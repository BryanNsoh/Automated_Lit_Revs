    Implementing innovative farming practices becomes imperative for a country whose
    economy relies heavily on agricultural products. Over recent years, the swift
    process of urbanization and the depletion of forests have influenced farmers.
    Due to the lack of rainwater harvesting and changing weather patterns, many crop
    failure cases have been registered in the last few years. To prevent loss of annual
    crop production, many researchers propose the technology-driven smart farming
    method. Smart agriculture involves utilizing technology to create a controlled
    environment for the management of the crops. Smart farming increases crop production
    and provides small farmers with an alternative income source. The government initiated
    many pilot projects to promote smart agriculture in India. Yet, the absence of
    technological assistance and skilled procedures poses a challenge for most farmers
    aiming to thrive in this industry. This paper introduces a smart freshwater recirculating
    aquaculture system based on IoT technology. The proposed system has integrated
    sensors and actuators. The sensor system monitors the water parameters, and actuators
    maintain the aquaculture environment. An intelligent data analytics algorithm
    played a significant role in monitoring and maintaining the freshwater aquaculture
    environment. The analytics derived the relationship between the water parameters

    I. Introduction In recent years, we have seen a significant transformation in
    regular farming. Many urban cities are utilizing their building spaces for intelligent
    farming. Smart farming is a technology-driven control for monitoring and maintaining
    the proper growth environment [1], [2]. However, smart farming is still tricky
    for many unskilled farmers [3]. In India, 70% population directly or indirectly
    depends on agriculture. Indian agriculture has a significant contribution to the
    Indian economy [3]. Over the past few years, the changing weather patterns and
    global warming have significantly impacted annual crop production [2]. A substantial
    number of farmers are affected by the loss of annual crop production. To cut short
    their loss and provide an alternative source of income, the Indian government
    initiated many pilot projects to promote integrated aquaculture-based farming.
    India has 2.36 million hectares of ponds and tanks, which offers immense opportunities
    for aquaculture. Aquaculture is the mean of livelihood for 28 million people in
    India. Unlike other aquaculture, freshwater pearl cultivation is the most profitable
    business in current scenarios. In 2020, India imported 1.59 trillion rupees worth
    of pearls, precious and semi-precious stones. To make India self-reliant on pearl
    production, the Indian government supports the farmers through subsidies and free
    training programs. Despite government efforts, the annual pearl production has
    not made significant progress. The lack of technological intervention and skill-oriented
    manual operation is the primary cause of poor production. In India, freshwater
    aquaculture-based farming is still operated manually. Aquaculture farming is very
    new to most farmers in India. This article presents a smart IoT-based freshwater
    recirculating aquaculture system. The proposed system smartly manages the optimal
    requirement for aquaculture. The system has three significant designs: 1) physical;
    2) network; and 3) logical. In physical configuration, we have edge devices integrated
    with sensors and actuators. The sensors monitor the water parameters, and actuators
    control the habitable aquaculture environment. The communication network between
    the physical devices manages data and control flow. The network design has an
    integrated network between the edge, fog, and gateway devices. The gateway operates
    the virtual private network (VPN) servers for secure communication in the public
    network. At the same time, the network between the edge node and fog node communicates
    using a socket. In logical design, we have an abstract representation of entities
    and processes. The logical design included a front-end data visualization and
    interactive control utility provided through the Danjgo Web framework. At the
    back-end, we have a relational database for managing the data. A data analytics
    algorithm utilizes the relational data for forecasting the change in the water
    parameters and control for the actuators. The whole operation for monitoring and
    management is scheduled through a real-time clock (RTC). The model selected for
    data analytics is a nonlinear decision tree-based model random forest (RF), M5
    Model tree, and gradient boosting machine (GBM). The proposed system has the following
    main contribution. An intelligent-IoT-driven monitoring and management of freshwater
    pearl farming. An inexpensive regent replacement-based sensor system designed
    for ammonia testing. A relational data analytics to forecast problem, sensor fault
    detection, and inexpensive monitoring and management. The remainder of this article
    is organized as follows. Section II presents the related work. Section III presents
    the baseline data. Section IV presents the components of the proposed IoT system
    for aquaculture management and presents the aquaculture management using data
    analytics. Section V presents the experiments and results. Finally, Section VI
    presents the conclusion. SECTION II. Related Work The rapid expansion of the IoT
    brought ubiquitous networked devices and sensors integration in a variety of intelligent
    applications [4], [5]. The generated data from these devices requires computational
    intelligence to extract the knowledge from the data [6]. We have identified a
    few research works centered around water quality monitoring in the literature
    review. Most research works focus on water quality monitoring rather than system
    affordability. It is worth noting that the adoption of technology-driven control
    farming remains costly for many farmers. Using relational data analytics techniques,
    researchers forecast the change in water parameters relative to some know parameters.
    This technique keeps the system in a stable state with minimal hardware requirements.
    Gao et al. [7] proposed an intelligent-IoT-based control and traceability system
    to forecast and maintain water quality for freshwater fish farming. The whole
    system is divided into two modules, i.e., an intelligent module and tracking module.
    The intelligent management module includes the integrated sensor assembly [pH,
    water, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and turbidity], data acquisition, data
    analysis, and database management. The tracking module includes the data visualization,
    chart, and data presentations. The intelligent module processes the fish pond
    monitoring data and forecasts the change in the water parameters. The alterations
    in water parameters empower farmers with the ability to oversee and manually regulate
    conditions using actuators. The system suggested by Gao et al. [7] manages water
    quality factors and offers farmers visual depictions to facilitate manual intervention.
    Zhu et al. [8] introduced a wireless network to oversee the water quality in fish
    cultivation. Their proposed method employs ANN to conduct a predictive analysis
    of water quality. The intelligent module of the system employs key variables like
    water temperature, pH, and salinity as benchmarks to predict the forthcoming patterns
    in dissolved oxygen levels. Zhu et al. [8] system tackles the measurement and
    control of water parameters. Simbeye et al. [9] developed a wireless sensor network
    (WSN)-based mechanism for monitoring aquaculture. The collected water quality
    information from the sensors is transmitted to a nearby server through a gateway.
    Afterwards, the data is displayed through a graphical user interface (GUI) via
    a local server. The primary focus of the study was on enhancing aquaculture management,
    optimizing power usage, and improving network efficiency. Simbeye et al. [9] devised
    the approach to oversee aquaculture within the confines of a personal area network.
    Dabrowski et al. [10] proposed a machine-learning approach to predict the DO using
    pH and water temperature. The data collected from the aquaculture prawn ponds
    was used for this study. Dabrowski et al. [10] analyzed the accuracy of DO prediction
    using long short-term memory (LSTM), linear regression (LR), ANN, and LDs. The
    experimental results show that the LSTM algorithm produces the optimum results
    with minimum normalized root mean-squared error (NRMSE). Dabrowski et al. [10]
    research show the accuracy of the machine learning approach for water quality
    forecast. Chen et al. [11] introduced a system equipped with water quality sensors.
    The sensor captures data from a fish pond and forwards it via zigbee to a microcontroller.
    The processed data is sent to a terminal device through a wirless interface. This
    terminal device empowers the user to monitor the agricultural. A graphical user
    interface (GUI) enables the data visualization. Chen et al. [11] provided a comprehensive
    description of a system that functions within a confined network. Mahfuz et al.
    [12] introduced an aquaculture monitoring system driven by a smart microcontroller.
    A user-friendly mobile application is employed to display the sensor-acquired
    data. The system is linked to a solar power setup to ensure continuous power supply.
    Any alteration in water parameters prompts notifications in the form of straightforward
    text messages. The suggested system required a manual intervention to manage the
    aquaculture. Vernandhes et al. [13] presented aquaponics monitoring system that
    utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The application interface provides
    an end user remote access to individual physical components of the system. The
    proposed system consists of sensors, actuator, relay, Ethernet, and router. The
    aquaphonic system integrated actuators and sensor maintain the control environment
    for better growth of the plant. The proposed system in future plan to extend for
    indoor farming of other crops The work in [14] used the multivariate LR and ANN
    to forecast the DO relative to pH, water temperature, and electrical conductivity
    (EC). Similar work extends in [10] and shows the comparative performance of ANN
    and LR with support vector machine (SVM). All the competing models have shown
    a significant accurate forecast of DO. However, these model accuracy of forecast
    relies on short interval high amount of historical data. Currently, we have identified
    various ANN models, such as LSTM and deep belief networks that are considered
    to be an appropriate to solve the forecast problem [15], [16]. Recently, certain
    studies have explored comprehensive water quality monitoring and management systems
    utilizing cultural knowledge models and forecasting models [17], [18], [19], [20],
    [21], [22], [24], [26]. Nevertheless, these systems did not specifically target
    the current requirement for developing a fully automated aquaculture setup. Moreover,
    their setups failed to attain the intended real-time data exchange and control,
    thereby affecting both water quality and aquaculture production. This paper introduces
    an Internet of Things (IoT) system that effectively manages freshwater aquaculture.
    The system is developed for freshwater pearls aquaculture, which considers the
    distinct water quality and management prerequisites. The proposed system can also
    dynamically accommodate the needs of other freshwater culture breeds. SECTION
    III. Baseline Data We have collected the baseline data from the Central Institute
    of Freshwater Aquaculture Bhubaneswar (CIFA Bhubaneswar) [32]. Table I illustrates
    the Optimal water conditions for pearl farming aquaculture. In an aquaculture,
    the primary focus should be monitoring the alkalinity and hardness of water parameters.
    The regional water bodies in different states have different alkalinity and hardness.
    Alkalinity is the indicator of resistance to acidification. Water bodies that
    have good alkalinity can prevent the sudden change in pH. Alkalinity indicates
    acid resistance, with higher alkalinity in water bodies helping prevent abrupt
    pH fluctuations. The connection between alkalinity and hardness is noteworthy,
    as total hardness is linked to calcium and divalent magnesium ions. The optimal
    water conditions for pearl farming recommends an alkalinity level of 100 PPM and
    a hardness level of 60 PPM. Research has shown that hard water proves more advantageous
    for productivity than soft water, although soft water is more conducive to the
    enhanced production of freshwater mussels. Alkalinity, a variable influenced by
    time, correlates with pH and temperature. Mornings typically see elevated pH levels
    along with moderate to high alkalinity. The intricate interplay between temperature
    and various biological and chemical reactions is evident, as warmer water hampers
    the solubility of atmospheric dissolved oxygen. Mussels inhabiting warmer waters
    necessitate a more excellent supply of dissolved oxygen. Likewise, DO is important
    in assessing water quality. Adequate oxygen levels are imperative for the well-being
    of pearl-farming mussels within the aquatic environment. However, in stagnant
    water, the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen is notably lower. To address this,
    we employ an oxygen pump and agitation to directly infuse atmospheric air into
    the water, augmenting the essential DO levels. photosynthetic activity in aquatic
    plants constitutes another source of dissolved oxygen. In the context of pearl
    farming, mussels feed on plankton. The presence of uneaten plankton further influences
    the habitable under water conditions. During daylight hours, these algae consume
    CO and release Oxygen. Consequently, DO levels experience an increase during the
    day, followed by a decrease at night and on heavily cloudy days. During nighttime
    hours and mainly overcast days, algae consume oxygen for respiration. Consequently,
    an abundance of algae growth leads to an elevation in the biological oxygen demand
    (BOD). The BOD is increased by mixing the ample nutrients in the pond. It also
    has a relation to time and temperature. During the night, the plankton algae consume
    the DO rapidly. The plankton density has a relation with DO and pH. However, the
    pH also has a relation to total alkalinity. The fluctuations in pH are less common
    in higher alkalinity. Similarly, carbon dioxide also has an ill impact on mussels.
    The higher concentration of carbon dioxide fluctuates the pH. However, the rate
    of change in pH is relatively less at higher total alkalinity. Carbon dioxide
    (CO2) concentration increases due to lack of photosynthesis and die-off of phytoplankton.
    There is a significant need to monitor the pond’s DO concentration to minimize
    the impact of carbon dioxide. Similarly, ammonia concentration is highly lethal
    for aquatic animals. Ammonia has a relation with DO, pH, and carbon dioxide. The
    ammonia increases, often decreasing the DO and increasing CO2. Ammonia toxicity
    is more pronounced at elevated pH levels. The primary sources of ammonia are the
    excretions of aquatic animals and the decomposition of organic matter. Maintaining
    control over ammonia levels is of utmost importance for optimal growth. Table
    II summarizes some of the recent available literature on the topic. Although some
    intelligent aquaculture systems have been proposed in the literature, more work
    needs to be done to integrate the factors that accurately determine the water
    quality, fault behavior analysis, optimal schedule for feeding, and fault-tolerant
    monitoring and management. Moreover, the existing systems cannot analyze and interpret
    real-time data rather monitor through some Web application. Still, much work needs
    to address for real-time control of the system parameters and intelligent data
    analytics integration at the edge devices or fog devices. As a result, the gap
    addressed in this article is relevant to the study. TABLE I Ideal Water Parameters

    SECTION IV. Component of Proposed IoT System for Aquaculture Management This section
    introduces the proposed smart IoT-based system for managing the aquaculture. The
    comprehensive system is organized into four distinct phases of development: physical
    design; network design; logical design; intelligent forecasting models. Fig. 1
    illustrates the conceptual layout of a smart aquaculture system based on IoT.
    Fig. 1. Conceptual design of intelligent-IoT-based aquaculture system. Show All
    A. Physical Design The physical layer is responsible for collecting the data from
    the sensors. System-integrated sensors gather the water quality parameters, and
    actuators manage the water quality parameters. The sensing nodes in the proposed
    system are integrated with analogue base DO, pH, Electric conductivity (EC), RTC
    timer, and temperature sensors, as shown in Fig. 2. These sensor assemblies are
    kept outside the aquaculture tanks, as shown in Fig. 3. To accurately measure
    the change from the sensor data, we have integrated the edge node with ADS1115
    16-bit precision analog-to-digital converter (ADC) [26]. Through the I2C interface,
    ADS1115 ADC communicates the sensor data to the edge node. The 1-wire DS18B20
    temperature sensor directly interfaces with the edge node. For edge computation
    and networking, we have selected the Beagle-bone Black. The Beagle-bone black
    has a variety of general-purpose input–output ports, which allows interaction
    with various communication interface protocols. The onboard 4-GB internal flash
    memory provides sufficient space to organize the data in the relational data model.
    The board has a 1-GHz ARM cortex processor, consuming less power and providing
    adequate processing capability. We have employed actuators such as aerator, submersible
    pumps, bio-filters, heaters, and valves to maintain a habitable aquaculture environment.
    The direct current (DC) operated actuators are connected through the L293 driver.
    The alternate current (AC) ran actuators are connected through relays. The proposed
    system has the following subsystem for aquaculture management: test setup; regent
    replacement-based ammonia sensor system; power management; automated smart feeder;
    RAS. Fig. 2. Edge node integrated sensors and actuators (adapted from [32]). Show
    All Fig. 3. Test equipment setup. Show All 1) Test Setup: In the proposed system
    design, we have an edge node equipped with temperature sensors (DS18B20), pH sensor
    (DFRobot Gravity, model SEN0161), and DO (DFRobot Gravity model no: DFR1628),
    ammonia sensor, and water EC sensor. Similarly, we equipped the edge node with
    actuators like water pumps, aerators, feeders, biofilters, water heaters, and
    solenoid valves. Except for the temperature sensor, all the sensors are kept outside
    the main harvesting tank, as shown in Fig. 3. This arrangement prevents the sensor
    monitoring tip from corrosion and extends their lifetime. The integrated actuator,
    comprising a submersible pump and valve, facilitates water transfer from the main
    tank to the test setup. After the water quality assessment, the valve attached
    to conical funnel releases the water. A non-contact water level sensor is employed
    to regulate the activation and deactivation of the valve and submersible pump
    to manage the water overflow in the conical funnel. After each water quality assessment,
    the distilled water is pumped to clean the sensor probe. The water quality assessment
    is scheduled through a RTC. Our experimental investigation determined that water
    quality within the culture pond does not change abruptly. Numerous factors, such
    as water temperature, weather conditions, feeding, and the discharge of by-products,
    influence water quality parameters. These parameters often exhibit inconsistency
    multiple times throughout the day. After analyzing a month’s recorded data, we
    have established an optimal schedule for managing the freshwater pearl aquaculture
    system. 2) Regent Replacement-Based Ammonia Sensor System: Ammonia is directly
    toxic to culture breeds in the unionized form, which is favored at high temperatures
    and pH. It also reduces the ability of culture breeds to utilize oxygen. Ammonia
    gets introduced into the water through excreted metabolic waste and the decomposition
    of organic matter. We have designed an inexpensive regent replacement-based ammonia
    sensor system to automate ammonia testing. The regent replacement-based ammonia
    sensor system automates manual regent-based ammonia testing. In the regent replacement-based
    ammonia sensor system, we have used the water level sensor, drop counter, and
    color sensor. Similarly, we have used the actuators like water pump, overhead
    steerer, check valve, and solenoid valve, as shown in Fig. 4. The scheduled set
    for water quality monitoring activates the ammonia sensor system. At the scheduled
    time, the edge not integrated DC submersible pump and solenoid valve start their
    operation to carry the water for quality test. The noncontact water level sensor
    immediately closes the solenoid valve and pumps when the required amount of water
    is in the conical funnel. Ammonia testing regent is available in the burette,
    which is controlled through a check valve. The overhead stepper motor pushes the
    check valve to make an air entry, resulting in ammonia regent drop released into
    the conical funnel. To manage the required amount of regent drop, we have a drop
    counter which signals to the stepper motor and closes the check valve. The drop
    counter is designed through an optical QRD 114 proximity sensor, invert Schmitt
    trigger (SN74HC14N), and OR gate (MN4072B IC). The regent in conical funnel mixes
    with overhead stirrer motor. The test result is recorded through an RGB color
    sensor and translated into the corresponding numeric PPM value. The test water
    in the conical funnel is released through the solenoid valve. After the test experiment,
    we pump the distilled water to clean the testing site for the next test. The filtered
    water is adequately mixed with the overhead stirrer motor and released from the
    solenoid valve. Fig. 4. Regent replacement-based ammonia sensor system. Show All
    3) Power System: In the power subsystem design, we have implemented using a 160-W,
    12-V mono-crystalline solar panel, a 24-V 30 Amp solar controller, 12-V lead-acid
    batteries, a 12-V relay, a 200-W AC inverter, and a 12-V DC-DC buck converter
    to ensure an uninterrupted power supply, as depicted in Fig. 5. The proposed strategy
    for overseeing and managing the aquaculture system is synchronized via an RTC
    lock. The absence of a proper schedule could impact the productivity of aquaculture.
    Water parameters exhibit inconsistency and undergo multiple fluctuations throughout
    each day. Consequently, maintaining a consistent and well-monitored schedule for
    the aquaculture system is paramount. Therefore, missing a schedule monitoring
    and management may impact aquaculture productivity. The proposed power subsystem
    operates the DC and AC devices. A DC–DC buck converter supplies the required power
    to the DC-operated overhead stirrer, solenoid valve, and stepper motor. Similarly,
    the AC inverter operates the 20-W submersible pump, 15-W air pump, and 50-W water
    heater. Fig. 5. Power subsystem. Show All 4) Automated Smart Feeder: A crucial
    aspect of the aquaculture system is the necessity for accurate monitoring of mussel
    feeding. Neglecting proper feed management can have multifaceted effects on the
    overall well-being of the mussels. Overfeeding, for instance, results in not only
    the loss of mussel life but also exacerbates the levels of food-based pollutants
    within the water [15] [31]. This overfeeding further amplifies the presence of
    excreted by-products in the water, subsequently elevating the concentrations of
    harmful ammonia and nitrate. Both ammonia and nitrate pose significant threats
    to the mussels’ health. At night, uneaten algae consume dissolved oxygen while
    introducing increased carbon dioxide (CO2) into the aquatic environment. Conversely,
    similar algae release the DO as a by-product of photosynthesis during daylight
    hours. For the equilibrium of the aquaculture ecosystem, it is imperative to uphold
    an appropriate feed. The repercussions of overfeeding and the prolonged presence
    of residual matter in the water can profoundly affect the quality of the water.
    Green algae are water-soluble and readily consumable by mussels and play a vital
    role in their diet. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the smart feeder system comprises
    a submersible pump and agitator. These agitators effectively blend the solution
    of green algae, which is then transported to the harvesting tank by the submersible
    pump. Fig. 6. Automated smart feeder. Show All The RAS is responsible for purifying
    the cultured water, subsequently re-utilizing it after appropriate treatment.
    This recirculating system effectively channels the water through bio-filters,
    which serve to eliminate by-products from aquatic organisms and decomposing residues
    present within the water. The absence of technological support hampers aquaculture
    farmers in their efforts to oversee and sustain water quality manually. In open
    pond aquaculture, the water is polluted with diverse waste materials. These waste
    components undergo decomposition, thereby exerting an influence on the overall
    quality of the water. This RAS configuration transfers water from the harvesting
    tanks to the bio-filter chamber via pumps, as shown in Fig. 7. Subsequently, the
    purified water is directed back into the main tank. This recirculating procedure
    is initiated after each feeding cycle. The innovative RAS design effectively addresses
    the primary issue of ammonia concentration and regulates pH levels. Fig. 7. RAS
    [32]. Show All B. Network Design The network design incorporates a communication
    framework connecting sensing, fog, and gateway nodes, as illustrated in Fig. 8.
    The socket communication API facilitates sensor data and controls communication
    between the edge and fog nodes. The gateway is the mediator of this communication
    between private and public networks. In the proposed network design, fog node
    placement is essential for data analysis and control. Fog nodes have local databases
    and analytics algorithms to process the data. The time scheduled monitoring and
    management are controlled by the fog node. However, the Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    EC2 infrastructure-as-a-service also runs an identical Web server. Data processing
    near the sensing node offers the benefit of maintaining the system optimally,
    ensuring adherence to scheduled monitoring and management tasks. The existing
    capacity of the public cloud needs to be improved to effectively address challenges
    such as latency and bandwidth constraints [31]. Relying solely on the cloud server
    for comprehensive analysis and control could yield undesirable outcomes. The potential
    for interruptions in connectivity between the sensing node and cloud servers raises
    the risk of timely scheduled operations being compromised at the sensing node.
    To mitigate these concerns, we have strategically positioned cloud analysis closer
    to the sensing node through fog nodes, thus averting disruptions to scheduled
    data analysis and control. However, the fog nodes primarily serve as data processing
    and storage intermediaries. The responsibility of managing scalable storage and
    processing of sensor data remains within the purview of the public cloud. The
    Rest API serves as the web server’s communication channel for data and control.
    Encoding of both data and control information is carried out using the base64
    format. Furthermore, a combination of MQTT and RestAPI protocols is utilized to
    facilitate the communication between the nodes. The local network between the
    nodes communicate to Amazon cloud EC2 instance via gateway router, as depicted
    in Fig. 9. We have employed the TP-link router for this gateway setup. This router
    features dual bands: IEEE 802.11ac/n/a at 5 GHz and IEEE 802.11n/b/g at 2.4 GHz,
    offering bandwidths of 450 Mbps and 1300 Mbps, respectively. We harnessed supplementary
    router capabilities such as the virtual private network (VPN) and Network Address
    Translation (NAT) features to enhance security and functionality. Notably, the
    VPN server integrated within the router furnishes a safe network environment for
    remote access from the public network. The secure tunnel also provides remote
    users to monitor and manage aquaculture operations. Fig. 8. Network configuration
    between the nodes [32]. Show All Fig. 9. Logical representation of the network
    configuration between the nodes. Show All C. Logical Design In a Data Processing
    layer, we have composed distinct functional components, each contributing to functions
    like data visualization, control, command, and processing. We have used the Python
    web framework for the front-end aspect. The graphical user interface (GUI) on
    the front end offers an array of functions, as illustrated in Fig. 10. The graphical
    user interface (GUI) was created using the technology stack of JQuery, Chart.js,
    CSS, and HTML5. The back-end is constructed using the MYSQL database. The web
    server is deployed at Amazon cloud EC2 instance and at fog node within the network.
    To streamline cloud-based data analytic, we have implemented visualization using
    docker containers. This approach simplifies the challenges inherent in application
    development. Container-based visualizations require the application and its associated
    binaries and libraries. The isolation of containers occurs at the kernel level,
    eliminating the need for a separate guest operating system and minimizing resource
    duplication. Each container runs isolated data analytic models, enabling seamless
    scaling or updating of micro-services without disrupting other application functionalities,
    as depicted in Fig. 11. It is a swift, low-cost, and elegant isolation framework.
    The isolated containers forecast the change in water parameters through different
    nonlinear decision tree-based models. The IoT dashboard has additional features
    like recalibration, fault detection, and status monitoring of sensors and actuators.
    The data analytics visualize the forecasted data along with actual data. This
    feature lets us know the difference between real sensor data and analytics-driven
    predicted data. In order to safeguard the identity of each device, a distinct
    and random API key has been employed. This key is specific to each device within
    the network. The API key is unique to every device in a network. The customer
    signs up and changes the API key. The remote login to the edge device is protected
    through a VPN server running the TP-link AC1750 wireless dual-band gigabit gateway
    router. Fig. 10. IoT dashboard [32]. Show All Fig. 11. Container-based visualizations.
    Show All D. Intelligent Forecasting Models We have adopted a data analytic approach
    to manage aquaculture operations. The predictive model analyses the change in
    water parameters and effectively operates the actuators. In this study, we analyze
    the feasibility of the tree-based model to forecast the water parameter in the
    presence of a low amount of data. We focus on two main scenarios: 1) estimating
    water parameters based on the relative change in other parameters and 2) predict
    alterations in water conditions using historical data. Besides, we also compare
    the performance of the tree-based model with existing multivariate LR and ANN.
    The prime focus of this study is to analyze the DO forecast relative to pH, water
    temperature, and TDS. The most common approaches for water quality prediction
    in aquaculture include the following: autoregressive moving average (ARMA); autoregressive
    integrated moving average (ARIMA); Markov model; support vector regression (SVR).
    These models are inappropriate for prediction in aquaculture water quality parameters
    as they only consider the linear relationship. The water quality parameters are
    inconsistent due to various environmental factors; hence linear prediction models
    are inefficient in correlating the relationships between multiple predictors and
    their respective variables. These models also take a long prediction time, making
    them unsuitable for predicting the nonlinear relationship [25], [27]. Deep learning
    models like LSTM may need to be more stable for predicting all real-time dynamics.
    The predictive processes can be linear to a single target quality parameter and
    its dynamics over time between multiple predictors and their respective variables.
    LSTM and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are flexible in capturing the nonlinear relationship
    in water quality parameters [28]. Due to its outstanding results in time-series
    prediction, LSTM is the most popular forecasting DL technique. For time-series
    prediction, LSTM and GRU models could be better at keeping long-term memory, especially
    for extended sequences. In time-series forecasting, historical observations influence
    the prediction value at the present step. In certain circumstances, the observation
    step that had a significant impact may have appeared long before the current step.
    Recent research has shown that the ability of LSTM models to extract information
    about long-term relationships from historical observations remains a crucial performance
    constraint. Theoretically, it has been demonstrated that ordinary LSTM lacks long
    memory from a statistical standpoint [29]. Compared to Naive Bayes, K Nearest
    Neighbors, and SVM, decision tree learning and neural networks result in better
    and more consistent performance. Known as KIG-ELM, the hybrid DO prediction model
    combines K -means, enhanced genetic algorithms (IGAs), and extreme learning machines
    (ELMs) and is based on edge computing architecture. This model distributes data
    acquisition, processing, and DO prediction among sensing nodes, routing nodes,
    and servers. For DO prediction, an ELM is implemented. Because of the unstable
    prediction performance constraint, it takes a lot of time to obtain high precision
    using the multiscale decomposition method. Multiparameter methods, which use several
    related parameters as input and the DO content as an output to forecast future
    DO, still have some significant issues, such as insufficiently processing DO data
    effectively and failing to recognize the characteristics of DO content changing.
    The DO time-series data is volatile. During sunrises and sunsets, forecast accuracy
    typically drops off quickly [30]. In our proposed method, we have compared the
    accuracy of models like ANN, GBM, RF, and M5 model trees. We have chosen the models
    mentioned above due to certain advantages of these models. Table III summarizes
    the befits and limitations of the selected models. TABLE III Comparison of Forecasting
    Models For designing a predictive model, we employ a model tree (M5) and benchmark
    its performance against a GBM, RF, and artificial neural network (ANN). Unlike
    linear models, tree-based models accommodate non-linear relationships, making
    them apt for monitoring real shifts in water parameters [27]. Random forest comprises
    multiple individual random decision trees functioning as an ensemble, with each
    tree acting as an independent predictor. The ensemble predictions, formed from
    low-correlation individual trees, surpass the accuracy of solitary predictions.
    Optimal RF predictions require careful feature vector selection instead of random
    sampling, aiming for low correlation within the distinct decision trees. Similarly,
    gradient boosting progressively enhances the performance of the CART algorithm.
    Initially assigning equal weights during decision tree training, subsequent modifications
    refine prediction quality. Weight adjustments focus on harder-to-classify instances,
    strengthening their influence, while easing-to-classify ones see reduced weight.
    Subsequent trees yield improved forecasts over their predecessors. The ultimate
    prediction rests upon an ensemble’s weighted sum of prior tree predictions. Furthermore,
    model tree-based predictive analysis forms a decision tree hierarchy using elementary
    models like linear regression, logistic regression etc. Initially, the given feature
    vector is fitted with a linear model. Later, the error is estimated between the
    actual target and predicted values. The least error features are chosen as the
    conditional branch of the decision tree. The subsequent split goes until the leaf
    node has an optimized linear model fitted on the partial feature vector. The trained
    model tree effectively forecasts the change in water quality parameters. The recursive
    optimization of the decision tree may lead to an overfitting problem. To deal
    with the overfitting problem, we have used the prepruning method to filter out
    the anomalies in the data set using the local outlier factor (LOF) [32]. Similarly,
    we have applied the post-pruning method to prevent the decision tree growth to
    its full depth. The post-pruning method simplifies the model tree and optimizes
    the prediction accuracy. Similarly, the ANN models are the conventional approach
    for time-series forecasting. However, unlike the tree-based model, ANN-based models
    need a larger data set for training and testing, and it is not easy to interpret
    the information from the trained model. We analyze the performance of the multilayer
    perception ANN model with a ReLu activation function. SECTION V. Experiments and
    Results A. Experimental Setup and Control System We have used the glass aquarium
    for freshwater pearl farming. The Lammelidens marginalis mussel species is used
    for pearl production, as shown in Fig. 12. Each mussel is implanted with two designed,
    crafted mussel shell nuclei. In the implantation process, each mussel passes through
    a surgical procedure. After successful implantation, each mussel is placed within
    tanks dedicated to post-operative care, where antibiotics and an oxygen pump are
    administered. Some mussels might reject the implanted foreign particles and die,
    while others accept them. Those mussels that accept the foreign particles are
    transferred from the post-operative care tanks to the primary harvesting tank.
    Maintaining a controlled environment is imperative to ensure optimal pearl production.
    The proposed system has sensors and actuators that manage the habitable underwater
    environment [31]. Fig. 12. Aquaculture main harvesting tank [32]. Show All In
    the initial stages of data processing, we investigated how temperature influences
    biological and chemical reactions. The fluctuation in temperature notably impacts
    water parameters over an entire day. Hence, we’ve established five distinct time
    intervals for data acquisition. The first acquisition, scheduled at 6:00 AM, coincides
    with the lowest temperature and DO levels, alongside the highest pH and moderate
    alkalinity. The second interval, at 10:00 AM, aligns with the initiation of the
    smart feeder system and aeration. At 3:00 PM, the third acquisition takes place,
    coinciding with peak temperature, pH, and DO levels. The fourth instance, at 10:00
    PM, corresponds to the commencement of the recirculating aquaculture system. This
    system involves water passing through a bio-filter to eliminate residual plankton
    feed, as nocturnal plankton consumption affects dissolved oxygen. Analytical algorithms
    oversee DO changes and aeration operation. The fifth interval, at 1:00 PM, analyzes
    aeration requirements through data analysis. RTC control manages system operations.
    We validate the control system by simulating changes in water parameters to observe
    system behavior [31]. The smart data analytics algorithm schedule the requirement
    for aquaculture management based on the change in the water parameters. The intelligent
    data analytics algorithm schedules the requirement for aquaculture management
    based on the change in the water parameters. B. Data Preprocessing The sensing
    node simplifies raw sensor data for processing. In some initial data, sensor data
    may be missing, potentially leading to erroneous predictive analysis. To address
    this, data imputation is executed at the fog node due to sensing node constraints.
    The sensing node aggregates sensor data using base64 encoding, forwarding it to
    the fog node. Upon receipt, the fog node decodes and validates the data before
    predictive analysis. For missing sensor values, the fog node employs data processing
    to determine correlations between historical and current data. Scheduled RTC data
    acquisition simplifies correlating current and similar-timestamp historical data.
    Utilizing the KD tree, the missing sensor feed is imputed by analyzing non-missing
    neighbouring sensor data. The Kd tree searches the nearest neighbor of similar
    timestamps from the historical n proximity sensors and imputes the missing sensor
    feed by reading the nearest neighbors’ sensor feeds. Subsequently, the sensor
    data undergoes pre-processing to identify anomalies. Anomalies within the dataset
    are eliminated by applying the LOF, made by Singh et al. [32]. This technique
    identifies aberrant data points by assessing their local deviation compared to
    neighbouring points. The resulting LoF score is then utilized to ascertain the
    presence of outliers in the data ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ LOF(k)∼1 data point in a same cluster LOF(k)<1
    data point is Inlier LOF(k)>1 data point is outlinear. View Source In the equation
    above, the variable “k” denotes the locality concerning its k th neighbours. To
    assess the efficiency of LOF, we introduced an additional outlier data point into
    the dataset. The experimental findings indicate that LOF proficiently identifies
    outliers within the dataset, as Figs.13 and 14 illustrate. Fig. 13. Outlier detection
    between DO and pH [32]. Show All Fig. 14. Outlier detection between DO and temperature
    [32]. Show All C. Aquaculture Control System The actuators respond to control
    signals generated by the data analytic algorithm. This algorithm utilizes past
    data to predict shifts in DO levels, taking into account correlated water parameters
    like temperature and pH. Relying solely on sensor data for system operation can
    lead to imprecise monitoring. Prolonged usage of sensors often introduces inaccuracies
    in measurements. Despite any discrepancies in sensor measurements, we counteract
    deviations from the desired state by considering the historical data recorded
    at similar time instances. We have considered the water temperature, EC, and relative
    pH parameters for predicting DO levels. Likewise, we have considered the interdependent
    parameters of DO, electrical conductivity (EC), and water temperature for predicting
    pH values. To evaluate the precision of the DO sensor data, we compare the pH
    and water temperature data with historical records from similar time intervals.
    We have integrated a K-D tree to improve the search procedure, as depicted in
    Fig. 15. Fig. 15. Aquaculture control system. Show All The predicted DO values,
    and those extracted from historical records might display either close resemblances
    or notable disparities. Should the relative variation remain below 0.5 parts per
    million (PPM) between the predicted and retrieved DO values, the system functions
    smoothly without sensor malfunctions, adhering to a schedule derived from the
    analytic process. Conversely, suppose the relative divergence surpasses 0.5 PPM.
    In that case, it triggers a re-calibration of the sensors, resulting in an adjusted
    schedule based on other correlated parameters such as EC and water temperature.
    A combination of multiple temperature probes and EC sensors is employed to ensure
    precise prediction as they are robust and cost-effective relative indicators for
    forecasting DO and pH levels. Likewise, the relationship between pH and DO is
    influenced by various factors. pH fluctuations are attributed to changes in water
    ion composition, which can be readily deduced through the EC sensor. In cases
    where the pH sensor produces inaccurate readings, the EC sensor is employed to
    stabilize both DO and pH variations. An absolute difference exceeding 1 part per
    million (PPM) prompts a system alert, indicating a potential sensor malfunction,
    prompting a transition to alternative parameters (EC and water temperature). Enhanced
    precision in prediction is achieved through the combined utilization of correlated
    relative parameters. Our initial investigation encompasses pH, DO, EC, and water
    temperature as interconnected parameters for comprehensive water quality analysis.
    Integrating multiple relevant sensor inputs contributes to the refined forecast.
    The incorporation of the actuator system is designed in response to variations
    in the target water parameters, as outlined in Table I. The gathered data orchestrate
    diverse actuator actions through the Real-Time Clock (RTC). Overnight accumulation
    of by-products and leftover feed leads to alterations in pH and DO levels within
    the water, which are normalized through the operation of the Recirculating Aquaculture
    System (RAS) and the aerator system, scheduled at 6 A.M. Later at 10 A.M., smart
    feeder system pumps the plankton algae mixture into the harvesting tank and operates
    the aerator to supplement desired to DO requirement. The third sensor measurement
    time was set to 3 P.M. when mussels excreted by-product, and temperature variation
    may fluctuate the DO and pH. To balance the DO and pH, the proposed system, based
    on the requirement, may operate the RAS system and aerator. At 10 P.M., scheduled
    actuator operation, we balance the DO and pH through RAS and aerator. Similarly,
    at the 1 P.M. overnight schedule, the proposed system analyzes the DO requirement
    and accordingly operates the aerator. We adjust the water parameters to validate
    the functionality of the control system. The intelligent data analytics algorithm
    schedules the aquaculture management requirement based on the water parameters.
    D. Performance Evaluation for Predictive Analysis The cleaned data serves as input
    for predictive analysis. Initially, we computed bilateral Pearson correlations
    among the water parameters. Subsequently, we aggregated the highly correlated
    data elements for predictive analysis. The outcomes of the bilateral Pearson correlations
    are presented in Table IV. The examination unveils a significant correlation between
    DO and temperature, demonstrated by correlation coefficients of 0.52. Similarly,
    pH exhibits correlations with DO and temperature, indicated by correlation coefficients
    of 0.73 and 0.82, respectively. Given the pivotal role of DO and pH as aquaculture
    indicators, they have been incorporated into the training dataset. Furthermore,
    water temperature exerts notable influence over chemical and biological reactions.
    The inclusion of water temperature in our feature vector has been undertaken.
    Considering the interrelation between DO, pH, and water temperature, we have designed
    the model training process where pH and temperature serve as independent variables,
    and DO functions as the dependent variable. We contrast tree-based models with
    the ANN model to evaluate performance. We used the multilayer perceptron with
    ReLu as the activation function for the ANN model. Due to limited test measurement
    from the aquaculture site, we have kept 1000 validation runs using a training
    set of 160 samples and a test set of 40 samples to obtain the convergence of mean
    and standard deviation on the performance indicators. In M5 model tree construction,
    we have used the parameters such as linear model, maximum depth of decision tree
    = 4, the minimum number of samples at leaf = 10, and greedy search strategy. The
    model tree training generates the ten rules, as shown in Fig. 16. For DO prediction,
    the M5 model tree shows a strong correlation R=0.877 between the actual and predicted
    data. The model estimated mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.963. Table V shows the
    comparative performance of the M5 model tree for DO prediction with other nonlinear
    decision tree-based predictors. The training process encompasses 80% of the sample
    data (160 instances), while the remaining 20% (40 instances) is designated for
    testing the model’s performance. The non-linear RF, GBM, and M5 model tree are
    assessed with a maximum tree depth set at 4 and a sample size 40. All the nonlinear
    tree-based model RF, GBM, and M5 model trees showed better performance compared
    to ANN. The slightly lower performance of ANN is due to the smaller size of the
    training data set with multiple input parameter. TABLE IV Pearson Correlation
    Analysis Results [32] TABLE V Result of DO Predicted From Nonlinear Forecasting
    Models Fig. 16. Generated model tree with maximum depth = 4. Show All The comparative
    performance analysis obtained the lowest MAE of 0.963 from the M5 model tree.
    The model performance is validated using the new data set from the sensors. Similarly,
    we have evaluated the model performance for pH prediction using a training sample
    containing DO, pH, and temperature water parameters. Table VI shows the comparative
    performance of the model tree for pH prediction with other nonlinear decision
    tree-based predictors. TABLE VI Result of PH Predicted From Nonlinear Forecasting
    Models Figs. 17 and 18 display the correlation outcomes of the M5 model tree for
    pH and DO, comparing actual and predicted values. The correlation between predicted
    and actual DO values stands at 0.8775, accompanied by a satisfactory MAE of 0.963.
    Similarly, the pH prediction yields a high correlation of 0.974, alongside a minimal
    MAE of 0.01239. The experimental evaluation shows that the M5 model tree algorithm
    can predict the changing water parameters better than other RF, ANN, and GBM nonlinear
    predictors. In the comparative study, we found M5 model tree is slightly better
    than other nonlinear RF, GBM, and ANN models. Despite less training data, we obtain
    a better result with the M5 model tree due to its inherent features of grouping
    the high correlations data for constructing the M5-model tree. Fig. 17. Correlation
    between actual versus predicted DO values. Show All Fig. 18. Correlation between
    actual versus predicted pH values. Show All The employed M5 model tree performs
    the group analyses of relative water parameters. We adopt the pruning methods
    for the model to generalize well to unseen data. The pruning method optimizes
    the tree structure without affecting the classification accuracy. The REP algorithm
    pruned the growing tree and used the information gained as the branching criteria.
    Redundant subtrees were pruned to solve the overfitting problem and maximize the
    forecasting accuracy. SECTION VI. Conclusion This article introduces a holistic
    Internet of Things (IoT) system designed to oversee and uphold aquaculture operations.
    The proposed system design has a physical, network, and logical design. The physical
    design provided the hardware configuration details. In contrast, the network design
    shows the communication network between the physical devices. In this design,
    we have addressed the requirement of a fog node for intelligent data analytics
    and control. In the logical design, we have discussed the front-end and back-end
    implementation details. It also highlighted the importance of container-based
    virtualization and the various design features. This article also discusses the
    importance of the core intelligent analytics algorithm for monitoring and managing
    aquaculture. The closed-loop control system ran through intelligent nonlinear
    decision tree-based models. This article shows the comparative performance of
    the M5 model tree, RF, ANN, and GBM. The experimental evaluation found that the
    M5 model tree has the highest prediction accuracy for DO prediction with a correlation
    of 0.877 with an MAE of 0.963. Similarly, the M5 model tree outperforms PH prediction
    with a correlation of 0.975 and an MAE of 0.0123. Future research in this direction
    includes more robust relative water sensors to make the system more affordable
    and accurate. In future research, we also include analyzing and developing a more
    accurate forecasting model. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like

    WDS; classifications 1. Introduction Internet of Things (IoT) connects various
    industrial actuators, devices, and people at work. IoT provide additional insight
    into industrial applications, as well as minimize human labour and time and create
    a path for Industry 4.0. [1,2]. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are
    used in the IoT to process and analyse data from various sources and perform advanced
    predictive analytics such as predictive maintenance, fault class prediction, and
    demand forecasting [3]. It is challenging to create an accurate mathematical model
    for intelligent IoT applications since they are an enormous connected and complex
    process that produces a large volume of multi-feature data [4]. However, AI algorithms
    can extract critical information without needing a thorough knowledge of the underlying
    physical structure of the system. As a result, AI algorithms are well-suited to
    IoT in terms of self-adaptation, and self-learning [5]. AI technologies play a
    crucial role in IoT because of the highly dynamic system state and data structure
    and the time-varying monitoring parameters [6]. In the IoT, for example, predictive
    maintenance uses machine learning to detect abnormalities in systems and then
    anticipate device failure by correlating and evaluating the change in the pattern
    [7]. IoT devices, such as sensors, are of limited computation resources, hence,
    they have been mainly used for data collection which includes monitoring and transmitting
    data to robust systems such as cloud-based or centralised, for storage and processing
    [8]. Thus, a common IoT data analysis processing occurs at the cloud then communicating
    the findings to IoT devices for informed decision. Typically, data from sensor
    data are transported tens of thousands of kilometres to a data centre where they
    are stored and analysed. This approach increases data transfer latencies as well
    as network traffic as IoT devices have limited computation capabilities, the computation
    of data analytics cannot be conducted entirely on the devices [9]. As a result,
    bringing intelligence to the edge is without doubt a potential development trend.
    Integrating edge and cloud computing offers the promise to minimise IoT network
    traffic and related delay while enabling complex data analytics operations to
    be performed [10,11,12]. The widespread use of Internet of Things and robust cloud
    services has contributed to the demand for edge computing, in which data processing
    takes place in part at the network edge rather than entirely in the cloud [13].
    Edge computing helps to solve issues such as bandwidth costs, latency, power consumption
    of mobile devices, security and privacy. Edge computing uses small data centres
    on the network’s edge to deliver distributed computing services and it acts as
    a middle interface between a cloud server and IoT devices/sensors [14,15]. In
    edge computing, the cloud takes data from the collected databases, as it has historically
    done, as well as from sensing devices and smartphones. The devices serve as both
    data consumers and data generators. As a result, queries between end devices and
    the cloud can be bidirectional, rather than merely from end devices to the cloud.
    To minimise traffic from devices to the cloud, nodes at the network edge perform
    a variety of computational functions, including data processing, device management,
    caching, and privacy protection (see Figure 1). Edge computing, in contrast to
    mobile cloud computing, allows for real-time data analytics while maintaining
    privacy, expands network capabilities, and avoids congestion in backbone networks
    and the internet core [16,17]. Figure 1. Data analytics using edge computing.
    This paper investigates the use of edge computing for data analytics by integrating
    the edge with cloud computing to deliver deep learning applications. Four different
    scenarios have been used to identify the optimal framework for edge-cloud computing
    framework to monitor water quality. The organisation of this paper is as follows:
    Section 2 describes the benefit of applying edge intelligence in IoT, and Section
    3 reviews the most relevant research on using edge-cloud computing for providing
    real-time applications. Section 4 describes the proposed framework and how it
    is investigated in more detail, and Section 5 presents the numerical results and
    discussion of these results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the work and shows the
    future work. 2. Edge Intelligent with IoT This section introduces the architecture
    of edge intelligence in IoT and presents deep learning at the edge for different
    IoT applications. 2.1. Cloud-Edge Intelligent Architecture Cloud is a centralised
    infrastructure system that stores data, executes business models, and performs
    data analytics activities at a long distance away from data sources and end-users
    [18]. However, with large-scale traffic and a proliferation of connected devices,
    it is neither feasible nor feasible to transmit all data to the cloud for processing.
    Edge computing has arisen as a means of addressing these issues by shifting processing
    to the network’s and data sources’ edges [19,20]. Edge computing and fog computing
    share similar characteristics. Sometimes, the terms “fog” and “edge” are commonly
    used to describe the same thing [21]; but the difference is that edge computing
    is primarily focused on nodes that are closer to IoT devices, while fog computing
    may encompass any resource that is situated anywhere between the end device and
    cloud [22]. In this work, we use the word “edge” to refer to compute nodes that
    are near the water network edge, such as edge servers [23]. Even though edge computing
    reduces traffic, the computer resources accessible on the edge do not have the
    same capabilities as those available in the cloud. As a result, computationally
    intensive processes like machine learning are not well suited to edge devices.
    However, the edge can enhance cloud computing by performing a portion of the computation,
    lowering network traffic and latency [24]. As illustrated in Figure 2, the edge-cloud
    learning framework is made up of three primary components: end-user devices, edge
    learning servers, and remote cloud deep learning clusters [25]. End-user devices,
    such as mobile phones, cameras, and internet-of-things sensors, send data to the
    edge server, which can be noisy and highly redundant [26]. Edge computing servers
    collect enormous amounts of raw data from end-users and utilize pre-processing
    and basic learning algorithms to filter out the noise and extract significant
    features from the raw data. Deep learning tasks, such as convolutional neural
    networks (CNN) and artificial neural networks (ANN), are carried out by the deep
    learning cluster (cloud), which is outfitted with scalable and robust GPU resources
    [27]. Figure 2. Standard edge-cloud architecture. 2.2. Deep Learning in Edge Computing
    Typically, IoT devices generate significant amounts of data and send it to the
    cloud for processing. These data include multimedia information like photos, sounds,
    videos, and structured data like vibration, temperature, and humidity. There are
    numerous developed solutions for analysing structured data and then operating
    IoT devices autonomously [28]. Deep learning has been successful in many fields,
    including multiple visual tasks, speech recognition, natural language processing
    and industrial applications [29], this is because of its capacity to learn complicated
    models, and diversity of architectures [30]. A deep learning network is often
    composed of numerous layers. These layers will process the input data. Each layer
    processes the previous layer’s intermediate features and then generates new features.
    Finally, the extracted features generated by the final deep learning network layer
    will be recognised as the output by a classifier. Deep learning networks consider
    the layers closest to the input data to be lower levels, while the others are
    higher layers [28,31]. In this work, we have used an MLP model to detect and classify
    water contaminant levels for data that include water quality parameters. The developed
    model contains several layers that are completely connected. The model was trained
    using time series data for more than 50,000 samples. The MLP model was used to
    classify the data into five different classes representing the various levels
    of water contamination. Deep learning increases prediction accuracy for IoT services
    by extracting features through numerous layers rather than traditional complex
    pre-processing. However, with increased accuracy, communication performance will
    be the bottleneck. The amount of data needed to train deep-learning models is
    huge. Such a large volume of network traffic can cause various changes to the
    network in terms of increasing transmission delay, reducing the packet delivery
    ratio, increasing energy consumption due to high transmission rate, and may pose
    security risks; therefore, typical cloud-based solutions for deep learning approaches
    on IoT may not be ideal [32]. As illustrated in Figure 3, we present an edge computing
    topology for IoT deep learning applications. The structure is composed of two
    layers and also a normal edge computing structure. Edge servers are placed at
    the edge to process gathered data and the cloud server is used to train the deep
    learning network [33]. Applying deep learning entirely at the edge will reduce
    network traffic. However, the capacity of edge servers is limited compared to
    cloud servers. It is impossible to process infinite tasks in edge servers. Dedicating
    the entire work of deep learning to the edge will bring additional computing overhead
    to the servers. Therefore, we can only deploy part of the deep learning network
    into edge servers. The issue is deciding how to partition each deep learning network.
    Figure 3. Deep learning in edge computing. 3. Related Work Edge computing became
    more popular, particularly for applications with rapid response times and restricted
    bandwidth, since it places computing near data sources. Edge computing can be
    applied in different applications including smart cities, smart vehicles, smart
    traffic lights, and smart grids. These applications quickly integrate edge computing
    into their platforms, greatly increasing response time and saving network resources.
    3.1. State-of-Art of Edge-Cloud Computing Authors in [11] validated edge computing’s
    efficiency and resourcefulness. Edge systems are carefully surveyed, and a comparative
    cloud computing system research is presented. The results demonstrate that edge
    computing systems perform better than cloud computing systems after studying various
    network aspects of the system. In comparison to cloud computing standards, the
    current edge computing and fog computing standards provide stable and enhanced
    quality of service for IoT applications. Cao et al. in [34] examined a joint communication
    and computation user collaboration for mobile edge computing to enhance the power
    consumption for mobile edge computing (MEC). Consider a basic three-node MEC framework
    consisting of a helper node, an access point node, and a user node connected to
    an MEC server for demonstration purposes. A nearby helper node is enabled to contribute
    its computation and communication resources to increase the user’s computing performance.
    Numerical findings show the value of the collaboration in computing and communication
    offered by the users. Another study by Wang et al. [35] performed a full review
    of edge computer state-of-art research initiatives. This model integrates computing,
    caching, and communication resources. The edge computing is initially outlined,
    including description, design, and benefits. A complete examination of computing,
    caching and communication concerns is then provided at the network’s edge. The
    proposed framework architecture is composed of mobile edge, fog computing, and
    cloud. Mao et al. [36] provided a summary of significant advances in research
    for edge computing. Modelling methodologies for key edge computing (EC) components,
    such as computing tasks, communications, mobile computing, and the EC servers,
    were initially summarised. Models of essential elements of EC systems such as
    computation tasks, communications, and the computation of mobile devices and MEC
    servers were initially summarised. This facilitates characterising the latency
    and energy performance of EC systems. A research perspective is also presented,
    which contains a set of prospective MEC research guidelines. Finally, they discussed
    current industry standardisation initiatives, as well as numerous common application
    scenarios. The surveys addressed [11,34,36] highlight the potential of edge computing
    in data analytics and the relevance of edge computing in IoT for dealing with
    the number of linked devices that is rapidly increasing. As our work contributes
    to the use of edge computing for data analytics by merging edge and cloud computing
    for the delivery of deep learning applications, different applications for both
    IoT and edge cloud computing are reviewed below. 3.2. IoT Applications Based on
    Edge-Cloud Framework One of the most often mentioned use cases and applications
    of edge computing is smart cities. Mohamed et al. [37] described how the service-oriented
    middleware (SOM) approach might benefit from resolving the issues associated with
    designing and managing smart city services utilising cloud and fog computing.
    They proposed SmartCityWare as a SOM for the complete coordination and usage of
    fog and cloud computing. The proposed framework isolates components and services
    used in smart city applications and makes them available as services via the service-oriented
    approach. This improves integration and enables the flexible incorporation and
    use of the many services required in a smart city application. Another study by
    Tang et al. [38] provided a multi-tier fog computing system for extensive data
    analytics in smart cities. Because of the inherent geo-distribution of massive
    data collected by enormous sensors, they disseminate smart at the edge of a tiered
    fog computing system. To maintain the safety of essential infrastructure components,
    computing nodes at each tier conduct latency-sensitive applications and offer
    rapid controller loops. Using smart pipeline monitoring as an example, a four-layer
    fog-based computing paradigm is presented to showcase the usefulness and feasibility
    of the system’s potential city-wide implementation. Wang et al. [39] created a
    three-layer conceptual framework, dividing the city into zones for dispersed management.
    The fog and cloud layers offer potential computing abilities and resources for
    message processing without adding network expenses. According to queueing theory,
    model stationary and moving vehicle-based fog nodes predict the average reply
    time depending on their processing abilities. They conclude that moving fog nodes
    of vehicle-based may be seen as servers with queue theory M/M/1. To show the efficiency
    of the proposed framework, a performance assessment based on a real-world taxi
    path dataset is presented. In terms of average system response time and processing
    resources required, the proposed framework outperforms the competition. He et
    al. [40] proposed multi-tier fog for smart city applications with a large-scale
    data analysis service. The multi-layer fog is made up of devoted fogs and ad-hoc
    fogs, each having adaptable and dedicated computing resources. The developed novel
    fog computing framework, which includes distinct functional modules, can reduce
    the potential issues of a specialised computing platform and delayed reply in
    cloud computing. The results of experiments show that the analytical services
    are efficient across multitier fogs, and the proposed QoS systems are effective.
    In terms of job blocking likelihood and service utilities, fogs may significantly
    increase smart city analytical services than cloud models. Other applications
    have used the edge-cloud framework for data analysis, Darwish and Bakar [41] proposed
    a new real-time intelligent transportation system (ITS) significant data analysis
    framework on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment. The architecture presented
    fuses three dimensions: intelligent computing real-time extensive data analysis,
    intelligent computing, and IoV dimension, i.e., fog and cloud computing. This
    study also provides an exhaustive overview of the IoV setup lambda real-time large
    data analysis architecture, ITS big data characteristics, and various smart computing
    technologies. Sittón-Candanedo et al. [42] proposed an energy-efficient system
    using an edge-IoT framework and a social computing architecture inside a public
    building scenario. The system is assessed in a public building, and the findings
    show the remarkable advantages that edge computing brings to energy-saving circumstances
    and the framework. These advantages encompassed lowering the IoT-Edge data transmission
    into the cloud and lowering cloud, computer and networking expenses. The result
    of this work shows that systems with less computing capacity, consumption and
    hardware expenses may be deployed in a much more cost-effective manner by dividing
    computation loads from the cloud into the edge. Thakur et al. [43] presented a
    water conservation edge computing framework by employing easy computing methods.
    The proposed work helps decision-makers raise people’s awareness of water efficiency
    in a scientifically easy method. Based on numerous parameters such as the number
    of people, average family income, the profession of the members, and previous
    water needs, the proposed model leverages edge computing at the home nodes of
    the network to estimate the actual consumption of a specific home in real-time.
    Results reveal that the proposed approach operates better in a self-synthesised
    dataset than in other similar networks. The approach framework converges effectively
    and provides greater precision in spatial and temporal terms. There are also other
    applications on health care and video streaming. Rahmani et al. [44] provided
    a fog-based computing-based framework that presents an implementation of an Internet
    of Things health monitoring system as a proof of concept. The proposed framework
    improves, for example, energy economy, performance, reliability, interoperability,
    and other diverse properties of IoT architecture utilised in health applications.
    A fog computing-based health IoT system and its services are described in more
    detail in the proposed framework, which is conducted from a variety of viewpoints.
    A medical case study named early alert cases to monitor patients suffering from
    acute diseases was applied to the fog-assisted system. All data flow operations
    from the data collection at sensor nodes to the cloud and end-users are part of
    our whole system demonstration. Sheltami et al. [15] proposed a framework for
    mobile users to employ fog computing as a content delivery system. The fog nodes
    are distributed close to mobile users. The users request the fog servers and answer
    each request, whether they are downloaded from the fog server or from the cloud
    if the request is just initialised. The findings show that fog computing gives
    minimal response time compared to the cloud. The studies also examine mobile users’
    power consumption in different modes. 3.3. Edge Computing for AI All the studies
    reviewed previously in this section used edge-cloud computing but for the non-machine
    learning task. The edge processing needs to accommodate the final machine learning
    computation for machine learning activities while decreasing the required network
    bandwidth and traffic [45]. Our work focused on using edge-cloud computing for
    machine and deep learning applications. Hence, it is essential to review a few
    works in this category. Khelifi et al. [46] addressed the mapping of deep learning
    and information-centric networks (ICN) with IoT at edge computing and their potential
    benefits. They also introduced an effective component that enhances IoT by making
    the edge more intelligent. As a result, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model
    can be employed in the IoT area to use data from a complicated environment reliably.
    Furthermore, reinforcement learning (RL) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have
    recently been integrated into IoT, which can be utilised to account for data multimodality
    in real-time applications. Ran et al. [47] proposed a distributed framework, DeepDecision,
    that links computationally weak devices (assuming that they’re smartphones) to
    more robust back-end devices that let deep learning in choosing local or remote
    execution. Any device that delivers the required computing power can be worked
    as the back-end helper. They are especially interested in running a CNN developed
    for recognising objects in real-time for augmented reality applications. Another
    work by Zhao et al. [48] presented a unique distributed deep learning framework
    (DDL). The DDL enables mobile edge nodes in the network to cooperate and interchange
    information in order to decrease the error of content demand estimation without
    compromising mobile users’ private information. They demonstrated through simulation
    findings that their proposed approach can improve accuracy by lowering the root
    mean squared error (RMSE) by up to 33.7 percent and minimising service latency
    by 47.4 percent compared to other machine learning techniques. All the papers
    reviewed in this section show that cloud computing is the computing platform that
    is currently being used to analyze and monitor the quality of water. Therefore,
    we decided to take advantage of distributed computing and apply edge computing
    to monitor water quality and make real-time decisions. 4. System Model: Proposed
    Framework In this work, we take a water distribution system as a case study to
    introduce our proposed intelligent edge-cloud framework to monitor drinking water
    quality. Figure 4 depicts the proposed distributed edge-cloud framework consisting
    of IoT devices and edge nodes equipped with edge server functionality and remote
    cloud. Compared to cloud servers, edge servers typically have more resources than
    IoT devices and are physically closer to them. In the IoT layer, water quality
    sensors are deployed in the WDS. This layer takes seven water quality indicators
    that are utilised to monitor the quality of the drinking water by using AI models,
    these features are chlorine (Cl), turbidity (TUR), PH, total organic carbon (TOC),
    temperature (TEMP), conductivity (COND), and pressure (PRES). To communicate edge
    servers and IoT devices, we used a communication technology suited for a short
    distance and lightweight IoT protocol (ZigBee). Using the same medium and protocol
    from both IoT devices and edge servers benefit in the following: Figure 4. Proposed
    intelligent edge-cloud framework. Reduced design complexity due to the use of
    only one network stack and eliminating the requirement to convert packets from
    one format to another. Packet conversion is not required, which decreases energy
    consumption and latency. However, the training phase of some machine learning
    algorithms, such as MLPs, puts a lot of pressure on edge servers’ computational
    capabilities and the backbone network’s communication resources, as training data
    must be obtained from sensors. Thus, the intelligent computational architecture
    must be altered. In this regard, we proposed an IoT intelligent computing architecture
    that consists of a two-tier smart data center, namely the edge layer and cloud
    layer. Edge and cloud computing work together to provide water quality sensors
    with near real-time computing through the edge layer and comprehensive and powerful
    computing through the cloud layer. Edge layer: It supports lightweight IoT intelligent
    computing services, while edge server computing services can be distinguished
    by computing application and service accuracy. This layer mainly works for the
    purpose of detecting water contaminants using deep learning models. The MLP model
    is trained and used for detection at the edge layer, as presented in scenario
    1 explained below. The ensemble model is trained in the cloud and then used for
    detection at the edge layer, as illustrated in scenario 3. While edge servers
    act as a data forwarder to cloud computing, as explained in scenario 4. Cloud
    layer: It offers IoT users a strong and comprehensive computing solution at the
    cost of latency and connection overhead. It was used as long-term storage for
    data, as explained by Scenario 1. It has been used to train detection models using
    deep learning, as in scenarios 2 and 3. It was used to carry out all the tasks
    assigned to it to monitor water quality using deep learning models as in scenario
    4. To investigate the functionality of the proposed framework, four different
    scenarios will apply, whereby the functionality provided by both the edge and
    the cloud computing layers will be changed. 4.1. Scenario 1 (Fully Distributed)
    In this scenario, training the MLP model and the detection apply at the edge layer.
    The framework initialises to work using an offline MLP model that is already pre-trained
    using historical data. The model keeps updated and trained at the edge using the
    real-time data that come from the sensors. The edge servers here conduct all functions
    train the model and use the model for detection, as shown in Figure 5. Figure
    5. Architecture for scenario 1. 4.2. Scenario 2 (Train Mlp Model at Cloud and
    Detect at Edge) The MLP model is trained in the cloud and sent down to the edge
    layer for detection. In this scenario, the edge servers have two functions: Continuously
    forward data to the cloud to continue the training. Use the trained MLP model
    downloaded from the cloud for detection as shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. Architecture
    for scenario 2. 4.3. Scenario 3 (Train Ensemble Model at Cloud, and Detect at
    the Edge) In this scenario, the third scenario aims to enhance the MLP model’s
    performance by applying ensemble learning in the cloud and sending the enhanced
    MLP model to the edge layer for detection. To take advantage of the high power
    resources at the cloud computing layer, ensemble learning (training) applies to
    the cloud. The ensemble uses different voting task models to select the suited
    model to apply at the edge (detection) as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7. Architecture
    for scenario 3. 4.4. Scenario 4: (Fully Centralised) Fourth scenario (fully centralised),
    in this scenario, all tasks apply at the cloud layer and edge servers work as
    data forwarders. All data need to be sent to the cloud in more detail, and the
    MLP model generated, trained, and used for detection at the cloud (See Figure
    8). Figure 8. Architecture for scenario 4. 5. Results and Discussion 5.1. Network
    Topology The proposed framework consists of three different layers: IoT in WDS,
    edge layer, and cloud layer as explained in the previous section. The network
    topology used to represent this framework is as follows. The case study (WDS)
    was divided into three different zones: Area-1 (B), Area-2 (C), and Area-3 (F)
    as shown in Figure 9. Each area contains a number of drinking water quality sensors,
    and these sensors were positioned in the area using optimisation method that was
    applied in the WDS [49]. A separate edge server is assigned for each area, and
    it is responsible for all water quality sensors located in its area. Water quality
    sensors need to establish a connection with edge servers, and edge servers establish
    communication with cloud servers. Another connection is also required, as cloud
    servers require establishing a connection with edge servers. Figure 9. Network
    topology. ContikiOS with CooJa simulator was used to implement the communication
    of our proposed framework. Contiki OS is an open-source operating system for resource-constrained
    hardware devices with low power and less memory [50]. It was developed mainly
    for Internet of Things applications. It also has many features, such as the communication
    module encompassing uIP and 6LowPAN [51]. uIP is, known as “micro IP”, has been
    designed to integrate a minimum set of components needed for TCP / IP stacks [52].
    6LowPAN is a growing technology that allows the use of IPv6 over IoT devices [53].
    ContikiOS also has an extra function that supports the resource constraint hardware
    with the following features: small size, limited memory, lower power, low bandwidth,
    short-range, and communication using radio [54]. On the other hand, Cooja is a
    wireless sensor network emulator based on Java across layers, and it is distributed
    with Contiki OS. It simulates different levels from the physical to the application
    layer and enables the emulation of the hardware of a group of sensor nodes [55].
    5.2. Experiment Setting In order to develop the proposed framework presented in
    this work, we use data collected from three different zones in the case study
    as explained in the network topology. For that, edge servers are implemented using
    a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). CoAP is a constrained application protocol
    designed for IoT applications. Simplistically, CoAP is a machine-to-machine protocol
    built based on the request/response client-server paradigm and it is quite similar
    to HTTP [56]. It also supports the CoAP supports built-in discovery of services
    and resources. The main features of this protocol are: connectionless, lightweight,
    RESTful, and has a small 4-byte header. This protocol is used to manage the communication
    and data transfer between the sensors and edge servers on one side and the edge
    server and cloud servers on the other side. We have used two different communications
    technologies to establish the connection between the sensors with the edge servers
    and edge servers with the cloud server. ZigBee was used to offer the communication
    bridge between the edge and sensors as they are typically located closer to sensors
    in a ≤100 m range. LoRaWAN was used to provide the data from the edge to the cloud
    that were assumed to be apart from the edge servers with 10 km. More details of
    these techniques and parameters required are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Communication
    technologies parameters. On the other hand, MLP was built using a sequential model
    with three layers: The input layer takes the seven water qualities: PH, TOC, temperature,
    conductivity, chlorine, and pressure. The activation function of this layer is
    linearly corrected. In this model, two hidden layers were used; the first hidden
    layer had 10 neurons, and the second hidden layer had 8 neurons; in order to activate
    both hidden layers, the rectified linear function was used. The output layer uses
    five classes have been used to represent the outcome (level of contamination)
    and Softmax used as an activation function. We used the “Adam” optimizer, as well
    as losses and accuracy for measurements. Summarised of all these parameters are
    presented in Table 2. Table 2. Hyperparameters of the MLP model. 5.3. Numerical
    Results In this section, the numerical results from all scenarios explained before
    will be presented. In addition, five metrics have been used to evaluate the performance
    of each scenario: latency, throughput, packet deliver ratio (PDR), power consumption,
    and model performance. Firstly, latency in a network refers to the time for data
    transmission across the network to its desired destination. One-way latency is
    measured in packet-based networks by sending a precisely timestamped packet across
    the network. The one-way delay is calculated by comparing the packet’s timestamp
    with the time of the receiving unit’s reference clock [57]. Secondly, the amount
    of data that may be transmitted from source to destination in a particular timeframe
    is referred to as network throughput [58]. Throughput capacity is often measured
    in bits per second, although it may also be measured in data (Kilobit or Megabit)
    per second. Throughput is calculated by dividing the data bits delivered to the
    destination by the delay time of communications data packets [59]. Moreover, (PDR)
    is defined as the ratio of packets transmitted to total packets sent from the
    source node to the destination node in a network. PDR describes the packet loss
    rate, which restricts the network’s throughput. The routing protocol’s performance
    improves as the delivery ratio rises. PDR is computed as: 𝑃𝐷𝑅= 𝑃 𝑡𝑟 𝑃 𝑠 ×100 (1)
    where 𝑃 𝑡𝑟 is the total packet received at the destination, 𝑃 𝑠 is the number
    of packets sent from the source. For power consumption, we utilised the Contiki
    power tracer model, which reads the number of Ticks on a regular basis and computes
    the power consumption using the equation below [60]. 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑟(𝑚𝑊)= 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑠𝑡×𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡×𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑔𝑒
    𝑅𝑇𝑀𝐸𝑅×𝑅𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 (2) where 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 is the values in TICKS read from the simulator,
    𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 and 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒 are the sensor values of current and voltage from the datasheet
    of the used sensors. 𝑅𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 is the simulation time and 𝑅𝑇𝑀𝐸 𝑅 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑 is the constant
    𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒= 32,768 used to convert the values of the simulator from TICKS to seconds.
    5.3.1. Results of Scenario 1 Since we used three different areas in our case study
    as explained in the network topology section. We need to evaluate the overall
    network performance by sending all the data from the lower layer (IoT-layer) to
    the upper layers (edge and cloud) in all three areas. The average latency for
    sending all data from the first layer to the edge server has been shown in Figure
    10. We can notice the latency for the three areas is different due to the accessibility
    to the medium and the data size in which Area-1 recorded a low latency 15.5 mS.
    In comparison, Area-3 recorded the height value of the average latency ( 25.8
    mS). Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the average throughput used by each area during
    the transmission and the average packet delivery ratio (PDR) that offers the average
    success of packet delivery, respectively. Figure 10. Latency of areas for scenario
    1. Figure 11. Throughput of areas for scenario 1. Figure 12. Packet delivery ratio
    for scenario 1. The relation between latency versus throughput is presented in
    Figure 13. We notice that throughput has a significant impact on both latency
    and PDR as increasing the throughput helps reduce the latency and increases the
    successful number of delivery packets. Considering power consumption as an essential
    metric for performance evaluation, we calculate the power consumption for edge
    servers and sensors. The amount of energy consumed for each device has been calculated
    based on four different models: low power mode (LPM), processing mode (CPU), receiving
    (Rx), and transmission (Tx). The total power consumption of sensors for each area
    (Area-1, Area-2, Area-3) is presented in Figure 14. Area-3 shows high power consumption
    because extensive data have been collected from that area, while Area-1 power
    looks small because it collected small data. The details of power consumption
    for Area-1, Area-2, and Area-3 including all modes are presented in Figure 15,
    Figure 16 and Figure 17, respectively. Figure 13. Relation of latency and throughput.
    Figure 14. Power consumption for sensors. Figure 15. Power modes for sensor in
    Area-1. Figure 16. Power modes for sensor in Area-2. Figure 17. Power modes for
    sensor in Area-3. On the other hand, the total power consumption for edge servers
    has been calculated using the same mods used with sensors. Figure 18 presents
    the total power of all edge servers (Area-1, Area-2, and Area-3). We can notice
    that the edge servers used a huge amount of power in this scenario because all
    the tasks of training and detection for the MLP model have been applied at the
    edge layer. Most of this power was consumed by the processing mode (CPU) that
    performed all training and detection tasks, and the rest of the consumed power
    was distributed between the other modes, high for the receiving mode (Rx). Figure
    19, Figure 20 and Figure 21 present the breakdown power consumption of all servers.
    These figures show in which mode the power consumption rate rises (LPM, CPU, Rx,
    Tx). Figure 18. Power of servers for scenario 1. Figure 19. Power modes of edge
    server-1. Figure 20. Power modes of edge server-2. Figure 21. Power modes of edge
    server-3. 5.3.2. Results of Scenario 2 In this scenario, the MLP model trains
    and develops in the cloud and then needs to be sent back down to the edge, and
    we expect the latency to be higher than the latency of the previous scenario.
    Figure 22 depicts the total average latency that passed through three hops: sensor-edge,
    edge-cloud, cloud-edge (end-to-end) for the three areas. The result shows a high
    value at Area-3 and a low value at Area-1. The throughput used to send all data
    and models, and the PDR are presented in Figure 23 and Figure 24, respectively.
    Power consumption of the edge servers seems to be reduced compared to the previous
    scenario because the model’s training has been moved to the cloud, and the edge
    servers are used only for detection; see Figure 25 for the total average of power
    consumption for edge servers. Figure 22. Latency of areas scenario 2. Figure 23.
    Throughput of areas scenario 2. Figure 24. PDR for areas scenario 2. Figure 25.
    Power of servers scenario 2. A simple comparison between scenario 1 and scenario
    2 in terms of latency and power is presented in Figure 26 and Figure 27, respectively.
    The results show that scenario 1 outperforms scenario 2 in terms of latency while
    scenario 2 outperforms scenario 1 in terms of power, as scenario 1 consumes a
    huge amount of power. To sort the issue of power that appeared in scenario 2 and
    scenario 3 we will try to take advantage of cloud and edge by dividing the tasks
    between cloud and edge layers. Figure 26. Comparison between scenarios 1 and 2:
    latency. Figure 27. Comparison between scenario 1 and 2: power. 5.3.3. Results
    of Scenario 3 In this scenario, we applied ensemble learning to enhance the performance
    of the MLP model. The process of data analysis is divided between the cloud and
    edge servers. The cloud layer is used to train and develop the ensemble model
    and the edge layer uses the pertained model sent from the cloud for the detection.
    More precisely, edge servers are used to apply the voting technique for detection.
    Figure 28 shows the latency for all areas. In general, it seems that the latency
    is very high compared to previous scenarios while maintaining the same level between
    areas (Area-1, Area-2, and Area-3). Throughput and PDR seem to be the same with
    very little change compared to scenario 2 as shown in Figure 29 and Figure 30.
    The total average power consumption for the edge servers is presented in Figure
    31. Figure 28. Latency of areas scenario 3. Figure 29. Throughput of areas scenario
    3. Figure 30. PDR of areas scenario 3. Figure 31. Power consumption of edge servers.
    5.3.4. Results of Scenario 4 In this scenario, fully centralised is used. All
    data analysis tasks are performed in the cloud, so there is no need to send the
    model to the edge layer. This leads to reducing the latency compared to scenario
    2 and scenario 3. Figure 32, Figure 33 and Figure 34 show the latency, throughput
    and PDR, respectively. This scenario has not calculated the power consumption
    for edge and cloud servers. Since the edge servers are used for a very light task
    as data forwarders, that will lead to very low power consumption that can be neglected,
    and the cloud assumes it is fully equipped with power all the time. Figure 32.
    Latency for areas scenario 4. Figure 33. Throughput for areas scenario 4. Figure
    34. PDR for areas scenario 4. 5.4. Discussion Through the above numerical experimental
    analysis, we can compare the performance metrics between all scenarios. For example,
    Figure 35 depicts the latency of all scenarios for each area, and we can conclude
    that scenario 1 outperforms all scenarios in terms of latency, as it has achieved
    the least delay in all areas with different data volumes. Figure 36 presents the
    throughput of all scenarios for the three areas; from the figure, it is clear
    that scenario 2 and scenario 3 require a very high throughput compared to the
    others. This is because sending data goes through 2-hops (edge, cloud) and sending
    the model from the cloud down to the edge. Scenario 1 shows that it requires a
    little throughput as it only needs to send data to one hop and does not require
    sending a model anywhere else. Scenario 4 plays a marginal role between scenario
    1 and scenarios 2, and 3. Figure 35. Latency for all scenarios based on each area.
    Figure 36. Throughput for all scenarios based on each area. Figure 37 shows the
    PDR for each area separately. It shows that scenario 1 outer performs the others
    with a high percentage of successful packet delivery, and scenario 3 indicates
    the lowest rate of successful packet delivery. That’s because scenario 1 requires
    only one hop connection while scenario 3 requires three hop connections. This
    leads to an increase in the probability of packet loss. Figure 37. PDR for all
    scenarios based on each area. Power consumption for edge servers also was compared
    between all scenarios, as shown in Figure 38. The results here show the significant
    differences in power consumption between the first scenario and the others. Scenario
    1 shows terrible power consumption compared to others because all the tasks required
    for training the model and for the contaminant detection process are performed
    at the edge layer. Looking at the power consumption in both the second and third
    scenarios, we find that the consumption is logically close to the increase in
    consumption in scenario 3 because the voting process required in ensemble learning
    is performed at the edge layer. Figure 38. Power consumption of all scenarios
    based on each area. The performance of the MLP model is compared between all scenarios
    in Figure 39; the results show that the performance of the MLP model is stable
    and obtains the same accuracy regardless of the place in which it was implemented,
    whether in the cloud or at the edge. With the exception of scenario 3, it achieved
    the best performance, because we used ensemble learning, which helped improve
    the model’s performance without affecting the rest of the parameters, all energy
    consumption and delay. Figure 39. Performance accuracy of models for all scenarios
    based on each area. The overall performance of the framework presented for each
    metric is as follows: Figure 40 shows the overall latency for all scenarios. The
    result shows that scenario 1 is the best in terms of latency while scenario three
    is the worst one. Figure 41 shows the overall performance of the throughput, the
    results show that scenario 2 and scenario 3 required more throughput than others
    while scenario 1 required the lowest throughput. Figure 42, summarises the percentage
    of the successful packet received at the destination. The result shows that scenario
    1 is the best while scenario 2 is the worst. Figure 43 shows the overall power
    consumption of the framework; it shows that scenario 1 is the worst with a very
    massive amount of power consumption, while scenario 3 is the best. Power scenario
    4 is ignored as it performed totally in the cloud. Finally, the overall performance
    of the MLP model for classification is presented in Figure 44, the results depict
    that scenario 3 enhances the accuracy of the model while all other models recorded
    the same accuracy. In summary, taking all metrics into consideration, scenario
    3 shows the optimal solution as it shows the best performance. Figure 40. Overall

    This paper proposes an intelligent computing architecture for water quality, based
    on collaboration between edge servers and remote clouds. A deep learning application
    aimed to provide real-time monitoring of water quality in WDS. Thus, the datasets
    from three different areas (Area-B, Area-C, and Area-F) in the WDS were used to
    develop the deep learning model and then evaluated the framework’s performance.
    The datasets include the main parameters used to indicate the quality of water
    such as chlorine, turbidity, Ph, TOC, conductivity, temperature, and pressure.
    Four different scenarios were applied in the proposed framework to investigate
    the ideal architecture for the used application. We have used Contiki with Cooja
    simulator to implement and simulate all these scenarios. We have used five different
    metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in all these scenarios.
    These metrics are latency, throughput, packet delivery ratio, power consumption,
    and deep learning model detection accuracy. The overall performance of the proposed
    work shows that scenario 1 outperforms the others in all stations (B, C, F) in
    terms of latency, throughput, and packet delivery ratio obtaining 20.33 mS, 148
    Kb/s, 97.47%. On the other hand, scenario 1 shows the worst in terms of power
    consumption as it records a high value of 2,259,987 mW. In terms of model accuracy
    detection, Scenario 3 shows the best, and it records 94.43%. Author Contributions

    Listen This manuscript presents a novel state-of-the-art cyber-physical water
    testbed, namely the AI and Cyber for Water and Agriculture testbed (ACWA). ACWA
    is motivated by the aim to advance water resources'' management using AI and cybersecurity
    experimentation. The main objective of ACWA is to address pressing challenges
    in the water and agricultural domains by utilising cutting-edge AI and data-driven
    technologies. These challenges include cyberbiosecurity, resources'' management,
    access to water, sustainability, and data-driven decision-making, among others.
    To address such issues, ACWA is built consisting of topologies, sensors, computational
    clusters, pumps, tanks, smart water devices, as well as databases and AI models
    that control the system. Moreover, we present ACWA simulator, which is a software-based
    water digital twin. The simulator is based on fluid and constituent transport
    principles that produce a theoretical time series of a water distribution system.
    It creates a benchmark for comparing the theoretical approach with real-life outcomes

    system is introduced and compared with existing water testbeds; additionally,
    use cases are described along with novel outcomes, such as datasets, software,
    and AI models. HIGHLIGHTS Listen ACWA is a novel cyber-physical testbed for testing,
    validating, and experimenting with intelligent water systems and AI. The testbed
    consists of multiple sensors, computational nodes, pumps, pipes, valves, tanks,
    and other computational components. Open water domain datasets with multiple variables
    are publicly available via ACWA, including ones that enable the testing of Cyberbiosecurity
    and AI deployments in water systems. ACWA is the first data generator of its kind
    (hardware and software) in the water domain. artificial intelligence (AI), cyberbiosecurity,
    testbed, topology, water systems INTRODUCTION Listen Water supply systems (WSS)
    are primary sources that provide and ensure water quality and availability, a
    prerequisite for flourishing economies, protecting public health, and promoting
    national prosperity (Batarseh & Kulkarni 2023). However, the lack of water availability
    has become a growing concern that requires increasing attention. The United Nations
    (UN) World Water Development Report of 2021 (UN 2021) states that the global population
    is experiencing severe water scarcity and will rise from 32 million people in
    1900 to 3.1 billion people by 2050. Additionally, cyber threats on WSS have been
    a critical threat to water resources in the United States and around the world.
    In WSS, it is common to use Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA),
    a standard ‘legacy’ software infrastructure, making systems susceptible to cyber
    threats (CISA 2021). Recently, Hassanzadeh et al. (2020) reported 15 cyber incidents
    on WSS and mentioned that more sophisticated attacks, such as data poisoning,
    minimum perturbations, and botnets, require algorithms that can detect, classify,
    and counter adversarial actions. According to Batarseh & Kulkarni (2023), AI is
    the leading approach to such defences due to its ability to identify unwarranted
    pattern shifts in networks and datasets. Despite AI being the primary approach,
    there is an absence of historical data (Sobien et al. 2023) concerning cybersecurity
    measures in water resources management. The dissemination of water data is rare
    due to their lack of integration and interoperability across various data archives
    (Bustamante et al. 2021). Further, difficulties in data accessibility arise from
    challenges in locating, obtaining, and comparing data across different regions,
    given that various parties and agencies store and manage data in different formats
    and have different governance limitations. Additionally, there are inconveniences
    in data accessibility caused by political, economic, and cultural barriers, along
    with varying legal requirements. For instance, most WSS have restrictions that
    stop them from sharing their data, also especially with cyber-related data, there
    is a challenging scarcity of data points that could be used for identifying patterns
    via AI and other methods. Considering these challenges and their severity, the
    need to create an innovative testbed that can create data and validate scenarios
    in a dynamic manner is evident. ACWA therefore, is an innovative cyber-physical
    system designed to tackle these challenges by generating valuable scenarios and
    datasets through experimental procedures. The underlying concept of the ACWA laboratory
    involves creating a water testbed with varying topologies (i.e., dynamic structures)
    to simulate diverse water distribution scenarios. Moreover, a soil topology is
    also established to explore the impacts of water on irrigation and agricultural
    practices. This comprehensive setup will incorporate different sensors (water
    and soil) and chemical agents to enable seamless data collection, feeding directly
    into a database. The accumulated data within the database are visualised via real-time
    dashboards, offering proactive monitoring and evaluation capabilities. RELATED
    WORK Listen A testbed can be defined as a ‘composite abstraction of systems used
    to study system components and interactions to gain further insight into the essence
    of the real system’ (Fortier & Michel 2003). This section reviews seven existing
    testbeds developed in the water domain for the simulation of monitoring and control
    processes. The reviewed testbeds are shown in Table 1, and the testbeds are also
    compared and contrasted with ACWA. Table 1 Seven existing testbeds developed in

    et al. (2015) presented WaterBox; a small-scale testbed that allows the simulation
    of monitoring and control processes of smart water systems. The WaterBox is a
    closed-loop structure consisting of three individual layers, as shown in Figure
    1. The upper layer is the Supply, which simulates the reservoir and a pumping
    station. The WaterBox also has pressure sensors and controllable values to monitor
    the water transfer to the middle layer. The middle layer indicates three district
    metered areas (DMAs) represented by tanks of different sizes that provide water
    to the lower layer. The lower layer represents Demand, which mimics the water
    demand variation in time using valves. Each output from the DMA in the lower layer
    has a flow sensor and valve installed. In the end, the water from the lower layer
    is collected in a large tank and recycled to the reservoir using an underwater
    pump. The details on information on preliminary experiments using WaterBox are
    provided by Kartakis et al. (2015). Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE WaterBox
    testbed is a closed-loop structure consisting of three individual layers (Kartakis
    et al. 2015). Karray et al. (2016) presented EARNPIPE to provide a low-power wireless
    sensor network (WSN) solution that detects leaks (and provides localisation).
    The meaning of localisation in this context is the sectional leaks in an otherwise
    leakage-free pipe. This testbed is constructed in a rectangular shape with polyethylene
    pipes, which support pressure up to 12 bar (1 bar = 100,000 pa). Further, two
    valves are installed as an inlet and outlet to vary water demand by varying the
    pressure. EARNPIPE also includes a 1,000 m3 reservoir for water storage and an
    electric pump with one Horsepower (hp) for pumping water from the reservoir to
    pipes. To induce leaks, two garden taps are used in their setup. The authors also
    have proposed and discussed the implementation of leak detection (Leak Detection
    Predictive Kalman Filter) and localisation algorithms (modified time difference
    of arrival) (Karray et al. 2016). Goh et al. (2017) presented a six-stage Secure
    Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, a scaled-down version of a real-world water treatment
    plant. SWaT utilises membrane-based ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis units
    to produce 5 gallons/min of filtered water. The overall process layout and the
    architecture of SWaT are presented in Figure 2. SWaT has six main processes: taking
    raw water (P1), pre-treatment (P2), filtration via membranes (P3), dichlorination
    (P4), reverse osmosis (P5), and distribution (P6). The authors collect data from
    these processes. Network traffic data are also collected from commercial equipment
    via Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. The additional details of data generation
    and attack simulation using the SWaT testbed are discussed in Goh et al. (2017).
    Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Overall process layout and architecture of SWaT
    (Goh et al. 2017). Bernieri et al. (2017) presented the Failure and Attack on
    interdependent Critical InfrastructurES (FACIES) testbed developed within a European
    Union (EU) project. The system emulates the water system of a small city. The
    FACIES testbed consists of five tanks connected by pipes where each tank consists
    of a water level sensor. The water flow in the system is managed by 4 centrifugal
    pumps, 20 solenoid valves, and 7 manual valves. The authors noted that these tanks
    could be arranged in 14 different configurations to perform a variety of experiments.
    The FACIES testbed and other modules present in FACIES are shown in Figure 3.
    The real-time data from the water level sensors are collected by Modicon M340
    and Schneider Electric PLCs, which are stored on a local database developed in
    Oracle MySQL Workbench. Additional details on FACIES can be found in Bernieri
    et al. (2017). Figure 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE The FACIES testbed and the modules
    constituting the testbed (Bernieri et al. 2017). Laso et al. (2017) presented
    a dataset generated from the physical water testbed to enable the detection of
    anomalies and malicious acts in cyber-physical systems. This testbed utilises
    two tanks (one with a 7-L capacity and the other with a 9-L) for storing water
    or fuel, one ultrasound depth sensor, four discrete sensors, and two pumps. The
    physical components are controlled and monitored using a computer connected to
    a programmable logic controller (PLC). This water testbed simulates 15 unique
    situations affecting ultrasound sensors, discrete sensors, the underlying network,
    or the whole subsystem. Ahmed et al. (2017) presented an architecture of a Water
    Distribution testbed (WADI), a scaled-down version of a large water distribution
    network of a city, in 2023, the same team released an additional SWaP testbed
    as indicated in Table 1. WADI consists of three stages (P1, P2, and P3), when
    in operation, it can supply 10 gallons/min of filtered water. The P1 is a primary
    grid that contains two water tanks (2,500 L each), a water level sensor, and a
    chemical system that maintains the water quality. Additionally, water quality
    sensors are also installed in P1. The second stage is P2, which indicates the
    secondary grid. This stage consists of two elevated reservoir tanks and six consumer
    tanks. The raw tanks from P1 supply water to these elevated tanks based on pre-set
    demand patterns set by the authors. Lastly, P3 deals with the return water grid,
    which is also equipped with a tank. When the demands of the consumer tanks are
    met in P2, the water drains to the return water grid. Detailed information on
    communication infrastructures and how they can help analyse an attack''s impact
    is provided by Ahmed et al. (2017). Oberascher et al. (2022a, 2022b) described
    the Smart water campus testbed for monitoring water networks that can be useful
    for fault detection in real-time along with involving cross-system improvements
    like rainwater harvesting. The authors noted that the Smart water campus is a
    network-based urban water infrastructure that integrates a water distribution
    network, an urban drainage network, and nature-based solutions. The testbed leverages
    perception, communication, middleware, and processing layers. A detailed description
    of the four layers used in the Smart water campus testbed and a demonstration
    of smart applications can be found in Oberascher et al. (2022a, 2022b). The scope
    of most of the existing testbeds summarised in this section is either within one
    or two experimental spectrums. For example, WaterBox (Kartakis et al. 2015) focuses
    on the simulation of monitoring and control processes of water networks and EARNPIPE
    (Karray et al. 2016) is designed to detect leaks and localisation, ACWA (the new
    testbed presented in this paper) aims to provide a dynamic environment that allows
    for multiple scenarios, including related to irrigation and soil, a notion missing
    from existing testbeds. SWaT (Goh et al. 2017), WADI (Ahmed et al. 2017), and
    FACIES (Bernieri et al. 2017) are explicitly developed for studying the effects
    of attacks (cyber and physical) on water plants while Laso et al. (2017) presented
    a testbed for anomaly/malicious act detection. These testbeds involve components
    such as pipes, pumps, and valves along with flow and water level sensors, but
    these testbeds do not capture water chemicals and related parameters (which is
    commonly a manner of attack on water systems), the lack of such experimentation
    renders these testbeds limited. Smart water campus (Oberascher et al. 2022a, 2022b)
    is the only testbed focusing on water quality parameters and on capturing soil
    and climate-related variables, although it is spread across eight hectares and
    does not provide the ability to run distributed AI algorithms. Considering these
    aspects, the ACWA testbed differentiates from the reviewed testbeds via the following
    main characteristics: 1. Modularity: The components of the testbed (multiple water
    networks) are designed modularly. This unique flexibility allows for the creation
    of new topologies and to add more nodes (such as pumps, valves, pipes, tanks,
    sensors, soil, and reservoirs) in any topology based on the experiment''s design
    and goals. 2. Sensors: The ACWA testbed has 14 water sensors that capture data
    on traditional water parameters, such as water level, water pressure, and water
    flow; and quality variables, such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate,
    and electrical conductivity (EC) – among other data points listed in this manuscript.
    Additionally, the soil topology is equipped with a soil moisture sensor, water
    turbidity, and two soil probes to capture EC and temperature data. 3. Data: The
    big data created at ACWA are captured at 1-, 5-, and 30-s intervals and are stored
    in a local MongoDB database. This unique feature allows researchers to capture
    granular-level data and analyse minuscule changes in sensor values, including
    the deployment of AI and security algorithms. A data collection frequency not
    found anywhere else. 4. Water and soil: The ACWA testbed is carefully designed
    and planned to accommodate a soil topology with four soil beds along with Line,
    Star, and Bus water network topologies. Furthermore, there is a lack of existing
    software water simulators, the most commonplace water simulator is EPANET, a prolonged
    hydraulic and water quality dynamics simulator built within a pressurised piping
    systems environment; based on Rossman (2000), EPANET is also used in commercial
    software development – in our open access GitHub repository (https://github.com/AI-VTRC/ACWA-Data),
    we also share the EPANET model for ACWA (in Appendix E), accessible to other researchers.
    A main addition that we present via ACWA is also a digital twin, namely, the ACWA
    simulator, also presented in this paper. The next section presents the main parts
    of ACWA, the main contribution of this paper. METHODS Listen To dynamically simulate
    and collect real-time data on different scenarios of WSS, the laboratory''s sensors
    are built into four topologies to capture water and soil quality attributes, such
    as pH, temperature, DO, turbidity, nitrate levels, EC, soil moisture, water level,
    pressure, and flow rate. These data are stored in a MongoDB database for analysis,
    model development, and AI assurance, which can assist in tackling rising challenges
    in the water and agricultural domains as found in recent literature (Dobermann
    et al. 2004; Li et al. 2020; Saad et al. 2020; Batarseh & Kulkarni 2023). The
    cyber-physical water topologies Listen A topology is a physical and logical arrangement
    of nodes and connections in a network. Literature (Peterson & Davie 2007; Liu
    & Liu 2014) indicates seven commonly used network topologies: Line, Bus, Star,
    Ring, Mesh, Tree, and Hybrid. These topologies are foundational in computer networks.
    However, literature on WSS indicates four main structures: grid-iron, ring, radial,
    and dead-end (Adeosun 2014). These four structures can be designed using the fundamental
    computer network topologies. In dead-end WSS (National Research Council 2007),
    the main line is at the centre, and sub-main lines are divided into branches.
    This structure can be developed using a Bus topology at ACWA in which the nodes
    are connected to a central line using a branch-like structure. Similarly, Ring
    WSS is a circular system, and a line topology can be turned into a Ring WSS if
    we connect the first and last nodes of a network. Also, in Radial WSS (National
    Research Council 2007), a reservoir is present at the centre, and water is distributed
    directly from it, which can be represented using ACWA''s Star topology. Considering
    these aspects and motivation from computer networks, we have built Line, Star,
    and Bus topologies. In these topologies, nodes are represented by water tanks
    and they are connected to pumps and reservoirs using pipes and tubes. These topologies
    are placed independently on three tables of sizes 5 inches × 2.6 inches × 2.5
    inches (length × width × height), which can also be connected into a hybrid topology
    using Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) or Chlorinated Poly Vinyl Chloride (CPVC) pipes.
    In our setup, we used two big water tanks (35 gallons) as reservoirs to provide
    water to the testbed. The detailed descriptions of these three topologies are
    as follows. Line topology Listen The Line topology is developed by building point-to-point
    connections between three tanks with pumps, as shown in Figure 4(a). To build
    this topology, three rectangular tanks and two diaphragm water pumps are connected
    via ½ inch PVC pipes. In Line topology, one diaphragm water pump pumps the water
    from the reservoir to three tanks, and the other pump pulls the water out from
    the tanks back to the reservoir. For every tank, the water flow can be changed
    at any point using manual valves installed in the network. The three tanks used
    here are 20.25 inches × 12.625 inches × 10.5 inches (length × width × height)
    in size and have a 10-gallon water storage capacity. To get real-time data during
    experiments, the water level, nitrate, and pH temperature sensors are mounted
    while the flow sensor is installed on a ½ inch PVC pipe. In addition, a water
    level sensor is mounted for capturing data from the water reservoir. Figure 4
    VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Schematic representations of the (a) line topology, (b)
    bus topology, and (c) star topology as used in ACWA. Bus topology Listen In this
    topology, four rectangular tanks and two diaphragm water pumps are connected via
    ¾ inch C-PVC pipes, as Figure 4(b) indicates. In Bus topology, the C-PVC pipe
    is installed at the centre, alternatively distributing water to two tanks on each
    side. The water flow also can be changed using manual valves, which are installed
    for every tank and line. The four tanks in this topology are 16.25 inches × 8.375
    inches × 10.5 inches (length × width × height) in size and have a 5.5-gallon water
    storage capacity. For data collection in real time, the water level and EC sensors
    are mounted while the pressure sensor is installed on a main line ¾ inch C-PVC
    pipe. Star topology Listen The Star topology is developed by connecting one medium-size
    and four small-size water tanks via ½ inch C-PVC pipes. A schematic diagram for
    Star topology is shown in Figure 4(c). This topology is designed using four diaphragm
    water pumps and five cubical tanks. In this topology, one diaphragm water pump
    transfers water from the main water reservoir to the central tank (node), and
    then two additional diaphragm water pumps distribute this water to four other
    small tanks. The manual valves for each tank are provided to change or control
    the water flow. Lastly, at the end of the experiment, the fourth pump pulls water
    from all four tanks back to the reservoir. This process is performed using a four-way
    water splitter and tubes. The four tubes are immersed in four small tanks to pull
    the water and transfer it back to the reservoir. The water flow can also be controlled
    or turned on/off using the individual valves on the splitter. The central tank
    used in this topology is 15.25 inches × 15.25 inches × 15.25 inches (length ×
    width × height) in size and has a 14-gallon water storage capacity. The four small
    tanks are 9.25 inches × 9.25 inches × 9.25 inches (length × width × height) in
    size and each tank has a 3-gallon water storage capacity. For data collection
    in real-time, water level, pH, temperature, and EC sensors are installed. Also,
    one water level sensor is mounted to capture data from the reservoir that provides
    water for this topology. Soil topology Listen Vertical farming (Van Gerrewey et
    al. 2021) involves cultivating plants in multiple layers to maximise yield within
    a confined space. The definitions of vertical farming differ due to factors such
    as size, density, control level, layout, building type, location, and purpose.
    These vertical farming principles are incorporated into the soil topology of ACWA
    to enhance space efficiency. The ACWA soil topology is mainly dedicated to conducting
    experiments on agricultural soils and focusing on irrigation and water transportation
    through them. It is designed in a vertical arrangement, illustrated in Figure
    5(a) showing the representations and Figure 5(b) showing the real topology. This
    vertical arrangement is achieved through a 4-Tier metal wire shelving unit, which
    is 54 inches in height and 36 inches in width. The spacing between each shelf
    level is 14 inches. This design enables independent experiments on soils because
    each soil pot has its own 3.5 L irrigation drip bag and 3-gallon drainage tank.
    Levels one and three of the shelving unit can accommodate two soil pots each and
    two water tanks are placed on levels two and four. These tanks are designed to
    collect drainage from the corresponding soil pots. Further, sensors in each soil
    pot are mounted to capture moisture, temperature, and EC data from them. The soil
    testbed also uses water level and turbidity sensors to capture real-time data
    from collected drained water. Figure 5 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE (a) Schematic
    representation of ACWA''s soil topology and (b) the soil topology picture. The
    mentioned topologies are connected to computational nodes and sensors, and via
    multiple communication protocols; the details of which are presented in the following
    sections. Appendix A shows other photos from the testbed. Associated with Figures

    mineral build-up from sensors       The sensors are connected to computers and
    GPU devices via three communication protocols, Modbus, Long Range, and Zigbee,
    as follows: (1) Modbus: A widely used communication protocol (Thomas 2008) in
    industrial automation and control systems. It allows different electronic devices,
    such as sensors, actuators, and PLCs, to exchange data and control commands over
    a network. Modbus is characterised by its simplicity and versatility, making it
    suitable for simple and complex applications in various industries. It operates
    over different physical layers, including serial connections like RS-232, RS-485,
    and Ethernet, making it adaptable to different communication needs. (2) Long Range:
    LoRa, or Long Range, is a wireless communication technology for long-distance
    data transmission with low-power consumption (Devalal & Karthikeyan 2018). It
    enables devices to communicate wirelessly over extended ranges. This makes LoRa
    useful for applications such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart city solutions,
    and rural connectivity. LoRa uses spread spectrum modulation techniques to achieve
    reliable communication even in challenging environments, and its low-power requirements
    make it suitable for battery-operated devices, extending its operational lifespan.
    (3) Zigbee: A wireless communication protocol (Ergen 2004) developed for creating
    low-power, short-range networks among various devices. It is designed for home
    automation and industrial control. The Zigbee protocol enables efficient and reliable
    data exchange. It operates on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and uses a mesh network
    topology. This allows devices to communicate directly or indirectly through other
    devices, enhancing coverage and reliability. Zigbee''s focus on low-power consumption
    makes it well-suited for battery-operated devices in smart homes and IoT applications.
    To manage data streams for AI development and Cyberbiosecurity measures, the following
    softwares are used (but not limited to): MongoDB, NodeRed, R Dashboards, Python,
    TensorFlow, Keras, and other data management technologies, more information on
    that is listed in the public access GitHub page: https://github.com/AI-VTRC/ACWA-Data.
    The next section presents the ACWA simulator and its structural details. The ACWA
    simulator Listen The main goal of the simulation is to showcase water flowing
    through pipes from a reservoir into two interconnected tanks. In a digital twin
    environment, a pump is placed between one tank and the reservoir (as Figure 8
    illustrates). The pump characteristics will determine the initial flow rate and
    a valve can be added between tanks as a control mechanism. The elevation of the
    bases of the tanks can be changed to simulate gravitational flow. Additionally,
    hydraulic and water nutrient parameters will be measured throughout the process.
    These parameters include pH, water level, water pressure, water surface temperature,
    and changes in nitrate, phosphate, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), DO, and sodium
    hydroxide (NaOH) concentrations. The connecting pipe diameter and surface roughness
    can also be programmed to simulate flow through a pipe. Figure 8 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Framework of the simulation, (a) GUI and data creation; (b) animation module.
    The ACWA simulator generates a CSV file incorporating time series data of all
    the parameters for every simulation. The novel part of the simulator is that it
    provides a time series for both hydraulic parameters, such as water level and
    pressure, along with water nutrient parameters, such as pH, Nitrate, BOD, and
    NaOH, which change every second. These generated data can be used for calibration,
    validation, AI modelling, data poisoning experiments, and comparison with the
    physical system. Inputs to the simulator environment include pH, BOD, DO, Nitrate,
    NaOH, Water Level, Water Temperature, Water Density, Kinematic Viscosity, Discharge,
    Pipe Material, Pipe Length, Pipe Diameter, Tank Shape, Tank Size – the data outcomes
    of the simulator as presented in Table 4. Table 4 Water quality attributes Variable

    software simulator has built-in physical assumptions that can be updated and tuned
    using the code; the following nine assumptions are set: 1. Water is assumed to
    be an incompressible Newtonian fluid (Mott & Untener 2015). 2. Water is in a steady
    state, i.e., the type of flow throughout the process will not change. 3. Flow
    should either be laminar or turbulent. This is implemented in the constraints
    section. 4. The reservoir and tanks are at atmospheric pressure. 5. Only head
    loss due to friction, entry, and exit loss is considered. 6. pH interacts with
    NaOH; BOD interacts with DO. No other mutual interactions are considered. The
    change in constituents is determined only by wall reaction, bulk reaction, and
    decay function. 7. Temperature can change only due to differences in air temperature
    and convection. 8. The model assumes a steady-state scenario, i.e., the conditions
    are not changing with time, only with position along the pipe. The fluid properties
    (like density, specific heat, and the heat transfer coefficient) are constant.
    This might not be the case, especially if the temperature changes significantly.
    9. The surface temperature of the pipe is assumed to be constant along the length
    of the pipe. Additionally, multiple physical characteristics are built into the
    system, related to the input variables mentioned previously, those are presented
    in Table 5 (Simulator inputs are presented in Appendix C). Table 5 Physical representations
    in ACWA simulator Input''s physical representation Description Source for formulasa
    Water density  Auto-generated and constrained as a function of water temperature.  Kell
    (1975)   Kinematic viscosity  Expressed as a function of temperature.  Guo et
    al. (2020)   Overflow check  Overflow can occur when the volume of water pumped
    into a tank exceeds its maximum capacity. Mathematically speaking, the available
    volume in tank 2 must always be adequate to water transported from tank 1.  Modi
    & Seth (2019)   Pipe flow safety factor  The diameter-to-length ratio is critical
    to prevent open channel flow and ensure the pipe remains full (avoiding ‘slug’
    flow or a mix of air and water). There is no strict ratio for all systems, but
    it depends on the specifics of the setup; a general guideline for keeping pipes
    fully pressurised is to ensure sufficient inlet head or pressure.  Mays (2000)   Flow
    type  Laminar and turbulent flows are two fundamental flow regimes in fluid dynamics,
    and they describe how fluid particles move within a conduit – pipe, open channel,
    or flow medium. Laminar or streamlined flow occurs when fluid flows in parallel
    layers (or laminae) with minimal mixing or lateral crossover between the layers.
    Turbulent flow is characterised by chaotic, irregular motion of particles in which
    fluid particles move randomly and swirl. It is necessary to determine whether
    the flow is laminar or turbulent.  Mott & Untener (2015)   Elevation pressure  Conveys
    how a force is distributed over a particular surface. The water pressure depends
    on the height of the water column, i.e., how high the water surface is above the
    tank/reservoir bed.  Mott & Untener (2015)   Energy loss  The hydraulic movement
    in the given system is governed by the energy equation derived from Bernoulli''s
    equation of fluid flow.  Mott & Untener (2015)   Pipe head loss  When pumped water
    goes through the pipes and due to friction generated in the pipe, the water will
    lose energy, resulting in decreased pressure in terms of head loss.  Mott & Untener
    (2015)   Friction factor  The Colebrook–White formula can be used to find out
    the friction factor.  Brandt et al. (2017)   Valves and joints loss  Entry and
    exit loss.  Mott & Untener (2015)   Water level rise  Considering all the friction
    loss and other energy conditions, there will be a specific flow at the end of
    the pipe and pressure. This will, in turn, transfer into the tank, and the water
    level will rise depending on the tank area.  Modi & Seth (2019)   Advective transport  Longitudinal
    dispersion is usually not a vital transport mechanism under most operating conditions.
    This means there is no intermixing of mass between adjacent parcels of water travelling
    down a pipe.  Chaudhry & Mays (2012)   Mixing in storage facilities  It is convenient
    to assume that the contents of storage facilities (tanks and reservoirs) are entirely
    mixed. This is a reasonable assumption for many tanks operating under fill-and-draw
    conditions, providing sufficient momentum flux is imparted to the inflow.  Rossman
    & Grayman (1999)   Heat transfer  For heat transfer of the fluid through pipe,
    convection theorem is used to model convective heat transfer from the outside
    environment to the water through the pipe.  Bergman (2011)   aAll formulas are
    presented in Appendix B. ACWA data Listen The data created from all the mentioned
    parts in this section are the main outcome of ACWA; the data variables are presented
    in Table 6 (data samples are available in the mentioned public GitHub repository;

    (Pa), Nitrate Concentration (mg/L), BOD Concentration (mg/L), DO Concentration
    (mg/L), pH, Temperature (°C). All data are visualised in multiple data dashboards
    (presented in Appendix D). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Listen The scope of the ACWA
    laboratory is extensive, covering a diverse range of applications relevant to
    its design and operation. It includes various concepts, such as data creation
    and collection, benchmark scenarios for Cyberbiosecurity research (Sobien et al.
    2023), AI assurance techniques to address adversarial attacks, fine-tuning process
    of soft sensors, innovative ideas for water and agricultural-related public policies,
    and more. Considering these aspects, the potential use cases that can be developed
    in the ACWA laboratory include (but are not limited to): 1. Digital twin: A digital
    twin is a replication of a physical sensor that allows monitoring, visualisation
    and prediction of its physical counterpart (Eckhart & Ekelhart 2019). The data
    collected from water and soil sensors could be used for the development of digital
    twins (besides the presented ACWA simulator). This can help in different applications,
    such as soil quality, systems'' simulation, along with other potential agriculture
    and water-related uses (Eckhart & Ekelhart 2018). 2. Data poisoning: The EPA (Environmental
    Protection Agency) has established water regulation limits, and water distribution
    plants use sensors to control the level of chemicals (such as Phosphorus) in the
    water. The ACWA laboratory allows the simulation of data poisoning via advanced
    AI algorithms that can help simulate cases where the data used for decision-making
    are compromised, similar to the many cyber incidents presented by Hassanzadeh
    et al. (2020). 3. Water quality: WSSs use filtration and chlorination processes
    to remove turbidity from water (Stevenson & Bravo 2019). The use of high chlorination
    forms trihalomethanes (THMs) and Haloacetic acids (HAAs), which can create human
    health hazards (Lowe et al. 2022). In these scenarios, AI can be used to develop
    an early warning system for predicting reclaimed water (U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency 2023) turbidity. This may help WSS in planning the use of the chlorination
    process efficiently. 4. Pump operations: These operations, such as determining
    capacity, number of pumps, and when to start them, can be determined optimally.
    This can assist pump operators by providing actionable recommendations on pump
    operations and reducing pump usage and energy consumption. 5. Simulation: The
    ACWA simulator generates different scenarios to showcase water flow from a reservoir
    to a tank. The simulator provides complete control of inputs such as selecting
    material for the pipe, tank dimensions, and chemicals. This simulator can be used
    to study the effects of different conditions (chemicals, pipe materials, etc.)
    on the water. 6. Decision-support system: A decision-support system represents
    the role of technology, such as AI, to provide the stakeholders with intuition,
    insight, and understanding (Keen 1980; Brill et al. 1990). These systems can be
    developed by combining advanced AI techniques with AI assurance for different
    water and agricultural stakeholders. 7. Process monitoring: ACWA data visualisations
    can represent the information and act as a diagnostic tool to bring situational
    awareness (Few 2007). This can help monitor different agricultural and/or water
    plant processes in real-time to check for subtle accuracies ingested into sensor
    networks. 8. Data generation: The need for more datasets for securing cyber-physical
    systems (CPS) (Goh et al. 2017) can be tackled by generating data from the ACWA
    laboratory topologies. ACWA laboratory provides a facility to generate realistic
    datasets for network, physical properties, and soil and water nutrient data with
    sufficient complexities of WSS, a notion not found in any other testbed. 9. Fertigation:
    Fertigation is injecting fertilisers and other soil products into the soil. ACWA
    laboratory allows experimentation of different fertiliser concentrations along
    with other parameters such as pH, and moisture content. This can be useful for
    instance for developing a recommendation system using AI models for farmers. 10.
    Economics and policy-making: The use of AI, specifically Deep and Reinforcement
    Learning (DL and RL) – subfields of AI – has been increasingly assisting farm,
    forest, and ranch managers in decision-making (Environmental Protection Agency,
    n.d.). In ACWA, advanced AI methods with causal aspects will be researched focusing
    on applications such as water quality, agricultural market structures, agricultural
    production, resource allocation, and international trade. 11. Anomaly detection:
    It is common in smart farms to have physical devices such as sensors, actuators,
    network cables, and routers outdoors. Also, these devices do not have tamper-resistant
    boxes, and the changes of intentional or unintentional physical modifications
    of these devices can occur (Rettore de Araujo Zanella et al. 2020). These anomalies
    can be identified using AI, and data generated from these devices can be detected
    in real time, a cyber scenario that can be tested at ACWA. 12. Network attack
    detection: A report published by the US Council of Economic Advisors (2018) reported
    >11 large-scale cyber incidents in the food and agriculture sector in 2016 for
    instance. This creates a need to provide robust security solutions, mainly when
    digital systems and IoT-based technologies are heavily used in the agriculture
    and water domains. The advanced sensors used in the ACWA laboratory can help create
    various anomalous datasets with a combination of different network attacks such
    as denial of service (DOS), man-in-the-middle, and address resolution protocol
    (ARP) Spoofing that may help in the development of assured AI models for network
    attacks'' mitigation and detection. 13. Soft sensors: In various industrial and
    scientific applications, accurate and reliable sensor measurements are crucial
    for making informed decisions and maintaining high-quality processes (Wang et
    al. 2022). However, hardware sensors are subject to environmental conditions,
    calibration drift uncertainties, expensive prices, hard set up, and other unreliable
    aspects (Geng et al. 2015). One solution to this problem is the development of
    soft sensors, which are mathematical models that output specific target parameters
    using hardware sensor data (Ching et al. 2021). This solution can be explored
    in ACWA considering the availability of advanced high-quality water and soil sensors.
    Other novel use cases will be researched considering the need and advancement
    of water technologies. Additionally, the ACWA laboratory actively collaborates
    with external organisations, industry partners, and academic institutions, fostering
    a collaborative community dedicated to addressing other potential complex challenges
    in water and agriculture. CONCLUSION Listen This manuscript presents the new ACWA
    testbed, a novel cyber-physical system designed and developed to test, simulate,
    and experiment with cutting-edge technologies such as AI and cyber solutions for
    intelligent water systems. As established in the literature review section, ACWA
    is the first of its kind in the domain, and it fills a needed gap for evaluating
    existing challenges and validating some of the proposed solutions in academia
    and industry. It is rather difficult to represent all potential AI applications
    in the water sector, for that reason, the four ACWA topologies (line, bus, star,
    and soil) are developed in a modular manner that allows researchers to manipulate
    the structure, expand on it, and collect different forms of datasets based on
    the desired outcomes. DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT Listen All relevant data are
    available from an online repository or repositories. ACWA data samples are available
    in our open access GitHub repository (https://github.com/AI-VTRC/ACWA-Data). More
    detailed datasets including requests for specific simulations and complete timeseries
    are available upon request from the authors. CONFLICT OF INTEREST Listen The authors

    humanity [1,2,3,4,5]. Water is life as the human body is made up of approximately
    65% water [6]. Hence, humans need to consume clean water for their survival [4,5,7].
    Clean water also plays a critical role in improving people’s health, well-being,
    and quality of life [1,2,5]. However, clean water is becoming a scarce commodity
    because of the negative impacts of several anthropogenic activities [1,5,7,8,9,10].
    To increase access to clean water, water quality monitoring is an active area
    of research in academia and industry [5,11,12,13]. Water quality monitoring research
    involves the use of traditional laboratory-based technology as well as modern
    distributed Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Among these technologies, the
    use of IoT technology is more popular because of its advantages over laboratory-based
    technology in terms of cost, real-time water quality monitoring, and prompt water
    data collection [14,15,16,17] Despite the promise of IoT systems in water quality
    monitoring applications, they are still at an infant stage and are resource-constrained
    in terms of power, bandwidth, and computational resources [18]. Because of these
    constraints, the IoT systems in water quality monitoring applications are currently
    limited in performance in the context of energy efficiency, throughput, and network
    lifetime [19]. For IoT systems to perform better in the water quality monitoring
    domain, it is important to address the resource constraint issues. Hence, it is
    important to investigate the design of new resource management strategies that
    can be incorporated into IoT systems for water quality monitoring. This study
    focuses on the design of efficient resource allocation strategies for resource
    management in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) IoT network for water quality
    monitoring; the main contributions of this work are highlighted as follows: We
    propose the design of a NOMA-enabled protocol for IoT-enabled water quality monitoring
    systems; We propose the integration of edge computing with water quality monitoring
    systems; We propose resource allocation optimization methods, including a Dinkelbach
    algorithm-based optimization method for optimizing wireless energy transfer and
    wireless information transfer, as well as a dynamic resource allocation method
    for hybrid access point (HAP) resource allocation for data collection; We provide
    a comparison of the proposed method with a comparable baseline method. The content
    of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a review of
    the related studies. Section 3 presents the proposed method. Section 4 presents
    the process of mathematical modeling and optimization of resource allocation.
    In Section 5, we provide experimental results to illustrate the energy efficiency
    performance of the proposed NOMA-enabled IoT system for water quality monitoring
    based on the proposed efficient resource allocation strategies. Section 6 concludes
    this work. 2. Related Work The successful deployment of IoT systems in water quality
    monitoring applications require efficient resource allocation solutions that can
    increase the system energy efficiency and network lifetime, support the transmission
    of a large amount of water data, and reduce the computational resources required
    by the system. As a consequence of this, researchers have intensified efforts
    to propose various resource allocation solutions. A review of the examples of
    the related studies are presented as follows. Ji and Guo [20] considered the problem
    of resource allocation optimization in a wireless-powered mobile edge computing-based
    IoT network. In their work, the mobile edge computing approach was employed to
    offload intensive computation tasks from the network devices to the edge nodes
    because of the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices. However, the use of
    mobile edge computing in IoT systems often results in increased resource utilization
    cost (e.g., power) and computational complexity. This may be due to the extra
    computational overhead and energy consumption introduced by edge computing for
    sensor devices because they must perform complex tasks in the context of data
    collection, processing, analysis, and decision making. In addition, the mobile
    edge computing approach is still a developing technology associated with various
    resource-allocation problems. Similar to the work of Ji and Guo [20], Ahmed et
    al. [21], and Sun et al. [22] also considered the problem of resource allocation
    in wireless-powered mobile edge computing networks. However, these works also
    suffer from the inherent resource wastage issue associated with edge computing
    due to the extra computational overhead and energy consumption introduced by edge
    computing for sensor devices. To address these issues, we introduced a heterogeneous
    multiclass communication system that consists of ordinary water quality sensor
    devices and two edge computing-enabled HAP devices that can perform edge computing
    tasks [23,24]. Additionally, we introduced the concept of a sequential multi-class
    WPCN to optimally and sequentially schedule the operation of network devices for
    data transmission with a low-complexity dynamic resource allocation method. Zeng
    [25] formulated the system energy efficiency problem as a game theory problem.
    In their work, the sensor devices are modeled to collectively work together to
    maximize their overall objective function value. However, because of the need
    to cooperatively make decisions on how to allocate resources, the system suffered
    from a computational complexity issue. This resulted in a low energy efficiency
    performance of the system. To address the problem in the work of Zeng [25], we
    propose a dynamic resource allocation method and an optimization-based method
    to jointly optimize the allocation of the system resources and improve the overall
    system energy efficiency in a sequential multi-class WPCN setting. Olatinwo and
    Joubert [26] studied the energy efficiency optimization problem in a wireless-powered
    sensor network where all the sensor devices in the network only have the opportunity
    to send their data to only one hybrid access point (HAP). In this case, more energy
    is spent by the IoT devices that are far from the HAP while less energy is used
    to send data by the IoT devices that are close to the HAP. This situation is due
    to the inherent doubly near–far problem in wireless-powered communication networks
    (WPCNs). To deal with this problem, a WPCN was proposed with two HAPs and a dynamic
    resource allocation method to efficiently allocate the HAPs to the network IoT
    devices for their data collection. In addition, unlike the work of Olatinwo and
    Joubert [26], where a meta-heuristic method was used to compute resource allocation
    to the network IoT devices with a near-optimal best effort solution, this study
    considered the application of the Dinkelbach algorithm to compute an optimal solution
    for the IoT devices in the proposed system. Ansere et al. [27] studied the problem
    of resource allocation in a cooperative IoT network for energy efficiency performance
    optimization of the network. In the network in the work of Ansere et al. [27],
    a cooperative relaying communication approach is employed to enable the network
    devices to collectively agree to select a channel (i.e., a relaying link) to send
    their data to a base station device at the destination. The cooperative communication
    process between the devices in the study of Ansere et al. [27] for decision making
    regarding channel selection will technically increase the computational complexity
    of the network in the context of power and time. This often leads to an increased
    energy consumption and low data throughput. The concept of cooperative communication
    in IoT networks is useful for reducing energy consumption due to data communication
    and increases the amount of data that the network can transmit. However, cooperative
    communication networks often experience an increased energy consumption and a
    reduced data throughput under an imperfect channel state. To address the limitations
    in the study of Ansere et al. [27] and also cater for limited power resources
    in a cooperative IoT network, this study introduced the use of a wireless power
    transfer technique to increase the availability of power resources in the network.
    Furthermore, the two HAPs are used to reduce the energy consumption due to data
    communication in a quasi-static environment. In addition, the concept of a sequential
    multi-class WPCN is proposed to optimally and sequentially schedule the operation
    of the network devices in the uplink using a low complexity dynamic resource allocation
    method. Ji et al. [28] studied the problem of resource allocation in wireless-powered
    IoT networks. In their work, a dual-hop communication approach was employed. In
    this case, relay node was used as an intermediate node between a power source
    and the IoT devices. The relay node used the energy received from the power source
    to power the IoT devices as well as collect data from the IoT devices. This can
    lead to network congestion and reduced throughput. Furthermore, in a wireless-powered
    network with one power source, the IoT devices experience unfairness in energy
    harvesting and data transmission. To address the problems associated with the
    use of relay nodes in networks powered by a single transmitter, we considered
    multiple transmitters in this work to improve the energy harvesting. In addition,
    we introduced two HAPs and a dynamic resource allocation method to optimally allocate
    the HAPs to the IoT devices for their data collection. We present a summary of
    the comparison of the proposed work and the existing works in Table 1. Table 1.
    Comparison of the existing works with the proposed work. It is important to emphasize
    that energy efficiency is still a major concern in IoT systems for several reasons,
    including the limited power resources of sensor devices and energy consumption
    due to data communication. Therefore, more research is needed to investigate the
    design of new resource allocation solutions for IoT systems in practical applications.
    Based on this, in contrast to the previous studies discussed above, we propose
    the development of a Dinkelbach algorithm-based method and a dynamic resource
    allocation method to achieve optimal energy efficiency in the proposed NOMA-enabled
    IoT system for water quality monitoring. 3. Proposed Method 3.1. System Architecture
    The proposed architecture of the water quality monitoring system is illustrated
    in Figure 1. It consists of a set of water quality sensors, HAPs, and an edge
    computing node. To provide readers with more insights into the project, Table
    2 shows a list of requirements for the system architecture. The water quality
    sensors are deployed at a water site to capture the water quality parameters of
    the relevant water body. Some of the important parameters for drinking water include
    pH, E. coli, and dissolved oxygen [29,30,31,32]. Due to the power-constrained
    nature of water quality sensors in IoT systems, HAPs are employed to power sensor
    devices and collect water data from sensor devices. The edge computing node is
    introduced to increase the computational capacity of the system for local water
    data processing. This is motivated by the limited computational resources of sensor
    devices and the gap in conventional water quality monitoring systems. For example,
    in most water quality monitoring systems, water data are often forwarded to remote
    stations where data processing, analysis, and prediction take place. By sending
    water data to distant remote water stations, real-time monitoring of any possible
    changes in water parameters may be impractical. To address this gap, we combined
    edge computing with the proposed water quality monitoring system to enable real-time
    water quality monitoring. Figure 1. Proposed architecture for water quality monitoring
    system. Table 2. Project Requirements. 3.2. System Model This study considers
    a multi-class communication system that classifies the system sensor devices into
    two different classes, 𝒜 and ℬ , according to the channel gains among the sensor
    devices and the data collecting HAPs. To minimize the transmission power used
    by the sensor devices to transfer their individual data to the available HAPs,
    the proposed system exploits the channel gain differences among the sensor devices
    and the available HAPs in the system to classify them into K sensor devices ∈
    𝑚={ 𝑚 1 , 𝑚 2 ,…, 𝑚 𝐾 } and L sensor devices ∈ 𝑛={ 𝑛 1 , 𝑛 2 ,…, 𝑛 𝐿 } . In the
    system, there are I dedicated power sources, represented as 𝑠={ 𝑠 1 , 𝑠 2 ,…,
    𝑠 𝐼 } . These power sources are used to transfer power to K sensor devices in
    class A as well as the L sensor devices in class B. Among the I power sources,
    two of them ( 𝑠 1 and 𝑠 2 ) serve as the HAPs. Hence, both 𝑠 1 and 𝑠 2 ∈ s can
    transfer power to the sensor devices and can also collect data from the sensor
    devices. Each class of the network transfers its data to two HAPs to achieve a
    good channel gain among the sensor devices and the HAPs. We assume that the proposed
    multi-class communication system is a heterogeneous system such that the sensor
    devices are ordinary water quality sensor devices and HAPs 𝑠 1 and 𝑠 2 are edge
    computing-enabled and can perform edge computing tasks [23,24]. This circumvents
    the potential extra computational overhead and energy consumption that edge computing
    may introduce for sensor devices owing to complex tasks relating to data collection,
    processing, analysis, and decision making. The proposed multi-class communication
    system works as a wireless-powered communication network (WPCN). Hence, the wireless
    energy harvesting (WEH) phase and the wireless information transmission (WIT)
    phase of the system operates within a timeslot defined by 𝜏(𝑠) based on the proposed
    communication protocol presented in Figure 2. Consequently, the durations of the
    WEH and WIT phases are defined as 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 (𝑠) and 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 (𝑠) , respectively. Hence,
    the system operates within the duration of 𝜏= 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 (𝑠)+ 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 (𝑠) . Figure 2.
    Proposed NOMA-based communication protocol. In each timeslot, both classes 𝒜 and
    ℬ harvest power from all the available I power sources within the duration of
    𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 (𝑠) , whereas only one of the classes is enabled to perform data transmission
    to the allocated set of HAPs within the duration of 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 (𝑠) . For example, if
    class 𝒜 is enabled for data transmission to the HAPs in timeslot 𝜏 then class
    ℬ is sequentially enabled for data transmission to the HAPs in the next timeslot,
    𝜏+1 . Since it is not a must for all the sensor devices to perform data transmission
    in the WIT phase concurrently in each timeslot, the concept of sequential data
    transmission scheduling is considered in this work to optimize the use of power
    resources by the overall system. The K and L sensor devices are strategically
    deployed across the water body in a random manner to optimally capture the key
    water parameters, as shown in Figure 1. In addition, dedicated I power sources,
    including the HAPs { 𝑠 𝑖 } 2 𝑖=1 , are connected to a controller with global knowledge
    of the resources in the proposed system. It is aware of a scheduler designed to
    enable either class 𝒜 or ℬ in a sequential manner for data transmission to HAPs
    𝑠 1 and 𝑠 2 in each timeslot, 𝜏 . It is important to emphasize that, at each timeslot,
    the controller update its information about the K sensor devices in class A, L
    sensor devices in class B, and I power sources for the purpose of synchronization.
    The sensor devices draw energy from separate batteries for updating their energy
    status information with the controller. Table 3 contains some of key acronyms
    used in this work. Table 3. List of acronyms. 4. Mathematical Model The communication
    channel gains among the K sensor devices and the HAPs, 𝑠 1 and 𝑠 2 , as well as
    the L sensor devices and the HAPs, follow a quasi-static fading model. Therefore,
    the communication channel gain from the I power sources to the K sensor devices
    and the L sensor devices in the WEH phase are 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 and 𝑐 𝑖,𝑙 . In addition, the
    reversed communication channel gain from the K sensor devices to the HAPs is 𝑑
    𝑘,𝑖 , while the communication channel gain from the L sensor devices to the HAPs
    is 𝑑 𝑙,𝑖 . As a result of the reciprocity of DL and UL communication channel gains
    for the class 𝒜 network, 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 = 𝑑 𝑘,𝑖 = 10 −1 × 𝑑 −𝛼 𝑘,𝑖 . Furthermore, the reciprocity
    of the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication channel gains for the class
    ℬ network is 𝑐 𝑖,𝑙 = 𝑑 𝑙,𝑖 = 10 −1 × 𝑑 −𝛼 𝑙,𝑖 . In both cases, 𝛼 is the pathloss
    exponent. During the WEH phase, using the proposed NOMA protocol, the K sensor
    devices and the L sensor devices harvest energy within the duration of 0≤ 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻
    ≤1 . The energy harvested by the K sensor devices and the L sensor devices are
    𝑒 𝜏 𝑘·ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝐽) and 𝑒 𝜏 𝑙·ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡 (𝐽) , respectively, where: 𝑒 𝜏 𝑘·ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡 =𝜉
    ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 𝑃 𝑖 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + 𝑒 𝜏 𝑘·𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 ,∀𝑘(𝐽) (1) 𝑒 𝜏 𝑙·ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡 =𝜉 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼
    𝑃 𝑖 𝑐 𝑖,𝑙 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + 𝑒 𝜏 𝑙·𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 ,∀𝑙(𝐽) (2) where 𝑃 𝑖 (𝑊) is the transmission
    power used by the I power sources to charge the K sensor devices, while 𝑒 𝜏 𝑘·ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡
    and 𝑒 𝜏 𝑙·ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡 are the available energy in the K and L sensor devices’ in-built
    batteries from the previous timeslot. Each k sensor device and l sensor device
    used the energy 𝑒 𝜏 𝑘·𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡 (𝐽) and 𝑒 𝜏 𝑙·𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡 (𝐽) to transfer their respective
    data to HAPs 𝑠 1 and 𝑠 2 , respectively, in the WIT phase. Consequently, the available
    energy, 𝑒 𝜏 𝑘·𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 and 𝑒 𝜏 𝑙·𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 , for the next timeslot, 𝜏+1 , is
    computed based on (3) and (4): 𝑒 (𝜏+1) 𝑘·𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 = 𝑒 𝜏 𝑘·ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡 − 𝑒 𝜏 𝑘·𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡
    (3) 𝑒 (𝜏+1) 𝑙·𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 = 𝑒 𝜏 𝑙·ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡 − 𝑒 𝜏 𝑙·𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡 (4) The transmission
    power used by each k sensor device to transfer its data to HAPs 𝑠 1 and 𝑠 2 is
    defined as 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 (𝑊) , while 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 (𝑊) is the transmission power used by each
    l sensor device to transmit its data to the HAPs. During the WIT phase, using
    the NOMA protocol, the K sensor devices and L sensor devices transmit their individual
    data at a scheduled timeslot, 𝜏 , to their dynamically allocated HAPs, { 𝑠 𝑖 }
    2 𝑖=1 , within the duration of 0≤ 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 ≤1 . Because of the simultaneous data
    transmission of the K sensor devices and the L sensor devices at a scheduled timeslot
    to the HAPs, a successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique is applied
    at the HAPs to enable a sequential decoding of the concurrently transmitted data
    of the K sensor devices as well as the L sensor devices in each timeslot by first
    decoding the signal of the highest channel gain sensor device at the corresponding
    HAP i [26,33]. By applying the Shannon theory, the amount of data that each k
    sensor device can transmit per second to a HAP i in the WIT phase is computed
    in (5) as: 𝑅 𝑘,𝑖 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝑖∈𝑠 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 𝐵𝑙𝑜 𝑔 2 (1+ 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 𝑑 𝑘,𝑖 ∑ 𝑘 ′ ≥𝑘+1
    𝑃 𝑘 ′ ,𝑖 𝑑 𝑘 ′ ,𝑖 + 𝜎 2 ) ∀𝑘∈{ 𝑚 1 , 𝑚 2 ,…, 𝑚 𝐾 } (5) where B denotes the system’s
    bandwidth in Hz, 𝑑 𝑘,𝑖 denotes the UL communication channel from the K sensor
    devices to the HAPs, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 (𝑊) represents the transmission power consumed by each
    k sensor device to send its data to a HAP i, and 𝜎 2 is the additive white Gaussian
    noise (AWGN) power. The resource allocation vectors for the time resources and
    the transmission power resources for the K sensor devices are formulated as 𝜏=
    [ 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 ] 𝑇 and 𝑃 𝐴 = [ 𝑃 1,1 , 𝑃 2,1 , 𝑃 3,1 ,…, 𝑃 𝐾,1 , 𝑃 1,2 , 𝑃 2,2
    , 𝑃 3,2 ,…, 𝑃 𝐾,2 ] 𝑇 , respectively. A minimum quality of service (QoS) constraint
    is set for each sensor device k in (6) to satisfy the minimum amount of data of
    the K sensor devices in order to achieve a reliable data transmission. 𝑅 𝑘,𝑖 (𝜏,
    𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )≥ 𝑟 𝑘,𝑖 ,∀𝑘 (6) The total amount of data that all the K sensor devices
    can transmit is computed in (7) from (5) as: 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 ∑ 𝑖∈𝑠
    𝑅 𝑘,𝑖 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ),∀𝑘 (7) Furthermore, the amount of data that each l device can
    transmit per second to a HAP i during the WIT phase is formulated in (8) as: 𝑅
    𝑙,𝑖 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝑖∈𝑠 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 𝐵𝑙𝑜 𝑔 2 (1+ 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 𝑑 𝑙,𝑖 ∑ 𝑙 ′ ≥𝑙+1 𝑃 𝑙 ′ ,𝑖 𝑑 𝑙
    ′ ,𝑖 + 𝜎 2 ) ∀𝑙∈{ 𝑛 1 , 𝑛 2 ,…, 𝑛 𝐿 } (8) The resource allocation vectors for
    the time resources and the transmission power resources for the L sensor devices
    are 𝜏= [ 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 ] 𝑇 and 𝑃 𝐵 =[ 𝑃 1,1 , 𝑃 2,1 , 𝑃 3,1 ,…, 𝑃 𝐿,1 , 𝑃 1,2
    , 𝑃 2,2 , 𝑃 3,2 ,…, 𝑃 𝐿,2 ] 𝑇 , respectively. Additionally, the minimum QoS rate
    constraint for the L sensor devices is formulated in (9) as: 𝑅 𝑙,𝑖 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 )≥
    𝑟 𝑙,𝑖 ,∀𝑖 (9) The total amount of data that all the L sensor devices can transmit
    is calculated in (10) as: 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑙=1 𝐿 ∑ 𝑖∈𝑠 𝑅 𝑙,𝑖 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ),∀𝑙
    (10) During the WEH phase, the energy consumed by the K devices and L devices
    are computed in (11) and (12) [26] as: 𝑒 𝐾,𝑊𝐸𝐻 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , 𝑃 𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 ( 𝑃 𝑖
    + 𝑃 𝑐 − ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝜉( 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 𝑃 𝑖 )) 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 ,∀𝑘 (11) where 𝑃 𝑐 is the circuit power
    consumption for the transmission power and hardware. 𝑒 𝐿,𝑊𝐸𝐻 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , 𝑃 𝑖 ) =
    ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 ( 𝑃 𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑐 − ∑ 𝑙=1 𝐿 𝜉( 𝑐 𝑖,𝑙 𝑃 𝑖 )) 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 ,∀𝑙 (12) By combining (11)
    and (12), the total energy consumed by both K devices and L devices during the
    WEH phase is formulated in (13) as: 𝑒 𝐾,𝐿 𝑊𝐸𝐻 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , 𝑃 𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 ( 𝑃 𝑖
    + 𝑃 𝑐 − ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝜉( 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 𝑃 𝑖 )+ ∑ 𝑙=1 𝐿 𝜉( 𝑐 𝑖,𝑙 𝑃 𝑖 )) 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 (13) During the
    WIT phase, the energy consumed by the K devices and L devices to transmit their
    individual data to an allocated HAP i at a scheduled period is formulated in (14)
    and (15) as: 𝑒 𝐾·𝑊𝐼𝑇 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 ( 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑘,𝑐 ) 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 (14) where
    𝑃 𝑘,𝑐 is the circuit power consumption for the k device. 𝑒 𝐿·𝑊𝐼𝑇 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖
    )= ∑ 𝑙=1 𝐿 ( 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑙,𝑐 ) 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 (15) where 𝑃 𝑙,𝑐 is the circuit power consumption
    for the l device. Based on the derived equations, the total energy consumed by
    the class 𝒜 devices at a timeslot, 𝜏 , and the total energy consumed by the class
    ℬ devices at the next time timeslot, 𝜏+1 , can now be formulated in (16)–(19).
    𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝑒 𝐾,𝐿 𝑊𝐸𝐻 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , 𝑃 𝑖 )+ 𝑒 𝐾·𝑊𝐼𝑇 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ) (16) 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
    ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 ( 𝑃 𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑐 − ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝜉( 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 𝑃𝑖)+
    ∑ 𝑙=1 𝐿 𝜉( 𝑐 𝑖,𝑙 𝑃 𝑖 )) 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 ( 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑘,𝑐 ) 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 (17) 𝑒 𝐿·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
    = 𝑒 𝐾,𝐿 𝑊𝐸𝐻 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , 𝑃 𝑖 )+ 𝑒 𝐿·𝑊𝐼𝑇 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ) (18) 𝑒 𝐿·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻
    , 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 ( 𝑃 𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑐 − ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 𝜉( 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 𝑃𝑖)+ ∑ 𝑙=1 𝐿
    𝜉( 𝑐 𝑖,𝑙 𝑃 𝑖 )) 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + ∑ 𝑙=1 𝐿 ( 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑙,𝑐 ) 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 (19) According to [34],
    the system energy efficiency (EE) is the ratio of the received sum-data and the
    total power consumption. Due to the scheduling of the K devices in class 𝒜 and
    the L devices in class ℬ during the WIT phase, problems (17) and (19) are solved
    independently at timeslot 𝜏 and the next timeslot, 𝜏+1 . Therefore, the system
    EE configured with K sequential devices in class 𝒜 at timeslot 𝜏 is formulated
    as an optimization problem in (20), and the time allocation, 𝜏 , the power source
    power allocation, 𝑃 1 , as well as each k device power allocation, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 , are
    jointly optimized. The system EE optimization problem is: 𝑃1: 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖
    𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ) 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙(𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ) (20) s.t.: 𝐶1: 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 ≤1
    (21) 𝐶2:0≤ 𝑃 𝑖 ≤ 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑖 (22) 𝐶3:0≤ 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ≤ 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑘,𝑖 (23) 𝐶4:( 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑘,𝑐
    ) 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 ≤𝜉 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 𝑃 𝑖 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 𝑒 (𝜏) 𝑘.𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 (24) 𝐶5: 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 ≥0,∀𝑖∪∀𝑘 (25)
    𝐶6: 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 ≥0,∀𝑘∪ { 𝑠 𝑖 } 2 𝑖=1 (26) where 𝐶1 is the time resource allocation constraint,
    𝐶2 is the transmission power constraint for the power sources, 𝐶3 represents the
    limit on the sensor device k transmission power, the 𝐶4 constraint ensures that
    the power cost for sensor device k data transmission should not exceed its total
    power, and 𝐶5 and 𝐶6 are non-negative constraints for the decision variables.
    In (20), 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 and 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 are replaced with 𝜏 in subsequent problems involving
    𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 and 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 since 𝜏= 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 . The system EE configured with L sequential
    devices in class ℬ at the next timeslot, 𝜏+1 , is formulated in (27), and the
    time allocation, 𝜏 , the power source power allocation, 𝑃 𝑖 , as well as the power
    allocation, 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 , of each l device are jointly optimized. The system EE optimization
    problem is written as: 𝑃1: 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ) 𝑒 𝐿·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙(𝜏,
    𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ) (27) s.t.: C1, C2 𝐶7:0≤ 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ≤ 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑙,𝑖 (28) 𝐶8:( 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑙,𝑐
    ) 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 ≤𝜉 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 𝑃 𝑖 𝑐 𝑖,𝑙 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 𝑒 (𝜏) 𝑙.𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 (29) 𝐶9: 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 ≥0,∀𝑖∪∀𝑙 (30)
    𝐶10: 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 ≥0,∀𝑙∪ { 𝑠 𝑖 } 2 𝑖=1 (31) 4.1. Transformation of the Objective Function
    The optimization problems in (20) and (27) are non-linear fractional optimization
    problems. Such optimization problems cannot be easily solved directly and it is
    difficult to obtain optimal solutions to such problems. To deal with this problem,
    we applied the Dinkelbach method  [35] to transform the non-linear fractional
    optimization problems into a subtraction form that can be easily solved. To apply
    the Dinkelbach method, we introduced parameters q and r to compute the optimal
    solution for the system EE in (20) and (27). Let 𝑞 ∗ represents the system EE
    for the optimization problem in (20), which is formulated in (32) as: 𝑞 ∗ = 𝑚𝑎𝑥
    𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ) 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙(𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ) = 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ( 𝜏 ∗
    , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑘,𝑖 ) 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙( 𝜏 ∗ , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑖 , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑘,𝑖 ) (32) From (32), the maximum system
    EE 𝑞 ∗ can now be easily obtained  [36] when 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜏 , 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃
    𝑘,𝑖 )− 𝑞 ∗ · 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )= 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ( 𝜏 ∗ , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑘,𝑖 )− 𝑞 ∗ · 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
    ( 𝜏 ∗ , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑖 , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑘,𝑖 )=0 . By applying the parameter q to the system EE optimization
    problem in (20), problem 𝑃1 was transformed as a new objective function in (33)
    as: 𝑃3: 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )−𝑞· 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )
    (33) s.t.: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 Let 𝑟 ∗ represents the system EE for problem
    P2 in (27), which is formulated in (34) as: 𝑟 ∗ = 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏,
    𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ) 𝑒 𝐿·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙(𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 ) = 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ( 𝜏 ∗ , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑙,𝑖 ) 𝑒 𝐿·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙( 𝜏 ∗
    , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑖 , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑙,𝑖 ) (34) From (34), the maximum system EE 𝑟 ∗ can now be easily
    obtained when 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜏 , 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 )− 𝑟 ∗ · 𝑒 𝐿·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖
    , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 )= 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ( 𝜏 ∗ , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑙,𝑖 )− 𝑟 ∗ · 𝑒 𝐿·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ( 𝜏 ∗ , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑖 , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑙,𝑖
    )=0 . Following this, the parameter r can now be applied to optimization problem
    P2 in (28) to transform it to a new objective function in (35) as: 𝑃4: 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜏,
    𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )−𝑞· 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 ) (35) s.t.: C1,
    C2, C7, C8, C9, and C10 The convergence of the transformed subtraction function
    has been proved in  [36], and this can be easily applied to problems (𝑃3) and
    (𝑃4) . Hence, the proof is omitted in this paper. To achieve an optimal EE for
    the proposed WPCN system, we solved problems (33) and (35) in each iteration using
    an iteration algorithm. 4.2. Optimal Solution The objective functions in problems
    (33) and (35) are convex optimizations with respect to variables 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖
    and variables 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 , respectively. Hence, we proposed and applied a
    Lagrangian method and a Dinkelbach iterative algorithm. The Lagrangian function
    of the optimization problem in (33) is given in (36) as: 𝐿(𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 , 𝜇
    1 , 𝜇 2 , 𝜇 3 , 𝜇 4 ) = 𝑅 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )− 𝑞· 𝑒 𝐾·𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 )+ 𝜇
    1 ( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 −1)+ 𝜇 2 ( 𝑃 𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑚 𝑖 𝑎𝑥)+ 𝜇 3 ( 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑚 𝑘,𝑖 𝑎𝑥)+ 𝜇 4 ((
    𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑘,𝑐 ) 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 − 𝜉 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝐼 𝑃 𝑖 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + 𝑒 (𝜏) 𝑘.𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 ) (36) where
    𝜏=( 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 ,𝜏𝑊𝐼𝑇) defines the duration for the WEH phase and the duration for the
    WIT phase and 𝜇=( 𝜇 1 , 𝜇 2 , 𝜇 3 , 𝜇 4 ) represents the Lagrangian multipliers
    for the constraints. The dual optimization problem for the transformed optimization
    problem in (33) is provided in (37) as: 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 , 𝜇 1 , 𝜇 2 , 𝜇 3 ,
    𝜇 4 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐿(𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 , 𝜇 1 , 𝜇 2 , 𝜇 3 , 𝜇 4 ) (37) s.t.: 𝜇 1 , 𝜇 2 , 𝜇 3 ,
    𝜇 4 ≥0 Based on the zero-duality-gap condition, the optimal solution of the dual
    variables (or multipliers) 𝜇 ∗ 1 , 𝜇 ∗ 2 , 𝜇 ∗ 3 , 𝜇 ∗ 4 will achieve the maximum
    EE of the problem in (33). This is computed by using an iteration algorithm to
    solve (37). For each iteration, the dual optimization problem in (37) is solved
    using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions  [37] based on the initial variables
    𝜇 1 , 𝜇 2 , 𝜇 3 , 𝜇 4 , and by equating the Lagrangian partial derivative to zero
    to obtain optimal resource allocation solutions for 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 . The iteration
    process is provided as follows: Δ 𝜇 1 = 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 −1 Δ 𝜇 2 = 𝑃 𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑖
    Δ 𝜇 3 = 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑘,𝑖 Δ 𝜇 4 =( 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 + 𝑃 𝑘,𝑐 ) 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 −𝜉 ∑ 𝐼 𝑖=1 𝑃 𝑖 𝑐 𝑖,𝑘
    𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 + 𝑒 (𝜏) 𝑘.𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  The initial Lagrangian multipliers are updated iteratively
    by 𝜇 (𝑡+1) =( 𝜇 (𝑡) + 𝛽 (𝑡) Δ𝜇) to obtain a new set of multipliers. This process
    is repeated until the optimal multipliers are obtained when the proposed iteration
    algorithm saturates to convergence. Note that Δ𝜇=(Δ 𝜇 1 ,Δ 𝜇 2 ,Δ 𝜇 3 ,Δ 𝜇 4 )
    , 𝛽 (𝑡) is used to denote the step size of the iteration and T is used to denote
    the number of iterations. For a given 𝜇 , the process of computing optimal energy
    transfer time allocation; data transfer time allocation; and k device transmit
    power allocation, i.e., 𝜏 ∗ , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑖 , and 𝑃 ∗ 𝑘,𝑖 , is obtained through the KKT
    conditions by equating the Lagrangian partial derivative to derivatives to zero
    as follows: By equating ∂𝐿 ∂ 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 , ∂𝐿 ∂ 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 , ∂𝐿 ∂ 𝑃 𝑖 , and ∂𝐿 ∂ 𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 to

    ) (46) where 𝜆=( 𝜆 1 , 𝜆 2 , 𝜆 3 , 𝜆 4 ) denotes the Lagrangian multipliers for
    the constraints. The dual optimization problem for the transformed optimization
    problem in (35) is provided in (47) as: 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝜏, 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 , 𝜆 1 , 𝜆 2 , 𝜆 3 ,

    dual variables or multipliers 𝜆 ∗ 1 , 𝜆 ∗ 2 , 𝜆 ∗ 3 , 𝜆 ∗ 4 will achieve the maximum
    EE of the problem in (35). This is computed by the proposed iteration algorithm
    to solve (47). In each iteration, the formulated dual optimization problem in
    (47) is solved by applying the KKT conditions  [37] according to the given initial
    multipliers 𝜆 1 , 𝜆 2 , 𝜆 3 , 𝜆 4 , and by equating the Lagrangian partial derivative

    updated iteratively by 𝜆 (𝑡+1) =( 𝜆 (𝑡) + 𝛾 (𝑡) Δ𝜆) to obtain a new set of multipliers.
    This process is repeated until the optimal multipliers are realized when the proposed
    iteration algorithm reaches a point of saturation. Note that Δ𝜆=(Δ 𝜆 1 ,Δ 𝜆 2
    ,Δ 𝜆 3 ,Δ 𝜆 4 ) , and 𝛾 (𝑡) is used to denote the step size of the iteration.
    The process of computing optimal energy transfer time allocation; data transfer
    time allocation; and l device transmit power allocation, i.e., 𝜏 ∗ , 𝑃 ∗ 𝑖 , and
    𝑃 ∗ 𝑙,𝑖 , is obtained by equating the Lagrangian partial derivative to zero, as

    problems in (33) and (35) is presented in Algorithm 1. To obtain optimal power
    and time resource allocations in each cycle of the proposed system, a Dinkelbach-based
    iteration algorithm is proposed and presented in Algorithm 2. 4.3. Dynamic HAP
    Resource Allocation Algorithm This section presents the resource allocation algorithm
    (i.e., Algorithm 3) employed by the proposed system for allocating HAP resources.
    During the WIT phase, the HAPs are dynamically allocated to the K and L devices
    for data collection during a scheduled period to manage the energy consumption
    of the devices. This is achieved by exploiting the channel gain differences between
    the devices and the HAPs. This concept helps improve the communication channel
    quality of devices with a power channel gain to reduce the power used by the devices
    to report their individual data to the HAPs. Algorithm 3 HAP allocation in the
    WIT Phase Require:  { 𝑚 1 , 𝑚 2 ,…, 𝑚 𝐾 }𝐼𝑜𝑇𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠 , { 𝑛 1 , 𝑛 2 ,…, 𝑛 𝐿 }𝐼𝑜𝑇𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠,𝑎𝑛𝑑

    Results and Discussions In this section, the performance of the proposed system
    is evaluated based on the baseline method in [26]. Consequently, the same simulation
    parameters as in [26] were also assumed in this study for comparison and validation
    purposes. The simulation parameters used in the experiments are presented in Table
    4. Table 4. Simulation Parameters. The proposed system comprises two sequential
    groups of class 𝒜 and ℬ networks. The class 𝒜 network is configured with a set
    of K water quality sensor devices, whereas the ℬ network is configured with L
    water quality sensor devices. These devices are deployed within the communication
    coverage of the power sources and data collection devices, as shown in Figure
    3. Figure 3. Network deployment. 5.1. Performance Comparison of Different Methods
    In this section, the proposed method is simulated and compared with a baseline
    method [26] to evaluate its performance. Similar to the baseline method [26],
    we consider a WPCN system with five sensor devices, six sensor devices, and three
    power sources. Consequently, two configurations were considered in the experiments.
    The first configuration included 𝐾=3 , 𝐿=2 , and 𝐼=3 . The second configuration
    included 𝐾=4 , 𝐿=2 , and 𝐼=3 . Two I devices were enabled to transfer power and
    collect water data from the devices. In both configurations 1 and 2, the K and
    L devices were enabled to concurrently perform energy harvesting within the period
    of 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 using the proposed NOMA protocol. Using the proposed sequential strategy,
    only the class 𝒜 network with A devices was enabled to perform water data transmission
    to the allocated HAPs within the period of 𝜏 𝑊𝐼𝑇 since the water data of the K
    devices are more critical than those of the L devices. The proposed algorithm
    was enabled to simulate the proposed method, and it was disabled for the baseline
    method. The proposed method was simulated over a different number of runs (or
    iterations). In each run, the performance of the proposed method was compared
    with the baseline method, and the outcome of each iteration is presented in Figure
    4. Figure 4. Performance comparison of the proposed method. From Figure 4, it
    can be deduced that both the proposed method and the existing method converged
    well to an optimal saturation point at approximately 80 runs. However, the performance
    of the proposed system for the two configurations considered validates that the
    proposed system is more energy-efficient than the baseline method. The proposed
    method outperformed the baseline method by approximately 12.65% and 16.49% for
    configurations 1 and 2, respectively. The efficiency of the proposed method can
    be attributed to the computation of the optimal resource allocation for network
    devices using the proposed resource allocation algorithm. 5.2. Impact of Noise
    Power on Energy Efficiency In this section, we investigate the effect of noise
    power on the performance of the proposed method. For this experiment, we considered
    a WPCN system with 𝐾=3 devices in the class 𝒜 network, 𝐿=2 devices in the class
    ℬ network, and 𝐼=3 . The two classes of networks perform energy harvesting during
    the 𝜏 𝑊𝐸𝐻 period. The class 𝒜 devices are first enabled to perform data transmission
    in the current cycle and the ℬ devices are scheduled to perform data transmission
    in the next cycle. The value of the system noise power was varied from −90 dBm
    to −110 dBm over a different number of iterations, and the energy efficiency performance
    of the system is presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6 for the two classes. Figure
    5. Impact of noise power on energy efficiency for class A device during the first
    phase of UL data transmission. Figure 6. Impact of noise power on energy efficiency
    for class B device during the next phase of UL data transmission. During the first
    cycle of the system, where the 𝒜 devices transferred their data to the two HAPs
    in the system, as the noise power was varied from −90 dBm to −110 dBm, the energy
    efficiency of the system increased for a small value of noise power, while the
    energy efficiency decreased for a large value of noise power, as shown in Figure
    5. During the next cycle of the system, where the ℬ devices performed data transmission
    at the UL, the same effect during the first cycle of the system was also observed.
    The increase in the energy efficiency effect caused by a small value of noise
    power can be attributed to the increased data rate with low power consumption
    and low noise power. 5.3. Effect of the Number of Power Sources on Energy Efficiency
    In this section, different numbers of power sources were used in the experiments
    to investigate the effect of the number of power sources on the energy efficiency
    of the proposed system. The proposed system was configured with 𝐾=3 , 𝐿=2 , 𝜎
    2 =−90 dBm, 𝜎 2 =−100 dBm, and 𝜎 2 =−110 dBm, and the number of power sources
    was varied from one to five. From the results in Figure 7, it was observed that
    increasing the number of power sources resulted in increased energy efficiency
    of the system for both class 𝒜 and class ℬ devices. However, the class ℬ devices
    achieved a higher energy efficiency than the class 𝒜 devices. The class ℬ devices
    achieved an increased energy efficiency because they had less data to transmit
    compared to the 𝒜 devices. Hence, the class ℬ devices spent less power on data
    transmission and were able to increase energy efficiency. Figure 7. Impact of
    number of power sources on energy efficiency. 5.4. Impact of Sensor Device Transmit
    Power on Energy Efficiency In this section, we study the impact of different values
    of the sensor device transmission power on the energy of the proposed system.
    We consider 𝐾=3 , 𝐿=2 , 𝐼=3 , 𝜎 2 =−90 dBm, 𝜎 2 =−100 dBm, and 𝜎 2 =−110 dBm for
    𝑃 𝑘,𝑖 = 𝑃 𝑙,𝑖 = 0.1 W, 0.2 W, 0.3 W, 0.4 W. The experimental results are shown
    in Figure 8. As shown in Figure 8, as the transmission power of the sensor devices
    in class 𝒜 and class ℬ was varied from 0.1 W to 0.4 W, there was a slight decrease
    in the energy efficiency of the system. This was a result of the trade-off effect
    between the total energy consumption and total throughput. When the transmission
    power of the sensor devices was increased, more data were supported by the system,
    and the energy consumption of the sensor devices increased. Consequently, the
    system energy efficiency decreased slightly. Figure 8. Impact of sensor device
    transmit power on energy efficiency. 5.5. Impact of QoS Data Requirements on the
    System EE In this section, different values of the minimum QoS throughput requirements
    are investigated for the performance of the proposed system. In this experiment,
    two configurations were considered. The first system configuration included 𝐾=3
    , 𝐿=2 , 𝐼=3 , 𝜎 2 =−90 dBm, 𝜎 2 =−100 dBm, and 𝜎 2 =−110 dBm. The second system
    configuration contains 𝐾=3 , 𝐿=2 , 𝐼=4 , 𝜎 2 =−90 dBm, 𝜎 2 =−100 dBm, and 𝜎 2
    =−110 dBm The minimum QoS throughput requirement of the devices varied from 1000
    bits to 5000 bits for the two system configurations. The experimental results
    for the two configurations are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10. Figure 9. Impact
    of minimum QoS throughput on energy efficiency for the first configuration. Figure
    10. Impact of minimum QoS throughput on energy efficiency for the second configuration.
    6. Conclusions IoT-enabled water quality monitoring systems are becoming increasingly
    popular due to their benefits over laboratory-based systems. However, these systems
    are resource-constrained, with limited power, computational, and bandwidth resources.
    As a result, they have drawn the attention of academics and practitioners to improve
    their performance. In this study, we introduced a multi-class communication strategy
    to classify the water quality sensor devices in the system. We designed a NOMA-based
    communication protocol to schedule and optimize the operation of the water quality
    sensor devices for energy harvesting and information transfer. We proposed a new
    resource allocation method to compute optimal power and time resource allocation
    for the devices. We also introduced a dynamic resource allocation method for hybrid
    access point (HAP) resource allocation for efficient data collection. Furthermore,
    we introduced edge computing into the water quality monitoring system proposed
    in this work to extend the traditional architecture based on cloud computing.
    This helps to improve the computational capacity of the system and enables local
    processing of water data at the water site to guarantee real-time water quality
    monitoring. Our proposed method outperformed an existing comparable baseline method
    by approximately 12.65% and 16.49% for two different configurations, demonstrating
    its effectiveness in improving the energy efficiency of a water quality monitoring
    system. In future studies, more research is required to explore ways to improve
    the energy efficiency of the wireless-powered water quality sensor devices used
    in water quality monitoring systems. Author Contributions Conceptualization, S.O.O.

  description: The escalating global water usage and the increasing strain on major
    cities due to water shortages highlights the critical need for efficient water
    management practices. In water-stressed regions worldwide, significant water wastage
    is primarily attributed to leakages, inefficient use, and aging infrastructure.
    Undetected water leakages in buildings’ pipelines contribute to the water waste
    problem. To address this issue, an effective water leak detection method is required.
    In this paper, we explore the application of edge computing in smart buildings
    to enhance water management. By integrating sensors and embedded Machine Learning
    models, known as TinyML, smart water management systems can collect real-time
    data, analyze it, and make accurate decisions for efficient water utilization.
    The transition to TinyML enables faster and more cost-effective local decision-making,
    reducing the dependence on centralized entities. In this work, we propose a solution
    that can be adapted for effective leakage detection in real-world scenarios with
    minimum human intervention using TinyML. We follow an approach that is similar
    to a typical machine learning lifecycle in production, spanning stages including
    data collection, training, hyperparameter tuning, offline evaluation and model
    optimization for on-device resource efficiency before deployment. In this work,
    we considered an existing water leakage acoustic dataset for polyvinyl chloride
    pipelines. To prepare the acoustic data for analysis, we performed preprocessing
    to transform it into scalograms. We devised a water leak detection method by applying
    transfer learning to five distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) variants,
    which are namely EfficientNet, ResNet, AlexNet, MobileNet V1, and MobileNet V2.
    The CNN models were found to be able to detect leakages where a maximum testing
    accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score of 97.45%, 98.57%, 96.70%, and 97.63%,
    respectively, were observed using the EfficientNet model. To enable seamless deployment
    on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE edge device, the EfficientNet model is compressed using
    quantization resulting in a low inference time of 1932 ms, a peak RAM usage of
    255.3 kilobytes, and a flash usage requirement of merely 48.7 kilobytes.

    1. Introduction The presence of water is the distinguishing factor that allows
    Earth to harbor life. Recent studies show that global water usage is predicted
    to surge by 55% and almost a quarter of major cities worldwide are already grappling
    with some degree of water strain [1]. A lack of safe drinking water is one of
    the consequences of water shortages. Nearly 2.2 billion individuals globally are
    struggling to drink safe water [1]. In an attempt to deal with the alarming situation
    of water worldwide, different initiatives have been proposed and deployed. We
    can cite, for example, water restrictions, re-purposing water for non-potable
    use, and awareness campaigns. However, one of the major problems faced by water
    management institutions worldwide is the high amounts of drinkable water that
    are wasted because of leaking pipes in the distribution networks [2]. Water wastage
    is caused by various factors, those that are related to human behavior, and those
    that are linked to the state and the quality of the pipes in distribution networks.
    Indeed, pipe flaws can lead to substantial losses of quality water and wasted
    energy in purification processes [3]. Morocco, representing a typical example
    from the Global South countries struggling with water scarcity, faces significant
    water wastage primarily due to leakages. According to a 2019 report by the World
    Bank, Morocco’s water supply experiences a loss of approximately 40% due to leaks,
    inefficient use and aging infrastructure [4]. This is a significant amount of
    water wastage that highlights the need for more efficient water management practices.
    Water leakages in buildings’ pipelines are a common and costly problem that can
    cause a wide range of issues. Leaks can be caused by a variety of factors such
    as age, wear and tear, corrosion, damage from external factors (temperature and
    humidity), poor installation, or the pipeline’s quality. They can occur in any
    part of the pipeline system, from the main water line to individual fixtures,
    and can result in significant water waste, increased water bills, structural damage,
    mold growth, and other related problems. The early detection and repair of leaks
    is crucial to minimize damage and avoid costly repairs. Among the solutions to
    mitigate water stress is to improve water efficiency by reducing the quantity
    of non-revenue water. To this end, various techniques for leakage detection in
    buildings’ pipelines have been developed, ranging from visual inspection to advanced
    technologies such as cameras, acoustic, pressure, acceleration, and flow sensors.
    In this context, it is critical to identify the most effective and efficient methods
    to detect leaks. In this work, we propose a solution for automatic water leakage
    detection to showcase a form of technical intelligence in smart buildings. The
    objective of intelligent buildings is to operate autonomously, possessing the
    ability to learn, forecast, and adapt without the need for user intervention or
    awareness. Sensors and monitors can rapidly and automatically adjust parameters
    such as room temperatures, lighting, shading, and the consumption of energy and
    water [5]. The application of information and communication technology, specifically
    through sensors and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, enhances the quality of
    life for occupants within these smart buildings, especially in urban settings.
    Smart cities should have buildings with smart water management technology to monitor,
    use and reuse water resources in a more efficient and sustainable way. At the
    heart of smart water management systems, we usually find technologies such as:
    (i) sensors to collect live data, with reporting capabilities to a master system,
    (ii) artificial intelligence and ML models to analyze vast amounts of data and
    identify patterns that would be difficult for human beings to determine easily,
    and (iii) intelligent controllers capable of making some local decision making.
    Despite the improvements brought using traditional IoT systems and the different
    ML techniques, these systems suffer from serious drawbacks. Traditionally, IoT
    systems depended on offloading massive amounts of real-time sensor data to the
    cloud. Data is then processed to make required decisions, and reply to the appropriate
    nodes. However, this configuration faced major challenges, including high communication
    and processing loads as a significant delay which does not serve the needs of
    real time applications. Furthermore, data privacy problems developed when third-party
    companies became engaged in communication, storage, and decision-making processes.
    TinyML has emerged as a viable option to effectively address these challenges
    through the convergence of tiny intelligent devices and ML technologies [6,7].
    TinyML is a specialized subset of edge computing [8,9] which enhances intelligence
    on resource-constrained edge devices, with limited processing power and memory,
    such as sensors and IoT objects. This enables devices to perform AI tasks locally,
    often with very low power consumption, without relying on cloud-based processing.
    As a result, the central entity’s work is drastically decreased or in certain
    circumstances abolished completely, with just periodic updates of metadata information
    required for supervision purposes. This work delves deeper into smart water leak
    detection using TinyML, which would permit the refinement of water utilities by
    detecting leaks and tracking water distribution within a building. Detecting water
    leaks with ML requires the usage of various sorts of data in order to effectively
    detect and locate probable leaks. Several data sources and approaches may be used
    in this process to detect and prevent leaks effectively [10]. Among these, sensors’
    data play a pivotal role. Water distribution systems are equipped with numerous
    sensors that capture real-time data such as water flow rates, pressure levels,
    and vibrations. ML systems can discover abnormalities and trends that indicate
    anomalies by monitoring these metrics. A quick decrease in pressure or an unusual
    rise in flow rate, for instance, might indicate a possible leak. Acoustic data
    is another useful data source [10]. Water leaks frequently make distinct noises
    that may be detected by sophisticated acoustic sensors or even by analyzing audio
    recordings. ML algorithms that have been taught to recognize certain leak-related
    sound patterns can be used to detect leaks automatically. By leveraging these
    diverse data sources and employing ML algorithms, water utilities can improve
    their ability to detect leaks promptly. The aim of our work is to develop TinyML
    models that are capable of detecting water leakage in pipes using acoustic data.
    In this study, we focus on deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNNs). CNNs are employed to detect water leakages by utilizing the sensory
    input of a water distribution network. CNNs analyze the regional similarities
    in sensor inputs, detecting leaks by identifying deviations in sensor readings
    caused by changes in flow, pressure, or vibration. The CNN models effectively
    capture these differences and use them to pinpoint the presence of leaks within
    the water distribution network. We also apply quantization on the different models
    to identify the best performing and efficient model for a low-cost device which
    is Arduino Nano 33 BLE (https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble

    as follows: Section 2 investigates the related work, presenting previous research
    addressing the same issue. In Section 3, we detail the materials and methods deployed
    for conducting our experiments. Section 4 presents the empirical results and discusses
    the outcomes derived from the experiments. Lastly, Section 5 highlights some conclusions
    and directions for future work. 2. Related Works Numerous studies have tackled
    the use of machine learning or deep learning based CNN architectures to discern
    patterns and detect irregularities within water and wastewater pipeline systems.
    For example, Fang et al. [11] present a CNN-based method for identifying numerous
    leakage spots. The CNN model collects important features from past leakage data
    and applies them to real-time data to detect whether there is a leak. A simulated
    water distribution system experimental platform was constructed within the AnhuWe
    Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building and Building Energy Saving. The
    platform spans 200 m2, with pipe sections measuring 400 m in length and featuring
    pipe diameters ranging from 30 cm to 50 cm. A total of 21 water pressure sensors
    were strategically placed throughout the platform. They were able to collect a
    dataset that contains non-leakage data and four types of pipe network pressure
    data under the conditions of single-point leakages, two-point leakages, and three-point
    leakages. The experimental findings show great detection accuracies, with 99.63%,
    98.58%, and 95.25% accuracy attained for one, two, and three leakage spots employing
    21 sensors, respectively. When the number of sensors is reduced to eight, the
    accuracies for one, two, and three leakage points drop to 96.43%, 94.88%, and
    91.56%, respectively. In Kang et al. [12], the authors conducted non-invasive
    measurement of the leakage signals using piezoelectric accelerometers (PCB-393B31).
    These accelerometers possess the ability to objectively measure vibrations and
    translate them into acceleration levels. Furthermore, the authors introduced a
    local search technique based on graphs to locate leaks. Their approach, however,
    was not completely tuned for categorizing 1-D signals. It required feature extraction
    from the recorded signal data prior to applying the classification layers. Furthermore,
    the detection range was determined by the clarity and correlation of acoustic
    signals, and the issue of mistakes caused by signals with low correlation coefficients
    remained unsolved. In a different study by Cody et al. [13], the authors designed
    a water system experimental test bed that is made up of many components, including
    a full-scale hydrant and PVC pipes with bends. These pipes are made of grayscale
    schedule 80 PVC with a 152.4 mm inner diameter, which is extensively used in water
    distribution networks (WDNs) in Canada and the United States. The authors used
    a CNN architecture whose output is sent into a variational autoencoder (VAE),
    which tries to recover the original spectrogram image. The mean squared error
    (MSE) between the original image and its reconstructed counterpart is used to
    calculate the loss function. This proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.2%
    for detecting a 0.25 L/s leak. Shukla et al. [14] conducted a study where a CNN
    model is built using modified layers of the pre-trained AlexNet network [15].
    The purpose of the model is to classify images based on different scenarios using
    a dataset of 9000 scalograms images. This was achieved by considering 25 scenarios,
    with 12 accelerometers per scenario, 10 samples per scenario, and three images
    per sample. The model excels at categorizing images based on their corresponding
    leakage scenarios, accurately identifying healthy configurations as well as various
    leaky situations with a 95% accuracy rate. Moreover, the average recall, precision,
    and F1 score for both validation and testing data are 94% and 95%, respectively.
    The findings of the authors indicate that the CNN model effectively detects true
    positive labels with a high degree of accuracy. Coelho et al. [16] introduced
    an IoT system that has the ability to monitor water distribution systems and accurately
    detect and locate water leaks. The proposed solution uses flow sensors and affordable
    microcontrollers (ESP32) to collect and process real-time data. Five different
    classification algorithms were considered, namely, random forests, decision trees,
    neural networks, support vector machines, and XGBoost. A total of 12 tests were
    performed for each method in order to find the algorithm with the best accuracy
    for implementation of the system. The random forest algorithm consistently achieved
    the highest accuracy across various scenarios, making it the preferred choice
    with an accuracy of nearly 85%. Loukatos et al. [17] presented a system that solves
    the issues of traditional IoT systems. Using embedded ML on a Raspberry Pi Pico
    microcontroller board, the authors trained a neural network to recognize three
    characteristic kinds of water utilization profiles which are Normal Use (NU),
    Water Leak (WL), and Water Waste (WW). The neural network structure has an input
    layer with 200 features (window size), two hidden layers, with the first one to
    have 20 neurons and the second one 10 neurons, and an output layer with three
    classes. Upon evaluating the testing data, the system achieved an accuracy of
    77.8% for the NU category, indicating that it correctly identified Normal Use
    instances. Similarly, it achieved a 100% success rate for both the WW and WL categories,
    accurately identifying Water Waste and Water Leak scenarios. These performance
    results led to an expected accuracy of 98.5% for the final model when tested using
    the quantized (int8) version of the dataset. The investigation of domestic water
    leak detection has also been examined through the analysis of flow data [18].
    This research has focused on training a random forest and a CNN-based model in
    the cloud. The classification problem addressed in this study revolves around
    detecting leak events from non-leak events. They also detect the magnitude of
    leaks categorized as small (≤1 L/h), medium-sized (1 to 10 L/h), or large (≥10
    L/h). The CNN model exhibited the best performance with an accuracy, precision,
    and recall ranging from 92% to 96%. Additionally, the area under the Precision-Recall
    (PR) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves consistently achieved
    high values, ranging between 97% and 99%. A summary of the salient features from
    the literature review is provided by Table 1. Table 1. Related work summary. The
    existing literature in the area of water leakage detection systems reveals a noticeable
    gap in the integration of TinyML methodologies. While prior efforts have been
    dedicated to tackling the water leakage challenge, a significant portion of these
    solutions has not capitalized on the potential benefits of TinyML approaches.
    Furthermore, the few endeavors that do involve TinyML techniques often exhibit
    limitations, particularly in terms of the scope and the considered CNN models.
    We make a contribution by experimenting with state-of-the-art CNN models, such
    as ResNets [19], MobileNet [20] and EfficientNet [21] architectures, for highly
    accurate and efficient water leakage detection. Moreover, a distinctive aspect
    of our work is the attention we devote to the integration of these models into
    small-scale devices using TinyML. This two-fold approach not only broadens the
    spectrum of the considered ML models but also paves the way for the seamless incorporation
    of cutting-edge technology into an efficient real-time operational framework of
    water leakage detection. 3. Materials and Methods In this section, we detail the
    methodologies employed for the acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis of the
    data central to our study. Figure 1 provides a comprehensive visual representation
    of the approach we undertook to achieve this study. The process involves several
    key stages, similar to traditional machine learning projects, with some additional
    considerations for the constrained real-time processing requirements of the embedded
    device. We preprocess the acoustic leakage data and generate scalogram images.
    The different CNN models are trained and optimized. Hyperparameters are tuned
    on the validation set, and we perform evaluation using a separate testing test.
    The chosen model with the best testing metrics is optimized for on-device resource
    efficiency. In our research, we compressed the model using quantization and evaluated
    the model’s performance taking into account the device’s real-time hardware and
    real time constraints. Finally, we generate the C++ packages to be deployed on
    the device. The development lifecycle was conducted on Edge Impulse (https://edgeimpulse.com/
    (accessed on 15 March 2023)), which is a platform that facilitates training models,
    tuning hyperparameters, as well as optimizing the models to run on any edge device.
    Figure 1. The systematic approach undertaken to achieve this study. 3.1. Data
    Acquisition and Preprocessing In this work, we use an existing dataset curated
    by Shukla et al. [14], collected using a small-scale experimental setup, that
    was built in the Clemson University campus (US), to collect data on pipeline vibrations.
    This system made use of accelerometers positioned at various locations throughout
    the pipe’s length. The test set included elements that mimic real-world complexity,
    including pipes with various diameters, rounded bends, T-joints, pipes at various
    heights, and various burial conditions. As shown in Figure 2, acceleration data
    were gathered using Bruel and Kjaer (BK) 4507-B-006 accelerometers from a total
    of 12 locations dispersed throughout the pipeline system. The test setup included
    two PVC pipes with diameters of 3 inches (76 mm) and 4 inches (102 mm). The 4-inch
    (102 mm) PVC pipeline was only partially covered (shown in Figure 2 by a dotted
    line); the rest of the system was left exposed. To make it easier to access the
    pipe surface and mount the accelerometers for data collection, wooden boxes were
    erected on the subterranean. Within the experimental test bed, the accelerometers
    were located at an average distance of 30 inches (762 mm) for the unburied pipeline
    and 24 inches (610 mm) for the buried pipeline. The test setup also comprised
    two leak simulators, one mounted on a PVC pipe with a diameter of 3 inches (76
    mm) and the other on a pipe with a diameter of 4 inches (102 mm). More detailed
    information about them and the test setup can be found in [22,23]. Figure 2. Schematic
    layout of the experimental pipeline setup (reprinted, with permission, from [14]
    @ 2020 Elsevier). As can be seen from Figure 2, accelerometers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    and 6 detect whether a leak occurred in the leak simulator number 1, which is
    located in the unburied section. Similarly, accelerometers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and
    12 detect leaks in the leak simulator number 2, which is located in the buried
    section. Table 2 shows the recorded flow information for all 25 situations that
    were acquired from the flowmeter. Each scenario’s acceleration signal data was
    recorded once the pipeline system reached a stable flow condition, as shown by
    repeatable flow-meter readings. Ten samples of 15-s data were taken for each scenario
    in order to guarantee precise readings and remove inadvertent biases or inaccuracies.
    To diversify the dataset, the size of leaks and the water flow are changed in
    each scenario [14]. Table 2. The water leakage data scenarios (reprinted, with
    permission, from [14] @ 2020 Elsevier). Our research focuses on detecting whether
    a pipeline is leaky or not; thus, we processed the data in such a way it aligns
    with our objective by categorizing the data into two classes which are ‘Leak’
    and ‘NonLeak’. In order to make use of CNN models in the water leak context, the
    acoustic data should be converted into scalogram images. A scalogram is a representation
    of the continuous wavelet transform’s (CWT) absolute value that demonstrates how
    a signal varies with frequency and time [24]. In contrast, the fast Fourier transform
    (FFT) of the signal, which splits it into smaller parts, yields a spectrogram.
    Scalograms break down the signal into wavelets, whereas spectrograms break it
    down into infinite-duration sinusoids. The signal features represented in scalogram
    images are defined by wavelet parameters. Wavelets are useful for detecting sudden
    shifts in the signal by localizing it in both frequency and time, while scalograms
    are appropriate for studying low-frequency acceleration signals [24]. We were
    able to generate 1440 ‘NonLeak’ scalograms and 1680 ‘Leak’ scalograms, resulting
    in a total of 3120 scalograms. We have successfully achieved the crucial task
    of balancing the dataset by using data augmentation techniques, namely random
    cropping and noise injection. Random cropping involves randomly cropping a portion
    of the scalogram images during training; it helps the model become more robust
    to variations. As for noise injection, it makes the model more robust by simulating
    real-world conditions where data is often corrupted by various forms of noise.
    This transformative process has not only mitigated class imbalance but has also
    enhanced the generalization of our machine learning models by reducing overfitting.
    Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10,
    Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14 display the scalogram images of
    different scenarios of Leak, NonLeak, buried and unburied sections of the pipeline
    setup. Comparing the images, it is evident that the scalogram images of the buried
    section exhibit less noise and clearer features (indicated by heavy green spots)
    compared to the scalogram images of the unburied section. However, differentiating
    between scalogram images corresponding to non-leaky (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure
    5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8) and leaky (Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11,
    Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14) is challenging. Figure 3. NonLeak|Unburied|Scalogram

    19. 3.2. Water Leak Detection CNN Models In this work, we used transfer learning
    to train several CNN models, namely AlexNet, ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet V1,
    and MobileNet V2. Each of these models possess distinct architectural characteristics
    and computational efficiencies, making them valuable candidates for our research.
    AlexNet, developed by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012 [15], is a deep CNN model that
    played a pivotal role in revolutionizing image classification tasks. It consists
    of multiple convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers, and employs
    techniques like ReLU activation, dropout regularization, and overlapping pooling.
    AlexNet demonstrated exceptional performance and significantly outperformed other
    existing models at the time of its introduction in spite of its relatively small
    size (61 million parameters). ResNet, short for Residual Network, introduced by
    He et al. in 2015 [19], addressed the challenge of training extremely deep neural
    networks. It introduced the concept of residual connections, allowing the network
    to learn residual mappings and effectively tackle the vanishing gradient problem.
    By utilizing skip connections, ResNet enabled the training of deeper networks
    with improved accuracy and ease of optimization. EfficientNet [21] aims to optimize
    both model accuracy and computational efficiency. The model’s architecture was
    obtained using a neural architecture search to find a good trade-off between model
    size and performance, making it highly efficient for resource-constrained environments.
    EfficientNet also employs a compound scaling method to systematically balance
    the depth, width, and resolution of the network. These features make EfficientNet
    transfer well to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on several benchmark datasets,
    thus, it has become increasingly popular due to its ability to achieve impressive
    results with limited computational budgets. MobileNets, introduced by Howard et
    al. in 2017 [20], focus on efficient mobile applications and low-power devices.
    MobileNets make use of depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the computational
    cost while maintaining reasonable accuracy. MobileNet architectures are well-suited
    for resource-constrained environments, enabling real-time image classification
    on devices with limited processing capabilities. In this research, we used two
    versions from this family of models, namely MobileNet V1 [20] and MobileNet V2
    [25]. All five models have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset—a large-scale
    collection of approximately 1.2 million labeled images spanning 1000 different
    categories—to ensure a strong foundation in visual recognition and feature extraction.
    This extensive pre-training process equips the models with a rich understanding
    of a wide range of objects, scenes, and concepts, making them valuable tools for
    a variety of computer vision tasks. These model choices reflect a balance between
    model complexity, resource efficiency, and historical significance, tailored to
    the specific requirements and constraints of the water leak detection project.
    Moreover, these models have demonstrated their effectiveness not only in traditional
    image classification but also in the context of scalogram images. More details
    about the architectures of the used models can be found in Table 3. Table 3. Models’
    architecture. We employed transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-existing
    knowledge in various domains and transfer it to our leak detection problem by
    capturing intricate patterns and representations in the water leak detection dataset.
    In essence, transfer learning reduces the time and computational resources required
    for model development. Considering that our dataset is small, as a transfer learning
    strategy, we froze the downloaded parameters and we trained only the parameters
    of the output layer. By strategically freezing the early layers of the neural
    network during training, we ensure that the weights and parameters in those layers
    remained unchanged, allowing the model to retain the knowledge it had acquired
    during its initial training phases. We used ADAM as optimization algorithm, a
    technique that seamlessly combines two crucial optimization strategies [26]: Nesterov
    momentum, which aids in achieving better convergence, and adaptive learning rates
    which help adapting the learning rate for each parameter. We further employed
    a mini-batch gradient descent approach to make a good estimation of the error
    and the gradients. Our training strategy involved a specific number of epochs,
    which were determined by the tuner based on the optimal validation results, and
    this was around 50 epochs. To avoid overfitting, the dropout technique is used
    by the different models we applied transfer learning on. Furthermore, we used
    data augmentation which usually enhances generalization. To tune the hyperparameters,
    a total of 15 combinations of the number of epochs, learning rate, and mini-batch
    size were tested over all five models. The details of the different combinations
    are listed in Table 4. The goal was to find the optimal hyperparameters that can
    improve the training time while improving the classification accuracy. Table 4.
    Combinations of hyperparameters. We evaluated the five models and compared the
    results. The performance of the models is evaluated based on accuracy, recall,
    precision and F1 score metrics [27,28]. The considered metrics offer a comprehensive
    assessment of model performance, catering to different aspects of prediction quality.
    Accuracy provides a holistic view of correct classifications, making it a good
    starting point. However, in many real-world scenarios, imbalanced datasets or
    specific business needs require a deeper analysis. Recall is crucial for identifying
    the proportion of true leak detection alerts among actual positives, emphasizing
    the model’s ability to catch relevant events. Precision complements recall by
    measuring the proportion of detected leaks among predicted positives, focusing
    on minimizing false positives. The F1 score strikes a balance between precision
    and recall, making it a reliable metric when striving for a harmonious trade-off
    between minimizing false positives and false negatives. These metrics together
    ensure a more nuanced evaluation and guide model refinement tailored to specific
    project objectives and constraints. 3.3. Target Deployment The target device for
    deployment is an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (Cortex-M4F 64 MHz, Arduino, Somerville,
    MA, USA), which is characterized by its compact size and suitability for various
    applications. With a maximum available RAM of 256 kB and a ROM of 1024 kB, the
    device offers limited computational resources. The Arduino Nano 33 BLE is equipped
    with five sensors that facilitate diverse data collection capabilities. Particularly
    relevant to our study is the acoustic data sensor. The onboard MEMS microphone
    enables the acquisition of acoustic signals, allowing for sound analysis and recognition
    tasks. Additionally, the integrated digital barometric sensor aids in capturing
    atmospheric pressure variations, which can be essential for understanding fluid
    dynamics and airflow patterns. State-of-the-art CNN models, while powerful, are
    often too large to be deployed on a compact device, such as an Arduino Nano 33
    BLE Sense, due to their resource-intensive nature. To address this challenge,
    we use post-training quantization offered by the Edge Impulse platform, a feature
    to optimize models based on implementations provided by the Tensorflow Lite Micro
    library. This approach involves strategically reducing the precision of a model’s
    internal representations by converting 32-bit floating-point parameters into lower
    precision int8. This helped us to significantly reduce the amount of memory (ROM)
    the model requires, making it much more feasible for deployment on a tiny device.
    Additionally, this reduction in memory usage results in faster computation, enabling
    quicker predictions and responses. In essence, post-training quantization serves
    as a crucial optimization step that allows us to retain the core functionality
    and accuracy of the models while tailoring them to the constraints of the device’s
    limited resources. Considered that the water leak detection models are to be deployed
    in Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, other metrics were taken into consideration, namely
    the inference time which is how quickly the models can make predictions, the model’s
    memory usage and storage footprint. These factors are crucial because we want
    to make sure that the models are efficient enough and can fit and perform smoothly
    on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE. By examining their classification metrics, computational
    efficiency, and suitability for the tiny device, we were able to make informed
    decisions regarding the model selection. To deploy the ML model on the Arduino
    Nano 33 BLE, we convert our application into a fully optimized C++ source code
    that can be integrated as an application on the device. The customizable library
    packages contain both the preprocessing block that turns acoustic data into a
    scalogram, and the machine learning block for inference; besides all of the external
    required libraries, everything is turned into a single package with all available
    source code. 4. Results and Discussion In order to train and validate the CNN
    models, we used a split of 72%-10%-18% for training, validation and testing respectively.
    A 5-fold cross-validation approach is adopted where different sets of training
    and validation were randomly selected in each fold. Through training and evaluation
    cycles, it became evident that this split guaranteed a balance between providing
    the model with a enough and diverse training data and ensuring a robust assessment
    of its generalization performance. Table 5 shows the results of our experiments.
    Table 5. Models’ evaluation on validation and testing sets (The best results were
    made bold). As Table 5 shows, EfficientNet emerged as the model that showed the
    best results. The reasons for this outstanding performance were numerous. First
    of all, EfficientNet’s design consists of a revolutionary compound scaling technique
    that uniformly scales the depth, width, and resolution dimensions, allowing it
    to outperform other models. Due to this quality, EfficientNet was able to balance
    model size and accuracy, providing superior performance. Furthermore, extensive
    pre-training on massive datasets helps EfficientNet learn rich and generalized
    representations. Its effective network block designs and depth-wise separable
    convolutions aid in lowering computational costs while keeping expressive capability.
    As a result, EfficientNet’s innovative architectural design and enhanced efficiency
    features were crucial in providing maximum performance for our research. ResNet
    comes second for several reasons. ResNet’s deep residual connections allow for
    effective propagation of gradients, addressing the issue of vanishing gradients
    and enabling the network to be trained more deeply. The skip connections in ResNet
    facilitate the flow of information, helping the model capture more complex patterns
    and features. With a deeper architecture compared to MobileNet and AlexNet, ResNet
    has a greater capacity to learn intricate representations, which can lead to improved
    performance. Although ResNet’s computational complexity is higher than EfficientNet
    and MobileNet, its architectural design and ability to handle deeper networks
    contribute to its notable performance, placing it in the second position for accuracy
    in our study. However, this emphasis on depth alone does not necessarily guarantee
    optimal performance. The deeper architecture of ResNet also leads to higher computational
    complexity, which may limit its practicality in certain resource-constrained scenarios.
    In light of the constraint of the device considered for deployment, our research
    has led us to compress the five models using quantization; however, two of them,
    namely EfficientNet and MobileNet V1, fit within the device characteristics range.
    Table 6 shows the inference time, ram and flash usage of the developed models.
    Table 6. Models’ inference time, peak ram and flash usages. Among the various
    models explored, EfficientNet emerged as the optimal choice, effectively striking
    a balance between good performance and compatibility with our tiny device by adhering
    to its stringent resource limitations. 5. Conclusions This study highlights the
    significance of developing advanced techniques for leak detection, especially
    in the context of water distribution networks and buildings’ pipelines. The integration
    of deep learning algorithms, such as the proposed approach utilizing scalogram
    images of vibration signals, shows promise in efficiently identifying and locating
    leaks. By leveraging TinyML, which combines sensor technology and ML at the network
    edges, real-time data collection, analysis, and localized decision-making can
    be achieved. This not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of leak detection
    but also reduces reliance on centralized entities. The experimental results show
    that EfficientNet underscores our commitment to not only achieving noteworthy
    performance but also to ensuring seamless integration into the tiny device considered
    for deployment. Its capacity to achieve good performance with resource-efficient
    design positions it as the ideal candidate for our deployment objectives, reaffirming
    our endeavor to harness cutting-edge technology for practical applications on
    constrained hardware. Moreover, the high recall achieved by the model also guarantees
    a reduced number of false alarms. The edge solution can process data locally and
    filter out noise or false alarms before sending alerts, reducing the likelihood
    of unnecessary responses. This research has culminated in the development of a
    water leak detection embedded model. As we move forward, our focus will shift
    towards the practical implementation of a water leak detection solution in domestic
    smart buildings. This step entails the translation of our findings to seamlessly
    integrate the embedded ML system into a real-world environment with hardware and
    environmental constraints. The deployment process will encompass rigorous testing,
    optimization, and fine-tuning to ensure reliability and effectiveness. Author

    Introduction The rapid growth of the global population and limitations in soil
    and water resources have highlighted the importance of precision agriculture and
    water productivity. Accurate prediction of vegetation biomass and yield ahead
    of harvesting enables planners to improve national food policies and apply a more
    appropriate management (Noureldin et al., 2013). One of the typical methods for
    determining the plant yield is using destructive measurement methods, which are
    time consuming, costly, and challenging due to farm sampling (Afshar et al., 2021a,
    b). On the other hand, the availability and capability of aerial and satellite
    datasets have turned remote sensing into a big data technology with enormous applications
    in agricultural sciences and specially crop yield monitoring (Feizizadeh et al.,
    2021; Xu et al., 2021). In this regard, many desirable results have been achieved
    in monitoring vegetation conditions and crop biomass estimation by using spectral
    vegetation indices (Afshar et al., 2021a, b; Carneiro et al., 2019; Chen et al.,
    2019; Zhou et al., 2017). In recent years, many studies have been done on monitoring
    crop performance and conditions using satellite images. In one research, Wang
    et al. (2010) suggested models for predicting rice yield at the plant potting
    phase using spectral vegetation ratios such as NIR/red and NIR/green. These models
    showed acceptable results in estimating rice yield on a large scale by using satellite
    images. Baio et al. (2018) also reported a positive linear relationship between
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and cotton yield. Further, in
    other studies carried out by Becker-Reshef et al. (2010), Mkhabela et al. (2011),
    Bolton and Friedl (2013), and Huang et al. (2013), different crop yield regression
    models have been developed based on NDVI. Zhou et al. (2020) also presented an
    approach based on spatiotemporal data fusion by fusing Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3
    data to reconstruct field-scale leaf area index (LAI) imagery over the growth
    period of winter wheat. Further, Tian et al. (2020) have reported that continuous
    measurement of LAI is very crucial for winter wheat yield estimation. Zhao et
    al. (2020) also reported that on farm scale, a prediction model based on NDVI,
    soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) vegetation
    indices resulting from Sentinel-2 had a better performance in comparison to the
    prediction of wheat yield using one or multiple vegetation indices. Similarly,
    other studies have been performed using other spectral indices such as the normalized
    difference water index (NDWI) (Bolton & Friedl, 2013), EVI (Duncan et al., 2015),
    the modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCAR), and the transformed chlorophyll
    absorption ratio index (TCARI) (Sharifi, 2020). Nonetheless, it should be noted
    that in each experimental approach, using equations in new locations or at other
    times can be challenging (Lobell, 2013). As mentioned before, utilizing satellite
    images has led to acceptable accuracy and performance in estimating the plant
    yield at a large scale. Nevertheless, in most regions, problems such as small
    farm size, improper topography, bad climate during the growing season, huge costs,
    and limitations in accessing data have impeded the application of satellite remote
    sensing (Zhang & Kovacs, 2012; Zhou et al., 2017). Capabilities of the unmanned
    aerial system (UAS) in terms of spatial-time resolution, low cost, ease of use,
    and application of different sensors have developed this system for improving
    precision farming (Zhang & Kovacs, 2012). Meanwhile, several research studies
    have been conducted using UAVs to monitor vegetation conditions, diagnose diseases,
    examine vegetation stresses, and do phenotyping (Córcoles et al., 2013; Fullana-Pericàs
    et al., 2022; Ihuoma & Madramootoo, 2017; Verger et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2018;
    Zhou et al., 2021). In addition, there are several studies in the field of crop
    yield estimation using UAV aerial images based on different vegetation indicators.
    Teoh et al. (2016) and Maresma et al. (2020) have reported that NDVI derived from
    UAV aerial images is highly correlated with crop yield. Zhou et al. (2017) used
    UAV spectral images during several stages of plant growth and concluded that indices
    highly correlated with LAI have a better performance in crop yield estimating.
    Carneiro et al. (2019) studied three vegetation indices such as NDVI, the normalized
    difference red-edge index (NDRE), and the infrared percentage vegetation index
    (IRVI) to evaluate the spatial-time changes of soy plants. According to the findings,
    the best time for obtaining data was 45 and 60 days after plantation, and NDRE
    showed a better performance than other indices. Yeom et al. (2019) also used 13
    different vegetation indices derived from UAV data to analyze the effect of tillage
    on plant health and vegetation index performance. NIR-based indices indicated
    a better performance than RGB-based ones, and the modified soil adjusted vegetation
    index (MSAVI) had the best performance. In addition, one research conducted based
    on different field managements comprising six various treatments of nitrogen,
    potassium, and combined fertilizers showed that potato yield could be estimated
    using four vegetation indices with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 for the image
    data set of 90 days after planting (Li et al., 2020). Furthermore, Duan et al.
    (2021) concluded that multi-temporal vegetation index (VI) grain yield estimation
    models could be more accurate than single-stage Vls in estimating different rice
    cultivars. On the other hand, some studies have been conducted to predict crop
    yield using plant height. In this regard, crop surface models (CSMs) have been
    developed to estimate plant height using digital images (Bendig et al., 2015;
    Geipel et al., 2014). Nevertheless, it has been observed that height-yield relationships
    change significantly under different variants and during various growing stages
    (Zhou et al., 2017). A review and evaluation of research history indicate that
    numerous studies conducted using vegetation indices derived from different data
    acquisition equipment (LiDAR, RGB, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors) and
    various data analysis methods such as regression techniques, ANN, SVR, and RFR.
    Despite rapid developments in remote sensing and accessibility of UAV images,
    difficulties have remained and there is no global method to apply for all crops
    in all cases. Although multi-sensor data fusion improves the accuracy of crop
    monitoring, it makes the process of data collection more complex and difficult,
    which can lead to reducing the speed of monitoring. Also, although advanced analysis
    methods improve evaluation accuracy, they require a long training time and will
    have poor performance in small sample sizes and lack of samples. On the other
    hand, different farming management and different crops, even the same crops in
    different environments, have different characteristics and can be effective on
    crop reflectance and spectral indices. These differences require us to carefully
    distinguish the features of crops, use appropriate sensors to collect features,
    and test multiple indices to determine the best biomass indices. We hypothesize
    that different VIs developed from aerial imagery collected using UAV would have
    a significant and specific relationship with corn biomass and the accuracy of
    biomass estimation can be improved by Bayesian averaging of VIs during crop growth
    stages. Therefore, the main objectives of this research were to (i) analyze the
    effect of different irrigation and nitrogen levels on biomass and UAV spectral
    indices, (ii) examine the efficiency of the most widely used spectral indices
    during different plant growth stages, and (iii) improve the accuracy of biomass
    estimation models by using the BMA combined approach. Materials and methods Research
    area and experimental treatments In this research, farm experiments were performed
    in part of the research field of Urmia University, West Azerbaijan, Iran, with
    an area of 4800 square meters, coordinates 37°39′18.85″ N, 44°58′20.39″ E (UTM
    497,559.37 m E, 4,167,564.23 m N, zone: 38 S), and the elevation of 1370 m, during
    the 2017–2018 growing season. The farm had a uniform topography with a mild slope
    of 0.1 m/m and a deep groundwater level (Fig. 1). The average annual rainfall
    in Urmia was 308 mm, and the minimum and maximum long-term temperatures were 5.3
    and 18.1 °C, respectively, with a semi-arid climate. To determine the farm soil’s
    physical and chemical properties, samples were extracted from different soil depths
    before plantation and tested in the laboratory. Some physical and chemical properties
    of the farm soil are listed in Table 1. Fig. 1 Location of the research area Full
    size image Table 1 Test result of physical and chemical properties of soil Full
    size table Farm experiments were carried out based on a randomized block factorial
    design with nine treatments in four replications. The first factor included three
    levels of irrigation (I1 = 100%, I2 = 80%, and I3 = 60% of crop water requirement);
    the second one involved three levels of nitrogen application (N1 = 100%, N2 =
    80%, and N3 = 60% of N fertilizer requirement). Thus, T1 to T9 treatments defined
    as T1: I1N1, T2: I1N2, T3: I1N3, T4: I2N1, T5: I2N2, T6: I2N3, T7: I3N1, T8: I3N2,
    and T9: I3N3. According to the soil composition test and the fertilization recommendation,
    the amount of the consumed urea fertilizer was determined to be 250 kg/ha; other
    treatments were specified as a percentage of this amount. The details of the treatments
    and also the workflow of the research are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Work flow of
    the methodology used in this research Full size image In order to estimate the
    evapotranspiration of the reference crop, the Penman-Monteith equation based on
    the FAO-56 method was used. Based on this, the corn irrigation requirement was
    estimated to be equal to 610 mm/season for the 100% water requirement treatment
    (I1); the amount of the required irrigation water for other treatments was determined
    based on this value. Irrigation operation was then performed using a T-tape drip
    irrigation system. Each experimental plot included six planting rows with a width
    of 50 cm and a length of 15 m. The distances between the plots were considered
    to be between 1.5 and 2 m to overcome the effect of the humidity of different
    irrigation levels. Double-cross maxima 580 hybrid cultivars were used to plant
    corn with 25-cm distances in rows (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Flight operation and experimental
    treatments Full size image Data collection In this research, an eBee+ fixed-wing
    UAV equipped with a Sequoia multispectral sensor having four spectral bands of
    green, red, infrared, and red-edge was used (Fig. 3). All flight parameters, including
    ran strips, imaging stations, flight height, longitudinal and latitudinal overlap
    in images, ground sampling distance (GSD) dimensions of the image, flight time,
    and flight distance, were determined using the emotion3D software. Thus, GSD dimensions
    of the images, flight height, and longitudinal and latitudinal overlap between
    images were considered to be 10 cm, 110 m, and 80 and 70%, respectively. Vegetation
    indices In this section, the obtained images were preprocessed in terms of geometric
    correction and mosaicking of the image using the Pix4Dmapper software to extract
    the vegetation indices. Pix4DMapper software is UAS photography geometric correction
    and mosaic technology based on feature matching and structure from motion (SfM)
    photogrammetry technology (Turner et al., 2012). Initially, images were processed
    in a model space to create three-dimensional point clouds. The point cloud was
    then used to generate the digital terrain model (DTM) required for image correction.
    Subsequent geographic reference images linked together to form the mosaic of the
    study area. Finally, after performing the required preprocessing, 13 vegetation
    indices were estimated in the form of 5 groups based on the relations presented
    in Table 2. Table 2 The utilized vegetation indices for monitoring vegetation
    condition Full size table Crop harvesting and statistical analysis of the data
    At the end of the growing season, crop samples were obtained from four rows of
    middle plantations and the weight of the biomass was calculated as the fresh weight
    of the plant. Also, the spectral samples of the treatments were extracted from
    UAV images simultaneously with crop samplings during three plant growth stages
    including stem elongation (F1), flowering (F2), and silking (F3). Finally, to
    determine the effectiveness of the treatments, the variance decomposition technique
    (ANOVA) was used by applying the SPSS statistical software; also, the treatment
    means were compared using Duncan’s multiple range test. Model development Development
    of linear regression models In addition to examining the effect of irrigation
    water and nitrogen levels on VIs, the capability of these indices in estimating
    crop biomass was investigated as well. In this regard, simple linear regression
    models between spectral indices and vegetation biomass were developed as independent
    and dependent variables, respectively. The first approach in regression equations’
    fitting was to estimate plant biomass during different growing season stages and
    compare the indices during the growth season. Therefore, linear regression relationships
    were proposed individually for the first, second, and third stages of the aerial
    survey. On the other hand, the second approach was developing regression models
    for the entire growing season, considering that the planting date of plants might
    be different in a vast area. Development of the combined model using the BMA method
    In crop biomass modeling by using various indices, uncertainty in the input data
    may cause multiple outcomes and bring uncertainty in the final results. In most
    cases, it is attempted to choose one of the models using statistical methods and
    simulate data by these models, which can cause an error due to the possibility
    of other scenarios. Hence, considering the models’ outcomes and possible scenarios
    in simulation can increase the accuracy and raise the reliability of the model’s
    predictions. One of the most common methods used for combining model results is
    the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method, which was carried out in R (version
    3.5.1). In this method, it is assumed that all models are beneficial and can be
    used in simulation; however, the degree of certainty is different, such that it
    can be defined by attributing weight to each. The weight of each simulation and
    the variance of their distribution function are determined using the posterior
    probability distribution function of each. Then, by using the defined weights,
    one of the simulation models is selected and a random number is chosen using their
    distribution function. The weight of each simulation depends on its correlation
    with the observation data, as measured by the posterior probability of each model.
    If we assume that f1, f2, …, and fk are simulation models (simulated scenarios)
    and their distribution function is gk(y|fk), then the BMA predictor model is defined
    as shown below (Hoeting et al., 1999; Raftery et al., 2005): $$P(y\\left| {f_{1}
    ,...,f_{k} ) = \\sum\\nolimits_{k = 1}^{k} {w_{{_{k} }} g_{{_{k} }} (y} } \\right.\\left|
    {f_{k} )} \\right.$$ (1) where wk is the possibility of choosing simulation k
    as the best simulation, which is determined based on the performance of the simulation
    k. These values have probabilistic characteristics in such a way that each is
    non-negative and the sum of all of them is equal to one (\\(\\sum\\nolimits_{k
    = 1}^{k} {w_{k} = 1}\\)). Assessment criteria of the models’ performance In this
    research, to evaluate the obtained results, two common statistical indices, including
    root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2), were used:
    (Willmott & Matsuura, 2005) $$RMSE = \\sqrt {\\sum\\nolimits_{k = 1}^{N} {\\frac{{(X_{k}
    - Y_{k} )^{2} }}{N}} }$$ (2) (Zou et al., 2003) $$R^{2} = \\left[ {\\frac{{\\sum\\nolimits_{k
    = 1}^{N} {(X_{k} - \\overline{X})(Y_{k} - \\overline{Y})} }}{{\\sum\\nolimits_{k
    = 1}^{n} {(X_{k} - \\overline{X})^{2} \\sum\\nolimits_{k = 1}^{N} {(Y - \\overline{Y})^{2}
    } } }}} \\right]^{Z}$$ (3) where N is the sum of data, X is the calculated output,
    Y is the measured output, and \\(\\overline{X}\\) and \\(\\overline{Y}\\) are
    the average values. Results Variations of VIs under various experimental treatments
    Figure 4 represents the results of the 13 spectral indices obtained during three
    aerial surveys, along with the reflectance changes of the related bands for each
    index. As can be seen, changes in the indices during the growing season were not
    similar. Indices of groups 1 and 2 and some of group 3, such as NDVI, OSAVI, and
    WDRVI, showed a different behavior, as compared to other indices. These values
    were higher during the start of the season and did not change in the second stage
    in comparison to the end of the season. Also, the evaluation of VIs during different
    treatments showed that the effect of different irrigation water and N fertilizer
    levels on VIs was different. For example, the obtained values of GRVI and MGRVI
    for the T1 treatment with 100% of irrigation water and the N fertilizer requirement
    were not the highest during the second and third flights in contrast to other
    indices; also, they were lower than other treatments. Nonetheless, values of green,
    red, red-edge, and NIR spectral bands showed a similar behavior; their values
    were more in the second flight than in the first one; also, they were higher in
    the third flight rather than the second one, which was in accordance with the
    plant growth. Fig. 4 Vegetation indices and spectral bands under different treatments
    during the growing season (F1, flight1; F2, flight2; and F3, flight3 during first,
    second, and third stages of measurements) Full size image Based on Fig. 4, the
    indices of group 1 decreased during the growing season; the highest values of
    GRVI and MGRVI were in the first flight at the beginning of the growing season.
    Meanwhile, despite plant growth and an increase in the green and red bands during
    the second and third flights, the values of the indices obtained from these bands
    had a decreasing trend. Similarly, the indices of group 2 also had the highest
    values at the beginning of the growing season; in the following stages of plant
    growth, their values decreased in most treatments despite the increase of the
    green and NIR spectral bands. Among the indices of group 3, NDVI, WDRVI, and OSAVI
    showed a behavior different from that of SAVI, MSAVI, and EVI2. These differences
    were due to mathematical relationships and different coefficients considered for
    red and NIR bands. Most indices of group 3 had high values at the beginning of
    the growing season, not showing a significant change during the second and third
    flights; they were saturated at the end of the growing season. Unlike other indices,
    during the third flight, WDRVI exhibited a large decline, as compared to the second
    and first flights; in contrast, EVI2 was increased during the second and third
    flights, as compared to the previous stage. Examination of the indices in groups
    4 and 5 showed that NDRE, RECI, and MTCI increased with increasing the red, red-edge,
    and NIR bands during the growing season; however, they did not reach a saturation
    state in the third stage. One of the most important reasons for this issue is
    using the red-edge spectral band, which is highly sensitive to leaf chlorophyll,
    increasing with plant growth. Statistical analysis of the effect of irrigation
    water and nitrogen application levels on corn biomass and VIs Based on the variance
    decomposition results, the effects of irrigation water and N fertilizer levels
    and the interaction of irrigation water × N fertilizer on corn biomass were significant
    during three flights (p < 0.01). However, the effect of irrigation and N fertilizer
    levels on VIs was different; the obtained results, thus, indicated the importance
    of the utilized spectral bands. In addition, the results of comparing the means
    of irrigation water and N fertilizer levels are presented in Table 3. As can be
    seen, the biomass of corn decreased significantly with the reduction of irrigation
    and N fertilizer levels during all three stages; the highest value was obtained
    at a level of 100% of irrigation water and N fertilizer requirement. Based on
    the results of stage 3, the average crop biomasses for I1, I2, and I3 treatments
    were 84.809, 80.488, and 67.667 ton/ha, respectively; meanwhile, these values
    for N1, N2, and N3 treatments were 89.074, 75.361, and 68.529 ton/ha, respectively.
    Table 3 Mean values of corn biomass and VI response to irrigation water and N
    fertilizer levels Full size table However, examining the effect of different irrigation
    water and N fertilizer levels on some VIs showed a different result. Unlike corn
    biomass, GRVI had the highest values at I2 treatments with 80% of irrigation water
    requirement during the second and third stages; the highest MGRVI values were
    achieved at I2 treatments during all measurement stages. On the other side, these
    indices were decreased in accordance with a decline in the consumed N fertilizer
    during the first and second measurement stages; it was only in the third stage
    that N2 and N3 treatments with 80 and 60% of the N fertilizer requirement showed
    a larger value, as compared to N1 treatments, with 100% of the N fertilizer requirement.
    In the same way, the maximum values of GCI and GNDVI indices were obtained at
    I1 and N1 treatments; it was only in N2 treatments that a larger value was observed,
    as compared to other levels. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, the values of the
    indices of groups 1 and 2 decreased over time despite plant growth. Meanwhile,
    the values of the third and second measurement stages were obtained to be less
    than those of the first stage. Therefore, using the green and red bands could
    not correctly depict the level of plant growth and biomass of corn by irrigation
    water and N fertilizer levels during the growing season. As can be seen in Table
    3, among indices of group 3, NDVI and WDRVI showed a weaker performance than other
    ones. Throughout all measurement stages, NDVI did not show a significant difference
    between I1 and I2 treatments with 100 and 80% of irrigation water requirement
    levels; at the third measurement stage, the value of this index for N3 and N2
    treatments was higher than that in N1 treatments. On the contrary, EVI2 and MSAVI
    showed a better performance than other indices; in most cases, they could show
    a significant difference between irrigation and N fertilizer levels. Examination
    of the values of groups 4 and 5 indices showed that these indices had significant
    variations in regard to the changes in irrigation water and N fertilizer application
    levels; in all measurement stages, they achieved the maximum values in I1 and
    N1 treatments with 100% of irrigation water and N fertilizer requirement. Also,
    their values were significantly more in 80 rather than 60% of irrigation water
    requirement treatments. Further, while indices of the first, second, and third
    groups at the end of the growing season did not show a significant change between
    levels 80–100 and 60–80% of the N fertilizer requirement, NDRE, RECI, and MTCI
    resulted in a significant difference between all levels of irrigation water and
    N fertilizer, thus leading to better results. This was due to using the red-edge
    band in these indices, which was sensitive to plant chlorophyll, creating significant
    differences when using different N fertilizer levels. Other similar studies have
    shown that NDRE could have a better performance than NDVI in identifying the inhomogeneities
    of olive vegetation (Jorge et al., 2019). For a more detailed examination, the
    results of comparing the means analysis for corn biomass and the five best indices
    of each group are represented individually for each treatment in Fig. 5. A research
    of the results related to corn biomass indicated that the T1 treatment with 100%
    of irrigation water and N fertilizer requirement had the highest biomass during
    the entire plant growing season; its values for the first to third measurements
    were, respectively, 11.462, 45.980 and 96.263 ton/ha. Additionally, in the last
    measurement stage, it was observed that after T1, the highest crop biomass was
    equal to 92.008 and 81.515 ton/ha for T4 and T2 treatments, respectively; T9 had
    the lowest crop biomass when using 60% of irrigation water and N fertilizer requirement.
    Based on the results of the research done by Lisar et al. (2012) and Viero et
    al. (2017), water stress intensifies the chlorophyll stresses in plant leaves
    since nutrition transportation in a plant is done via water; also, a reduction
    in plant water content increases nitrogen losses due to volatilization. Fig. 5
    Comparing means of VIs under irrigation water × N fertilizer interactions Full
    size image Also, it was observed that during the first and second measurement
    stages, GCI of the T1 treatment was significantly higher than that in other treatments;
    however, in the third stage, T2 had the highest value of this index. Thus, the
    maximum values of GCI in the first, second, and third measurement stages were
    8.428, 5.594, and 4.786, respectively. Hence, this index had an acceptable performance
    during the plant’s primary growing stages; however, it should be noted that its
    value decreased along with the crop growth; therefore, it should not be used in
    researching two regions with different plantation times. Similarly, GRVI had an
    acceptable performance during the primary stage, appropriately showing the vegetation
    state according to biomass and crop growing conditions. However, during the second
    and third measurement stages, T4 and T5 had the largest amount of GRVI; even in
    the third stage, the value of this index in T9 was significantly higher than that
    in T1 and T2, thus signifying the low accuracy of this index at the end of the
    growing season. Investigation of EVI2, RECI, and MTCI changes showed that the
    behavior of these indices was similar; contrary to GCI and MGRVI, their values
    increased as the plant grew during the growing season. In all measurement stages,
    the maximum value of these indices occurred in T1; in most cases, they directly
    changed following the variation in the crop biomass. For example, as can be seen
    in the color image of MTCI (Fig. 5), in the third flight, similar to the crop
    biomass behavior, the highest values of this index resulted in the treatments
    T1, T2, and T3, which were 1.269, 1.049, and 1.147, respectively; meanwhile, the
    lowest values were observed in T8 and T9, with the values of 0.620 and 0.611,
    respectively. In some cases, this did not occur; changes in indices were not in
    accordance with those in the biomass level. For instance, EVI2 of T8 in the third
    measurement stage was more than its value on T5, T6, and T7. Meanwhile, the amount
    of biomass in T8 was less than that in the mentioned treatments. Estimation of
    crop biomass using vegetation indices The relationships between corn biomass and
    13 spectral indices during three growing stages and the entire growing season
    were analyzed (Fig. 6). Based on the obtained results in the first stage, indices
    of groups 4 and 5 showed a better performance than others; R2 coefficients were
    obtained to be equal to 0.82, 0.85, and 0.84 for NDRE, RECI, and MTCI, respectively.
    Additionally, the performance of the indices in group 3 was better than that in
    groups 2 and 1. On the contrary, during the second flight, R2 and RMSE coefficients
    of the second group of VIs, especially WDRE, were better than those of other groups
    and indices. It should be noted that WDRE had a weaker performance than other
    indices during the first and third flights; however, during the second flight,
    it had the best fitting with plant biomass. This indicated how many coefficients
    used in equations could be effective. Similar to the first flight, in the third
    flight, the indices of groups 4 and 5 provided a more accurate estimation of corn
    biomass; however, the R2 and RMSE coefficients were reduced when compared with
    the first flight results. As mentioned in other researches, the indices were reduced
    at the end of the growth stages. Fig. 6 Coefficients of correlation and RMSE for
    regression relationships of biomass-vegetation indices during various measurement
    stages (F1, flight1; F2, flight2; and F3, flight3 during first, second, and third
    stages of measurements) Full size image However, the results for the entire season
    showed that the performance of indices was different; four indices including MTCI,
    RECI, NDRE, and EVI2, with R2 values of 0.92, 0.89, 0.87, and 0.6, respectively,
    and the RMSE values of 8.27, 9.69, 10.32, and 18.3 ton/ha, respectively, had the
    best performance, as compared with other indices. Therefore, the indices of groups
    1 and 2, and NDVI, MSAVI, OSAVI, and WDRVI of the third group did not give an
    accurate estimate of corn biomass during the entire growing season; thus, using
    these indices for the estimation and comparison of performance could not be suggested
    in farms with various plantation times. Figure 7 represents the regression equation
    of the given fitting for the best indices of each group, along with NDVI, which
    is widely used in most researches. As can be seen, GRVI, GCI, and NDVI indices
    were inversely related to corn biomass in the third flight stage. This could be
    due to the effect of different irrigation water and N fertilizer levels on the
    mentioned indices. According to the results represented in Table 3, GRVI for the
    treatment involving 80% of irrigation water requirement (I2) was more than that
    for the treatments consisting of the 100% level of irrigation water requirement
    (I1); further, GCI for the treatments with 60% of irrigation water requirement
    (I3) was higher than that of the 80% one. Meanwhile, NDVI did not significantly
    change in the treatments with the irrigation water requirements of 100, 80, and
    60%. On the other hand, the effect of N fertilizer levels on spectral indices
    indicated that GRVI, GCI, and NDVI indices were more in the treatments involving
    80 and 60% of the N fertilizer requirement, as compared to those consisting of
    100% of the N fertilizer requirement. These factors also caused these indices
    not to have an acceptable estimate of crop biomass during the growing season;
    therefore, a negative slope was obtained for the equation of the entire growing
    season. The R2 coefficients of GRVI, GCI, and NDVI indices during the entire growing
    season were obtained to be 0.15, 0.27, and 0.05, respectively; the RMSE values
    of these indices were also 26.61, 24.66, and 28.07, respectively. On the contrary,
    examination of EVI2, RECI, and MTCI indices’ graphs showed that despite the proper
    fitting of these indices during the first, second, and third stages, they performed
    well during the entire growing season. According to the statistical analysis,
    the effects of different levels of irrigation water and N fertilizer on these
    spectral indices were observed, and they were raised with an increase in irrigation
    water and N fertilizer consumption during the growing season. Thus, the R2 and
    RMSE coefficients of the entire season were 0.6 and 18.3, respectively for EVI2;
    these were 0.89 and 9.69, respectively, for RECI. Finally, these were 0.92 and
    8.27 for MTCI, respectively. Fig. 7 The relationships for corn biomass and vegetation
    indices Full size image Therefore, as can be seen, the type and combination of
    different spectral bands led to different results in crop biomass estimation.
    For instance, the red-edge reflectance was more sensitive to vegetation chlorophyll
    in comparison to the red one; with an increase in the consumed nitrogen, the indices
    based on the red-edge were increased significantly as well. On the other side,
    the reflectance of the NIR band was highly sensitive to LAI; as the plant was
    grown, LAI was increased, leading to the rise of reflectance in this spectral
    range; meanwhile, in the same condition, red-edge reflectance was decreased, reaching
    the saturation state (Xie et al., 2018). Estimation of crop biomass using BMA
    models To increase the accuracy of the estimation models of corn biomass and to
    use the advantages of different spectral indices, BMA models were created based
    on different inputs (Fig. 8). During the selection of the inputs for the BMA models,
    an attempt was made to choose indices with various bands and best performance;
    based on this, four BMA models were selected, as shown below: BMA1: MTCI, RECI,
    MSAVI, GCI, GRVI BMA2: MTCI, NDRE, RECI BMA3: MTCI, RECI, EVI2 BMA4: MTCI, WDRVI,
    GCI Fig. 8 Relationships for corn biomass and VIs Full size image The results
    showed that BMA1 had the best performance in all three plant growth stages due
    to the use of 5 vegetation indices. The R2 coefficients of this model during the
    first, second ,and third stages were 0.9, 0.89, and 0.75, respectively; also,
    RMSE values were 0.22, 2.31, and 5.73 ton/ha, respectively (Fig. 9). The BMA2
    model had a better performance than BMA3 and BMA4 models in response to not using
    the NDRE index at the first and third stages. On the contrary, the BMA3 model
    led to better results, as compared to BMA2 and BMA4 models, due to the use of
    the EVI2 index, which had a better performance in the second stage in comparison
    to the indices of groups 4 and 5. Fig. 9 Coefficients of correlation and RMSE
    value for BMA models during measurement stages Full size image Additionally, examination
    of the modeling results of crop biomass during the growing season showed that
    the BMA1 model, with an R2 value equal to 0.93 and an RMSE value equal to 7.45
    ton/ha, had the best results when compared with other indices and BMA models.
    Discussion Studies of different indices showed that using different spectral bands
    in the form of mathematical relationships with different coefficients could lead
    to various results whose effects could differ depending on the plant type. It
    should be noted that most mathematical relationships used for spectral indices
    are in the fractional form, and the value in the denominator can significantly
    change the final result (Fig. 4). As can be seen in the indices of group 1, since
    the green and red bands were used as the denominator of these indices and the
    average values of these bands at the beginning of the growing season were between
    0.055–0.064 and 0.026–0.046, the final value of VIs was higher, while the plant
    was still at its primary growing stages. This effect was intensified in MGRVI,
    where its bands were squared. Similarly, regarding the indices of the second group
    for which red and green bands were used as the denominators, the index value at
    the beginning of the growing season was obtained to be higher in comparison to
    that in the following stages since the denominator values were low at the initial
    stages. In the indices of the third group, the NIR band was used as the denominator
    and the average range of this spectral band at the beginning of the season was
    at 0.308–0.523 range; different results were, therefore, obtained. In other words,
    the value of indices such as SAVI, MSAVI, and EVI2 was in accordance with plant
    growth at the beginning of the growing season since the utilized coefficients
    had the raised denominators of their terms. In contrast, this was not the case
    in other indices of group 3, such as NDVI, OSAVI, and WDRVI (Fig. 4). On the contrary,
    NDRE, RECI, and MTCI were raised following plant growth, leading to an increase
    in the values of the spectral bands. One of the effective factors is the use of
    the red-edge spectral band in the denominator of indices; the average range of
    this band was equal to 0.293–0.404, 0.333–0.453, and 0.366–0.495, respectively,
    throughout the three measurement stages (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Changes in reflectance
    range of spectral bands during different growing stages Full size image Investigation
    of the effect of irrigation water and nitrogen application levels on VIs showed
    that in all growing stages, most indices were significantly affected by water
    and nitrogen levels. However, comparing the means analysis of the treatments showed
    that changes in some of the indices of groups 1, 2, and 3 were not in accordance
    with an increase or decrease in irrigation water and nitrogen levels, or the interaction
    between these two factors. This signified the different effects of irrigation
    water and nitrogen levels on various spectral indices; some indices such as MTCI,
    RECI, and NDRE, which included the red-edge spectral bands, could properly indicate
    the changes in irrigation water and nitrogen. Using indices based on the red-edge
    spectral band is superior in terms of identifying nitrogen concentration and plant
    biomass estimation. The spectral range of the red-edge band was from 680 to 750
    nm, thus indicating the transition from the chlorophyll absorption band in the
    red band region to the reflectance range of the NIR region (Clevers et al., 2002).
    Therefore, in addition to an increase of plant reflectance in this region, sensitivity
    to plant chlorophyll was higher than that in the red band region (Horler et al.,
    1983; Xie et al., 2018). Also, comparing the means analysis of the treatments
    showed that most indices of groups 1, 2, and 3 did not significantly differ during
    the second and third measurement stages, reaching a saturation state. The results
    of various studies have shown that the sensitivity of VIs to biophysical parameters
    such as LAI is reduced as vegetation density is increased to more than a threshold
    (Gitelson et al., 2002; Small & Lu, 2006). Moreover, similar to our study, Colovic
    et al. (2022) studied the water and nitrogen status of sweet maize crop by hyperspectral
    vegetation indices and concluded that red-edge-based indices had higher sensitivity
    to nitrogen levels, and it is critical to select suitable vegetation indices to
    monitor the plant eco-physiological response to water and nitrogen stresses. Examination
    of the linear regression models also showed the appropriateness of indices in
    groups 4 and 5 in estimating corn biomass, especially MTCI, thus showing a better
    performance than other indices by applying three NIR, red-edge, and red spectral
    bands. Moreover, the effect of relationships and coefficients used in spectral
    indices was significant. For instance, a comparison of NDVI and EVI2 indices showed
    that despite using similar spectral bands in these two indices, their performances
    were significantly different during the entire growing season; NDVI was decreased
    with plant growth; in contrast, EVI2 was increased directly in proportion to the
    plant growth. These results were consistent with those obtained by Coelho et al.
    (2018), who concluded that using NDVI and IRVI indices, with the same red and
    NIR bands, led to different results in estimating the wheat yield. Vivekar (2019)
    also carried out a research for estimating crop yield from multispectral UAV images
    and fixed tower sensors. Based on the obtained results, values of NDVI also were
    high in the beginning of the crop growth. Therefore, the type and structure of
    different spectral bands lead to different results in crop biomass estimation.
    For instance, the red-edge reflectance is more sensitive to vegetation chlorophyll,
    and with an increase in the consumed nitrogen, the indices based on the red-edge
    increase significantly as well. On the other side, NIR is highly sensitive to
    LAI, and as the plant grows, reflectance of NIR band rises due to LAI increasing
    (Xie et al., 2018). According to the different properties of each VI in terms
    of using various equations, coefficients, and bands, the selection of the best
    index must be based on a comprehensive analysis, considering the existing limitations
    and environmental circumstances. On the other hand, different plants can have
    various effects on VIs due to their specific and complicated characteristics (Xue
    & Su, 2017). In addition to the nitrogen concentration and LAI, other parameters
    such as the structure of leaves and vegetation architecture can be effective on
    the plants’ reflectance. For example, the leaf angle distribution of corn and
    alfalfa is different from that of wheat and barley (Houborg & Boegh, 2008; Viña
    et al., 2011). So, by considering these factors, a proper combination of the indices
    could be used for practical applications. Therefore, using BMA models based on
    a combination of different indices and utilizing the advantages of each can provide
    a proper estimation of plant biomass. Based on the results of this research, using
    the BMA approach can improve the performance of VIs to a significant level. Conclusion
    In recent years, due to the extensive use of remote sensing drones, the qualitative
    and quantitative monitoring of agricultural farms using this technology and vegetation
    spectral indices has grown significantly. Given the progress made in designing
    platforms and sensors, developments of various vegetation indices, as well as
    the different spectral behaviors of various plants, introducing a comprehensive
    methodology is essential for farmers and managers to precisely assess crop production.
    The main objective of this research was to apply different spectral and data-driven
    approaches to UAV images to identify the efficiency of each technique. For this
    purpose, in this paper, while examining and analyzing the variation of VIs under
    different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer management types, the BMA-based models
    were used to provide hybrid models for estimating the maize biomass with high
    accuracy. Analysis of various VIs showed that using different spectral bands with
    different coefficients could create various results whose effects might be different
    during plant growth. Indices such as MTCI, RECI, and NDRE, which include the red-edge
    spectral bands, could properly indicate variations in irrigation water and nitrogen
    levels, thus playing a vital role in terms of precision agriculture and saving
    water and fertilizer resources. For example, during the third flight, the highest
    values of MTCI resulted in the treatments T1, T2, and T3, which were 1.269, 1.049,
    and 1.147, respectively; meanwhile, the lowest values were observed in T8 and
    T9, with values of 0.620 and 0.611, respectively. Also, fitting linear regression
    models showed the capability of the indices in groups 4 and 5 in estimating corn
    biomass. Vegetation indices such as MTCI, RECI, NDRE, and EVI2, with R2 values
    of 0.92, 0.89, 0.87, and 0.6, respectively, and RMSE values of 8.27, 9.69, 10.32,
    and 18.3 ton/ha, respectively, had the best performance in estimation corn biomass.
    Furthermore, some BMA models were developed based on different inputs in order
    to increase the accuracy of the corn biomass estimation models. The results showed
    that BMA1 had the best performance in all plant growth stages due to the use of
    5 vegetation indices. The R2 coefficients of this model during the first, second,
    and third stages were 0.9, 0.89, and 0.75, respectively; also, RMSE values were
    0.22, 2.31, and 5.73 ton/ha, respectively. Therefore, the results of BMA models
    showed that by using such a procedure, we can present high accuracy models for
    crop yield estimation under different weather conditions, crop types, and agricultural
    managements. This research showed that numerous factors such as water and fertilizer
    management, VIs with different spectral bands and coefficients, and different
    crop characteristics in terms of vegetation structure and reflectance can cause
    uncertainty, thus leading to different results in estimating crop biomass. Therefore,
    instead of selecting specific VIs that are limited to the environmental and managerial
    conditions of the region, it is necessary to apply the approach of hybrid models
    that includes all features and benefits of different indices. So, given UAV data
    availability for precision agriculture, the current research can be considered
    a progressive research in the domain of agriculture and remote sensing sciences
    by applying different data-driven approaches and identifying the efficiency of
    each method. Data availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during

  description: Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is the 400–700 nm portion
    of the solar radiation spectrum that photoautotrophic organisms including plants,
    algae, and cyanobacteria use for photosynthesis. PAR is a key variable in global
    ecosystem and Earth system modeling, playing a prominent role in carbon and water
    cycling. Alongside air temperature, water availability, and atmospheric CO2 concentration,
    PAR controls photosynthesis and consequently biomass productivity in general.
    The management of agricultural and horticultural crops, forests, grasslands, and
    even grasses at sports venues is a non-exhaustive list of applications for which
    an accurate knowledge of the PAR resource is desirable. Modern agrivoltaic systems
    also require a good knowledge of PAR in conjunction with the variables needed
    to monitor the co-located photovoltaic system. In situ quality-controlled PAR
    sensors provide high-quality information for specific locations. However, due
    to associated installation and maintenance costs, such high-quality data are relatively
    scarce and generally extend over a restricted and sometimes non-continuous period.
    Numerous studies have already demonstrated the potential offered by surface radiation
    estimates based on satellite information as reliable alternatives to in situ measurements.
    The accuracy of these estimations is site-dependent and is related, for example,
    to the local climate, landscape, and viewing angle of the satellite. To assess
    the accuracy of PAR satellite models, we inter-compared 11 methods for estimating
    30 min surface PAR based on satellite-derived estimations at 33 ground-based station
    locations over several climate regions in Europe, Africa, and South America. Averaged
    across stations, the results showed average relative biases (relative to the measurement
    mean) across methods of 1 to 20%, an average relative standard deviation of 25
    to 30%, an average relative root mean square error of 25% to 35% and a correlation
    coefficient always above 0.95 for all methods. Improved performance was seen for
    all methods at relatively cloud-free sites, and quality degraded towards the edge
    of the Meteosat Second Generation viewing area. A good compromise between computational
    time, memory allocation, and performance was achieved for most locations using
    the Jacovides coefficient applied to the global horizontal irradiance from HelioClim-3
    or the CAMS Radiation Service. In conclusion, satellite estimations can provide
    a reliable alternative estimation of ground-based PAR for most applications.

    keyboard_arrow_down      Browse Figures Versions Notes Abstract Photosynthetically
    active radiation (PAR) is the 400–700 nm portion of the solar radiation spectrum
    that photoautotrophic organisms including plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use
    for photosynthesis. PAR is a key variable in global ecosystem and Earth system
    modeling, playing a prominent role in carbon and water cycling. Alongside air
    temperature, water availability, and atmospheric CO2 concentration, PAR controls
    photosynthesis and consequently biomass productivity in general. The management
    of agricultural and horticultural crops, forests, grasslands, and even grasses
    at sports venues is a non-exhaustive list of applications for which an accurate
    knowledge of the PAR resource is desirable. Modern agrivoltaic systems also require
    a good knowledge of PAR in conjunction with the variables needed to monitor the
    co-located photovoltaic system. In situ quality-controlled PAR sensors provide
    high-quality information for specific locations. However, due to associated installation
    and maintenance costs, such high-quality data are relatively scarce and generally
    extend over a restricted and sometimes non-continuous period. Numerous studies
    have already demonstrated the potential offered by surface radiation estimates
    based on satellite information as reliable alternatives to in situ measurements.
    The accuracy of these estimations is site-dependent and is related, for example,
    to the local climate, landscape, and viewing angle of the satellite. To assess
    the accuracy of PAR satellite models, we inter-compared 11 methods for estimating
    30 min surface PAR based on satellite-derived estimations at 33 ground-based station
    locations over several climate regions in Europe, Africa, and South America. Averaged
    across stations, the results showed average relative biases (relative to the measurement
    mean) across methods of 1 to 20%, an average relative standard deviation of 25
    to 30%, an average relative root mean square error of 25% to 35% and a correlation
    coefficient always above 0.95 for all methods. Improved performance was seen for
    all methods at relatively cloud-free sites, and quality degraded towards the edge
    of the Meteosat Second Generation viewing area. A good compromise between computational
    time, memory allocation, and performance was achieved for most locations using
    the Jacovides coefficient applied to the global horizontal irradiance from HelioClim-3
    or the CAMS Radiation Service. In conclusion, satellite estimations can provide
    a reliable alternative estimation of ground-based PAR for most applications. Keywords:

    Solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is recognized as one of the most
    important sources of energy driving plant growth [1,2,3]. The essential part of
    solar radiation needed by plants lies between 400 nm and 700 nm and is called
    photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). PAR is used by photosynthetic organisms
    (photoautotrophs) for carbon assimilation, thus controlling biomass growth [4,5].
    Farmers and growers, as well as practitioners and scientists in agriculture, forestry,
    meteorology, and oceanography, are in growing need of high-quality PAR data, for
    instance, for forest management and ecosystem preservation, food production, and
    the monitoring of marine ecosystems and grass in sports stadiums [6,7,8]. Well-maintained
    ground-based stations with high-accuracy measurement instruments provide locally
    accurate real-time and archive PAR datasets helping to meet these data needs.
    However, due to the high associated costs of both installation and maintenance,
    high-quality in situ PAR measurements are scarce in space and time. To overcome
    this limitation, several proxy approaches have been designed and reported in the
    scientific literature, spanning from simple ones based on proportionality coefficients
    to complex ones combining machine learning and physical-based models [9,10,11,12,13,14].
    For a broader review of existing proxy approaches and applications, please refer
    to [13,14]. A useful proxy for PAR estimates is broadband solar radiation, also
    called global horizontal irradiance (GHI), i.e., the irradiance integrated over
    the broadband range from 0.28 µm to approximately 3 µm. Although broadband radiation
    measurements have better spatial coverage over land compared to PAR measurements,
    they still lack temporal coverage. Researchers have also analyzed alternative
    lower-quality broadband radiation data sources, such as meteorological analyses
    [15,16,17,18,19]. In view of these limitations, an alternative approach is to
    use satellite-based PAR estimates derived from satellite-based GHI, which offers
    a reliable complement to in situ measurements [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31].
    Previous studies estimating surface PAR fluxes from satellites have mostly been
    validated in limited locations without an inter-comparison of alternative methods.
    Therefore, the purpose of this article was to assess and inter-compare the performance
    of both previously tested and newly developed methods for estimating surface PAR
    in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. In addition, this study
    expanded the validation of five recent methods developed by Thomas et al. [32],
    which were limited to three sites located in the southern UK. Newly developed
    methods rely on modeling the attenuation of PAR due solely to clouds. Here, PAR
    data from an initial group of 47 ground stations were collated and quality-assessed,
    yielding a final set of 33 stations that met the quality constraints. All satellite-derived
    methods providing PAR estimates exploit cloud information derived from the Meteosat
    Second Generation (MSG) prime satellite. MSG prime coverage corresponds to the
    initial coverage of the MSG satellite and represents 42% of the planet; the nadir
    is 0° in both longitude and latitude, and the coverage extends from −66° to +66°
    degrees in latitude and longitude. The performance of the 11 methods studied here
    was assessed at these 33 ground-based stations. This paper is organized into four
    main sections. Section 2 covers the description of the measurements, the quality
    assurance process to discard outliers, and the adopted validation protocol for
    this comparison between in situ PAR measurements and satellite-derived PAR estimates
    based on 11 different methods, which are described in Section 3. Section 4 presents
    the results of the validation of the methods when compared with ground-based measurements,
    and Section 5 presents interpretations of these results. Section 6 addresses the
    study limitations and proposes recommendations for further study. Section 7 summarizes
    the research conclusions. 2. Ground Measurements, Quality Control, and Validation
    Protocol Thirty-three stations were used to assess the quality of the satellite-derived
    PAR methods. The station list and their meta-information are shown in Table 1.
    All data used in this study can be freely accessed through public sources available
    online, and access details are provided in the “Data Availability” statement.
    Most good-quality in situ PAR measurements are achieved using LI-COR quantum sensors,
    for which the typical relative uncertainty (95% confidence level) lies in the
    range of 5% to 8% [33,34]. They are recorded as quanta of photons per unit area
    per unit time, i.e., the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), in µmol m−2
    s−1. The PPFD can be linked to irradiance expressed in W m−2 using the widely
    used approximation 1 W m−2 = 4.57 µmol m−2 s−1 [35]. Hereafter, we substitute
    PPFD with PAR. All measurements were summed in the temporal window collected by
    the instrument. The final column of Table 1 indicates whether the time stamp associated
    with the PAR measurement was given at the beginning, middle, or end of this interval
    window. For 1 min measurements, the time step was too short to make differences
    between integrated or instantaneous measurements significant, and so such time
    stamps are labeled “not relevant” (NR). Table 1. Thirty-three in situ surface
    PAR measurement stations and associated meta-information. Color indicates Köppen–Geiger
    climate type, with green for temperate climate without dry season and warm summer
    (Cfb), light brown for arid and cold climate of steppe type (Bsk), yellow for
    temperate climate with dry and hot summer (Csa), deep sky blue for cold climate
    without dry season and with warm summer (Dfb), yellow-green for temperate climate
    with dry and warm summer (Csb), blue for tropical climate of monsoon type (Am),
    orange for arid and hot climate of steppe type (Bsh), pale green for temperate
    climate with dry winter and hot summer (Cwa), and green-yellow for temperate climate
    without dry season and with hot summer (Cfa). Table 1 lists the Köppen–Geiger
    climate type associated with a color and code for each station according to Peel
    et al. [36]. Meanwhile, Figure 1 displays the geographical distribution of the
    stations with the updated version of the KG climate classification [36,37] as
    the background. The number of stations that fell into each class is shown in the
    legend in brackets as a reminder. Figure 1. Geographical distribution of surface
    in situ PAR stations, with the Köppen–Geiger climate classification as the background
    [37] and the number of PAR stations falling into each class (between brackets
    in the legend). In our effort to ensure the best-quality data from PAR and GHI
    in situ ground measurement stations, we assessed the quality from an initial network
    of 47 stations based on the original measurement time step of each station. These
    47 stations were unevenly distributed within the footprint area of the MSG prime
    satellite: scarcer in South America, the Middle East, and Africa, and denser in
    Europe. In line with Thomas et al. [32], we first deployed the approach of Opálková
    et al. [38] as an adaptation of the quality control procedure of Korany et al.
    [39], which was applied to broadband irradiance measurements. This quality control
    turned out to be well-suited to the 30 min PAR measurements, for instance, at
    Aberystwyth University and Abbotts Hall, serving as a reference. In addition,
    further visual inspection of the data was carried out by means of plotting the
    PAR per hour and per day, for example. All investigations contributed to a powerful
    methodology for retaining the best quality of collected data. A data quality procedure
    was therefore implemented to verify the quality of the PAR measurements by eye.
    Factors considered included time shifts, shadows due to the potential shading
    of the instrument by buildings or trees, and progressive deviation or drift in
    the radiation measurements. In addition, the use of two interactive features enabled
    on-the-fly updates for all graphs and the identification of all reliable data.
    Table 2 summarizes the impact of the quality check procedure in terms of the number
    and percentage of discarded records. Table 2. The initial number of PAR records
    (column 2), the percentage of records discarded by the quality check (column 3),
    and the resulting final number of records available (column 4) at the original
    timestep of each of the 33 retained in situ measurement stations. The comparison
    of the satellite estimates with these in situ measurements was performed at a
    30 min timestep. Thirty minute values were computed if at least 85% of the records
    at the original timestep were available in the in situ measurement records. The
    statistical quantities or performance metrics used in this paper were mean bias
    error (MBE), standard deviation (STD), root mean square error (RMSE), and the
    Pearson correlation coefficient (CC). For all these indices, aside from the CC,
    absolute values in µmol m−2 s−1 are indicated, as well as relative values in percent
    with respect to the mean measurement value. 3. Methods to Derive PAR from Satellite
    Imagery This work extended the validation initiated in 2018 [32]. In the previous
    work, five methods to assess PAR from satellites were developed and evaluated
    at three sites in the United Kingdom. Among the investigated methods were PAR
    computed as the product of the clear-sky PAR by a physical quantity accounting
    for the attenuation of broadband radiation due solely to clouds. It was found
    that the latter method resulted in better performance than those multiplying the
    satellite-retrieved solar broadband irradiance by a constant coefficient. The
    best results obtained with these methods were synthesized by an MBE of −5 to 0
    µmol m−2 s−1 (−1% to 0% relative to the mean of the measurements), an RMSE of
    130 µmol m−2 s−1 (28%), and correlation coefficients exceeding 0.945. This paper
    aimed to check whether the conclusion previously drawn could be extended to a
    much wider set of sites in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and South America.
    3.1. Three Surface Solar Irradiance Resources: HC3, CAMS-Rad, and SARAH-3 In Thomas
    et al. [32], two surface solar irradiance (SSI) resources, HelioClim-3 version
    5 (HC3) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service radiation product in
    all-sky conditions (CAMS-Rad), were utilized. Both resources relied on CAMS McClear
    for cloud–free conditions [23,25]. The current version number is 3.1, and CAMS
    McClear has demonstrated for many years its capacity to provide accurate, reliable,
    and robust data and service availability entirely suited for academic and commercial
    purposes. The computation of the extinction of clouds in HC3 was performed by
    computing a cloud index from MSG images using the Heliosat-2 method [22,40]. CAMS-Rad
    relies on the more recent model Heliosat-4 [26] to provide an estimate of both
    the global and the direct component over a horizontal plane fully built on the
    separability model between cloud-free and cloud extinction models [41]. In version
    4 of CAMS-Rad, the cloud extinction is provided by the cloud properties from APOLLO
    NG (AVHRR Processing Scheme over Clouds, Land, and Oceans—New Generation, Qu et
    al. [26], supplied by DLR (the German Aerospace Center)). In both cases, 30 min
    averaged PAR were used in this work. A new SSI was added to our analysis here,
    SARAH-3 [42,43] from CM SAF (Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring)
    of EUMETSAT, provided by Deutscher WetterDienst (DWD). The SARAH-3 climate data
    record uses geostationary satellite observations from the Meteosat satellite series
    to provide 30 min instantaneous, daily, and monthly means of surface radiation
    parameters covering the time period from 1st January 1983 to 31st December 2020
    at a spatial resolution of 0.05° over the MSG prime coverage area. The surface
    radiation was also estimated using a so-called Heliosat approach [44]. In contrast
    to the Heliosat-4 method, the scheme used for SARAH-3 does not require the explicit
    estimation of cloud optical depth and other cloud parameters, but uses the effective
    cloud albedo (sometimes called the cloud index) derived directly from the satellite
    data in the visible channel to consider the cloud effect on surface irradiance.
    Besides the total and direct (horizontal and normal) surface solar radiation components,
    SARAH also provides information on sunshine duration. The improved consideration
    of snow-covered surfaces in the SARAH-3 climate data record results in substantially
    improved data quality compared to the previous version of the SARAH data record,
    SARAH-2.1, under these conditions. In addition, SARAH-3 now also provides information
    on spectral surface radiation parameters, e.g., PAR and daylight (DAL). The spectral
    information is estimated using the SPECMAGIC clear-sky model, which considers
    the irradiance in different so-called Kato bands [45]. The SARAH-3 climate data
    record is accompanied by an interim climate data record (ICDR), providing data
    from 2021 onwards with a temporal delay of about 5 days (not evaluated in this
    paper). 3.2. Two Groups of Methods First, we take care to distinguish between
    models and methods. In this respect, a method corresponds to the implementation
    of a model on a given SSI. Following the presentation of Thomas et al. [32], we
    defined two groups of methods. First, group 1 included all models that derive
    PAR information by multiplying the GHI component by a constant coefficient. The
    same three models were considered here: Jacovides; Udo and Aro (1999, named “Udo
    and Aro” hereafter); and Szeicz ([46], hereafter “Szeicz”). Their respective constant
    coefficients are 1.919 (initially optimized for Cyprus), 2.079 (for Nigeria),
    and 2.285 (for the United Kingdom). Note that Jacovides et al. [11] proposed a
    slightly higher value than 1.919 for Greece that was not considered here. The
    choice of these parameters was based on the study of Yu et al. [47], which provided
    a review of different coefficients that can be found in the literature. These
    three coefficients were applied to the GHI of HC3 to create methods M1, M2, and
    M3, and to the GHI of CAMS-Rad to create methods M6, M7, and M8. These six methods
    were, respectively, named “Jacovides from HC3”, “Udo and Aro from HC3”, “Szeicz
    from HC3”, “Jacovides from CAMS-Rad”, “Udo and Aro from CAMS-Rad”, and “Szeicz
    from CAMS-Rad”. Group 1 methods intrinsically assume that PAR can be inferred
    from GHI in both clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions using the same constant coefficient.
    Of course, this assumption is not fully correct, and scientists acknowledge that
    the relationship depends on atmospheric properties. Until now, methods have been
    developed using satellite-based measurements of atmospheric properties as inputs
    for estimating PAR in all-sky conditions. However, in general, the level of attenuation
    due to clouds is a function of the cloud modification factor (CMF) [41]. Su et
    al. [48] developed such an approach using atmospheric conditions from Clouds and
    the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) products and validated estimates with
    PAR measurements over the USA. Among the methods assessed by Thomas et al. [32],
    an approach using atmospheric properties based on CAMS-Rad was validated over
    the UK. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. [49] proposed a look-up table (LUT) approach using
    satellite observations from both MODIS and GOES-16 and compared outputs against
    PAR measurements from the SURFRAD network over the USA. More recently, Tang et
    al. [50] described a physical-based model using the latest International Satellite
    Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) H-series cloud products, MERRA-2 aerosol data,
    ERA5 surface variables, and MODIS and CLARA-2 albedo products. These authors validated
    PAR estimates with measurements over the USA and China. However, ground-based
    validations of such approaches are unfortunately lacking in other regions of the
    world. Group 2 was composed of methods that combine a CMF derived from an SSI
    with an accurate estimation of the spectral distribution in cloud-free conditions.
    The variable “BB CMF” designates a CMF computed in the broadband range, computed
    as the ratio between the GHI estimates in all-sky conditions and its corresponding
    estimates in cloud-free conditions. The first model was “Weighted_Kato with BB
    CMF”, that has already been described in Thomas et al. [32]. This model was the
    result of the PAR computed in cloud-free conditions obtained as a weighted function
    of the Kato bands [51], with an optimized version by Wandji Nyamsi et al. [52,53]
    that lies in the range [400, 700] nm, with BB CMF computed from an SSI. The model
    under cloud-free conditions has already been successfully validated for PAR as
    well as UV and daylight radiation [54,55,56,57]. The SSIs were HC3 to generate
    method M4 and CAMS-Rad to create M9, respectively named “Weighted_Kato with BB
    CMF from HC3” and “Weighted_Kato with BB CMF from CAMS-Rad”. A new model was explored
    in this paper: it combines the same Weighted_Kato model for clear-sky conditions
    in the PAR range, but with a spectral version of the cloud extinction tailored
    for PAR. We define “PAR CMF” as the ratio between PAR and PAR in cloud-free conditions.
    PAR CMF is a function of the cloud optical depth (COD), the cloud type (water
    or ice), and BB CMF. As the spectral version of the cloud extinction in the PAR
    range has never been introduced before, Section 3.3 is dedicated to its description.
    This model was applied to HC3 to create method M5 and CAMS-Rad to create method
    M10. Their names are, respectively, “Weighted_Kato with PAR CMF from HC3” and
    “Weighted_Kato with PAR CMF from CAMS-Rad”. Beside broadband products, SARAH-3
    proposes PAR estimates based on a group 2-type approach. SARAH clear-sky surface
    radiation is simulated in the 32 Kato spectral bands using the spectral clear-sky
    model SPECMAGIC [45]. PAR also exploits a weighted function of the Kato coefficients
    that lie in the spectral range covered by PAR in cloud-free conditions. The 30
    min instantaneous PAR data derived from SARAH-3 were temporally interpolated to
    time series with a 1 min resolution (following [19]) and, subsequently, averaged
    over 30 min to match the temporal resolution of the surface measurements. This
    PAR product is named “SARAH-3” in the remainder of the document and corresponds
    to method M11. Due to their simplicity, group 1 methods have the advantage of
    rapid calculation in real time. The data storage capacity required to produce
    such time series is also much smaller than for those in group 2. Another strength
    of such empirical approaches is that long-term PAR measurements immediately become
    available as soon as archives of in situ or satellite GHI are released. However,
    several publications have reported a limitation of group 1 methods related to
    their sensitivity to sky conditions and atmospheric properties such as water vapor
    or aerosol contents [54,56]. Table 3 presents a summary of the methods and groups.
    Table 3. Methods (MX) used to estimate PAR from satellite imagery evaluated in
    this paper and their groups. Group 1 methods define models that apply a constant
    coefficient directly to the GHI component. Group 2 methods provide a more accurate
    description of the radiation content in cloud-free conditions according to specific
    spectral bands (the Kato bands), which are then multiplied by a BB or PAR CMF.
    3.3. Towards an Optimal Cloud Extinction Method Dedicated to PAR To retrieve the
    PAR CMF from the BB CMF at ground level, our approach was to establish a simple
    relationship between PAR and BB CMFs using radiative transfer simulations performed
    with the radiative transfer model (RTM) libRadtran 2.0.3 [58,59] combined with
    a cloud product based on the Heliosat-4 method [26]. The cloud properties were
    derived from 15 min temporal resolution images of the MSG satellites using an
    adapted APOLLO (AVHRR Processing Scheme over Clouds, Land, and Oceans) scheme
    and mainly comprised cloud optical depth (COD), cloud coverage, and cloud type.
    The latter is currently used for identifying either water or ice clouds. To develop
    the relationship, several atmospheric states were randomly built using a Monte
    Carlo technique generating a large number of vectors as inputs for the RTM. An
    atmospheric state in cloud-free conditions is a combination of the solar zenith
    angle, ground albedo, total column ozone and water vapor content, vertical profile
    of temperature, pressure, density, volume mixing ratio for gases as a function
    of altitude, aerosol optical depth at 550 nm, aerosol type, and elevation of the
    ground above sea level. For all-sky conditions, an atmospheric state was defined
    as the combination of an atmospheric state in cloud-free conditions and the cloud
    properties COD, cloud base height, cloud geometrical thickness, and cloud phase.
    The statistical distributions of atmospheric variables describing cloud-free atmospheric
    states and cloud properties are summarized in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.
    Table 4. Statistical distributions of values taken by the cosine of the solar
    zenith angle (SZA), the ground albedo, and the 7 variables describing the clear
    atmosphere. Table 5. Cloud properties. Five thousand cloud-free atmospheric states
    were randomly produced based on Table 4. Each cloud-free atmospheric state was
    then associated with a specific combination of COD, cloud base height, cloud geometrical
    thickness, and cloud phase based on Table 5. For any other variables, default
    values of libRadtran were used, such as for cloud liquid content and droplet effective
    radius (1.0 g m−3 and 10 μm for water clouds, and 0.005 g m−3 and 20 μm for ice
    clouds, respectively). All other settings for clouds were set to the default values
    of libRadtran. The solar spectrum of Gueymard [60] was used. Figure 2 shows the
    ratio of the PAR CMF to BB CMF for ice clouds (left) and water clouds (right)
    as a function of COD ranging from 0 to 100. Figure 2. Simulation results of the
    ratio of PAR CMF to BB CMF for ice clouds (left) and water clouds (right) as function
    of cloud optical depth. The mean values of the boxes are marked with a red dot.
    The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles are marked with a blue line. The results demonstrated
    that the ratio strongly depended on the COD and that it could be approximated
    as 𝐶𝑀 𝐹 𝑃𝐴𝑅 = 𝑒 −( 𝑎 0 + 𝑎 1 𝐶𝑂𝐷+ 𝑎 2 𝐶𝑂 𝐷 2 + 𝑎 3 𝐶𝑂 𝐷 3 ) 𝐶𝑀 𝐹 𝐵𝐵 , (1) where
    ax with x in the range [0; 3] depends on the cloud type. The values of these coefficients
    are given in Table 6 for a COD below 100 and above 100. Table 6. Values for a0,
    a1, a2, and a3 parameters for APOLLO cloud optical depths below and above 100.
    4. Results The statistical quantities and MBE, STD, RMSE, and CC indices were
    first computed for each station separately in all-weather conditions (the results
    are available in Table S1 of the Supplemental Materials). The computation of four
    statistical quantities to evaluate the performance of the 11 methods at 33 stations
    generated a huge number of results. To ease the interpretation of the results,
    we first computed a single set of statistical results averaged across all stations
    (Figure 3). Figure 3. Statistical results averaged across the 33 stations for
    each method, M1–M11. (a) Relative MBE (%); (b) relative STDEV (%); (c) relative
    RMSE (%); (d) CC. The 3 colors depict the SSIs with which the methods were computed:
    HC3 in purple, CAMS-Rad in turquoise, and SARAH-3 in khaki. Methods were M1: Jacovides
    from HC3; M2: Udo et Aro from HC3; M3: Szeicz from HC3; M4: Weighted_Kato with
    BB CMF from HC3; M5: Weighted_Kato with PAR CMF from HC3; M6: Jacovides from CAMS-Rad;
    M7: Udo et Aro from CAMS-Rad; M8: Szeicz from CAMS-Rad; M9: Weighted_Kato with
    BB CMF from CAMS-Rad; M10: Weighted_Kato with PAR CMF from CAMS-Rad; and M11:
    SARAH-3. The MBE averaged across sites ranged from 1% to 21% between methods,
    with a tendency for all methods to generally overestimate PAR (positive biases).
    One of the reasons for this might have been the overestimation of CAM-Rad and
    HC3 in overcast situations [26,61]. Aside from M3 and M8, the MBE did not exceed
    10%. While the STDEVs for M3 and M8 reached 31 and 29%, respectively, all other
    methods returned comparable values of 25–26%. The RMSE results aligned with the
    other statistical metrics: A lower performance for M3 and M8 and similar, more
    favorable results for the other methods. All CC values ranged between 0.955 and
    0.958, meaning that all methods could capture the temporal variations in the PAR
    measurements. Considering all four metrics, M1 (Jacovides from HC3) was the best
    overall method, followed by M6 (Jacovides from CAMS-RAD) and M4 (Weighted_Kato
    with BB CMF from HC3). The poorest results were achieved by M3 and M8, with a
    strong overestimation of the radiation levels. Summarizing method performance
    in this way via a single set of statistics averaged over many locations provided
    an easy means of identifying outlier methods. However, it may not have been entirely
    reliable in revealing important details relating to regional climate and topographic
    effects. Consequently, we further assessed the suitability of this approach by
    comparing the results against those generated for specific station groups. Twelve
    groups were defined based on: (1) a careful investigation of the statistical results
    for each station; (2) the geographical location and the proximity to the coverage
    limits of MSG; and (3) the climate of each station. These groups offered a suitable
    compromise between the importance of local characteristics versus the need for
    a manageable dataset. They are described in Table 7 in decreasing order of the
    number of stations in each group. Table 7. PAR station groups and climate classification.
    Color code is equivalent to Table 1. For the first five groups comprising more
    than one station, we investigated their representativity by exploring the spread
    of the values with the statistical indicators of each method (second column of
    Table 8) and the range of these statistical indicators across group sites (third
    column of Table 8). The spread of values was reduced by at least 30%, reaching
    and even exceeding 50% for all MBE values and all indices of group 2 to 4. The
    maximum amplitude was slightly reduced by a few percent for all indices of the
    “Western Europe” group aside from MBE. This spread was mainly due to the results
    obtained for EFDC_IE-Dri in Ireland, where the methods performed worse than for
    other sites in this group. Note that the same remarks apply to the measurement
    site EFDC_UK-Amo, for which the conclusions also coincided with those for the
    “Western Europe” group. However, due to the proximity of this station to the edge
    of the MSG disk, all methods showed significantly degraded performances due to
    cloud cover, spatial resolution, and parallax issues. Therefore, this site was
    excluded from the results for the “Western Europe” group. For the STD and RMSE
    of the “Central Spain” group, the maximum amplitude was reduced by approx. 30%.
    For the rest of the statistics, the amplitude decreased by 50 to 75%. Table 8.
    Group representativity expressed as the standard deviation values (column 2) and
    the range (column 3) computed for each statistical quantity. The first row shows
    the results for all stations, and the 5 subsequent rows correspond to the first
    5 groups comprising more than 1 station. The analysis of each separate station
    combined with this investigation of the distribution of the statistical results
    led to the conclusion that we could more confidently rely on the group statistical
    results to evaluate the performance of the methods. While each group comprised
    stations that belonged to the same KG class, a limitation of the KG climate classification
    is that it is only based on precipitation and temperature, and not radiation and
    cloud cover. Climate classifications like KG aim to categorize vegetation zones
    using only climate variables. However, a dry season without clouds and a dry season
    with low clouds result in very different climates. For instance, Zscheischler
    et al. [62] explored different combinations of climate and remotely sensed vegetation
    variables to propose a new classification. Using unsupervised learning methods,
    they identified a stable group of 12 clusters (Figure S13 in the Supplementary
    Materials) that could be explored in further analysis. The results per group and
    per method are presented in Table 9. The performance level was ranked according
    to the uncertainty of the measurements themselves. Table 9. Statistical results
    per group and per method. Units: µmol m−2 s−1 and percent. NBDATA: number of 30
    min records available in the group. Color indicates the performance level of methods
    between groups: the best method is shown in green with the lowest MBE absolute
    value, good methods in light green with the second lowest MBE absolute value,
    bad methods in light red with the second highest MBE absolute value, and the worst
    method in red with the highest MBE absolute value for each group. 5. Interpretation
    of Results The statistical performance metrics averaged across sites presented
    in Figure 3 are also shown for each group in Figures S1–S12 of the Supplementary
    Materials. Meanwhile, Figure S14 of the Supplementary Materials shows a clear
    illustration of the relative performance of the methods using podiums for each
    group, also including the KG class color as a reminder, making it easy to quickly
    identify spatial patterns of performance. The first observation was that M1, M4,
    and M6 tended to outperform other methods, with numerous “green” values in the
    corresponding boxes. On the contrary, the table highlightes that M3 and M8 provided
    the lowest performance, with a strong overestimation of PAR at most sites. The
    performance of these two methods is not discussed further in this section. This
    confirmed the interpretation of the metrics computed when averaged across all
    sites. The performance of methods in the “Western Europe” group was good. The
    CCs were excellent, with values above 0.95, and the STD and RMSE ranged between
    23 and 26%. The best MBE was achieved by methods M4 (relative bias of 1%) and
    M6 (−1%), followed by M1 (−3%) and M9 (3%), and a relative bias of around 6% was
    achieved by the remainder of the methods. M4 is therefore a good candidate for
    this area. HC3 methods (i.e., M1 to M5) performed slightly better than CAMS-Rad
    (M6 to M10) and SARAH-3 (M11) methods. As previously mentioned, the Scottish station
    EFDC_UK-Amo belonged to the “Western Europe” group, as both the climate and the
    observations of the results led to similar conclusions regarding the final ranking
    of the stations. However, this dataset was excluded from the statistics because
    the resulting MBEs obtained for all methods increased by 5 to 10%, the STD by
    10 to 15%, and the RMSE by 5 to 15%, and the CCs decreased by approximately 0.05.
    The anomalous behavior at this site relative to all others could be explained
    by its proximity to the limit of the satellite coverage, which led to an increase
    in the size of the MSG pixel in this area to approx. 12 km and a decrease in precision
    for the estimation of radiation at ground level. In the “Central Europe” group,
    methods based on HC3 exhibited a smaller overestimation of PAR than in the “Western
    Europe” group. As all other metrics aside from MBE exhibited similar results,
    only MBE was capable of characterizing method performance. M1 was the best method,
    with an MBE of zero, followed by M4 and M6 (3%). Overestimation was still observed
    for all methods, which could be explained once again by the difficulty of modeling
    cloud coverage with SSIs. Stations in the “Eastern Europe” group fell into the
    same KG class as those in the “Central Europe” group. The interpretations were
    similar to those for the “Central Europe” group, except that: (1) the HC3 and
    CAMS-Rad methods gave very similar statistical results whatever the metric; (2)
    all methods strongly overestimated PAR, though M1 and M6 performed best; and (3)
    the results for continental stations exhibited similar patterns but degraded as
    we moved from the “Central Europe” group to the “Eastern Europe” group—the MBE
    increased by approx. 8% and the STD by 7%, and the CC decreased by 0.02. The reason
    for such increases in the error rate from the “Central Europe” group to the “Eastern
    Europe” group could be explained by the proximity of the stations to the edge
    of the MSG coverage, as in the case of EFDC_UK-Amo for the “Western Europe” stations.
    Another alternative explanation could be related to the existence of a different
    type of cloud coverage that is not considered in the KG classification. M11 offered
    a satisfactory performance in this area, close to that of the other methods. The
    area covered by the “Central Spain” stations corresponded to a zone of transition
    between an oceanic climate located in the western part of Europe and the Mediterranean
    Sea. Consequently, we would have expected that the statistical results would be
    in between the “Western Europe” group and the “Mediterranean” group. However,
    it is interesting to observe that the results were very close to those obtained
    for the “Central Europe” group, except that the MBE increased by approx. 5%. As
    this intermediate area might be drier and have smaller cloud coverage, we expected
    an improvement in the statistics, which was not observed here. Despite this observation,
    the podium of the best-performing methods was identical to that of the two nearby
    groups, “Western Europe” and “Mediterranean”, with M1 in first position, followed
    by M4 and M6. As we moved south toward drier areas from the “Western Europe” group
    down to the “Mediterranean” group, the STD, RMSE, and CC improved, with an increase
    in the MBEs of approx. 2%. The relative ranking of the methods was identical.
    The Moldovan station [63] demonstrated similar results in terms of STD, RMSE,
    and CC to the “Western Europe” group, except that all MBE values decreased by
    approx. 7%, leading to different conclusions in terms of method ranking. Methods
    that usually strongly overestimated PAR now showed the best performance. Five
    methods were now in first position on the podium: M2, M5, M7, M10, and M11. This
    fall observed for all MBEs could be explained by the models overestimating cloud
    coverage in this area. A more detailed investigation of the results would have
    been needed to explore whether specific local events occurred on certain days,
    for instance, haze during winter mornings, which could have been misinterpreted
    by the satellite as cloud coverage. A seasonal analysis would also help to distinguish
    whether a particular season was more affected by this underestimation. In line
    with the interpretations for the “Moldova” group, we observed lower MBEs than
    for other groups for the Israeli site as well, although the decrease in this case
    was only 4%. As the Israeli station was in an arid area, the improvements of approx.
    10 to 12% for both the STD and RMSE and a decrease of approx. 0.02 for the CC
    were consistent with the occurrence of clear-sky conditions at this location.
    The best-performing method was M10, which exhibited an MBE equal to 0, followed
    by M5 (−1%) and M4 (1%). The conclusions for both the “Moldova” and “Israel” groups
    contrasted with those of the other groups, highlighting the importance of investigating
    local trends. Similar trends were observed for the “Uruguay” group, with MBEs
    reduced by approx. 5 to 6%, leading to a strong underestimation by methods M1
    and M6 of approx. 8%. Contrary to conclusions elsewhere, the best-performing methods
    were M10, M7, M11, and M12, with MBEs close to 0, an STD and RMSE of approx. 17
    to 19%, and a CC of 0.96. The spectral extinction of clouds improved the MBE but,
    unfortunately, degraded the other metrics. It could be noted that the use of this
    spectral cloud extinction method was more efficient for CAMS-Rad SSI than for
    HC3 at this site. The tropical stations of both the “Congo” and “French Guyana”
    groups (KG class “Am”) exhibited similar results. Methods based on HC3 performed
    better than those using CAMS-Rad or SARAH-3, and this was especially clear for
    “Congo”. One reason for the decreased level of performance of M11 (SARAH-3) might
    have been that this model uses a climatology of aerosol optical depth, which could
    have degraded the data quality in Central Africa. M1 (Jacovides from HC3) was
    the best method for both sites, generating an underestimation of PAR for “Congo”
    of 4% and an MBE of zero for “French Guyana”. Metrics for all other methods seemed
    to worsen when moving from “Congo” to “French Guyana”. This finding was similar
    to that for the station EFDC_Uk-Amo in the “Western Europe” group, probably also
    due to the station’s proximity to the edge of the MSG coverage, in this case the
    western limit. The overestimation of all methods was emphasized for “French Guyana”,
    with an increase in the MBE of approx. 5%, probably due once again to the difficulty
    faced by satellite methods in the accurate detection of cloud cover in areas where
    the spatial resolution of the satellite is important. Parallax issues were caused
    by the line of sight of the satellite, which sees clouds from the side in this
    area, leading to a shift of clouds away from the nadir, and contributed to the
    less precise modeling of cloud cover once more. This was also confirmed by the
    decrease in the CC of approx. 0.02, demonstrating issues in capturing the variability
    at ground level. Despite a slight underestimation, M1 remained the best-performing
    method for the “South Africa” group. The podium was completed by M4 and M6, in
    line with the performances observed in Europe and at tropical sites. More precisely,
    the order of method performances resembled that of the “French Guyana” group,
    but with far better performance on this site, probably due to the lower cloud
    coverage. HC3 performed better than the two other SSIs. However, a more comprehensive
    assessment is needed at this site due to the very reduced dataset for this location
    of only 4833 available 30 min records after the quality check. The site in Senegal
    exhibited similar results to the “South Africa” group, but with a larger underestimation
    for most of the HC3-based methods. The fall in the PAR level was so significant
    that M3, so far rejected by all metrics in all other groups, now became a good
    candidate when considering MBEs. Compared to group 1, all MBEs decreased to 10
    to 15% for all methods, except for M11, where the fall was limited to 5%, meaning
    that the method still strongly overestimated PAR. The weather was mainly cloud-free
    in this area, leading to enhanced STD, RMSE, and CC results compared to those
    obtained for South Africa. Regarding all metrics, the best method was M6, followed
    by M2 and M9. 6. Lessons Learned and Recommendations As expected, the STD, RMSE,
    and CC results were enhanced when the weather was mainly cloud-free, since it
    is easier to model cloud-free situations. This was the case in the Mediterranean
    Sea, Israel, Senegal, South Africa, and Uruguay. Globally, the correlation coefficients
    of the methods ranged from 0.91 to 0.97, depending on the group, showing that
    they were all capable of capturing local fluctuations in PAR levels. In Europe,
    Congo, French Guyana, and South Africa, M1, M4, and M6 were usually on the podiums.
    Other conclusions for these areas were that most methods overestimated PAR, and
    that the HC3-based methods demonstrated better or similar overall performance
    compared to those based on CAMS-Rad. In the other areas (Moldova, Israel, Senegal,
    and Uruguay), the overestimation was less pronounced. In fact, in a few cases,
    the methods could sometimes underestimate PAR. This observation was particularly
    valid for the HC3-based methods, leading to other methods that performed best,
    such as M2, M5, M7, M9, M10, and M11. In these areas, the CAMS-Rad-based methods
    demonstrated better or similar overall performance compared to the HC3-based methods.
    M11 (SARAH-3) mostly demonstrated an intermediate performance when compared to
    the other methods. However, it provided a good overall compromise, as its performance
    was more stable across space than methods based on the two other SSIs. Figure
    S15 in the Supplementary Materials summarizes the range of optimal coefficients
    to assess PAR from the GHI of HC3. Note that the same analysis and illustration
    could be produced based on CAMS-Rad, and that the advantage in deriving PAR from
    a Copernicus resource is that it is accessible for free and will be maintained
    through different CAMS projects into the future. Consequently, the service is
    sustainable and can support both academic and commercial applications. Another
    improvement for this work would be to create a specific group for the station
    EFDC_UK-Amo considering the statistical results for this station relative to those
    obtained for Western Europe, in a similar manner to the tropical station of French
    Guyana when compared to the results obtained for the Congolese stations. We would
    have expected an improvement in the results when switching from a broadband to
    a spectral extinction of clouds, i.e., when switching from M4 and M9 to M5 and
    M10, respectively, as the latter models were tuned to more accurately estimate
    the impact of clouds in the 400–700 nm range. This was only the case, however,
    for the sites of Moldova and Israel. Here, we explored the performance of the
    methods as a function of the type of sky, with either cloud-free or overcast conditions.
    These conditions were extracted from the “all-weather” dataset by computing PAR
    CMF > 0.8 for cloud-free and PAR CMF < 0.3 for overcast conditions. Note that
    PAR 30 min records below 50 µmol m−2 s−1 were discarded. Results in cloud-free
    and overcast conditions are shown in Tables S2 and S3, respectively, of the Supplementary
    Materials. There were no reasons why stations would be statistically gathered
    in the same groups. Therefore, results are presented for each station separately.
    In cloud-free conditions, all MBEs declined, resembling the MBE distributions
    of Uruguay and Moldova in all-weather conditions. The underestimation of the radiation
    in cloud-free conditions was even more significant for sites located at the highest
    latitudes. As both types of SSI exploited CAMS McClear, the PAR methods performed
    relatively similarly for CAMS-Rad and HC3. However, the differences observed in
    two locations when the PAR CMF was greater than 0.8 were mostly due to the presence
    of clouds, yielding a PAR CMF other than 1 for completely clear-sky situations.
    M11 showed good performance, generally reaching third position on the podium.
    An important remark is that M5 and M10 always performed better than M4 and M9,
    respectively. In overcast conditions, the trends and observations were very similar
    to those in all-weather situations, since clouds are the main factor that affects
    PAR levels. Overestimation by the methods was frequent, leading to optimal coefficients
    that should be decreased. In these weather conditions, M5 and M10 were always
    worse than M4 and M9, respectively. Contrary to clear-sky conditions, there were
    strong differences in behavior for CAMS-Rad-based methods compared to HC3-based
    methods. For almost all sites, CC was better for CAMS-Rad-based methods, whereas
    the MBE, STD, and RMSE were improved using HC3. M11 had difficulty in accurately
    modeling cloud cover and was usually ranked in the second half of methods in overcast
    conditions. To complement this analysis, we considered the extent to which the
    correction of the bias for HC3 or CAMS-Rad impacted the results as it rectified
    potential errors in the surface solar irradiance map using a global default correction.
    We tried to temporarily discard the correction and re-process the evaluation of
    the method performances. The results showed strong degradation, demonstrating
    the necessity to maintain the correction for both SSI computations, and that this
    did not cause the underperformance of the spectral version of the cloud extinction
    model. Another potential issue of such a model based on discrete cloud type values
    might also be the creation of discontinuities in surface solar PAR maps, as well
    as temporal discontinuities when transitioning from one cloud type to another
    during the day. Another limitation relates to the current implementation of the
    PAR CMF using COD from APOLLO, which is currently difficult to retrieve operationally:
    the 1 min verbose mode is required, which is computationally expensive and requires
    a large storage capacity, making real time operation difficult. Based on these
    findings, we concluded that this version of the spectral extinction of clouds
    is not yet suited to accurately simulating radiation transfer under conditions
    of a high COD. Several recommendations follow from this investigation: We statistically
    assessed the performance of the current model as a function of each APOLLO cloud
    type to highlight where the largest errors lay. Furthermore, due to the increase
    in the signal-to-noise ratio in the early morning and in the afternoon, the performance
    should also be evaluated as a function of the elevation angle. The higher the
    cloud thickness, the less precise APOLLO. The expression that derived the PAR
    CMF as a function of the BB CMF, COD, and cloud type also combined the uncertainties
    of the subjacent models. Therefore, another alternative should be to explore an
    expression that avoids dependence on the COD but pays more attention to the type
    of weather, such as PAR CMF = a × BB CMF + b, where a and b would depend on the
    type of cloud (water/ice) and the type of weather: overcast skies, broken cloud
    conditions, and close to clear-sky conditions. 7. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations
    This study assessed the performance of 11 methods for estimating surface PAR from
    satellite imagery in all-sky conditions at 33 ground-based stations. The set of
    33 ground-based stations resulted from a careful inspection of the quality of
    a larger set of 47 ground-based stations located in the MSG prime field of view,
    from which only reliable measurements were retained. The relative uncertainty
    of good-quality measurements is likely to be less stringent for PAR than GHI,
    for which the targeted uncertainty from Baseline Surface Radiation Network measurements
    is 2% [64] due to the need for highly accurate solar energy generation estimates.
    In all-weather or overcast conditions, M1, M4, and M6 met this requirement and
    should be preferred in Europe, Congo, French Guyana, and South Africa. For other
    areas, M2, M5, M7, M9, M10, and M11 are good options. M2 and M5 were the best
    candidates in cloud-free conditions for most sites. M3 and M8 overestimated the
    PAR levels for most sites and should only be considered when SSIs underestimate
    radiation. The performance of the HC3- and CAMS-Rad-based methods depended on
    the geographical location. This observation was less the case for SARAH-3, with
    a more stable performance across sites, except for Central Africa. Group 1 methods
    that compute PAR by multiplying the GHI by a constant coefficient offer an excellent
    compromise in terms of accuracy, ease of implementation, and capacity to be deployed
    in real time. Moreover, PAR estimates are immediately available as soon as a GHI
    estimate is available around the world. Our analysis demonstrated that an optimal
    coefficient should depend on both the geographical area and the type of sky. Group
    2 methods that rely on a more accurate modeling of the cloud-free and cloudy state
    of the atmosphere in the PAR spectral range provide pioneering opportunities for
    research and development. However, they rely on several different resources with
    both individual and combined levels of uncertainty. In particular, the spectral
    extinction of clouds as explored in this paper is well-suited for low COD values,
    but still needs some refinements for higher COD values. As errors accumulate,
    a simpler function of the PAR CMF based only on the BB CMF, type of cloud, and
    type of sky might be a promising method to explore. However, despite these advantages,
    group 2 methods are computationally expensive in terms of both CPU time and memory
    allocation. In sum, while group 2 methods aim at the better characterization of
    the atmospheric effects impacting the estimation of PAR, they do not at the moment
    appear to offer significant benefits over the simpler, less computationally expensive
    group one methods, though this may change with further research and development.

    exchanges with all data providers, interaction with DWD to receive and adapt SARAH-3
    datasets to support the research approach, the generation of all PAR time series
    estimated from satellite imagery, the validation of model performance at all sites
    except the site in Uruguay, and the writing of the paper and production of most
    of the figures. W.W.N. challenged the assumption that clouds are spectrally neutral
    under the supervision of A.A. (Antti Arola). He developed a spectral version of
    cloud extinction. He also regularly interacted and provided relevant feedback
    to Claire in her task of validating the satellite PAR methods. He was the author
    of the description of associated methods M5 and M10. U.P. and J.T. provided the
    SARAH-3 time series at all ground sites. They wrote the text describing the model
    and reviewed the whole paper before submission. S.D. sourced several in situ UK
    datasets: Aberystwyth University and Abbotts Hall. With his extensive and relevant
    experience in both research and industry in the PAR domain, S.D. wrote major elements
    of the framework and state-of-the-art approaches in this paper as well as optimizing
    the English language. A.L. carried out the quality assessment of the methods at
    the site in Uruguay. C.T. and A.L. also had an earlier opportunity to work together
    on similar evaluation activities regarding the performance of alternative satellite
    methods for the assessment of ultra-violet radiation. It is obvious that this
    collaboration contributed to the development of combined expertise with respect
    to spectral radiation assessment. M.F. provided all the high-quality datasets
    from the Czech Republic. With numerous discussions and exchanges of experience
    in the last few years, Milan actively contributed to this effort by providing
    an alternative and complementary vision of this quality assessment work. Last
    but not least, A.A. (Alexandr Aculinin) supplied the very long-term and excellent-quality
    dataset at Kishinev, Moldova. His extensive experience and great generosity contributed
    relevance and coherence to this work. All authors have read and agreed to the

  description: 'The goal of irrigation for wine grape grown in arid or semiarid regions
    is to sustain vine survival and to optimize berry attributes for quality wine
    production. Precision irrigation of wine grape is impeded by the lack of a smart,
    decision support system (DSS) to remotely monitor vine water status. The objectives
    of this study were to: develop and field test an Internet of Things (IoT) DSS
    system for precision irrigation of wine grape. The IoT system was comprised of
    a suite of in situ sensors used to monitor real-time weather conditions, grapevine
    canopy temperature, soil moisture, and irrigation amount. Sensor data were collected
    and stored on a field deployed data logger that calculated a daily thermal Crop
    Water Stress Index (CWSI) for grapevine using a neural network model with real-time
    sensor data model inputs. The data logger also hosted, via a cellular modem, webpages
    showing a running, 12-day history of daily CWSI, fraction of available soil moisture
    (fASW), irrigation amount, and other sensor data. The webpages were accessible
    to vineyard managers via cell phone or computer. The CWSI based IoT DDS system
    was installed at two small acreage, commercial estate vineyards in southwestern
    Idaho USA over four growing seasons. At each vineyard site, the DSS was used daily
    by the vineyard irrigation manager to schedule irrigation events. Neither vineyard
    manager used any other quantitative vine water status monitoring tool for irrigation
    management decisions. The midday leaf water potential (LWP) of grapevines was
    routinely measured by research project personnel. Data collected over the study
    period at each vineyard showed a significant (p < 0.001) correlation with LWP
    and fASW, providing evidence that, under the conditions of this study, the daily
    CWSI based IoT provided automated, remote monitoring of vine water status. Both
    vineyard managers reported daily use of the DSS for irrigation scheduling decisions.
    Over the four-year study, each vineyard manager was able to maintain consistent
    seasonal average CWSI daily values and irrigation application amounts, despite
    yearly differences in climatic conditions. The results of this study demonstrate
    that a CWSI based IoT DSS can be used for precision irrigation of wine grape in
    a commercial vineyard under semiarid growing conditions. The CWSI based IoT DSS
    used a unique combination of neural network modeling, edge computing, and IoT
    for real-time vine water stress monitoring for precision irrigation.'

    support systemInternet of Things 1. Introduction Irrigation management of most
    field crops aims to avoid plant water stress and maximize yield by supplying water
    to fully meet crop evapotranspiration (ETc). However, in wine grape (Vitis vinifera
    L.), fruit quality attributes are prioritized over yield as a production goal,
    and development of the berry and vine canopy are related to vine water status
    throughout the growing season [1,2]. For example, mild vine water stress between
    veraison (berry softening) and harvest is desirable to prevent berry splitting
    or dilution of flavors or sugars and to slow canopy growth in preparation for
    winter dormancy. Inducing vine water stress through deficit irrigation has also
    been shown to increase vine water use efficiency [3], [4], [5]. Water resources
    in the western U.S. are experiencing unprecedented competitive demand from irrigated
    agriculture, growing urban populations, and environmental and ecosystem restoration.
    Groundwater levels in many areas have steadily decreased from historic levels
    and ground water use is approaching an unsustainable level. In addition, the western
    US is experiencing the worst megadrought since 800 CE [6] leading to historically
    low water levels in many of the regions water reservoirs. Warmer winter temperatures
    due to climate change are predicted to reduce future mountain snowpack, which
    is the source of early irrigation developments in much of the western U.S. The
    growing demand on surface and groundwater resources combined with climate change
    necessitates increased water resource stewardship and crop water productivity
    to meet food and fiber needs of a growing population. Wine grape production in
    semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. is well established but relies
    on irrigation during the growing season for vine growth, survival, and economically
    viable yield. Optimum management of irrigation requires routine direct or indirect
    monitoring of vine water status [7]. Indirect methods for accessing plant water
    status include soil water content or soil water potential measurement and atmospheric-based
    methods [7,8]. Soil water monitoring is a widely accepted tool for estimating
    crop water needs for field crops but in the case of vineyards there are several
    disadvantages. These include spatial variability in soil characteristics and 3-dimensional
    soil wetting patterns from drip irrigation leading to the need to install several
    sensors, which complicates information management and increases cost. Additionally,
    there is a lack of established thresholds for determining vine water status and
    severity [7]. Atmospheric based methods include Bowen ratio energy balance and
    eddy covariance to determine ETc and infer plant water status by comparing measured
    ETc to estimated non-water stressed ETc. These techniques require expensive sensors,
    skilled technical knowledge, and large uniform upwind fetch, especially for eddy
    covariance, which make them unsuited for small commercial vineyard water management
    purposes [7]. A more detailed discussion of indirect methods is provided by Rienth
    and Scholasch [8]. Direct (plant-based) methods for determining plant water status
    rely on measurements of physical plant variables. Unlike indirect methods, plant-based
    methods use the plant as a biosensor in a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Conventional
    direct methods include leaf or stem water potential, visual observation, stomatal
    conductance or photosynthesis, sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor pressure
    [7,9]. Midday stem or leaf water potential (LWP) is the most commonly accepted
    direct measurement of vine water status [10] and critical upper and lower water
    stress thresholds have been established [7], making it an effective tool for deficit
    irrigation management. The primary disadvantages of LWP are the limited time of
    day for measurement, the need for repeated measurements due to plant variability,
    and a need for several equipped and trained personnel to cover a vineyard. Visual
    observation is based on the visual growth characteristics of the apical meristem
    or apex of vines, tendrils, and leaf orientation of numerous vines [1,8]. The
    drawbacks of this method include low sensitivity to moderate water stress, time
    lag between water stress and visual observation, and the cost of trained personnel
    to cover a vineyard. Stomatal conductance measures the ease of passage of CO2
    or water vapor through the stomata and is a good indicator of plant response to
    water stress because it changes with atmospheric demand and soil water status.
    It has been shown to indicate the degree of vine water stress but varies with
    timing of measurement and leaf canopy location [7]. The primary disadvantages
    are the cost of the equipment, constant need for calibration, technical skill
    to operate. Sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor are direct measures that
    have been shown to be indictors of plant water stress. However, they have not
    been widely adopted in regional commercial vineyards but have the advantage of
    being automated, which facilitates integration into a deficit irrigation management
    program. Detailed descriptions of other direct methods and their respective advantages
    and disadvantages are provided by [7], [8], [9]. Plant canopy temperature increases
    when solar radiation is absorbed and cools when water is evaporated (transpiration)
    within the leaf structure. A water-stressed plant canopy will reduce transpiration
    and have a higher temperature than a non-stressed canopy [11,12]. This physical
    plant response to water stress makes canopy temperature measurement a viable direct
    method for assessing plant water status. Infrared radiometers have been used to
    measure plant canopy temperature under research field conditions to estimate evapotranspiration
    and drought stress in many crops [13], [14], [15], including grape [16], [17],
    [18], [19], [20], [21]. Infrared thermometry is nondestructive, can be measured
    continuously, can be stationary or mounted on mobile platforms for spatial and
    temporal monitoring [9,[20], [21], [22]], and can be less expensive [23] than
    soil water sensing. Canopy temperature is related to plant water status, but it
    also depends upon solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (Ta), humidity (RH), and
    wind speed (WS) among other things. A method of using canopy temperature to calculate
    a CWSI for irrigation scheduling was proposed over 40 years ago by Idso et al.
    [15] and Jackson et al. [14]. The CWSI normalizes measured canopy temperature
    relative to reference threshold canopy temperatures for a well-watered vine (TLL)
    and a water stressed, non-transpiring vine (TUL) under identical weather conditions,
    resulting in an empirical CWSI value between, 0 (no water stress) and 1 (maximum
    water stress). Unfortunately, the need for TLL and TUL reference temperatures
    under identical weather conditions has limited the use of a CWSI to research scale
    studies and precluded its adoption on a commercial scale [9]. Alternatives to
    actual measurement of crop reference temperatures have been investigated, such
    as artificial wet and dry surfaces [16,[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]] and
    physical and empirical models [14,26,[30], [31], [32], [33]] to predict reference
    temperatures. The required maintenance of an artificial surface has limited use
    on a commercial scale, leaving physical or empirical models as the most logical
    choice. King et al. [33] used measured temperatures of non-water stressed wine
    grape canopies to develop data driven models (neural network, regression) to estimate
    TLL. The models were used to calculate CWSI values for research plots of Malbec
    grapes vines that were differentially irrigated to induce differing severities
    of vine water stress [19] and validated by comparing, over a 5-year period, CWSI
    values with LWP and fASW. The CWSI calculated using model predicted reference
    temperatures was well correlated with LWP (R2 = 0.54) and fASW (R2 = 0.71). When
    CWSI values were used to trigger 28 mm irrigation events, CWSI values increased,
    LWP became more negative, seasonal water application decreased, and grape cluster
    weight decreased. These results demonstrated that a CWSI could be used as an effective
    irrigation scheduling tool for wine grape. Irrigation scheduling based on canopy
    temperature has not been adopted on a commercial scale by vineyard irrigation
    mangers in semiarid regions of northwestern U.S. as evident by the lack of commercial
    systems supporting the application. The objectives of this study were to: develop
    a CWSI based IoT DSS for precision irrigation of wine grape under semiarid conditions;
    field test the CWSI based IoT DSS in two, small acreage commercial estate vineyards
    over four growing seasons; validate the IoT derived CWSI values by statistical
    correlation with LWP and fASW at each vineyard site; and evaluate vineyard manager
    annual consistency in irrigation scheduling. Vineyard irrigation managers were
    allowed to freely decide if they wanted to use the CWSI based IoS DSS for irrigation
    scheduling. Consistency of plant water stress and irrigation application across
    multiple years was used to gage success of the CWSI based IoT DDS system for irrigation
    scheduling as implemented by the vineyard manager. 2. Methods and materials 2.1.
    Field study site characteristics This study was conducted on two small (< 7 ha)
    family owned and operated commercial vineyards in southwestern Idaho USA over
    a four-year period (2017–2020). Both operations were estate vineyards in that
    they have associated wineries that produce branded commercial wines. The vineyard
    sites were located within 30 km of each other but differed in their soil characteristics
    and soil water holding capacities. The soil at vineyard-A (V-A) was a Greenleaf-Owyhee
    silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids) characterized
    as very deep well drained with moderately slow permeability and an available water
    capacity of 0.2 cm−1 (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vineyard-B (V-B) was located adjacent
    to an ancient volcanic vent that had been subjected to limited volcanic rock mining.
    The vineyard site was reclaimed using surrounding soil and original overburden
    to cover exposed rock resulting in a highly disturbed soil profile. The natural
    soils at the site were Turbyfill fine sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive,
    calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents) and Jacquith loamy fine sand (Sandy, mixed,
    mesic Xereptic Haplodurids), both of which are moderately deep and well drained
    in their natural state with moderately rapid permeability. Available water capacity
    of the Turbyfill fine sandy loam and Jacquith loamy fine sand were 0.12 and 0.07
    cm−1, respectively (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vines in both vineyards were grown
    with double trunks on a vertically shoot positioned, two-wire trellis system with
    moveable catch wires. The vines were trained to bilateral cordons and spur-pruned
    annually to approximately 16 buds m−1 of cordon. Row by vine spacing was 2.7 m
    x 1.8 m at V-A and 2.7 m x 1.5 m at V-B. Irrigation at both sites was applied
    using drip irrigation tubing suspended about 30 cm above ground in the vine row.
    Drip emitter spacing was 76 cm with a flow rate of 3.8 L hr−1 at V-A and 61 cm
    with a flow rate of 1.9 L hr−1 at V-B. The wine grape cultivar evaluated at V-A
    was Chardonnay (2017–2020) and the cultivars at V-B were Malbec (2017–2019) and
    Cabernet Sauvignon (2020). 2.2. Field measurements and instrumentation hardware
    and software Canopy temperature was measured using wired infrared radiometers
    (SI-121, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah) with a 36° field of view. The radiometers
    were placed along a single vine row to prevent potential damage to sensor cables
    from vineyard equipment. In each vineyard, two (2017, 2018, 2019) or four (2020)
    radiometers were installed per cultivar. Radiometer cable lengths were 30 m allowing
    a maximum distance of 60 m between radiometers within a vine row. The radiometers
    were installed on vines with representative canopy size and positioned approximately
    15 to 30 cm above fully expanded leaves located at the top of the vine canopy.
    Radiometers were pointed northeasterly at approximately 45° from nadir, with the
    sensor view aimed at the center of solar noon sunlit leaves. The temperature sensing
    area of vine canopy was approximately 10 to 20 cm in diameter and received full
    sunlight exposure during midday. The possibility of background bare soil visibility
    was limited by multiple leaf layers within the canopy below the measured canopy
    location. The infrared radiometer sensor view was periodically adjusted as necessary
    to ensure that the field of view concentrated on sunlit leaves near the top of
    the canopy. The infrared radiometers were installed after fruit set, usually mid
    to late June. Solar radiation (Rs) (SP-110 pyranometer, Apogee Instruments, Logan,
    UT), air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) (HMP50 temperature and humidity
    probe, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and wind speed (WS) (034B, Met One Instruments,
    Grants Pass, Ore.) were measured in each vineyard at a height of 2.5 m. Canopy
    temperature and weather parameters were measured every minute and recorded as
    15 min averages on a datalogger (CR6, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT). The weather
    sensors and data logger were installed in the same vine row and located midway
    between the infrared temperature sensors. The equipment was removed at harvest,
    usually mid to late September. A 1.2 m soil moisture sensor (Drill and Drop, SenTek
    Sensor Technologies, Stepney, SA) was installed in the vine row within 3 m of
    the data logger and within 20 cm of an irrigation drip line emitter. Soil moisture
    was recorded every 30 min measured at 10 cm depth increments to a depth of 1.2
    m. In 2017 and 2018, a tipping bucket rain gage (RainWise, Boothwyn, PA) was placed
    under an drip line irrigation emitter to record cumulative irrigation application
    amount. The rain gage was connected to the data logger and total emitter water
    application was recorded in 15 min and 24 hr increments. In 2019 and 2020 a flow
    meter (36MP.75RG.1, Netafim Irrigation, Inc., Fresno, CA) was installed in the
    irrigation drip line and connected to the data logger. Flow rate was recorded
    in 15 min increments. The field data logger was equipped with a machine-to-machine
    cellular modem (RavenXTA CDMA or RV50 Sierra wireless AirLink, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., Logan, UT) to provide real-time access to the sensor data using commercial
    software. Study personnel accessed sensor data using datalogger management software
    (LoggerNet 4.5, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT). Vineyard managers were provided
    real-time sensor data access through a website. The website was hosted on the
    field data logger. Data logger webpage publishing software (RTCM Pro Development
    4.3.3.6, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) was used to design and publish the
    webpage on the data logger. The website was accessible using either a personal
    computer or a smart phone. The website provided graphical pages with running 12-day
    histories of daily CWSI, soil water content at each depth increment, fASW, daily
    irrigation depth, and latest 15-min averaged weather data, each on a separate
    webpage. The website was available between the hours of 6:00 to 22:00 MDT. The
    cell phone modem was powered down overnight to conserve battery power and to reset
    the modem in case of intruder hacking and malware. The data logger battery was
    charged using a 20 W solar panel. Midday LWP was measured at 7-to-10-day intervals
    in both vineyards in each year of the study to verify vine water status and to
    investigate its correlation with daily CWSI. LWP was measured between 13:00 and
    15:00 MDT on two fully expanded, sunlit leaves from vines adjacent to each installed
    infrared radiometer using a pressure chamber (model 610, PMS Instrument Co., Albany,
    OR) as described by Levin et al. [10,34]. 2.3. Calculated webpage values Information
    shown on webpages hosted by the field data logger was based on several calculations
    performed by datalogger software using measured sensor values. The calculated
    values included daily CWSI, fASW, and daily irrigation depth. Daily CWSI was calculated
    as the average 15-min CWSI between 13:00 and 15:00 MST, which corresponded to
    −1 to +1.5 hr of solar noon. The 15-min CWSI was calculated using the empirical
    equation developed by Idso et al. [15] as: (1) where Tc is measured canopy temperature
    of fully sunlit leaves ( °C). The TLL reference temperature ( °C) was estimated
    using cultivar specific neural network models [32]. Inputs to the neural network
    models were 15-minute averaged values of measured Rs, Ta, RH and WS. The TUL reference
    temperature ( °C) was estimated using the energy balance-based equation of [14]
    as: (2) where ra is aerodynamic resistance (s m−1), Rn is net radiation (W m−2),
    cp is heat capacity of air (J kg-1 °C-1), and ρ is density of air (kg m−3). Aerodynamic
    resistance was estimated using the approach of [30] as described by [33] using
    the same cultivar specific data sets for well-watered wine grapes in southwestern
    Idaho. Values used for ra were 16.8 s m−1 for Malbec and 21 s m−1 for Chardonnay
    and Cabernet Sauvignon. Net radiation was estimated as Rn = 0.9Rs – 60 [33]. The
    fASW for a given soil profile depth was calculated as: (3) where θi is measured
    volumetric soil water content for depth i, θpwpi is estimated volumetric soil
    water content at permanent wilting point for depth i, θfci is estimated volumetric
    soil water content at field capacity at depth i, and n is the number of 10 cm
    soil water content measurement depths considered. Field capacity for each soil
    depth was estimated as the maximum soil water content measured 24 h after an irrigation
    event or soil water content at the beginning of the season for depths below the
    irrigation wetting front. Permanent wilting point (PWP) for each soil depth was
    estimated as 50% of field capacity (FC) or minimum soil water content measured.
    Values for θfci and θpwpi were continually adjusted during the beginning of the
    season as soil water content measurements were collected. Three values of fASW
    were presented in the webpage: 0 to 60 cm, 0 to 90 cm, and 0 to 120 cm. Values
    shown in the webpages were expressed in English units as they were designed for
    use by vineyard managers located in the U.S. Daily irrigation depth was calculated
    as the volume of water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT divided by the drip
    irrigation lateral length represented and vine row spacing. In the case of rain
    gauges, the volume of water measured by the rain gage was divided by the emitter
    spacing and vine row spacing. In the case of flow meters, the daily volume of
    water applied was calculated by summing the flow rate in each 15 min interval
    multiplied by the time interval. The volume of water was divided by lateral length
    downstream of the flow meter and vine row spacing. The calculated irrigation depth
    was presented in the English unit of inches. 2.4. Irrigation DSS vineyard manager
    accessible webpages The irrigation DSS was comprised of six separate webpages
    that displayed daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), soil moisture at depth of 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in) (Fig. 2), soil moisture at a depth of 70 to 120 cm (28 - 48 in) (Fig.
    3), fASW at three soil depths (Fig. 4), irrigation amount (Fig. 5), and weather
    (Fig. 6). The webpages showing CWSI, soil water content (%) and fASW displayed
    data as a running 12-day history. Each webpage had a top menu showing all available
    webpages. CWSI values were graphed independently for each infrared radiometer
    and as the average value of all radiometers. An example of the main webpage at
    site V-B for 13 August through 25 August 2020 is shown in Fig. 1. Soil volumetric
    water content (%) was graphed independently at depth increments of 10 cm (4 inches)
    (Figs. 2,3). fASW (Fig. 4) was graphed independently for soil depths 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in), 0 to 90 cm (1 – 36 in), and 0 - 120 cm (0 – 48 in). Daily irrigation
    amounts (Fig. 5) represent water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT. Fig. 1, Fig.
    2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show data for V-B from 13 August through 23 August 2020.
    Weather conditions in each vineyard (Fig. 6) were displayed as the most current
    15-min average value for Ta, RH, WS, and wind direction. For ease of use, the
    values for Ta and RH were displayed graphically as well as numerically. Download

    Linear and multiple regression were conducted using Microsoft Excel data analysis
    tools. Graphical, linear, and multiple linear regression and variance analysis
    were used to quantify and evaluate relationships between variables. Regression
    line significance was evaluated using ANOVA (p < 0.05). Neural network model development

    3. Results 3.1. Climatic conditions Climatic conditions during the four-year study
    relative to 20-yr (1996–2016) averages are summarized in Table 1. The climatic
    conditions during the four study years were generally within one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean with a few exceptions. Alfalfa-based reference evapotranspiration
    was greatest in 2018 and exceeded the 20-yr mean by more than one standard deviation.
    The combination of high mean air temperature and daily solar radiation, and low
    mean relative humidity and April through September precipitation resulted in the
    high reference evapotranspiration in 2018. October through March precipitation
    was greatest in 2017 and exceeded one standard deviation of the 20-yr mean. April
    through September precipitation in 2019 and 2020 exceeded one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean. Growing-degree days was greatest in 2018, coinciding with highest
    mean daily air temperature and high reference evapotranspiration. Table 1. Climatic

    water stress Linear relationships between plant water stress measures fASW, LWP,
    and CWSI at each vineyard for the four study years combined are summarized in
    Fig. 7. All the linear relationships between the water stress measures were statistically
    significant (p < 0.001). The linear relationships between fASW versus LWP and
    daily CWSI versus LWP had similar R2 values for both vineyards. The linear relationship
    between fASW and CWSI at V-B had a much greater R2 than for V-A (0.58vs 0.32).
    Variability in the fASW vs CWSI data was similar between the vineyards, but daily
    CWSI spanned a greater range at V-B resulting in a greater R2. The greatest data
    variability occurred between daily CWSI and LWP for both vineyards. The greater
    variability is likely due to CWSI and LWP responding differently to Ta, RS, RH
    and WS. Download : Download high-res image (968KB) Download : Download full-size

    Relationship between seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts The seasonal
    average values for daily CWSI and the cumulative amount of irrigation applied
    between 1 July and 15 September in each study year at each vineyard are shown
    in Table 2. The seasonal average daily CWSI values for each vineyard were largely
    consistent over the four-year study. Seasonal daily CWSI values were higher for
    V-B as the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager
    of V-A. The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly
    increase a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding
    capacity of the sandy soil. Table 2. Average daily crop water stress index (CWSI)

    DSS vineyard manager accessible webpages An example of the irrigation DSS running
    12-day history and weather webpage is presented for V-B for 13 to 23 August 2020
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). An irrigation event, starting
    the evening of 18 August 2020, increased soil water content to a depth of 60 cm
    (24 inches) (Fig. 2) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1). An irrigation
    event starting on the evening of 23 August increased soil water content to a depth
    70 cm (28 inches) (Fig. 3) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1).
    The estimated fASW increased on 18 August and 23 August (Fig. 4) as soil water
    contents increased (Fig 2) due to irrigation events. Prior to irrigation on 18
    Aug, daily CWSI was greater than 0.6 (Fig. 1), while fASW for the 0 to 120 cm
    soil profile was about 0.3 and increased to greater than 0.8 following irrigation
    on 23 Aug. Midday on 25 August daily CWSI was near zero while fASW was about 0.78.
    An overnight irrigation event started on 18 August is depicted as two irrigations
    since it spanned two days (Fig. 5). The first irrigation event applied about 10
    mm (0.4 inch) and the second irrigation event applied about 21 mm (0.8 inch),
    which collectively decreased daily CWSI from 0.6 to near zero (Fig. 1) and increased
    fASW from 0.3 to 0.8 (Fig. 4). The observed variability among radiometers on the
    irrigation DSS webpage for daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), was likely attributed to
    high spatial variability in soil profile characteristics. Limiting historical
    data on the irrigation DSS webpage to a running 12-day period was to optimize
    time efficiency of the user web browsing experience. The infield data logger that
    hosted the irrigation DSS webpages had limited computing capacity, so limiting
    the historical data time frame to a running 12-days offered a reasonable compromise
    between data viewability on a cell phone and time to transfer the data to the
    user webpage interface device. A running 12-day historical record was sufficient
    to establish trends in CWSI or soil water availability useful in making irrigation
    management decisions. The vineyard managers in this study only wanted to know
    if they need to irrigation today and were largely uninterested in historical CWSI
    values. The 12-day historical length can be increased if deemed necessary by uploading
    the data to the cloud and using cloud based graphical software to display the
    same information for the full growing season. 4.2. Relationship between measures
    of vine water status and irrigation A seasonal graph of the irrigation DSS data
    for V-B in 2020 shows an interconnected response among the measured and estimated
    DSS parameters (Fig. 8). Values for daily CWSI and midday leaf water potential
    shown in Fig. 8 are averages of the measured values and fASW is for the 0 to 120
    soil profile. Prior to initiation of measurements on 13 June, there was above
    average precipitation in 2020 (Table 1). The prior precipitation is evident by
    the status of well-watered vines on 13 June (Fig. 8). Daily CWSI was low, fASW
    was > 0.55 and LWP was less negative. A rainfall event on 29 June was associated
    with a decrease in the daily CWSI, an increase in fASW and a less negative LWP.
    Prior to the irrigation event on 20 July, the daily CWSI steadily increased coincident
    with a more negative LWP. The small irrigation event on 8 July had minimal influence
    on daily CWSI or LWP potential as fASW remained below 0.55. Irrigation events
    prior to 17 August reduced CWSI and made LWP less negative for only a few days
    and fASW remained 〈 0.55 for most of the duration. The seasonally highest CWSI
    values and most negative LWP values occurred between 28 July and 24 August. The
    irrigation event on 23 August and precipitation events on 17 and 24 August decreased
    CWSI to near zero, increased fASW to 〉 0.55 and LWP became less negative, all
    of which indicated a short period of increase in vine water status. Between 24
    August and the next irrigation event on 1 September, the CWSI increased, fASW
    decreased, and LWP became more negative. The relatively large (> 25 mm) irrigation
    event on 3 September decreased daily CWSI to 〈 0.2, increased fASW to 〉 0.8, and
    LWP became less negative. The last irrigation on 11 September reduced daily CWSI
    to near zero, increased fASW to nearly 0.9 and increased LWP to > −0.9 MPa. Download

    Average daily CWSI, fraction of available soil water (fASW) in 0 to 120 cm soil
    profile, midday leaf water potential (LWP), precipitation, and irrigation during
    the 2020 growing season at V-B. The fASW is a common method used to express crop
    water stress for field crops. Wine grape is well-watered when fASW is greater
    than 0.55 [35]. The corresponding seasonal responses of fASW, midday LWP, and
    the daily CWSI to irrigation and precipitation events (Fig. 8) supports the usefulness
    and accuracy of daily CWSI for real-time irrigation management of wine grape irrespective
    of soil characteristics that may influence these values. 4.3. Comparison of vine
    water stress measures between vineyards The slopes of linear relationships between
    the fASW versus LWP or daily CWSI differed between vineyards (Fig. 7). This may
    be partially due to differences in soil textures and permeability between the
    vineyards. V-A had a silt loam soil with low to moderate permeability while V-B
    had a sandy soil with high permeability. Water applied by the drip irrigation
    emitter likely resulted in different wetting patterns between vineyards with a
    deeper wetting pattern and less lateral spreading at V-B. There was likely limited
    soil water availability outside the immediate area of the emitter wetting pattern
    at V-B due to the low water holding capacity of the sandy soil. The soil water
    sensor was installed within 20 cm of an emitter and may have provided a better
    measurement of total soil water at V-B than V-A. The greater water holding capacity
    of the silt loam soil at V-A likely resulted in much more stored soil water from
    non-growing season precipitation, limiting the range in fASW over the growing
    season. However, the range in LWP were similar between vineyards. The low permeability
    of the soil at V-A may have restricted movement of soil water to the roots. Lastly
    the soil at V-A exhibited silica cementation ranging from 45 to 60 cm deep during
    soil sensor installation that may have restricted root growth. Ample soil water
    was measured below 60 cm in the root zone (data not shown) but very little extraction
    occurred during the growing season supporting the suspicion of limited root presence
    below 60 cm. The presence of ample soil water below 60 cm limited the range in
    fASW over the growing season and if it was largely unavailable to the vines would
    result in high daily CWSI and low LWP values despite fASW > 0.55. Despite a significant
    linear relationship between daily CWSI and midday LWP for both vineyards (Fig.
    7), there is considerable variability in the relationships, which precludes use
    of CWSI as a direct surrogate for LWP. A quadratic relationship between CWSI and
    LWP averaged over four wine grape cultivars was reported by [21], which depicted
    a similar degree of variability. [36] reported LWP ranging from −0.51 to −1.15
    MPa for well-watered grapevines in California with LWP linearly related to vapor
    pressure deficit (VPD) and Ta. They also reported a linear relationship between
    LWP and VPD for water stressed vines, but with reduced dependence on VPD compared
    to well-watered vines. The results of this study are consistent with the findings
    of [36] as the relationship between CWSI and LWP (Fig. 7) could be represented
    by a piece-wise linear relationship with CWSI ≈ 0 for LWP > −1.15 MPa. Solar radiation
    also influences LWP and LWP measurements should be collected on cloudless days
    [36]. The LWP values reported in this study were made over a wide range of VPD
    and on days with variable clouds. Additionally, some LWP values reported in this
    study were not collected on the same vine used for canopy temperature measurement,
    another source of variability in the relationship between CWSI and LWP. Overall,
    the presence of water stress detected by LWP measurement was also indicted by
    daily CWSI as calculated in this study, demonstrating that CWSI can be effectively
    used as an irrigation management tool for wine grape. The vineyard managers in
    this study were successful in using daily CWSI to achieve similar levels of plant
    water stress over multiple years, despite yearly differences in evaporative demand
    and growing season precipitation. The primary advantage of using CWSI as an irrigation
    management tool is the ability to automate data collection for daily monitoring
    of water stress with minimal labor. The linear relationship between fASW and daily
    CWSI exhibited less variability than the linear relationship between fASW and
    midday LWP (Fig. 7), especially for V-B. Thus, CWSI was a more direct indicator
    of available soil water than LWP. For V-B, when fASW was > 0.55, indicating well-watered
    vines, CWSI was 〈 0.1 supporting the rational than CWSI should approach zero for
    well-watered vines and approach one for severely watered stressed vines as the
    linear relationship depicts. However, for V-A a fASW value of 0.55 corresponds
    to a CWSI value 〉 0.5, which clearly does not follow the rational of CWSI, indicating
    an error in estimating fASW. As forementioned, this discrepancy is likely due
    to the effective root zone of the vines less than the 120 cm depth used to compute
    fASW. The estimates of FC and PWP of the soil at V-A could also be in error, which
    could lead to overestimation of fASW. If estimates of the fASW at V-A were reduced
    by 25%, a fASW value of 0.55 would correspond to a CWSI value < 0.1, like V-B
    and a CWSI value of 0.6 would correspond to a fASW of 0.37. The unrealistic over
    estimation of fAWC at V-A based on measured midday LWP and calculated daily CWSI
    highlights the difficulty in accurately quantifying the fASW using a single soil
    moisture profile measurement with drip irrigated crops. Drip irrigation results
    in a 3-dimensional wetting pattern that makes reliable estimation of root zone
    available soil water difficult at best. As an example, [37] reported that nine
    neutron probe measurements in one quadrant of a vine root zone, to a depth of
    3 m, was necessary to quantify soil water content of drip-irrigated grape vines.
    The difficulty in quantifying fASW in drip irrigated vineyards highlights the
    advantage of using plant-based methods for assessing vine water status such as
    CWSI provided the reference temperatures TLL and TUL can be reliably estimated.
    4.4. Seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts between vineyard managers Neither
    vineyard manager in this study used any type of quantitative plant or soil water
    monitoring techniques to aid in irrigation management decisions prior to the installation
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. Prior to this study, the irrigation managers
    at both vineyards made irrigation decisions based upon intuition, previous experience,
    and crop appearance [1]; so, there was a reasonable expectation that the vineyard
    managers would actively use the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. At the beginning
    of the first study year, the vineyard managers were briefed on the concept of
    CWSI for monitoring plant water status and were given the guideline that a daily
    CWSI value of 0.3 corresponded to approximately a 70% ET rate relative to a well-watered,
    100% ET. Beyond that initial guidance on how to interpret the daily CWSI value,
    the vineyard managers independently accessed the irrigation DSS webpages and made
    irrigation management decisions without input from research project personnel.
    At the end of the first study year both vineyard managers reported that they routinely
    accessed the irrigation DSS webpages for daily CWSI and fASW and used the information
    to support irrigation management decisions. In each of the remaining three years
    of the study, both vineyard managers, at their discretion, continued to access
    the irrigation DSS webpages and use the daily CWSI to facilitate irrigation management
    decisions. Seasonal average daily CWSI values (Table 2) were higher for V-B as
    the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager of V-A.
    The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly increase
    a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding capacity
    of the sandy soil. Cumulative irrigation water application was surprisingly similar
    across vineyards, particularly for years 2018 through 2020, despite differences
    in soil water holding capacity and vineyard managers. Cumulative irrigation was
    low in the first year of the study at V-A due to above average non-growing season
    precipitation and higher water holding capacity of the silt loam soil. The narrow
    range in seasonal average daily CWSI (0.23 to 0.31 for V-A, and 0.36 to 0.44 for
    V-B) and cumulative irrigation (1.14 to 134 mm) in 2018 through 2020 suggests
    that vineyard managers effectively used the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS to develop
    and maintain a consistent deficit irrigation management program. 4.5. Irrigation
    decision support system limitations The data-driven models used in this study
    provided reliable estimates of TLL and TUL in real-time for the semiarid climatic
    conditions of the study site, which was representative of the irrigated wine producing
    locations in the pacific northwestern U.S. The climatic conditions under which
    these data-driven models were developed were representative of the conditions
    in this study. However, the models may not perform as well in other regions with
    weather conditions outside the database range for model development. For example,
    in areas where daily windspeeds exceed 5 m sec−1. Wind speeds higher than 5 m
    sec−1 were not included in the database used for model development and grapevines
    are known to reduce stomatal conductance under high winds [38,39]. A wind induced
    reduction in stomatal conductance would result in an increase in canopy temperature
    independent of plant water stress and, since the data-driven model estimate of
    TLL would be too low, the calculated CWSI value would be elevated. Canopy temperature
    data for well-watered vines under high wind conditions would need to be included
    in the data set used to calibrate the neural network model for estimating TLL
    in windy semiarid regions. There are climatic conditions that can result in a
    calculated CWSI value of less than zero or greater than one. Wet canopy conditions
    typically result in measured canopy temperature that is less than the TLL predicted
    by the data driven model. This results in a negative CWSI value regardless of
    soil water availability. The original development of the CWSI concept by [15]
    was limited to clear sunny conditions. However, the data driven model for predicting
    TLL that was used in this study uses a database of well-watered vine canopy temperatures
    that were measured under variable cloudy conditions. The data driven model can
    therefore predict TLL for variably cloudy conditions. While the data-driven model
    used for predicting TLL is valid for solar radiation < 100 W m−2, TUL predicted
    using Eq. (2) for low levels of solar radiation can be approximately equal to
    TLL resulting in CWSI values less than zero or greater than 1. In this study,
    solar radiation less than 200 W m−2 often resulted in CWSI values less than zero.
    [40] also found solar radiation greater than 200 W m−2 was necessary to reliably
    use canopy temperature measurement for irrigation scheduling. In this study, daily
    CWSI was limited to a maximum of one and a minimum of zero in software to avert
    illogical values. The effect of wet canopy and low solar radiation on calculation
    of daily CWSI is evident in Fig. 8 on 18 and 24 August when a value of zero was
    assigned to daily CWSI during rainfall events. Limiting daily CWSI value to zero
    due to low solar radiation or wet canopy has little practical impact on use of
    CWSI for irrigation management as vine water stress is low under these circumstances
    due to low evaporative demand. When calculated CWSI is greater than one due to
    low solar radiation, limiting the value of one is more problematic as this results
    in a very erroneous representation of vine water stress that could lead to an
    unnecessary irrigation event. The climatic conditions leading to errors in calculating
    CWSI (rainfall, low solar radiation) are limited to 1-to-3-days in duration in
    the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not prevent application
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region. Software used to compute
    CWSI can be modified to detect these events and indicate to the user that the
    daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value for the day preceding the rainfall
    or low solar radiation event can be used to guide irrigation decisions as plant
    water stress will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally as ET will be small
    under low solar radiation conditions. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system
    developed and implemented in this study focused on two small acreage, commercial
    estate vineyards in semiarid southwestern Idaho USA. The climatic conditions at
    the study sites were representative of vineyards in the semiarid irrigated regions
    of the Pacific Northwest U.S. Small acreage vineyards can be found throughout
    the region and most do not have staff with irrigation science training, nor can
    they afford to hire trained vineyard irrigation management professionals or services.
    They need affordable irrigation scheduling tools that are easy to maintain and
    indicate when to irrigate to maintain a desired level of vine water stress. The
    vineyard managers at the study sites were pleased the system reliably and timely
    indication of vine water stress without having to spend time collecting soil water
    content measurements needed to estimate fASW or measure leaf water potential.
    While this study focused on small commercial estate vineyards, the IoT irrigation
    DSS concept is applicable to larger commercial vineyards where it could be used
    to provide plant water stress information needed to ground truth remote sensing
    based estimates of the ratio of actual-to-reference ET such as those provided
    by GRAPEX [41] or OPENET (https://openetdata.org). These remote sensing-based
    estimates have a minimum spatial resolution of 30 m, which is larger than the
    minimum dimension of irrigation management blocks in many commercial estate vineyards,
    hence they are not necessarily applicable to small commercial estate vineyards
    in the region. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study
    used expensive scientific grade equipment, which proved invaluable to investigate
    the validity and adoptability of the system for irrigation management in wine
    grapes. The infrared temperature sensors cost $700 each, the multifunctional precision
    data logger was $2000, and the cellular modem with accessories was $700 totaling
    over $6100 excluding web page publishing software and climatic sensors. The soil
    moisture sensor cost is not included as it is unnecessary for calculation of the
    CWSI. The cost of the equipment used in this study is prohibitive for small vineyards
    to monitor just a single location. Vineyard manager acceptance and adoption of
    the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study justifies continued
    development and enhancement of the system. Future work will focus on incorporating
    less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power, low-cost radio
    communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station. The base
    station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and used to
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature
    at sensor locations across a vineyard and display daily CWSI for each canopy temperature
    monitoring location. These system enhancements would increase size of the vineyard
    area represented by daily CWSI measurements, encompassing multiple cultivars and
    irrigation blocks or irrigation management zones in larger vineyards. 5. Conclusions
    A CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS was developed, and field tested at two small acreage
    commercial wine grape estate vineyards in southwestern Idaho. Irrigation DSS webpages,
    accessible to vineyard managers via cell phone or computer, provided a running
    12-day history of CWSI daily values, soil moisture and current weather conditions.
    Data-driven models were used to estimate reference temperatures needed to calculate
    the CWSI using real-time environmental inputs for Rs, Ta, RH, and WS. Edge computing
    on a solar powered, field-deployed data logger was used to calculate the CWSI
    and fASW, and the data logger was used to host webpages of the irrigation DSS.
    The data logger was connected to a cellular modem located in the vineyard. The
    vineyard managers routinely used the irrigation DSS webpage for the CWSI and soil
    moisture to make irrigation management decisions. The average daily CWSI and irrigation
    amounts between 1 July and 15 September were similar between years over the four-year
    study for each study vineyard suggesting that the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS
    was effective in assisting irrigation management decisions. Linear relationships
    between daily CWSI, midday LWP, and fraction of available soil water were significant
    (p < 0.001) at both study sites. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.58)
    for the linear relationship between daily CWSI and fraction of available soil
    water for V-B was better than that for midday LWP (R2 = 0.38) indicating daily
    CWSI was the most reliable indicator (less variable) of vine water status. The
    data-driven models used to estimate TLL and TUL can result in CWSI values outside
    the theoretical range of 0 to 1 when the canopy is wet from precipitation or solar
    radiation is <200 W m−2. These climatic conditions are limited to 1-to-3-days
    in duration in the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not
    prevent application of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region.
    These climatic instances can be detected by IoT irrigation DSS system software
    and indicate to the user that the daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value
    for the day preceding the rainfall or low solar radiation event can be used to
    indicate plant water stress since it will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally
    as ET will be small under low solar radiation conditions. The hardware and software
    used to implement the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS in this study was very reliable
    but too expensive for practical commercial application. Future work will focus
    on incorporating less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power,
    low-cost radio communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station.
    The base station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature

  description: Improper disposal of municipal sewage sludge poses a significant threat
    to effective environmental protection. With the continuous advancement of artificial
    intelligence technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing detection
    technology is emerging as a promising research avenue to address this issue. However,
    the current state of real-Time detection technology is inadequate, hindering comprehensive
    and stable monitoring operation. Additionally, the rational use of network resources
    remains suboptimal. To address this challenge, this study proposes a resource
    optimisation technology for the current insufficient intelligent monitoring system
    of urban sewage sludge. By leveraging IoT and wireless technology, water meter
    data can be collected with minimal earth construction compared to traditional
    PLC collection. This is followed by utilising Faster R-CNN to plan the network
    transmission of sewage remote sensing information resources. Finally, the architecture
    collection module's scalability is enhanced by incorporating edge computing and
    reserving sensor ports to meet future plant expansion demands. The experiment
    demonstrates the significant potential of this technology in application and resource
    optimisation. In actual parameter tracking tests, the proposed method effectively
    monitors sewage sludge, providing policy guidance and measure optimisation for
    relevant authorities, ultimately contributing to pollution-free urban development.

  description: Farmers of the twentieth century are adopting the use of leading technical
    facilities in the field of agriculture to sustain the competitiveness of the global
    market economy. With the help of modern technology, they are trying to reduce
    production costs and improve crop yield with better product quality. A new era
    in which many traditional agricultural practices are replaced by cutting-edge
    technologies like Precision Farming (PF), which entails applying the agronomic
    variables in the right place, at the right time, has been ushered in by technological
    advancements made in monitoring, supervision, management, and control systems.
    One of the methods that will enable quick and non-destructive analysis of agricultural
    data will turn out to be an IoT integrated smart agriculture drone. This includes
    taking pictures to analyze crop behavior, finding out how much water the soil
    can contain, managing irrigation systems, etc. Numerous engineering disciplines,
    including aerodynamics, electronics, computer programming, and economics are integrated
    in the design, development, and implementation of drone-based agricultural systems.
    In considering the above thought, a problem taken into consideration is for a
    grape field of approximately 10 acres located near Nashik (28 36'N, 77 12'E) in
    the state of Maharashtra to analyze the performance of IoT enabled agriculture
    drones for PF. Main objective is to spray the insecticide with an agriculture
    drone only on the detection of the green zone of the crop or canopy for effective
    spraying and hence to reduce the wastage and cost of spraying. Drone image sensor
    will capture the field images, atmospheric parameters like, temperature, humidity
    in the field and analyze it on the cloud platform for analyzing the crop health
    and related parameters. An agriculture drone of 16 L capacity is proposed for
    spraying 1 acre of land. It could take 7-10 minutes of flight time of the drone
    to spray the insecticide which can lead to reducing the labor cost by 65%, spraying
    time by 85% and amount of insecticide by 50%. Drone camera and spraying mechanism
    is to be synchronized to achieve the objective through IoT platform. For effective
    spraying from the bottom and the top of the leaf, synchronized UGV and UAV spraying
    is proposed. Further, time series analysis of the photographic images and video
    footage captured by the drone camera can be done for the prediction, modeling
    of crop yields and auditing them with computer vision capabilities of UAV, and
    developing sufficient datasets. These data sets can be used for machine learning
    algorithms for AI or DL and for future research related to crop disease forecasting,
    canopy cover, stress management, and be able to guide farmers for taking corrective
    actions in advance and evolve best practices for overall improvement in the yield.

    I. Introduction Field robots could perform mission-critical tasks that are dangerous
    for humans. When being dispatched to remote areas without terrestrial cellular
    coverage, the operation of robots has to rely on non-terrestrial infrastructures,
    including satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [1], [2]. For such scenarios,
    a UAV platform needs to have integrated functionalities to support various requirements
    of robots, e.g., sensing, communication, controlling and computing. For example,
    a UAV can be equipped with on-board sensors to collect scene information, with
    mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to analyze the situation and make quick decisions
    for robot control, with base stations to transmit control commands to robots,
    and with a satellite communication module to support real-time communication to
    the remote cloud center [3]. This leads to a sensing-communication-computing-control
    ( SC 3 ) integrated satellite-UAV network, in which efficient resource orchestration
    for all the related functionalities is important. In the SC 3 integrated network,
    the whole control process, including sensing, computing, communication and control,
    is performed in a closed-loop manner, which is referred to as a SC 3 loop. Intuitively,
    a SC 3 loop can be regarded as a reflex arc, with the network as a nervous system
    [4], where multiple SC 3 loops would share and compete for resources. Existing
    studies on integrated satellite-UAV networks have mainly focused on communications.
    For example, [5] jointly optimized the channel allocation, power allocation, and
    hovering time of UAVs to maximize the data transmission efficiency. However, in
    a SC 3 integrated network, control and communication are closely coupled, and
    one will be more concerned with the control performance, especially for mission-critical
    tasks where reliable control must be guaranteed. Researchers in the control field
    have investigated the relationship between communication and control. It was shown
    that a noisy linear control system can be stabilized only if the communication
    throughput per cycle exceeds the intrinsic entropy rate of the control system
    [6]. Qiu et al. generalized this result to a multi-channel case [7]. Recently,
    a lower bound of the minimum data rate to achieve a certain linear quadratic regulator
    (LQR) cost was presented [8]. These achievements have indicated that jointly optimizing
    control and communication is promising and significant in the SC 3 integrated
    satellite-UAV network. However, most of these works modeled communications as
    simple pipelines with simple parameters and left communication resource allocation
    undiscussed. Inspired by the efforts in the control field, some recent works have
    considered the control part as constraints in communication design. Authors in
    [9] maximized the spectral efficiency of a wireless control system subject to
    the control convergence rate constraint. Chen et al. maximized the delay determinacy
    under the same constraint [10]. These studies have taken a great step toward control-oriented
    optimization. However, they still focused on communications as the objective.
    In mission-critical SC 3 integrated networks, as has been discussed, the control
    performance is more important and should be treated as the objective rather than
    constraints. Compared with the convergence rate that was considered in [9], [10],
    the LQR cost, which has been widely used in the control theory [11], [12], is
    a more suitable objective for measuring the control performance, as it provides
    a simple form to balance the state deviation and control energy consumption. Motivated
    by the above discussion, we optimize the sum LQR control cost of all SC 3 loops.
    Particularly, we establish a relation between the LQR cost and the communication
    data rate, and then formulate a control performance optimization problem which
    optimizes the power allocation of the UAV. We show the convexity of the problem
    and reveal the relationship between the optimal transmit power and the intrinsic
    entropy rates of different SC 3 loops. For the assure-to-be-stable case, we derive
    a closed-form solution for practical applications. SECTION II. System Model and
    Problem Formulation As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a SC 3 integrated satellite-UAV
    network that serves multiple field robots for mission-critical tasks. One satellite
    and one UAV (integrated with a sensor, a base station, a satellite communication
    module and a MEC server) provide sensing, communication, and computing services.
    The remote telemetry and control center monitors and guides the UAV through satellite.
    The network enables multiple SC 3 loops simultaneously. In each loop, the sensor
    senses the object states. The MEC and the remote center analyze sensor data and
    compute control commands. Next, the UAV transmits the commands to guide the robots
    to properly handle the objects. The whole process is in a periodic manner. Fig.
    1. Illustration of a SC 3 integrated satellite-UAV network for organizing multiple
    field robots in remote areas. Show All The UAV transmits control commands to K
    robots through frequency orthogonal channels. Denoting the power allocated to
    robot k as p k , we have ∑ K k=1 p k ≤ P max , where P max is the maximum power.
    The air-to-ground channels are assumed to be dominated by line-of-sight links
    [13]. Therefore, the channel gain from the UAV to robot k follows the free space
    path loss model as g k = β 0 d 2 k , where d k is the distance between the UAV
    and robot k , and β 0 is the reference channel gain. For the control part in SC
    3 loops, we model each control object as a linear time-invariant system [6], [7],
    [8], and hence the discrete-time system equation of the k th object is given by
    x k,t+1 = A k x k,t + B k u k,t + v k,t , (1) View Source where t denotes the
    cycle index, x k,t ∈ R n denotes the system state, u k,t ∈ R m denotes the control
    action, v k,t ∈ R n is system noise, and A k and B k are fixed n×n and n×m matrices
    denoting the state matrix and input matrix respectively. Due to the limited computing
    capability of the MEC server on the UAV, some complex computing tasks will be
    offloaded to the remote cloud center through satellite. The queuing time is negligible
    as the transmission of the tasks is infrequent (only at the start of each cycle).
    Denoting the task data size as D k , the transmission times from UAV to satellite
    and from satellite to control center can be calculated as t T,U2S k = D k R U2S
    and t T,S2C k = D k R S2C , where R U2S and R S2C denote the corresponding transmission
    data rates. The processing time is t P k = D k α k f k , where α k is the average
    CPU cycles to process the task per bit, and f k is the CPU frequency. From the
    perspective of system robustness, we consider the maximum propagation delay based
    on the satellite orbit height H S , the minimum elevation angle β min and the
    maximum central angle θ max , denoted as τ max = ( R e + H S )sin θ max ccos β
    min [15], where R e is the Earth radius. Therefore, the total delay, when a task
    is conducted on the cloud, can be calculated as T k,1 = t T,U2S k + t T,S2C k
    + t P k +4 τ max , (2) View Source where the transmission time from the remote
    cloud center back to the UAV is omitted as the amount of the output data is small.
    Denoting the control period of SC 3 loop k as T k , the available time duration
    for transmitting the control commands would be shorten to T k,2 = T k − T k,1
    , if a task is conducted remotely. The communication data rate between the UAV
    and robots is limited, which may affect the control performance. According to
    [6], to stabilize control object k , the data throughput transmitted in each cycle
    needs to satisfy the condition B T k,2 log 2 (1+ g k p k σ 2 )> h k ≜ log 2 |det
    A k |, (3) View Source where B denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise
    variance and h k is the intrinsic entropy rate which denotes the stability of
    object k . A large h k indicates an unstable object, which requires a high transmission
    rate to stabilize. In control theory, the control performance can be measured
    by the LQR cost function [11], [12]. In this letter, we consider the worst-case
    long-term average LQR cost, formulated as [8] l k ≜sup lim N→∞ E[ 1 N ∑ t=1 N
    ( x T k,t Q k x k,t + u T k,t R k u k,t )], (4) View Source where Q k and R k
    are semi-positive definite weight matrices. The terms x T k,t Q k x k,t denotes
    the deviation of the system from the zero state, and the term u T k,t R k u k,t
    denotes the input energy. These weight matrices balance the state and the energy,
    which can be set according to practical requirements. For example, one should
    set the entries of Q k to be large if he expects that the state of the system
    converges to zero quickly. To achieve a certain LQR cost ( l k ) , an additional
    term has to be added to the condition previously described in (3), and the data
    throughput in each cycle now must satisfy [8] B T k,2 log 2 (1+ g k p k σ 2 )≥
    h k + n 2 log 2 (1+ nN( v k )|det M k | 1 n l k −tr( Σ k S k ) ), k=1,2,…,K, (5)
    View Source where N( v k )≜ 1 2π exp( 2 n h( v k )) , h( v k ) is the differential
    entropy of v k , Σ k is its covariance matrix, and M k and S k are the solutions
    to control system Riccati equations shown in [8]. The right side of (5) is decreasing
    with l k , which means that a lower LQR cost requires a higher data rate in a
    single SC 3 loop. When multiple SC 3 loops share resources, e.g., the power, the
    control-oriented and communication-oriented resource allocation schemes will have
    essentially different results. This will be shown in the next section. In this
    letter, we focus on control-oriented resource allocation, and aim to minimize
    the sum long-term average LQR cost of the SC 3 loops by optimizing power allocation
    p=[ p 1 , p 2 ,…, p K ] . The problem is formulated as min p,l s.t. ∑ k=1 K l
    k ∑ k=1 K p k ≤ P max , (5), (6a) (6b) (6c) View Source where l=[ l 1 , l 2 ,…,
    l K ] and (6c) is the communication constraint imposed by the control performance
    requirements. In the following, we will transform this problem to a convex problem
    and analyze its optimal solution. SECTION III. Problem Transformation and Analysis
    We first propose a lemma to show the convexity of problem (6), and further reveal
    the relationship between the optimal power allocation and other parameters. Lemma
    1:Problem (6) is equivalent to the convex problem min p s.t. ∑ k=1 K l k ( p k
    ) ∑ k=1 K p k ≤ P max , B T k,2 log 2 (1+ g k p k σ 2 )> h k ,k=1,2,…,K, (7a)
    (7b) (7c) View Source where l k ( p k )≜ n 2 2 n h k N( v k )|det M k | 1 n (1+
    g k p k σ 2 ) 2B T k n − 2 2 n h k +tr( Σ k S k ). (8) View Source Proof:As the
    right side of (5) is decreasing with l k , the equality must hold to minimize
    the objective function. Therefore, we obtain the equation between l k and p k
    as (8). Correspondingly, problem (6) is recast as problem (7), where constraint
    (7c) ensures a positive denominator in (8). Next, we prove the convexity of (7).
    The second order derivative of l k ( p k ) is shown as (9) at the bottom of the
    page. ∂ 2 l k ∂ p k 2 = 2B T k,2 2 2 n h k N( v k )|det M k | 1 n (1+ g k p k
    σ 2 ) 2B T k,2 n [ 2B T k,2 n 2 2 n h k + 2B T k,2 n (1+ g k p k σ 2 ) 2B T k,2
    n + (1+ g k p k σ 2 ) 2B T k,2 n − 2 2 n h k ] ( p k + g k σ 2 ) 2 [ (1+ g k p
    k σ 2 ) 2B T k,2 n − 2 2 n h k ] 3 (9) View Source From (9), we can find that
    ∂ 2 l k ∂ p k 2 >0 as long as (1+ g k p k σ 2 ) 2BT n > 2 2 n h k , which is equivalent
    to (7c). Therefore, the objective function is convex in its feasible region, which
    guarantees the convexity. Lemma 1 transforms problem (6) into a convex problem,
    whose optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Next, we first consider a
    special case that the LQR weight matrices are set as Q k = I n and R k =0 . With
    this setting, the LQR cost solely describes the system deviation while the energy
    cost is not the focus. For this case, the relation between optimal power allocation
    and system stability is discussed in Proposition 1. Proposition 1:When Q k = I
    n and R k =0 , the optimal power p ∗ k allocated to channel k is monotonically
    increasing with the intrinsic entropy rate h k , i.e., the more unstable the control
    system k is, the more power should be allocated to it. Proof:When Q k = I n and
    R k =0 , the solutions of the Riccati equations are S k = M k = I n [8]. Therefore,
    we have |det M k | ( 1 n ) =1 in (8). It is not difficult to verify that the Slater’s
    conditions hold for problem (7), which guarantees strong duality [16]. Therefore,
    (7) is equivalent to its Lagrangian dual problem max λ≥0 min p s.t. ∑ k=1 K l
    k ( p k )+λ( ∑ k=1 K p k − P max ) (7c), (10a) (10b) View Source where λ is the
    Lagrangian multiplier with respect to constraint (7b). By checking the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
    (KKT) conditions, we have ∂ l k ∂ p k | p ∗ k +λ=0,k=1,2,…,K , where { p ∗ k }
    denotes the optimal solution to problem (6). Calculating ∂ l k ∂ p k , we obtain
    the following equation 2B T k 2 2 n h k N( v k ) g k (1+ g k p ∗ k σ 2 ) 2B T
    k n −1 σ 2 [ (1+ g k p ∗ k σ 2 ) 2B T k n − 2 2 n h k ] 2 =λ. (11) View Source
    Denoting the left side of (11) as s k ( h k , p k ) , we have s k ( h k , p k
    )= s j ( h j , p j ),∀j,k=1,2,…,K. (12) View Source Similar to (9), we have ∂
    s k ∂ p k <0 . In addition, it is obvious that s k is monotonically increasing
    with h k . Therefore, when the other parameters are fixed, if h k increases, p
    k should also increase to guarantee that condition (12) still holds. Remark 1:Similarly,
    we can prove that the optimal power allocated to SC 3 loop k is monotonically
    increasing with the entropy power of v k . Therefore, we can draw a conclusion
    that one should allocate more power to unstable control systems with larger noise
    to improve the overall control performance. Next, we derive a closed-form expression
    of the optimal power allocation without restricting the forms of Q k and R k .
    We consider the assure-to-be-stable assumption, that the communication capability
    is significantly greater than the lowest capability requirement to keep the system
    stable in (3), i.e., B T k log 2 (1+ g k p k σ 2 )≫ h k . This assumption means
    that the control systems are far from the unstable point, and we can focus on
    the control performance instead of the stability. Proposition 2:Under the assured-to-be-stable
    assumption, if all of the SC 3 loops have the same control period and computing
    delay, which means that T 1,2 = T 2,2 =⋯= T k,2 =T , the optimal solution to problem
    (6) is obtained as (13), shown at the bottom of the page. p ∗ k = ( P max + ∑
    K i=1 σ 2 g i ) [|det M k | 1 n 2 2 n h k N( v k )] n 2BT+n ( σ 2 g k ) 2BT 2BT+n
    ∑ K i=1 [|det M i | 1 n 2 2 n h i N( v i )] n 2BT+n ( σ 2 g i ) 2BT 2BT+n − σ
    2 g k (13) View Source Proof:When B T k log 2 (1+ g k p k σ 2 )≫ h k , we have
    (1+ g k p ∗ k σ 2 ) 2BT n ≫ 2 2 n h k , which means that the term 2 2 n h k in
    the denominator of the left hand in (11) is negligible. Therefore, we can rewrite
    (11) as p ∗ k = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ( 2BT|det M k | 1 n 2 2 n h k N( v K ) g k λ σ 2 ) n 2BT+n
    −1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ σ 2 g k . (14) View Source On the other hand, due to the monotonicity
    of l k with respect to p k , the equality in (7b) must hold, i.e., ∑ k=1 K p k
    = P max . (15) View Source Based on (14) and (15), we obtain that the Lagrangian
    multiplier λ satisfies equation (16), shown at the bottom of the page. ( 1 λ )
    n 2BT+n = P max + ∑ K k=1 σ 2 g k ∑ K k=1 (2BT|det M k | 1 n 2 2 n h k N( v K
    )) n 2BT+n ( σ 2 g k ) 2BT 2BT+n (16) View Source Substituting (16) into (14),
    we obtain (13) immediately, which completes the proof. Remark 2:From (13), we
    see that p ∗ k is increasing with h k and N( v k ) , which verifies the conclusion
    of Proposition 1. In addition, it is shown that the term n 2BT+n , as the power
    of the control parameters, evaluates the influence of the control parameters on
    the allocation results. In the special case that n 2BT+n →0 , we have p ∗ k =
    P max 1/ g k ∑ K i=1 (1/ g i ) , which is irrelevant to the control part of the
    system. SECTION IV. Simulation Results We assume 5 objects, which are randomly
    and evenly distributed in a circular area with a radius of 5000 m. The UAV is
    at the center of the circle. The UAV height, denoted as H , is set as 100m unless
    otherwise specified. Other parameters are set as B = 5kHz, β 0 =−60dB and σ 2
    =−110dBm [17]. We assume Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, with H S =1100km , β
    min = 50 ∘ , and hence τ max =4.56ms [15]. The data rates are set as t U2S k =10Mbps
    and t S2C k =100Mbps . For the control part, the intrinsic entropy rates of each
    system are randomly selected from the range [0, 100], the system noise is assumed
    to be independent Gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance 0.01,
    and the we set T 1 = T 2 =⋯= T K =100ms [18] and n = 100. The LQR weight matrices
    are Q k = I n , R k =0,∀k . The sensor data size is set as D k =200k bits, and
    other parameters are set as α k =100 and f k =2GHz , for k=1,2,…,K . In Fig. 2,
    we compare the LQR cost achieved by the water-filling method (which is optimal
    for maximizing the sum rate [14, Ch. 9.4]), the closed-form allocation in Proposition
    2, and the optimal results to (6) obtained with CVX, with different UAV heights.
    The figure shows the accuracy of (13), as the optimal solution and the closed
    form achieve nearly the same LQR cost. When P max =1dBW , the LQR cost of the
    power allocation in Proposition 2 is slightly higher than that of the optimal
    solution, because the assumption BT log 2 (1+ g k p k σ 2 )≫ h k is not satisfied.
    From this figure, we can see that the LQR cost decreases with the maximum power.
    In addition, the LQR cost with both control-oriented methods is lower than that
    with the water-filling method. Particularly, when P max =1dBW , the systems with
    the water-filling method are unstable, leading to an infinite cost. This verifies
    the superiority of the proposed method. It is observed that the LQR cost with
    H = 100m is lower than that achieved with H = 1000 m. This is because lower UAV
    height leads to less path loss. Notably, when the maximum power becomes large
    enough, the difference in LQR cost caused by different UAV heights becomes negligible.
    This is because the communication capability significantly exceeds control requirements
    and the LQR cost approaches its minimal value tr( Σ k S k ) , which can be observed
    from (8). Fig. 2. LQR cost achieved by different power allocation methods. Show
    All Fig. 3a compares the power allocated to each channel obtained with different
    methods, with P max =5dBW . The intrinsic entropy rates of each system are set
    as 5. The channels are sorted such that g 1 ≥ g 2 ≥⋯≥ g 5 . In Fig. 3a, the difference
    between these two methods is clearly shown. The control-oriented allocation method
    tends to allocate more power to channels with bad conditions, while the water-filling
    method behaves oppositely. To show the difference more clearly, we compare the
    power allocation results with lower maximum power and more robots in Fig. 3b,
    where P max =−10dBW and K = 10. It is seen that the water-filling method in this
    case will not allocate any power to some channels with poor conditions, while
    the control-oriented allocation method still allocates power to every channel
    to ensure the system stability under constraint (7c). Fig. 3. Power allocated
    to channels with different channel gains by different methods under different
    maximum transmit power constraints. Show All In Fig. 4, we show the impact of
    satellite latency. It is seen that the LQR cost increases as the satellite latency
    increases. This is because the time for command communication decreases with larger
    satellite latency, resulting in deterioration of the control performance. For
    this consideration, Geostationary Earth Orbit satellite might not be a suitable
    choice for SC 3 networks, since its latency could be longer than the control period,
    resulting an unstable system. Fig. 4. LQR cost under different satellite latency.
    Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this letter, we investigated a SC 3 integrated
    satellite-UAV network. A control-oriented power allocation problem was formulated.
    We transformed it into a convex problem and proved that more power should be allocated
    to the loops with higher intrinsic entropy rates to improve the control performance.
    We further derived the closed-form expression of the optimal power in the assure-to-be-stable
    case. Simulation results showed the difference between the control-oriented method
    and the capacity-oriented water-filling method. Specifically, the former will
    allocate more power to the channel with worse conditions while the latter behaves
    oppositely. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Listen Water-related natural hazards, including flooding and droughts, caused
    over $86 billion in damage and killed over 57,000 people around the world between
    the period of 2009–2019 (CRED 2020). Water resources support hundreds of billions
    of dollars in commerce, provide safe drinking water, and support recreation, irrigation,
    power generation, and manufacturing (Loucks & Beek 2017; Seo et al. 2019). Reliable
    and real-time monitoring of water resources is critical to minimize the loss of
    life and property from water-related hazards and the effective management of water
    resources (Guo 2010; Sit et al. 2019). The high cost of deployment and maintenance
    of these sensors causes challenges for data coverage, which is crucial to tackle
    vital issues like natural disaster mitigation (Yildirim & Demir 2021), water resource
    management (Demir et al. 2009), and climate change (Khan et al. 2020). For instance,
    there are 30 million stream reaches in the USA with an insufficient monitoring
    network of just 8,300 sensors (Marcarelli 2019). Currently, in the USA, federal
    and state agencies are using stage sensors that cost from $3,000 to $15,000, with
    annual maintenance costs ranging from $1,000 to $15,000 (Hennigan 2011). Furthermore,
    a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-sponsored report shows that for every
    $1 spent on disaster mitigation efforts from federal grants, $6 are saved from
    disaster damages on average (Multihazard Mitigation Council 2018). Thus, these
    statistics can be interpreted to conclude that the current state of water monitoring
    requires an immediate solution for low-cost and accurate water level measurement
    sensors. The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) identify
    the most important challenges currently facing humanity, including the pursuit
    of clean water, combatting climate change impacts, and creating disaster-resilient
    communities (UN 2016). Recently, the UN Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology,
    and Innovation for the SDGs (IATT 2021) published a report outlining how the rapid
    development of technology can aid in achieving the SDGs, particularly the utilization
    of autonomous sensors for environmental monitoring purposes (Demir et al. 2015;
    Boesl et al. 2021). A flexible approach that can be realized in a variety of devices
    to be applicable in a multitude of scenarios for water level measurement is needed,
    including in situ placement of stand-alone sensors as well as portable devices
    (Abolghasemi & Anisi 2021). There are various approaches that have been taken
    to tackle the issues of scalable and affordable stream stage measurements (Lin
    et al. 2017). One of the most widely studied and implemented methods of utilizing
    cameras in automated stage measurements is the use of staff gauges or known structures
    and shapes at the point of interest (POI) (Leduc et al. 2018; Chapman et al. 2022).
    While establishing and installing a reference point proves to be useful in accurate
    measurements, it requires a substantial amount of investment financially and in
    terms of acquiring appropriate permits (Sabbatini et al. 2021). Depth estimation
    via stereo imaging as well as the use of low-cost LIDAR sensors have also been
    studied for water monitoring (Mordvintsev & Abid 2013). However, the major challenge
    with such approaches is their tendency to yield substantially increasing margins
    of error as the range (e.g., distance) increases (Zhao et al. 2020). More recently,
    Karegar et al. (2022) presented a novel, low-cost, and demonstrated approach to
    utilize a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interferometric reflectometry
    technique to identify the water level by installing a Raspberry-Pi-powered antenna
    by a river and observed successful stage approximations, while acknowledging the
    technique may not perform well for rivers with a width less than 50 m, rivers
    that are almost dried out or at low levels, and for locations where satellite
    signals may be blocked. This research presents a novel methodology for intelligent
    stream stage measurement that utilizes prevalent sensors commonly found in smart
    devices. The methodology creates a distinct opportunity for a low-cost, camera-based
    embedded system that will measure water levels and share surveys to support environmental
    monitoring and decision-making (Teague et al. 2021). The presented intelligent
    stage sensing is implemented as an in situ installation of a complete single-board
    computer (i.e., a stand-alone sensor), which utilizes a registry of structures
    and POIs along with the core modules of the application logic: (1) deep-learning
    powered water segmentation module and (2) geometric POI calculation module. The
    implementation relies on a Raspberry-Pi with a motorized camera for automated
    measurements and is supported by a Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controller
    and multiprocessing. An administrative web panel is developed to manage, monitor,
    and calibrate intelligent stage sensors upon deployment. One of the main motivations
    behind this study is to demonstrate the need for and value of intelligent stream
    monitoring approaches and to establish a plethora of research and application
    areas to propel future work. Furthermore, the presented affordable sensor solution,
    along with the potential for the methodology''s expansion into a smartphone application,
    can provide benefits, especially to underserved nations and communities (Cosgrove
    & Rijsberman 2014) and facilitate collaboration with data scientists and geoscientists
    (Ebert-Uphoff et al. 2017). Given water data''s utility in various environmental
    tasks (e.g., flood mitigation; Alabbad et al. 2022), intelligent sensing approaches
    can support the SDG goals as established in the aforementioned UN report. The
    remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the proposed
    methodology along with a thorough description of the system architecture. Section
    3 presents the preliminary results of the experiment, both as a simulation and
    in operation. Finally, Section 4 concludes the article with a concise summary
    of findings and outlines future work and recommendations to tackle the challenges
    of intelligent stream monitoring. INTELLIGENT STREAM STAGE SENSING Background
    Listen Within the scope of addressing the scarcity of stream stage measurement
    points worldwide, five geometry-based approaches have been proposed by Sermet
    et al. (2020) to measure water levels utilizing inexpensive sensors. Previously,
    the 3-Cone Intersection method was implemented and tested as a mobile application
    to promote crowdsourcing. While it proved to be highly flexible and is readily
    applicable worldwide without requiring any site-specific preprocessing, error
    margins introduced by human errors are not trivial in consideration of the measurements’
    usage in environmental tasks (e.g., flood forecasting and reservoir governance).
    This research investigates the realization of another approach, entailing the
    convergence of a vector with a known structure at the POI, in pursuit of achieving
    a reliable, accurate, and actionable data flow (Demir & Sermet 2021). It is applicable
    for sites that have a clearly visible structure (e.g., building, infrastructure,
    and land) that intersects with the water body and requires only a single survey
    (i.e., taking a picture of the water intersection). The mechanism behind this
    approach can be summarized as assessing the water level at a POI by establishing
    a virtual vector with the initial point represented by the sensor geolocation
    and the absolute orientation of the camera at the time of the survey. The constructed
    vector is then intersected with the 3D model of the feature on-site to yield the
    altitude of the current water level. The presented methodology creates a distinct
    opportunity for two innovative approaches for stage measurement: (1) a smartphone
    application and (2) a camera-equipped embedded system. As a citizen science practice,
    the public can use the mobile application to perform and share surveys to support
    environmental research and decision-making (Ewing & Demir 2021). For continuous
    and reliable monitoring of selected sites, stand-alone water level measurement
    sensors that are comprised of low-cost, camera-based single-board computers can
    be utilized as a significantly low-cost complement to existing systems. As part
    of this study, stand-alone sensor implementation is explored. Sensor design and
    implementation Listen The presented approach relies on several independent core
    components, including a registry of geographic objects representing the POIs,
    image processing to determine water–structure intersection, and geometric calculations
    based on an earth model. Though they are implemented at the sensor level to support
    edge computing, their independent and flexible nature allows their migration to
    a centralized web server to enable intelligent stream stage sensing via various
    devices (e.g., smartphones) that are capable of producing the defined signals.
    The method is realized as a single-board computer (e.g., Raspberry-Pi) equipped
    with a single camera, a servomotor, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a GPS
    receiver, and a battery. In order to increase accuracy and allow different use
    cases, the system supports additional optional hardware, including a cell modem,
    a LIDAR sensor, a laser sensor, and a solar panel. In order to achieve the lowest
    cost (e.g., component cost, the effort required for deployment, and personnel
    cost for maintenance) possible with viable accuracy, the implementation in this
    study does not depend on any of the optional hardware and they were not considered
    for the simulation. Figure 1 depicts the system architecture along with components
    and their interactions. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE System architecture
    for implementation on a single-board computer. POI registry Listen The presented
    approach aims to find the water level by virtually constructing a 3D vector between
    the camera and the water intersection with a structure. It requires a clearly
    visible structure (e.g., bridge column and building) with a modellable surface
    and a known geolocation that intersects with the water. The 3D model of the structure
    on the measurement site is defined before deployment and saved in a relational
    database accessible via an Application Programming Interface (API) with functionality
    allowing the device to query by location and orientation to retrieve the desired
    POI in close proximity. The 3D model consists of a combination of geometrical
    objects with geolocation representing a simplified version of the intersecting
    structure, the location and shape of which can be assessed in a variety of strategies,
    including retrieving structure plans and data from building owners or from the
    city, taking manual on-site measurements using precise land surveying equipment,
    and utilizing high-accuracy or upscaled Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) (Demiray
    et al. 2021). However, for the sake of rapid prototyping, worldwide applicability,
    convenience, and low-cost, Google Earth has been used to extract the geolocations
    of the objects of interest and define the POI. Water segmentation Listen The sensor
    leverages a custom image segmentation model to automatically detect the intersection
    of the water with the structure using neural networks. The sensor performs the
    recognition at a predefined frequency to monitor the changes in water level. If
    the water level changes, the water intersection identified by the segmentation
    will drive the sensor camera movement, making it possible to calculate the new
    stage. Within the scope of this paper, an open-source and well-established obstacle
    detection model for autonomous boats has been adopted to utilize the underlying
    U-Net-based convolutional neural network to determine the waterline (Steccanella
    et al. 2020). POI calculation Listen For geometrical calculations, all geolocations
    are converted (by default, the WGS84 datum/ellipsoid) to the Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed
    (ECEF) Cartesian coordinate system for decreased error margin. Thus, latitude,
    longitude, and altitude are represented as x, y, and z. The direction of the camera
    is expressed in terms of pitch and yaw angles. The vector is limited to a length
    of 120 m, as the measurement site is expected to be closer than that distance
    for accuracy. Thus, the 3D vector can be defined by its origin and end points
    (Equation (1)). Once the 3D vector is generated, it is then intersected with geometrical
    objects representing the structure on the measurement site. For simplicity, during
    the case study, planes are used as the default geometrical object, which can be
    defined by three points on its surface. Once the intersection is calculated, its
    ECEF coordinate (x, y, z) is converted back to latitude, longitude, and altitude,
    of which the resulting altitude is the water level. For geometrical operations
    against the Karney ellipsoidal earth model, an open-source geodesy library is
    utilized (PyGeodesy 2022). (1) Automatic controller Listen In order to let the
    findings from the camera feed control the camera movements, an implementation
    of visual servoing is required. Two control techniques for visual servoing are
    considered, namely Image-based (2D) and Pose-based (3D) (Chaumette & Hutchinson
    2006). Since pose does not hold significance in the monitoring of surface water,
    the Image-based approach has been adopted. We implemented a PID control system
    (Rosebrock 2019) to automate the process of keeping track of the water intersection
    at the POI. As widely established in the literature, PID controllers function
    broadly to minimize the error between a setpoint and the process variable as part
    of a feedback loop (Pawar et al. 2018). In the proposed sensor''s context, the
    desired condition is to center the water intersection line as per the camera perspective,
    the process variable is a point selected on the extracted perimeter subject to
    conditions attached, and the error is the pixel-wise distance between the variable
    and the image center. The main course of action taken by the controller will be
    tilting the camera over the x-axis (i.e., up and down) to track the changes in
    water level, though the controller supports panning over the y-axis (i.e., left
    and right) for use during initialization and in rare cases where water visibility
    shifts as the stage fluctuates. The employed water segmentation method readily
    identifies the water-representing pixel groups defined by their perimeter. To
    contextualize the output for use in the controller, a point must be selected dynamically
    as the target for guiding the servo sensors. Considering the high variance introduced
    by the sampling process (e.g., unsteady water surface, image noise, and component
    error margins), considerations need to be made in the point selection as to eliminating
    infinite loops. Hence, the PID controller must enforce satisfaction criteria.
    Taking continuous monitoring into account, the process variable is determined
    as the point on the perimeter that (1) is closest to the image center and (2)
    does not have another perimeter point below in its orthographic projection. Because
    the ground truth changes with each observation (i.e., water is in motion), we
    need a fail-safe mechanism to prevent another type of possible infinite loop that
    is caused by the intrinsic feature of the monitored resource and not the controller.
    As a solution, the system keeps records of all the error terms, e(t), as well
    as the resulting camera orientation, in order to construct a trendline and assess
    the noise based on a threshold. Hence, the system estimates the true stage by
    minimizing negative effects that may be caused by waves and debris. Given that
    the sensor operation is automated and does not involve user interaction, the entire
    workflow is executed as concurrent processes using Python''s multiprocessing package,
    which manipulates the same variables shared over the server process maintained
    by the manager component (Marowka 2018). Administrative web panel Listen A web
    server is created to serve as an administrative panel for the setup and maintenance
    of the sensor. The flask web framework is utilized to expose the core functionalities
    offered by the unit to initialize, fine tune, and monitor the measurements as
    well as to handle site-specific anomalies. An intuitive user interface is designed
    with features including observing the real-time feed from the camera, manually
    aligning the camera, setting orientational offsets (e.g., pitch and yaw), and
    manually setting the deployed sensor geolocation (Figure 2). It should be noted
    that these features are optional and the sensor is capable of fully automated
    operation. For security as well as privacy reasons (e.g., water data quality for
    research and decision-making, camera access), the control panel can only be accessed
    from devices connected to the same network. However, depending on the requirements,
    the server can be exposed to the internet (e.g., ngrok), opening up use cases
    to remotely manage a network of sensors from a centralized application on the
    field. Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Admin panel for the sensor. System initialization
    and continuous monitoring Listen The stage sensor is first mounted at a location
    with a clear sight to a POI that possesses the characteristic of a water resource
    (e.g., river) intersecting with an immovable object such as a bridge, a building,
    or terrain, while the latter should be evaluated case-by-case depending on the
    error margin it may introduce due to the factors such as erosion. Upon booting,
    the sensor measures and records its geolocation and rotates the camera to the
    water intersection automatically. This rotation is measured and saved in the form
    of servomotor steps as well as the IMU measurements to accurately calculate the
    3D orientation of the camera. Hence, the sensor is autonomously aimed at a potential
    POI candidate visible to the camera during the installation, upon which the user
    can customize the parameters manually via the admin panel. The 3D model of the
    POI structure or terrain is retrieved once during initialization via a REST API
    from a centralized repository, with the selection criterion as the POI being contained
    within the spherical wedge defined by a portion of a sphere that has the sensor
    geolocation as its center with a diameter of 120 m (i.e., the practical limit
    of camera ranges with respect to the measurement accuracy). Of all the POIs returned
    from the repository for this query, the one with the closest proximity to the
    sensor is selected. By this point, the system has been using absolute orientation,
    which is prone to errors and noise due to environmental factors. That is why,
    once the POI is defined, the system goes through a calibration round in order
    to mitigate the noise by switching to relative orientation. A singular point on
    the POI is selected to mathematically calculate the pitch and yaw angles required
    to aim the camera (Equation (2)). Once the absolute orientation is identified
    (in radians) to constitute the reference point, the sensor then performs another
    stage of automated recognition to rotate the camera to the water intersection,
    however, recording relative movements. Finally, a 3D vector is created using the
    camera orientation, upon which there is supposed to be a point intersecting with
    the reference object. The altitude of this intersection represents the water level,
    which the system records along with a compressed picture of the site at the moment
    of measurement. (2) Once the initialization process is complete, the system performs
    continuous monitoring at predefined time intervals and relays the survey results
    to a centralized system for storage and visualization (Figure 3). During continuous
    monitoring, the system prioritizes tracking in a vertical fashion to measure the
    fluctuations in the water level. Hence, the yaw angle is fixed while the pitch
    angle stays as a variable, resulting in the creation of a 2D vector to assess
    the stage. Figure 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Flowchart describing the continuous
    monitoring process upon deployment (i.e., happy path). RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
    Listen The presented intelligent stage sensing methodology has been validated
    with a simulation that was conducted for a virtual sensor located at the IIHR–Hydroscience
    and Engineering building, with the measurement site (POI) as the Iowa Power Plant,
    which intersects with the Iowa River (Figure 4). The measurement site has been
    defined by a 3D plane for simplicity, which is described by three points on its
    surface. After the simulation data were supplied to the software, the water stage
    was calculated as 188.72 m, in comparison to the ground truth of 189 m, meaning
    that our approach was successfully able to estimate the water level with an error
    of 0.28 m for a POI that is approximately 90 m away. Upon the methodology''s validation,
    an implementation was realized as a stand-alone sensor for in situ installation
    in the locale as the simulation. The stage sensor is placed in a room that has
    a direct view of the water resource and has a Wi-Fi internet connection and electricity
    to power the sensor (i.e., plugged into an electrical outlet) (Figure 4(a)). The
    sensor was calibrated through the control panel and provided real-time measurements
    based on the video feed, proving its functionality in the operational setting,
    though the measurements exhibited a fluctuating accuracy due to the aggressive
    waves caused by the dam right near the POI (Figure 4(b)). Figure 4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE System validation and case study: (a) Survey setup; (b) close-up picture
    of the POI (not from the sensor camera); and (c) simulation parameters and result.
    This study details the methodology and its implementation, along with a simulated
    case study to showcase functional accuracy. However, a systematic experiment needs
    to be designed and executed at viable locales to study its feasibility in a real-life
    setting. The experiment can be conducted at places with existing USGS sensors
    to serve as reference points, focusing on the analysis of (1) the role that different
    weather conditions play (e.g. fog, precipitation, night time, temperature, and
    humidity) in image processing and sensor reliability; (2) identification of the
    ideal interval for measurements and discretization; (3) assessing and comparing
    the accuracy of singular point measurements with running average trendlines; and
    (4) calibration of critical parameters, including camera specifications, signal
    filters, and power usage. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Listen This study presents
    a novel methodology for water level measurement that utilizes prevalent sensors
    commonly found in smart devices and showcases its utility by realizing a low-cost,
    camera-based embedded system for on-site surveys. It utilizes static (e.g., a
    known structure that intersects with the water body) and dynamic parameters for
    the deployment site to power the presented geometry-based liquid level estimation
    algorithm. Its main purpose is to serve as a complementary solution to filling
    the substantial data gap caused by unmonitored sites and to support environmental
    research and decision-making by providing reliable and consistent stage measurements.
    An experiment has been conducted to validate the proposed implemented system''s
    functional operation and stability, along with a simulation that validated the
    degree of error margin under optimal conditions. Thus, while the methodology is
    validated, future case studies are needed to assess measurement accuracy in varying
    environmental conditions and sensory combinations. The findings of this study
    reveal numerous opportunities for future work, both from an application and research
    standpoint, some of which are identified below: (a) The accuracy and cost needed
    for the real-world application of stage measurements vary among different organizations
    (e.g., federal and state organizations, insurance companies, research groups,
    and property owners). For instance, federal organizations with decision-making
    motivation prioritize accuracy to the maximum extent possible, whereas increased
    coverage is just as valuable in the case of determining flood insurance costs
    for real estate. Similarly, different use cases may favor a higher initial deployment
    cost to decrease the long-term cost of maintenance, while others require minimizing
    upfront costs. In future work, such use cases should be carefully studied to design
    optimal stage sensor variations based on optional hardware and pre-deployment
    activities. (b) Another area of future work is utilizing neural networks to support
    or replace the PID controller. Currently, the stage sensor functions on a feedback
    loop to continuously adjust the camera orientation based on the waterline identification
    until a satisfaction threshold is reached. As an enhancement, each sensor can
    be equipped with a predictive model that is continuously trained upon the pixel-wise
    difference in waterline and resulting servo updates (in addition to other pertaining
    parameters) to calculate the required degree of change. Each sensor would have
    its own model calibrated to its site (e.g., POI distance and environmental parameters).
    Once satisfactory precision is achieved, the model can replace the PID controller
    and allow the camera to aim at the new water intersection in a single step (i.e.,
    a single servo update). While the training can be computationally expensive and
    power-hungry initially, it may, in fact, increase the power efficiency of the
    sensor in the long term by minimizing the overhead of servo operation caused by
    the PID controller. (c) The proposed stage sensor relies on the workflow of physically
    aiming the camera to the water intersection, thereby including a dynamic component
    that may complicate long-term maintenance and may suffer from the imprecision
    of the aiming process for further distances, which would be even more imperfect
    in the case of the implementation of the methodology as a smartphone application.
    This issue brings out the need to derive an equation to calculate the changes
    in water level with pixel differences without requiring the rotation of the camera,
    given that the POI is still visible. The equation would require the incorporation
    of additional parameters such as the camera specifications and highly precise
    structure and terrain models, which may be particularly difficult in cases of
    irregular surfaces. (d) Depending on the installation location, it is very likely
    that the sensor camera will be subject to obstructions and noise. In the case
    of the presented experiment, the windows are often covered with dust, spider webs,
    bugs, raindrops, and mud splashes. Deep-learning powered noise elimination approaches
    can be integrated into the image processing module. For instance, Liu et al. (2020)
    presented a method based on deep convolutional neural networks to automatically
    recover images through obstructions such as reflections, raindrops, and fences.
    The repository is open-source and directly applicable to the problem at hand.
    (e) The proposed methodology can be implemented as a Progressive Web Application
    (PWA) to pave the way to effective and convenient crowdsourced stage measurements
    running entirely using smartphones. One of the main advantages of the PWA approach
    is that the application can function on different types of devices (e.g., iOS,
    Android) utilizing the smartphone sensors and camera without requiring native
    development. Furthermore, the PWA approach enables the system''s utilization all
    around the world without individual sensor manufacturing, deployment, permit,
    and maintenance costs. A centralized POI repository can be developed and continuously
    expanded with support from local communities and administrative units. To encourage
    the public and ensure a continuous flow of stage measurements from the community,
    gamification methods can be employed (e.g., collecting points, feedback mechanisms,
    and recognition). (f) As a way to increase the effectiveness and interoperability
    of water level data collected via a wide range of devices and locations, water
    data sharing platforms and workflows can be researched, particularly based on
    blockchain technology. Water monitoring collaboration among institutions based
    on widespread IoT devices and immutable and verifiable records can enable holistic
    analysis for flood forecasting, circumventing the well-established challenges
    of water management (Lin et al. 2017). (g) On-site availability of internet-enabled
    and camera-equipped devices with high computational power opens a plethora of
    opportunities for future enhancements and alternative applications. In addition
    to the water level measurement, the presence of the camera enables further monitoring
    scenarios such as recognizing objects (e.g., debris, tree, human, and boat) on
    the water surface using deep learning and supplying annotated data for use in
    hydrological processes including surface water modeling, streamflow estimation,
    and flood prediction (Sit et al. 2020). ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen This project is

  description: The Internet of Things has a wide range of potential applications in
    environmental monitoring, including environmental protection, water safety, monitoring
    of severe weather, protection of endangered species, and commercial farming, amongst
    others. In these kinds of applications, sensors monitor and record any conceivable
    change in the surrounding environment. In order to facilitate the computations
    that utilises high energy, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has evolved. Using the
    techniques in MEC, energy-based task scheduling can be done with higher efficiency.
    For enhancing the energy-based data transmissions and performing computations,
    a novel MEC framework which incorporates heterogeneous components is proposed.
    Base stations and MEC servers are also included in the framework to perform computation-intensive
    tasks. Though the state change in base stations is continuous, the time is discretised
    to make the system effective. Communication and bandwidth allocation, computation
    tasks, and energy utilisation are prioritised and meticulously handled using statistical
    modeling. Queuing policy is introduced at various components of the proposed system
    to ensure the consistency of the computing task. The queued tasks are effectively
    managed using the optimidation algorithms based on energy conservation parameters.
    The neural network-based Reinforcement learning technique is proposed for optimising
    the data offloading and energy utilisation. By considering the contemporary system
    parameters, the actions are taken upon based on the optimisation technique. The
    proposed optimisation technique could adaptively learn the efficient policy for
    the given system and so it out performs the benchmark algorithms like Dueling
    Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), and Greedy policy.

    IEEE Conference Location: Imphal, India SECTION I. Introduction Cultivating has
    come a long way since it was first developed thousands of years ago. The need
    for novel approaches has never been higher than it is now, what with the world’s
    population rapidly expanding and mounting demand to increase food production without
    compromising sustainability. The Internet of Agricultural Things (IoAT) is a game-changing
    innovation that is reshaping conventional farming methods into “Smart Agriculture”
    or “Smart Farming.” With their built-in sensors, actuators, and networking capabilities,
    the “things” that make up the “Internet of Agricultural Things” (IoAT) can automatically
    gather and share information with one another. When used to farming, IoAT enables
    farmers to make data-driven decisions and improve farming practices in ways never
    previously possible. IoAT equips farmers to face the problems of scarce resources,
    a changing climate, and a growing global demand for food by allowing them to monitor,
    measure, and control a wide range of variables in real time. Farmers may learn
    a lot about the elements that affect crop growth, livestock health, and farm productivity
    by deploying IoAT-enabled devices and smart sensors throughout farmlands, livestock,
    and supply networks. In this introductory piece, we’ll look at the major ways
    in which the Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing agriculture, including
    its uses, advantages, and prospective effects on food production, resource management,
    and long-term sustainability. The IoT has ushered in a modern era of data-driven
    farming in which efficiency and sustainability go hand in hand, from precision
    agriculture and automated irrigation systems to livestock monitoring and predictive
    analytics. Incorporating IoT into farming has the potential to completely transform
    the food production industry by making farming more productive, sustainable, and
    profitable. Through the use of IoAT, farmers may improve water conservation, fertilizer
    efficiency, energy savings, and early detection of problems that could otherwise
    compromise crop health and productivity. Additionally, IoAT solutions in agriculture
    are not restricted to large-scale industrial farms; rather, they may be modified
    and scaled to meet the requirements of smallholder farmers everywhere. Improving
    food security and empowering rural people are two major goals of the Internet
    of Things (IoAT). The implementation of IoAT in agriculture presents opportunities
    and problems, as with any game-changing technology. The smooth implementation
    of IoT solutions in agriculture depends on resolving problems with data privacy,
    cyber security, up-front costs, and the digital divide. The Auto-ID Centre at
    MIT and its market research papers popularised the IoT in 1999. The IoT is a network
    of electronic devices that can communicate, monitor, control, and influence each
    other’s internal and external surroundings [1]. Enhanced end-device, system, and
    service connection thanks to IoT widespread adoption has become a game-changer
    for businesses of all stripes. Health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion, industrial control, and agriculture can benefit from the IoT [2].
    There has been a loT of effort put towards IoAT technology in agriculture to create
    smart farming solutions [3]. By analyzing a wide range of farming difficulties,
    the Internet of Things has introduced a revolutionary change to the agricultural
    landscape [4]. Technical advances are expected to help agriculturalists and technologists
    solve water shortages, cost management, and production issues utilizing IoT [5]
    [6]. Modern IoT technologies have found all these issues and offer cost-effective
    solutions to enhance productivity. Wireless sensor networks collect and send sensor
    data to primary servers [7]. Sensor data reveals system and environmental conditions.
    Field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of undesired objects, wild
    animal attacks, thefts, and so on all affect agricultural yield, therefore environmental
    conditions are only one component in crop quality [8] [9]. IoAT also provides
    an organized schedule for limited resources, ensuring that IoT maximizes efficiency.
    Figure 1 shows modern agricultural trends including greenhouse, cattle, farmer,
    and field monitoring. IoAT agricultural networks based on wireless devices allow
    for continuous monitoring of crops and livestock. As can be seen in the figure,
    two sensor kits have been deployed to track things like soil moisture, leaf wetness,
    temperature, humidity, productivity, air flow, and more. These kits are the Libelium
    Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoAT Vertical Kit and the Crop/ Plant Monitoring Sensor
    Kit, respectively. While the MooMonitor+ sensor keeps an eye on things like the
    animal’s vitals, fertility, diet, ruminant activity, and sleep schedule. When
    it comes to storing records and providing on-demand agricultural services to authorized
    users, the agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play a crucial
    role. There are several programmes, guidelines, and prototypes in the agriculture
    sector as a whole. Network platform, network architecture, applications, security,
    and problems are all topics of study in the field of Internet of Agricultural
    Things (IoAT) agriculture [10] [11] [12]. In addition, numerous countries and
    organizations throughout the world have developed various IoAT policies and guidelines
    in the agriculture industry. However, a fair amount of work has been done in the
    IoAT agricultural environment, and a comprehensive study on IoAT in the agriculture
    context is required to grasp the present state of research. This article examines
    numerous difficulties and trends in IoT smart farming with the goal of transforming
    agriculture technologies through IoT innovation. SECTION II. Background Study
    The physical setup, information gathering, information processing, and information
    analysis are the four pillars of any data infrastructure. When it comes to precision
    agriculture, the physical structure is the single most essential aspect in preventing
    accidents. Everything from sensors to actuators to gadgets are under the system’s
    command. Soil, temperature, weather, light, and moisture are just some of the
    variables that can be measured with the help of a sensor. Similar to nodes, devices
    carry out a variety of control functions such as discovering new nodes, identifying
    and naming devices, and so on. Any sensor or gadget operated by a microcontroller
    can carry out all these tasks. Any Internet-connected computer or other remote
    device can perform this controlling function. Standard data acquisition and IoT
    data acquisition are two subcomponents of data acquisition. In this case, the
    IoT data gathering part is made up of seven different protocols: Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP),
    Node, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS),
    and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). More protocols can be utilised to accomplish
    smart farming depending on the needs and conditions. Whereas ZigBee, WiFi, LoraWan,
    SigFox, and ISOBUS have all been utilised in conventional data capture, so have
    these. Image and video processing, data loading, decision assistance, and data
    mining are all part of data processing. Depending on system demands, any functionality
    can be implemented to provide parallel services. Live Stock Monitoring, Field
    Monitoring, and Greenhouse Monitoring are smart agriculture’s main control applications.
    Data analytics involves monitoring. With the help of the IoT, farmers can keep
    tabs on their cattle by using a variety of sensors to track vital signs including
    body temperature, heart rate, and digestive function [13]. Field monitoring software
    reports soil quality, climate, gas levels, air and water pressure, and crop diseases
    [14] [15]. Using clever Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors, a smart
    greenhouse design reduces the need for human interaction and monitors a variety
    of environmental factors. [16] [17] [18]. A. Technology for the Internet of Things
    in Agriculture Numerous technologies are being employed in IoT agricultural solutions,
    making it challenging to provide an exhaustive list. Consequently, our discussion
    will concentrate on a select set of fundamental technologies that have significantly
    contributed to the modernization of IoT agricultural services. i. Cloud and Edge
    Computing Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing give farmers with universal
    access to pooled resources. Cloud computing plays a crucial role [19] in responding
    to requests through networks and carrying out activities for a wide range of agricultural
    needs. Cloud-based software may improve data processing and agricultural operations
    [20] [21]. Edge computing is used in the Internet of Things to process data on
    embedded sensors, actuators, and others. Cloud computing is based on edge or fog
    computing. This technology is implemented based on smart farming needs [22]. ii.
    Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics The vast quantities of data provided by
    agricultural sensors constitute big data. Using big data analysis, farmers may
    effectively monitor their crops at various growth stages [23]. Big data analysis
    in agriculture: a solid comprehensive review [24]. The excellent solutions provided
    by neural networks at lightning speed have made them immensely popular. Using
    cutting-edge neural network principles and technology, intrusion detection has
    finally become a reality. However, neural networks’ primary value is in the detection
    module and data training they offer [25]. An Internet of Things (IoT) based hydroponic
    system was created utilising deep neural networks [26]. iii. Protocols and Networks
    used for communication Multiple Internet of Things (IoT) network technologies
    contribute to the development of sensors and devices for crop or field monitoring
    [27]. IoT agriculture network applications and systems rely heavily on communication
    protocols [28]. All kinds of agricultural information are shared using them. iv.
    Robotics Smart farming with many Agribots reduces the demand for human farmers
    by moving faster and more efficiently. Agribots carry out routine tasks like weeding,
    spraying, planting, and harvesting. In order to maximise crop yields and make
    effective use of available resources, all of these robots are remotely controlled
    via the Internet of Things. Characterization and ground mapping using robotic
    multi-sensor systems have been proposed [29]. B. Internet of Agricultural Things
    (IoAT) Protocols For smart farming, many IoT connection protocols are already
    in use. Farmers can better optimize and track crop growth in smart farming with
    these protocols since they can communicate more easily. IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4
    G-Mobile Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal
    Area Networks, Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee are some of the most widely used wireless
    protocols currently in use. IEEE 802.11 WIFI: The IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless
    local area networks includes the 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac
    protocols. 5 GHz, 2.2 GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz, and 5 GHz are all usable frequencies
    for these specifications. These specifications cover a data transfer rate spectrum
    from 1 MBit/s to 7 Gigabit/s. It has a range of 20 meters to 100 meters for communicating
    [30]. For “smart agriculture,” there has been talk of a Wi-Fi-based wireless sensor
    network in the IoT [31] [40]. LoraWan: LoraWan is a long-distance communication
    standard created by Lora TM Alliance, a non-commercial, open-source group. The
    primary goal of this LoraWan protocol is to guarantee multi-operator compatibility
    [32]. A framework based on Lora and ARIMA technology has been presented in [33]
    to increase agricultural output and foresee potential issues. WiMax: Worldwide
    Interoperability specifies a data transfer rate between 1.5 Mb/s and 1 Gb/s for
    microwave access. But currently, thanks to technological progress, the data transfer
    rate is different [34]. WiMax enables high-speed, multi-access connection for
    stationary, portable, nomadic, and mobile users through wired and wireless networks.
    WiMax and WiFi have both been set up in the Ghanaian Ministry of Food and Agriculture
    (MOFA), giving users the option of connecting through WiMax hotspots or the MOFA’s
    in-house WiFi [35]. LR-WPAN: The technical details of high-level communication
    protocols like ZigBee are figured out by Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks.
    The range of LR-WPAN data transfer rates is 40 Kb/s250 Kb/s. The primary quality
    of this standard is that it delivers communication services at low speeds and
    inexpensive costs [36] [39]. The majority of LR-WPAN installations are in greenhouses,
    greenhouses, and indoor farms. ZigBee: ZigBee Alliance has developed the most
    advanced set of specifications for IEEE 802. It’s a list of rules for low-power
    data rates in device-to-device networks. The requirement for faster and lower
    power-consuming technology has grown in tandem with technological progress and
    rising throughput demands. More mature methods, which allow for quicker data transport,
    meet these needs. Internet of Things sensors collect information in farms and
    send it to a central database. Data is analyzed for decision making after sensing
    has been completed [37] [38]. SECTION III. Proposed Model a) Poly House The steel
    framework of a poly home is completely encased with polythene. This polythene
    shields the crop from the damaging effects of the sun, heavy rain, and storms,
    all of which can reduce yield. Poly homes allow private, controlled farming. While
    poly farm houses can help double crop yields and quality, there are always room
    for improvement, and Internet of Things (IoT) device integration in poly houses
    is one such area. b) Water Volume Sensor An IoT device called a water volume sensor
    checks the amount of water running through a pipe at any given time. Providing
    too much water can reduce production and waste water. This instrument measures
    water volume and transmits the data to a server, which then takes care of business
    by, say, turning off the pump, etc. Fig. 1: Proposed Model Show All c) Soil pH
    sensor In order to keep the soil at an optimal pH for a certain crop, a soil pH
    sensor is used. The user can check soil pH data from this pH sensor on a server
    and alter it to optimize crop growth. d) Soil Moisture Sensor The Soil Moisture
    Sensor is functionally equivalent to a soil pH meter. A server receives the data
    and acts on it, such as activating spray pumps to moisten the soil or lowering
    the poly house temperature if it is too warm. Fig. 2: Structure of Poly House
    Show All Algorithm for calculate soil moisture by using Soil Moisture sensor Step-1:
    Obtain the moisture_label value for the relative humidity from the given a sensor.
    Step-2: if moisture_label is less than 500, Print “Less Moisture Level” Action
    “Turn On the Pump” Else if moisture_label<1000&& moisture_label > 500 Print “Medium
    Moisture level” Else Print “High Moisture level” Step-3: keep on reading the information.
    e) Air Temperature Sensor The air temperature sensor is an Internet of Things
    (IoT) device that monitors the temperature within a poly home, transmits that
    data to the central server, and triggers the activation of appropriate cooling
    and heating systems, ventilation systems, and even the spraying of water, if necessary.
    The poly house’s interior temperature can then be kept at a comfortable level.
    Algorithm to calculate Air Temperatureby using Air Temperature sensor: 1: Obtain
    the moisture_label value of air temperature from the designated sensor. 2: Initiate
    the lower and upper bounds air temperatures required for that crop. 3: if (air_temp)(min_temp),
    Print “Low Temperature of the Air” Action “Turn On the Heater” Else if air_temp
    < max_temp && air_temp > min_temp Print “Optimal Degrees” Else Print “High Temperature
    in the Air” Action “Turn on the Cooler” Step 4: keep on reading the information.
    f) Motion Detector Sensor The field (poly home) can be monitored with a motion
    detector. These sensors pick up on any odd motion in the area, transmit that information
    to a computer, and then, after the server processes the data, sends a signal to
    yet another device installed along the poly house’s perimeter. When this gadget
    is activated, noise is produced, scaring the animals away. Crop Management: The
    central hub receives crop monitoring data from sensors. The server can water plants
    if soil moisture is low. The server automatically performs these tasks without
    any human participation. Technological Challenges: Protected cultivation, which
    is what polyhouse smart farming is, uses artificial conditions to boost crop productivity.
    While this strategy has many advantages, it also faces some significant technological
    obstacles. Climate Control and Automation: It is essential for the health and
    growth of the crops grown in polyhouses to keep the environment at its ideal temperature,
    humidity, and ventilation. The development of sophisticated temperature control
    systems that can make these adjustments automatically in response to changes in
    the environment or in the weather prediction is a difficult task. Energy Management:
    Polyhouses need power for a variety of purposes, including heating and cooling,
    lighting, and watering. If we want to save money and lessen your influence on
    the environment, you need to focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources
    (like solar panels), and consumption management. Irrigation and Water Management:
    Avoiding either over- or under-irrigation is a key component of sustainable farming.
    It is not an easy effort to design precision irrigation systems that can adjust
    to the varying needs of various crops and soil types. Nutrient Management: Sophisticated
    nutrient delivery systems are required to provide plants with the proper nutrients
    in a contained setting. To maximise yield and quality while minimising waste,
    precise control of nutrient mix and timing is essential. Data Integration and
    Analytics: Gathering, analysing, and deciphering data from numerous sensors and
    devices installed in the polyhouse is crucial for making informed decisions. Creating
    platforms that can consolidate information from various sources and deliver useful
    insights to farmers is a complex task. Sensor Technology: Reliable and precise
    sensors are essential for keeping tabs on a wide range of environmental conditions,
    including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, nutrient levels, and more. Engineering
    reliable sensors that can operate in the extreme environments of polyhouses is
    a difficult task. Pest and Disease Management: In a closed environment like a
    polyhouse, it is essential to monitor for and take preventative measures against
    the spread of pests and illnesses. It can be difficult to create automated systems
    for detecting pests and diseases utilizing imaging, machine learning, and other
    technologies. Remote Monitoring and Control: For flexibility and scalability,
    it’s crucial to give farmers the tools they need to keep an eye on and manage
    their polyhouses. Designing safe and intuitive remote control systems is not always
    easy. Crop Specific Optimization: Different crops have different needs in terms
    of light, temperature, and other environmental aspects. It’s a technical challenge
    to design systems that can adjust to the specific requirements of different crops
    and genotypes. Cost Considerations: Smart farming technology might be expensive
    to implement in polyhouses. It can be difficult to determine how much of an initial
    investment will pay off in terms of long-term advantages like improved yield and
    decreased resource usage. IoT Implementation Challenges: Variation in the surrounding
    environment: There are problems involved in implementing Internet of Things (IoT)
    solutions, such as those for polyhouse smart farming. Adapting to shifts in the
    surrounding environment is a major obstacle. There is a huge variety of different
    types of people who work in the food system, ranging from large too small. As
    a consequence of this, there is no single solution that will meet the needs of
    all parties involved, regardless of whether it is inventive, a commercial show,
    or administrative in nature. North American arable ranchers must make extraordinary
    preparations to operate with Hungarian vines. Large ranches in Central and Northern
    Europe have implemented precision agriculture to increase production and quality.
    The goal of this action was to boost production and enhance quality. However,
    the current financial weight in agriculture, high ranch division and dispersion,
    and expanding water limitation in Southern Europe need precision water system
    ways to limit asset consumption. This is because Southern Europe has a high ranch
    division and scattering rate. Sizes of farms and associated expenses of capital
    investments: Capital investment costs for implementing the Internet of Things
    can vary greatly depending on aspects including the size of a farm, the type of
    farming being done, its location, the technologies being used, and the volume
    of operations. Larger, more expensive farms are more responsive to IoT innovation,
    and they also benefit greatly from it as a major part of the continuing interest
    in new gear like tractors. Current leading intelligent cultivating mechanical
    arrangements, like My John Deere (John DeereTM), were built for large homesteads,
    or they only work in small plots of land, like Field-View (The Climate CorporationTM)
    and En circa (DuPontTM), which primarily serve the North American market. One
    example of an arrangement that was intended for extensive homesteads is Field-View
    (The Climate CorporationTM), which works only in constrained land spaces. My John
    Deere was one of the first driving clever cultivating mechanical arrangements.
    365FarmNet is now only available to customers in Central Europe, but the company
    is working to tailor the prices of its services and the types of businesses they
    offer to the size of the customer’s holdings. The challenge is to make Internet
    of Things solutions sufficiently appealing to small-scale farmers who have limited
    capital available for investing in new technology and significant concerns around
    the misuse of their personal information. Confidential business plans and other
    matters: IoT implementation difficulties in the context of polyhouse smart farming
    need thinking about the convergence of technology and security in order to protect
    sensitive information such as business strategies. Agriculturists are demanding
    an extremely high level of privacy and informational management, thus strategies
    that give ranches and other agri-food on-screen characters the freedom to alter
    the details they present are crucial. Farmers are averse to what they see as yet
    another loss of control and considerable value as major businesses like John Deere
    try to abuse the data obtained by the machines they offer. The American Farm Bureau
    Federation has just established the Agricultural Data Coalition to continue fighting
    for ranchers there to maintain control and responsibility over information. Public
    and customer acclaim: End users need to be educated and prepared on the appropriateness
    and application of these new innovations. According to, as of recently, 71% of
    EU cultivate leaders were still operating on the assumption that they did not
    require such updates for their regular jobs and did not have the time or energy
    to study. It will be difficult for youngsters who have not been taught to think
    creatively to adapt to new ideas. However, there are already training and education
    programmes underway in Europe that aim to disseminate IoT culture among young
    people and other stakeholders in the ecosystem. Cost: Small-scale farmers and
    those in underdeveloped nations may find the high price of Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices and infrastructure to be an insurmountable obstacle. Sensors, connectivity
    infrastructure, and data management platforms can be quite expensive. Connectivity
    and Cooperation: IoT solutions for agriculture come from a wide variety of sources,
    and devices from different manufacturers may not always work together. Bringing
    together different systems can be difficult and time-consuming. SECTION IV. Conclusion
    The use of Internet of Agricultural Things (IoAT) devices in agriculture has the
    potential to improve productivity and precision. Several areas of farming can
    benefit from implementing IoAT technologies. The price of essential resources
    like electricity and water can make or break the agricultural industry. Old, inefficient
    irrigation systems cause a lot more water to be wasted than people realise, and
    since water pumps require electricity to run, reducing water waste would also
    reduce electricity use. Using a smart gadget equipped with a pump, one may gauge
    both water volume and flow rate over time. Insecticides, fertilisers, and pesticides
    are all other areas of agriculture, but since we’re proposing using IoAT in a
    poly house a fully enclosed structure where insects can’t get in and harm the
    crop insecticide use will be reduced. The correct choice can be made with the
    help of internet-connected sensors in the crop field. Finally, we conclude that
    developing an ideal IoAT architecture for agriculture is necessary to improve
    crop quality and yield, reduce energy and water consumption, and lower the overall
    cost of agriculture. cost less and earn more money since farmers in countries
    like India are crucial to the country’s gross domestic product. Authors Figures

    IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Water is a basic
    necessity for all the life forms on Earth [1], [2]. It is well known that water
    is the main reason behind Earth being the only living planet. It is impossible
    for any living being to live without water [3], [4]. Without water, a plant cannot
    perform its essential photosynthesis. It is understandable that if the problem
    of water scarcity continues to increase, it will remove the greenery in the future.
    As a result of which, there will be less rainfall. Water is also essential for
    agricultural production and food security [5]–[7]. Technology has always served
    to overcome such problems and to make lives easy with its innovations. Here through
    this study one such solution is introduced, named ‘lOT based Soil Management System,’
    a model for controlling irrigation that uses IoTto sense soil moisture with temperature
    and humidity of the surroundings with a microcontroller to make an intelligent
    irrigation system to help millions of farmers and University gardeners [8], [9].
    Soil moisture is critical to plant growth, and maintaining the right amount of
    moisture can help plants grow faster and produce better yields. An efficient soil
    moisture management system can help conserve water by reducing the water needed
    for irrigation [10], [11]. A soil moisture management system can help reduce water
    usage and lead to cost savings of water bills and other expenses. By managing
    soil moisture levels, it helps to maintain soil health and reduce erosion, which
    is essential for sustainable agriculture [12]–[14]. Farmers and growers can proactively
    avoid drought conditions and other weather-related risks that can harm crops by
    monitoring soil moisture levels [15]–[17]. To evaluate the link between soil moisture
    readings acquired from soil moisture sensors and the gravimetric approach, a study
    was conducted at the Water Technology Centre farm (WTC) at Hyderabad based college
    [18]. In 2021, Fengfei et al.''s Portable PHS Method for Moisture in the Soil
    Monitoring Based on Thermal Effect is implemented. The results were compared to
    those obtained using the drying procedure, confirming the practicality of the
    suggested method [19]. In 2019, G. S. Swileam et al. assessed soil heterogeneity
    utilising electrical resistance for typical alluvial soils in Egypt [20]. In 2018
    smith et aI., proposed a system for efficiently maintaining optimal soil moisture
    levels for crops using various traditional soil management systems [21]. Gupta
    et al. (2020) analyze whether rooftop harvesting of rainwater and outline bunding
    enhances the moisture in the soil. Their effects on yields of crops, availability
    of water, and soil moisture management are examined [22]. Contour plowing, terracing,
    and checking dams in arid environments are the main focus of this study by Patel
    et al. It assesses their ability to reduce soil moisture evaporation and increase
    water retention [23]. To measure the soil moisture content, humidity, and temperature
    using Raspberry Pi Pico and other sensors to minimize the over-watering and under-watering
    of plants. This paper deals with multiple sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico
    to measure the current readings of the soil & surrounding of the University plants,
    analyze them, display the measurements on the webpage, and automatically water
    the plants when required by connecting them to a water pump. IoT-based soil management
    systems can collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather conditions,
    and other relevant factors. This enables farmers and growers of the university
    to make data-driven decisions and respond quickly to changes in soil moisture
    levels. Farmers and growers can remotely monitor soil moisture levels and other
    factors with this system. This can save time and reduce the need for manual labor
    in the field. The curated system can automate the irrigation process based on
    soil moisture levels and other data. Intelligent systems can help reduce water
    waste and improve crop yields. IoT -based soil management systems can be easily
    scaled to accommodate more significant areas of farmland or garden spaces in universities.
    These innovative systems are also suitable for large-scale agricultural operations
    and smaller-scale applications. SECTION II. Proposed Work This IoT -based system
    deals with multiple sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current
    readings of the soil & surroundings, analyze them, display the measurements on
    the website, and automatically water the plants when required by connecting to
    a water pump. The system uses micro python to interface the sensors and modules
    with the microcontroller Raspberry Pi Pico. This project deals with the automatic
    watering of plants whenever the moisture, humidity, and temperature level decreases
    to a specific standard limit. The working of proposed model consists of a soil
    moisture sensor and a temperature humidity sensor, which tracks the soil moisture
    along with the humidity and temperature of the surroundings. When the measurements
    exceed the required standard readings, the relay directs the motor to pump water
    to plants. This model will benefit people with large patches of gardens, Universities,
    or those farther from their places. The proposed system has advantages in reducing
    costs, restricting water waste, and minimizing physical interference. It also
    promotes irrigation that requires little maintenance and is environmentally friendly.
    In order to regulate the water flow, a relay module has been installed. The model
    shows expected impacts at various levels of humidity and temperature. Figure 1
    shows the proposed model of our IoT -based system. Fig. 1: Proposed IoT-based
    system for Soil Moisture management system Show All SECTION III. Methedologies
    Used The Soil Moisture Sensor yields real-time data in the form of an analog.
    Analog to Digital (A/D) and data conditions are converted using Raspberry Pi Pico
    Microcontroller. The Microcontroller is used to acquire real-time soil moisture
    using a soil moisture sensor. The Thonny Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    is a cross-platform application that supports high-level programming languages
    like Python. The IDE makes writing code and uploading the source program to the
    board easy. It contains libraries and cores. The samples are measured from low
    to High moisture contents of the soil. The gardener can get the processed data
    through the webpage with the help of Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Technology. This
    system can give real-time data on soil moisture. The Soil moisture system is connected
    to the web page. We have interfaced the soil moisture sensor, DHTII Module, and
    relay with a Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the volumetric concentration of water
    inside the soil and the humidity and temperature of the surroundings. This system
    uses Raspberry Pi Pico as a microcontroller, which is then connected to the Moisture
    Sensor, which measures the soil''s moisture content. Raspberry Pi Pico acts as
    the central brain of the IoT-based soil moisture management system, responsible
    for data collection, processing, analysis, communication, and automated control.
    It is also linked to DHT -11, the Temperature and Humidity sensor, which measures
    the ambient temperature and humidity. The Pico is also connected to the Wi-Fi
    module ESP-Ol, bridging the divide between the hardware and software components
    of the system shown in fig. 2. The measurements of the above sensors and modules
    and the standard measurements will subsequently be displayed for users on our
    self-designed website using the ESP-Ol. Fig. 2. Schematic Layout of our Proposed
    System Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation & Model Evaluation The proposed intelligent
    system captures data in real-time using a range of sensors and modules shown in
    fig. 5. University gardeners use these sensors to assess soil and environmental
    conditions. The soil management system we built is responsible for several duties.
    It begins by measuring the soil moisture content using a capacitive soil moisture
    sensor and then monitors the humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment
    with a DHTII Module. All plants have a threshold value set to standard soil moisture
    content for home/university gardeners. When the moisture level falls below the
    set standard/threshold level, the relay module turns the Motor On and begins pumping
    water to the plants from the tank until the moisture level returns to the desired
    level. The measurements mentioned above’ readings will be shown on a website built
    with the ESP-OI, which we designed with HTML and CSS and coded in Python. Fig.
    3 shows the hardware connection of sensors/modules to Raspberry Pico and figure

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Dharwad, India SECTION I. Introduction Globally,
    smart irrigation is gaining popularity as a solution to the problems caused by
    population expansion, climate change, and water constraint. Water is a limited
    resource, and as the world’s population continues to rise, there is an unprecedented
    rise in the demand for water. Farmers and gardeners are under pressure to figure
    out ways to use water more effectively while still growing healthy plants and
    crops [1]. In the past, irrigation systems were either manual or predicated on
    a set timetable, with water being applied according to the plants’ projected water
    needs. This strategy frequently results in over-irrigation, which wastes water
    and can also cause soil erosion, nutrient leaching, and pest issues. Conversely,
    inadequate watering can stress plants and impair their ability to grow and produce.
    However, smart irrigation systems offer a solution to these issues. Smart irrigation
    systems may customize watering schedules to meet particular plant demands using
    real-time data and analytics, ensuring that the proper amount and timing of water
    is provided [2]. To gather information on the environment and plant growth, these
    systems make use of a variety of sensors, including soil moisture sensors, weather
    sensors, and plant sensors. Advanced algorithms are then used to process this
    data in order to calculate the ideal water need for each plant. The potential
    of smart irrigation to conserve water is one of its most significant advantages.
    while also promoting water resource conservation, which is crucial as water shortage
    provided by smart irrigation. Smart irrigation can boost crop yields, enhance
    plant quality, and lessen the need for pesticides and fertilizers by maximizing
    plant growth. As water is administered strategically, it can also aid in reducing
    soil erosion and nutrient leaching. Smart irrigation systems can also be managed
    remotely, Farmers and gardeners can save time and work by monitoring and modifying
    watering plans from their cell phones or laptops [3]. Smart irrigation system
    adoption comes with some difficulties despite its many advantages. The initial
    cost of installation, which can be more than with standard irrigation systems,
    is one of the main difficulties. However, long-term water bill reductions and
    increased agricultural yields can easily make up for these expenses. Another obstacle
    for some farmers and gardeners may be the requirement for technical know-how and
    training to install and maintain smart irrigation systems. In conclusion, smart
    irrigation is a cutting-edge and environmentally friendly method of irrigation
    that is becoming more and more well-liked all over the world. Smart irrigation
    systems can aid in water conservation, boost crop yields, and enhance plant quality
    while also leveraging cutting-edge technology and data analytics. Smart irrigation
    is a viable method for tackling the problems caused by water scarcity and climate
    change, notwithstanding several obstacles to its adoption. SECTION II. Literature
    Review Literature review includes some of the works which are published previous
    with IEEE guidelines. Some of these works are mentioned below: A. A review of
    precision irrigation technologies and their applications in crop production. This
    study presents an overview of agricultural production applications for precision
    irrigation systems. The writers go over a number of methods, including drip irrigation,
    micro-irrigation, and fertigation, and their advantages, such as higher agricultural
    output and water saving. The research also addresses the drawbacks of precision
    irrigation methods, such as their expense and upkeep needs. The introduction of
    the study defines. popular precision irrigation technique known as drip irrigation
    to supply water straight to the plant’s root zone. In contrast, to drip irrigation,
    micro-irrigation distributes water more often and at a lower flow rate. Through
    the irrigation system, fertilization includes the simultaneous supply of water
    and fertilizers. The advantages of precision irrigation methods are also discussed
    in the study. Water conservation is a key advantage. Farmers may send water precisely
    to a plant’s root zone with precision irrigation, reducing runoff and evaporation.
    Compared to conventional irrigation techniques, this strategy can cut water use
    by up to 50%. By ensuring that plants receive the right quantity of water and
    nutrients, precision irrigation may also increase agricultural output and quality.
    This strategy enhances crop quality and uniformity while increasing crop output
    by up to 40%. B. A review of smart irrigation systems and their integration with
    precision agriculture The paper “A Review of Smart Irrigation Systems and Their
    Integration with Precision Agriculture” by Yang et al. (2020) provides an in-depth
    review of smart irrigation systems and their integration with precision agriculture.
    The authors explore the potential benefits of smart irrigation systems, as well
    as the challenges and opportunities associated with their implementation. The
    paper starts with an introduction to precision agriculture and the role of irrigation
    in crop production. The authors then define smart irrigation systems as those
    that use real-time data to optimize irrigation management, including soil moisture
    sensors, weather forecasting, and data analytics. The authors emphasize the potential
    benefits of smart irrigation systems, including improved water efficiency, crop
    yield, and environmental sustainability. The paper then discusses the challenges
    and opportunities associated with smart irrigation systems, including the need
    for data privacy and security, the cost of sensors and equipment, and the importance
    of user education and engagement. The authors also explore the potential for smart
    irrigation systems to be integrated with other precision agriculture technologies,
    such as variable rate fertilization and crop monitoring. The paper provides several
    case studies that demonstrate the benefits of smart irrigation systems in different
    contexts, such as a study of a smart irrigation system in a tomato greenhouse
    in Italy and a study of a smart irrigation system in a citrus orchard in Spain.
    These case studies illustrate how smart irrigation systems can be used to optimize
    water management and improve crop yield. Another point in the paper’s favor is
    its focus on the significance of user education and involvement. The authors emphasise
    the need of training farmers and other stakeholders in the use of smart irrigation
    systems, as well as their participation in the design and implementation of these
    systems. This is an essential topic since the success of smart irrigation systems
    is dependent on farmers’ desire to embrace and use them. C. A review of automated
    irrigation systems and their potential for water conservation The authors commence
    by addressing the significance of proficient water management in agriculture,
    given that water scarcity and the struggle for resources persist as critical obstacles
    in numerous regions. Subsequently, the authors present an outline of various forms
    of automated irrigation systems, such as soil moisture sensors, automated valves,
    and controllers. These systems have the potential to enhance irrigation techniques
    and reduce water consumption, culminating in superior water conservation outcomes.
    According to the authors, automated irrigation systems operate by monitoring and
    regulating water application based on real-time data, such as weather conditions,
    soil moisture levels, and plant water needs. This approach guarantees that crops
    receive the ideal amount of water while avoiding the perils of over-or under-irrigation.
    The paper also explores the benefits of automated irrigation systems, including
    diminished water consumption, amplified crop yields, and enhanced resource efficiency.
    The authors cite several studies that demonstrate how automated irrigation systems
    can aid water conservation efforts, particularly in regions with limited water
    availability. For instance, a study conducted in Israel indicated that automated
    irrigation systems reduced water usage by 20-30% in contrast to traditional irrigation
    practices. Nonetheless, the authors concede that there are challenges associated
    with implementing automated irrigation systems. These challenges include high
    initial costs, upkeep requirements, and the necessity for technical expertise.
    The authors suggest that financial incentives and training programs may help promote
    the adoption of automated irrigation systems, while also ensuring that farmers
    possess the necessary knowledge and skills to operate them effectively. The paper
    also delves into the potential for automated irrigation systems to mesh with other
    technologies, such as remote sensing and data analytics, to further optimize water
    management practices. The authors contend that incorporating these technologies
    can facilitate real-time monitoring of water resources, thereby enabling farmers
    to make informed decisions concerning irrigation practices. SECTION III. Existing
    System An existing system is a collection of procedures, processes, technology,
    and resources that have previously been developed and are being used to complete
    certain tasks or objectives. This system might be anything from a software application
    to an industrial production process, a communication network, or a government
    policy. Existing systems are critical to the operation of any organization or
    community because they provide a framework for efficiently and successfully obtaining
    desired results. A. NODEMCU ESP8266 The NodeMCU open-source firmware and development
    kit is based on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It offers a simple framework for creating
    IoT apps and projects. NodeMCU is a fantastic alternative for individuals who
    wish to construct IoT applications without spending a lot of time and money on
    hardware and software development. Fig. 1. NODE MCU Show All NodeMCU also supports
    various interfaces and protocols, including I2C, SPI, and UART, making it highly
    versatile and adaptable to different applications. It can communicate with other
    devices and sensors, making it suitable for use in home automation, smart farming,
    environmental monitoring, and many other IoT applications Fig. 1. NodeMCU is an
    ideal choice for developers who to create their IoT projects quickly and easily.
    Its low power consumption, built-in Wi-Fi, and support for various interfaces
    and protocols make it highly versatile and adaptable to different applications.
    With its user-friendly Lua scripting language, even beginners want can develop
    IoT projects with minimal effort. B. Moisture Sensor A moisture sensor is a type
    of sensor that detects and measures moisture levels in soil, air, or other substances.
    It is widely used in agriculture, gardening, and environmental monitoring. A moisture
    sensor measures the electrical conductivity or resistance of the material with
    which it comes into contact. Fig. 2. Moisture Sensor Show All Two probes are put
    into the soil and the electrical resistance between them is measured in soil moisture
    sensors Fig. 2. Because moist soil has more electrical conductivity than dry soil,
    it provides a lower resistance measurement. The resistance reading may be used
    to determine the moisture level in the soil. Air humidity sensors monitor the
    humidity level in the air using a capacitive or resistive element. When the humidity
    in the air rises, so does the sensor element. absorbs moisture, creating a change
    in its electrical characteristics. The sensor transforms the change into an electrical
    signal, which can subsequently be monitored and utilised to calculate the humidity
    level. C. 5V Relay Model. A 5V relay module is a type of electronic switch that
    uses a low voltage signal to operate high voltage and high current circuits. It
    is intended to be simple to use and may be integrated into a variety of electrical
    applications. The module is made up of a relay (an electromagnetic switch) and
    a control circuit that is used to activate the relay. The 5V relay module takes
    its name from the voltage needed to activate the relay. When 5V is given to the
    control circuit, the relay is activated, enabling current to flow via the high
    voltage and high current circuit. The relay serves as a link between the control
    and high voltage circuits, guaranteeing that the to ensure that the control circuit
    is separated from the high voltage circuit, the relay Fig. 3. Relay Model Show
    All The 5V relay module is frequently employed in home automation tasks like lighting
    or fan control. It may be utilised to operate motors or other high current devices
    in robotics and industrial applications. The module is simple to use and may be
    managed by low voltage circuits or microcontrollers. One of the key benefits of
    employing a 5V relay module Fig. 3 is that it adds an extra level of safety to
    circuits with high voltage and high current. It lessens the risk of harm by separating
    the control circuit from the high voltage circuit. It helps to avoid damage to
    the control circuit and guarantees that the user is not exposed to the high voltage
    circuit by separating the control circuit from it. Additionally, it makes it simple
    to operate high voltage and high current devices using low voltage signals, which
    makes designing electrical circuits easier. D. Mini Water Pump A 5V micro water
    pump is a small, low-power water pump intended for use in a range of DIY projects
    such as aquariums, fountains, and other water-based applications. The pump is
    usually driven by a 5V DC power source, such as a USBport, making it simple to
    power with a variety of devices, such as laptops and portable battery packs. Fig.
    4. Water pump(5V) Show All A pump is generally made up of a motor and an impeller
    that work together to transport water through the pump. The impeller is a revolving
    disc with vanes that propel water forward as it rotates Fig. 4. The motor drives
    the impeller, and the resulting water flow may be varied by adjusting the voltage
    provided to the pump. The 5V little water pump’s small size makes it the perfect
    option for smaller applications with constrained space. It is also simple to set
    up and operate, often simply requiring access to a power source and water source.
    It is crucial to keep in mind that the pump might not have sufficient power for
    larger applications, like commercial fountains or water features. E. Connecting
    Wires Anyone who is interested in electronics or DIY projects has to be able to
    connect wires. To make an uninterrupted electrical channel, connecting two or
    more wires together is necessary. A loose or improperly connected wire might result
    in a short circuit or other electrical problems; thus, the quality of the connection
    is essential. Fig. 5. Wires Show All It is necessary to remove the insulation
    from the wire ends before connecting them to reveal the metal conductor beneath.
    Wire strippers or a sharp knife can be used for this, just be careful not to cut
    the conductor. After the ends have been removed, tightly twist them together to
    form a secure connection. Soldering, crimping Fig. 5, employing wire nuts or connectors,
    and soldering are only a few ways to join wires together. A temporary and reliable
    connection is made via soldering, which entails melting a small quantity of solder
    onto the twisted wires. By compressing a metal sleeve or connector onto the wires
    with a specialized tool, crimping makes a strong and dependable connection. Plastic
    caps called wire nuts or connectors twist onto the ends of the wires to hold them
    together. F. 6V Battery A 6V battery is a type of battery that produces six volts
    of electricity. These batteries are widely utilised in a variety of applications,
    including toys, electronic devices, and automobiles. Battery provides small amount
    of power according to the requirements and also capacity. Here they used 6V batteries
    are often composed of numerous cells connected in series, with each cell generating
    a 1.5 volt output. These cells might be rechargeable or primary. Primary lead-acid,
    nickel-cadmium, and nickel-metal hydride batteries are the three most popular
    types of 6V batteries. While nickel-cadmium and Nickel-metal hydride batteries
    are frequently utilised in portable electronic devices, lead-acid batteries are
    frequently used in automobile and backup power applications. A 6V battery’s capacity
    is determined by its size and kind. Generally speaking, larger batteries have
    higher capacity and can deliver more power for longer periods of time. The capacity
    is often expressed in ampere-hours (Ah), which represents the maximum amount of
    current the battery can deliver over a given time. SECTION IV. Propose System
    An Automated Irrigation System for Agriculture using IoT is a great idea for improving
    the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation in agriculture. Here are some components
    and features that can be included in the system: A. Soil Moisture Sensors The
    system should include sensors that measure the moisture content of the soil. These
    sensors can be placed at various locations throughout the farm to provide accurate
    and timely data about the moisture levels. Fig. 6. Tensiometer Show All A soil
    mineral detector, also known as a soil mineral analyzer or soil mineral spectrometer,
    is a device that measures the mineral content of soil Fig. 6. These detectors
    work by using various techniques, such as electromagnetic radiation or X-ray fluorescence,
    to identify and quantify the elements and minerals present in the soil. The device
    typically consists of a handheld probe or sensor that is inserted into the soil,
    which then sends out a signal to detect the various minerals present. The device
    can detect a range of minerals, including but not limited to nitrogen, potassium,
    phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. The readings from the detector can be used
    to determine the nutrient levels in the soil, which is crucial information for
    agricultural purposes. Soil mineral detectors are commonly used in agriculture
    and environmental studies to evaluate the nutrient levels in soil and to identify
    potential deficiencies or excesses in nutrients. By knowing the mineral content
    of the soil, farmers and other agricultural professionals can adjust their fertilization
    practices to improve crop yields and reduce waste. The information provided by
    a soil mineral detector can also be used to evaluate soil health and identify
    potential environmental risks, such as soil contamination or erosion. B. Rain
    sensor Fig. 7. Raindrop Sensor Show All Raindrop Sensor water automatically adjusting
    irrigation schedules based on rainfall. The sensor detects rainfall and sends
    a signal to the irrigation controller to pause or delay watering, preventing overwatering
    and reducing water waste. The rain sensor typically consists of a small cup-like
    device with a moisture-sensitive switch inside. When it rains, the cup fills with
    water, and the switch is activated, sending a signal to the Irrigation controller.
    The controller then pauses irrigation for a set period of time, allowing the rainwater
    to soak into the soil and reducing the need for additional watering. Rain sensors
    are an essential component of smart irrigation systems, as they help conserve
    water and reduce water waste. By using a rain sensor, smart irrigation systems
    can optimize irrigation schedules based on real-time weather conditions, reducing
    water usage and improving plant health Fig. 7. In addition to conserving water,
    rain sensors can also reduce labor costs associated with manually adjusting irrigation
    schedules based on weather conditions. By automating this process, farmers and
    landscapers can save time and money while still maintaining healthy plants C.
    Gas Detect Sensors A gas detector sensor in smart irrigation systems is used to
    monitor the levels of various gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the
    soil or surrounding environment. These gases can affect the growth and health
    of plants and can also indicate potential safety hazards, such as gas leaks or
    underground fires. The gas detector sensor works by detecting the presence and
    concentration of specific gases in the environment. It typically consists of a
    sensor element, which can be made of various materials depending on the gas being
    detected, and an electronic circuit that analyzes the sensor’s output. In a smart
    irrigation system, the gas detector sensor can be used to monitor the levels of
    gases in the soil and adjust the irrigation schedule accordingly. For example,
    if the sensor detects high levels of carbon dioxide, it can trigger the irrigation
    system to water the plants more frequently to increase oxygen levels in the soil.
    Additionally, the gas detector sensor can alert the system to potential safety
    hazards, such as gas leaks or underground fires. If the sensor detects a dangerous
    level of a gas, it can trigger an alarm or shut down the irrigation system to
    prevent further damage or harm Fig. 8. Fig. 8. MOS Sensor Show All D. Android
    App A mobile app can be developed to provide farmers with real-time information
    about the irrigation system. This can include data about soil moisture levels,
    weather conditions, and the status of the irrigation system. The app can also
    be used to make adjustments to the irrigation schedule and duration [4]. E. ESP32
    MCU Due to its numerous capabilities and reasonable pricing, the ESP32 is a potent
    microcontroller module that has recently gained a lot of popularity. The Espressif
    Systems ESP32 system-on-chip (SoC), which has a dual-core processor, WiFi, Bluetooth,
    and a variety of peripheral ports, is the foundation of this compact module. In
    this post, we’ll examine the ESP32’s numerous features and capabilities as well
    as the range of applications it can be utilized [5]. Two Tensilica Xtensa LX6
    CPU cores, each clocked at up to 240 MHz, provide the foundation of the ESP32
    module. Developers can balance their processing needs and power consumption by
    programming these cores separately or in tandem. The ESP32 also has an ultra-low-power
    co-processor, which enables the module to function in deep sleep. Bluetooth functionalities
    [6]. The module is perfect for a variety of wireless applications because it supports
    both the 5 GHz WiFi 802.11 a/n/ac standard and the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n
    standard. The ESP32 can connect with a range of Bluetooth-enabled devices, including
    smartphones, tablets, and wearable technology, thanks to its compatibility for
    Bluetooth 4.2 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). SPI, I2C, UART, CAN, and SDIO are
    just a few of the several peripheral interfaces that are included with the ESP32.
    As a result, connecting the module to other sensors, actuators, and gadgets is
    simple. The module also has an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with up to 12
    bits of resolution, which enables it to measure a variety of analogue signals
    [6]. Circuit Design. Fig. 9. Circuit design. Show All The soil moisture sensor
    module used in this article has two output pins (analogue and digital). A lm393
    comparator is used to compare the output from the moisture sensor probe to a reference
    value. Turning the module’s potentiometer will alter the reference value. When
    the soil is damp, the digital pin output is active low. Here, we’re using the
    module’s analogue output by coupling it to one of Node Mcu’s analogue pins. The
    wet detection value can be set or changed within the program while using the analogue
    output Fig. 9. A float switch and a 1K Ohm resistor are connected to one of Node
    Mcu’s analogue pins as indicated in the circuit diagram. utilized to draw the
    queue up. Node Mcu’s analogue pins can be utilized as digital inputs as well.
    By examining the output of the float switch, the condition of the tank is determined.
    In order to determine the amount of water in the tank, Node Mcu measures the voltage
    that has fallen across the pull-up resistor. To display the moisture status and
    tank status, respectively, two LEDs are attached to Node Mcu’s second and third
    pins. Additionally, the base of a BC547 transistor, which in turn powers the 12
    V DC motor, is connected to the fourth pin. Fig. 10. Module Serial Connection
    with PC Show All GPIO0 & GPIO2: - General Purpose I/O Pins. These pins decide
    what mode (boot or normal) the module starts up in. It also decides whether the
    TX/RX pins are used for Programming the module or for serial I/O purpose To program
    the module using UART, Connect GPIOO to ground and GPIO2 to VCC or leave it open.
    To use UART for normal Serial I/O leave both the pins open (neither VCC nor Ground).
    Now let’s connect ESP8266 module to computer with RS232 standard serial port (using
    USB to Serial converter in case of laptop) as shown in above Fig. 10. System architecture.
    Fig. 11. Circuit design Show All This system contains a node mcu which is heart
    of the whole application each sensor is connected to the controller, Each controller
    connects with the node mcu individually each sensors collect the data and send
    it to the node mcu node mcu will decide to turn on pump according to reading of
    the sensors and gives command to relay, relay is the controller of the pump which
    allow pump to supply water in required amount. Display which is connected with
    the node mcu will display every reading and activity performed by the system.
    And entire data will be shown in android app Fig. 11. SECTION V. Results The model
    is intended for controlling and monitoring the environment. The node mcu serves
    as a microcontroller that links the various sensors to a central processing unit,
    which then issues instructions to the pump to respond appropriately the sensor.
    Fig. 12. Complete Model. Show All Fig. 13. Working Model Show All The moisture
    sensor is probably used to gauge how moist the soil is. This is beneficial for
    farming and gardening, as plants require a particular amount of moisture to develop
    effectively Fig. 12. The central processing unit may instruct the pump to water
    the plants appropriately using the moisture sensor readings. The pump can be activated
    to deliver a precise amount of water to replenish the soil’s moisture level if
    it is too dry. the pump can be operated to release a set amount of water to restore
    the desired range of soil moisture Fig. 13. Fig. 14. Working water pumping image.
    Show All The system’s rain sensor is yet another crucial element. It can be used
    to determine when it is raining, and the pump can then be switched off using this
    information. This is crucial since watering plants in the rain can result in overwatering,
    which could harm the plants’ ability to thrive Fig. 14. Fig. 15. Power supply
    Show All Data on rainfall patterns can be gathered using the rain sensor and utilized
    to forecast weather patterns. The presence of gases in the environment can be
    determined using the gas detector sensor Fig. 15. This can be helpful in environments
    like homes or workplaces where there is a possibility of gas leakage [7]. A warning
    signal can be sent by the central processing unit to the user if the gas detection
    sensor detects the presence of gas. A. App Interface. Fig. 16. User interface

    of communication protocols called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
    Protocol) are used for data transmission through networks, including the internet.
    Fig. 16 & Fig. 17 The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physically connected
    objects that are equipped with sensors, software, and other technologies enabling
    data exchange [8]. Here is a general explanation of how controlling IoT devices
    using a TCP/IP-based app functions Fig. 18. Configuration of the device: Each
    IoT device has a specific IP address and is set up to communicate via TCP/IP protocols.
    The gadget can access the internet either directly or over a local network like
    Ethernet or Wi-Fi [9]. B. Test Cases TABLE I Test Cases SECTION VI. Limitations
    In this project we have used Wi-Fi module which enables connectivity and remote
    control, it means that the project functionality heavily relies on the stable
    internet connection. This system cannot detect diseases in crops or plants hence
    we need machine learning algorithms to develop improved irrigation system. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion & Future Scope and Enhancement The model offers the potential
    for a number of feature upgrades to enhance both its usability and functionality.
    The installation of an alarm system that notifies the user when any of the sensors
    detect abnormal circumstances could be one improvement. For instance, the system
    may send a message to detection sensor detects a dangerous gas level. Another
    feature might be the ability to modify the water output of the pump in accordance
    with the readings from the moisture sensor. By doing this, the plants would be
    given the ideal amount of water for growth. The mobile application may also offer
    historical information and analysis on the amount of moisture, rainfall, and gas
    levels identified over time. The user’s ability to make knowledgeable judgements
    about their crops or garden could result in a higher yield and healthier plants.
    Finally, the app might provide customization choices including watering schedules,
    plant species selection, and sensor sensitivity adjustments. Overall, these improvements
    would increase the system’s use, convenience, and effectiveness. Authors Figures

    paper PDF 1 Introduction Unlike conventional distributed datastore, blockchain
    technology provides advanced cryptographic techniques and emerging tools to store
    and access smart agricultural data that are shared with several untrusted users.
    Blockchain technology solves a number of data integrity issues caused by following
    untrusted operations: 1. single point failure in a supply chain centralized database,
    2. lack of data integrity due to the regular use of smart agricultural management,
    3. hackers can access and modify sensitive data, and 4. third-party assistance
    for providing security. The blockchain technology is applied on smart agriculture
    system to achieve ecosystem of agricultural services. Blockchain-based precision
    agricultural system provides secured environment for storing, exchanging, and
    retrieving confidential data between the several farmers and other persons. The
    integration of smart accuracy agriculture, edge computing, IoT, and blockchain
    technology allows the agricultural environment system to reduce the wastage of
    natural resources and increase the profit. With the new development of edge computing
    and blockchain technology, a precision agricultural system produces more profit
    by increasing crop and food productivity and reducing usage of natural resources.
    In the agricultural land, several sensors and devices are used to capture the
    environmental data and land-related data and these data are transferred to the
    data server in the cloud environment. Edge computing plays an important role to
    reduce the workload of cloud data server and minimize the volume of data moved
    to the data server. Instead of transferring data to the cloud data server, edge
    computing nodes perform the operation locally which is closer to the IoT devices
    in agricultural environment. The edge computing node provides necessary information
    to the farmers, agriculture officers, agents, researchers, and producers to earn
    more profit. The farmers can receive required information at the correct time
    to take better decision. The sensor data are collected, processed, and analyzed
    locally closer to the data center without transforming data to the remote centralized
    cloud server so that network transport latency is reduced. In Fig. 1, we have
    explained the precision farming system constructed on blockchain and edge IoT-based
    computing technology. IoT devices such as cameras, environmental sensors collect
    large amount of data from the farm and transmitted to cloud storage system for
    data analysis. The process of transferring data from IoT application area to the
    cloud service will take more time and reduce the speed of the system. The edge
    computing service is introduced between the IoT application system and cloud system
    to reduce the network traffic and latency in cloud environment. The edge computing
    server increases the speed of the data analysis process and provides solution
    to the farmer and the other users immediately without delay. The edge computing
    paradigm allows sensor data to be stored and analyzed close to the data source
    and application devices using 5G network connection, which reduce the cost and
    increase the crop yield. Fig. 1 A precision agriculture system using blockchain
    technology Full size image The proposed work is explained in this paper which
    is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the related work in a precision smart
    efficient agricultural system using blockchain technology and an edge computing.
    The IoT, edge computing, and blockchain functionalities of the various layers
    are discussed in Sect. 3. The process flow of the projected system is explained.
    In Sect. 5, we have explained the experimental environment and parameters, results,
    and analyses of various algorithm. In Sect. 6, we have explained the result of
    the proposed efficient precision agricultural system and future enhancements.
    2 Related Works In 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.6 billion.
    To provide the food products to the large population, agriculture department should
    integrate with new technology [2, 5, 13]. Precision agriculture is a sensor-controlled
    and software-managed environment for automatic collection of land environmental
    data, data analysis, monitoring, and tracking of operations with advanced technologies
    to meet the food products’ demands in future. Precision agriculture uses IoT and
    blockchain technology to avoid centralized management of data [17]. Traditional
    centralized smart agriculture system has lack of data security, data misinterpretation,
    and data redundancy [1, 3]. Blockchain-based smart agriculture system provides
    efficient services to the different stockholders like farmers, farm product wholesalers,
    supply chain agents, and financial sectors participated in every process from
    farm to our plate [4, 6, 7]. Blockchain is a chain of secured and verified block
    of information with timestamp. Blockchain and smart contract already proved information
    transparency and security-based record keeping [8, 9]. It provides trusted way
    of storing and processing of data in a distributed environment. Blockchain information
    are immutable which avoids alteration of data in the blockchain. Distributed consensus
    algorithm is implemented using tamperproof method to support users to validate
    every transaction in the blockchain network [10, 12]. It ensures no false information
    is added in the blockchain hashed data with the support of timestamp and cryptographic
    footprint data. IoT devices are responsible for monitoring and collecting land
    environment data with minimum power and low cost and lack of information security.
    This security and traceability problem can be solved by smart contract and blockchain
    mechanism [11, 14]. Figure 2 shows the different components of three-layered precision
    agricultural system. Edge computing is a distributed environment, which moves
    storage and computing power nearer to the IoT wireless sensor network to reduce
    the workload of the cloud server and the latency [15, 19]. Edge computing node
    provides immediate response to the farmers to take better and efficient decision
    to improve the crop yield and reduce the usage of resources. It reduces the cost
    and increases the network efficiency by providing better security [16, 18]. Analysis
    of sensor data performed in the edge computing node reduces the network latency
    and increases reliability, modularity, and scalability. Raspberry Pi acts as an
    edge computing node, which executes a machine learning algorithm to predict the
    required information about the crop yield and status of resources using gateways
    [18]. Fig. 2 Precision agricultural system Full size image 3 IoT, Edge Computing,
    and Blockchain Technology in Precision Agricultural System Smart contract controls
    do not allow the third-party intermediate users to fix the price for food products
    in the market. The blockchain technology controls the usage and modification of
    data in the edge server and cloud server node using contracts and consensus algorithm.
    Food supply fully depends on the agricultural process, which is composed of pre-harvesting
    and post-harvesting. Pre-harvesting includes finding best quality seed, cultivation
    process, market demand, finding soil quality, and need of fertilizer. Post-harvesting
    represents distribution of food products in the market to the producer, supplier,
    and consumer. Food supply management involves direct and indirect users to accomplish
    the transfer of food products to consumer or producer through different agents.
    Blockchain allows different levels of users to access the centralized secured
    data and execute different operations on hashed data. 3.1 Proposed Blockchain-Based
    Agricultural Model The proposed system allows the users to trace the food product
    data from land to consumer and ensures the security and adoptability. In Fig.
    3, we have explained the different use cases of blockchain in precision agriculture
    system. The blockchain technology helps to create trustworthy environment between
    the producer and consumers in food supply chain management. Every transaction
    is stored as block in chain with time stamp, which cannot be modified in future.
    Sensors collects crop data and environment data from the agricultural and stored
    in edge computing node for data pre-processing. Some portion of the data is processed
    in the IOT side edge process node to provide information to the different users
    and farmers and other users immediately without any time delay. Machine learning
    algorithm is executed in the edge layer processing node to predict the crop yield
    and demand in the market. Fig. 3 Use cases of blockchain in precision agriculture
    Full size image 3.2 Functionality of Layered Architecture Blockchain-based precision
    agricultural system consists of different kind of components at each layer to
    perform agricultural land sensor data analysis, which are collected from agricultural
    land. In Fig. 4, we have explained different components and layers of the proposed
    system. The different functionalities of various layers are explained below: Data
    collection layer: It is responsible for collecting land- and crop-related data
    from different sensors and drones deployed in the agricultural area. The collected
    data is transferred to the highest level edge computing server node using wireless
    sensor network gateway. Edge computing layer: The edge computing layer comprises
    storage server and processing node, which is responsible for processing the data
    nearer to the data source to reduce the latency and network traffic. It provides
    required information to the user with minimum response time. Bigdata analytics
    layer: Data mining association rule algorithm is executed on the large volume
    of data to generate the pattern to be stored in the knowledge repository with
    contract-based blockchain technology. It can be used by the farmer and other stakeholders
    hashed in the blockchain. Blockchain service layer: Transaction details and data
    from each layer are stored in the blockchain in a distributed environment to support
    the property traceability for all users and security. Application layer: The user
    can access information or knowledge pattern from the knowledge repository using
    laptop, computer, or mobile phones at any time and everywhere. The farmer, retailer,
    agri-officer, supplier, and retailer can access information using mobile devices
    connected via Internet. Fig. 4 Layered architecture using blockchain technology
    Full size image 4 Performance Analysis The proposed blockchain system maintains
    transaction transparency using decentralized ledger when compared with traditional
    approach. The performance of the proposed secured blockchain system is measured
    in terms of speed, average latency, average throughput, resource utilization,
    and user performance. The experiment is performed on 250 transactions in two different
    blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. Ethereum is a distributed
    computing platform with smart contracts, open source, and public. Hyperledger
    Fabric is an open-source permissioned private blockchain technology with distributed
    ledger. Figure 5 shows the comparison of average throughput for Ethereum and Hyperledger
    with varying number of transactions. The experiment was conducted with two platforms
    on five different sizes of datasets. For all datasets, Hyperledger has more throughput
    than Ethereum. The next performance matrix latency is evaluated with different
    number of transactions for Ethereum and Hyperledger. In Fig. 6, we observed that
    the throughput increases when the number of transaction increases. The Ethereum
    has more latency than Hyperledger. Fig. 5 Comparison of throughput Full size image
    Fig. 6 Comparison of latency Full size image 5 Conclusion and Future Work With
    the development of edge computing efficient technologies and blockchain algorithm
    rapidly transfer traditional smart agricultural systems to advanced precision
    agricultural systems. The effective food supply chain system is developed with
    use of consensus algorithm in two different blockchain platforms. In this paper,
    we proposed secured advanced smart precision agricultural system deployed in the
    field of research and food supply, which provides transparency and security to
    the information stored in the knowledge repository. The farm management process
    is optimized with the use of machine learning algorithm and security contacts
    by improvising the food plant and crop yield and minimizing the convention of
    natural resources. The proposed system delivers the needed information or knowledge
    to the farmers at the correct time and correct place. The novelty of the proposed
    advanced system is to maximize the profit for the farmers and minimize the investment
    cost based on blockchain-based food supply system. In future, the proposed method
    can be extended for designing food chain management system in order to increase
    the profit for farmers and crop demand and disease analysis. References Antonucci

    urban flood inundation 1. Introduction Many countries worldwide have experienced
    significant economic and infrastructure damage and loss of lives from flooding
    [1], especially for those with limited resources [2]. Rapid water mapping for
    flooding is essential for managing first responders’ operations and implementing
    best management practices after disasters [3]. To allocate relief efforts and
    organize preventative measures against flood damage, emergency responders also
    need timely and accurate information on the areas affected by floodwater [4].
    Remotely sensed data by satellites and aircraft have been applied in flood monitoring/delineating
    and other water resource management [5]. It is an approachable and critical method
    for developing countries to utilize with rapidly gathered information so that
    detailed snapshots of floods can be provided [6,7]. Remote sensing data can help
    with flood monitoring and management, ranging across a variety of fields, such
    as flood risk and damage assessment [8,9], surface water detection [10,11], water
    level monitoring [7,12], flood model calibration and validation [13,14], data
    assimilation [15,16], and remote sensing-derived floodplain topography [17,18].
    Revilla-Romero et al. [11] showed the use of a multiyear surface water product
    from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery to
    improve global flood forecasting. Horritt [13] used satellite-borne synthetic-aperture
    radar imagery as calibration and validation data for a two-dimensional finite
    element flood flow model. Massari et al. [15] assimilated Advanced SCATterometer
    (ASCAT) soil moisture products to improve the simulations of a rainfall-runoff
    model. Fassoni-Andrade [17] presented a high-resolution topographic mapping (30
    m) of the middle-lower Amazon floodplain using Landsat imagery. Meanwhile, efforts
    have also been made to improve the algorithms for automated surface water mapping
    using remote sensing data. These algorithms include (1) thresholding of single
    bands and spectral indexes [19,20], (2) knowledge-based water detection from other
    land cover types based on the spectral properties [21,22], spectral mixture analysis
    (SMA) [23,24], and machine learning methods including both supervised and unsupervised
    classification schemes [25,26]. DeVries et al. [27] applied a fully automated
    and scalable algorithm that estimated the subpixel water fraction using Landsat
    data over large areas. Huang et al. [28] presented an automated surface water
    extraction algorithm using Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imagery.
    Kordelas et al. [29] applied an unsupervised approach based on the automatically
    selected threshold on the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band to better distinguish
    between different types of flooded wetlands using Sentinel-2 optical images. Cao
    et al. [30] developed an automated algorithm to find the image segmentation threshold
    for operational flood mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery. Donchyts et al. [31]
    created a similar segmentation algorithm that extracts water edges for threshold
    sampling. Bo et al. [3] utilized a self-supervised machine learning framework
    for patch-wise urban flood mapping using bitemporal multispectral satellite imagery.
    Acharya et al. [26] evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms such as naive
    Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF) to extract surface
    water in Nepal. Bazi et al. [32] presented an SAR-based automatic approach to
    assess the water surface changes in Saskatchewan, Canada, where the expectation
    maximization (EM) algorithm [33] was applied to obtain maximum likelihood estimates
    of the mixture parameters. Among the water mapping algorithms, the thresholding-based
    methods have been most widely used since they are computationally less time-consuming
    and could produce accurate results compared to other approaches of higher complexity
    [34,35,36,37,38]. In addition, automated and rapid flood inundation modeling using
    a digital elevation model (DEM) can supplement the necessary flood information
    when real-time satellite images are unavailable, as shown in the latest studies
    [18,39,40]. The applications above using multiple data sources with automated
    flood mapping are highly beneficial and desirable for a time-sensitive disaster
    situation in flood response practices. However, rapid-deployed and reliable flood
    mapping based on satellite or DEM data during extreme events is still very challenging
    due to uncertainties and limitations of the high-quality remote sensing data,
    the methods, and the high demand for computational resources. Advances in cloud-based
    data providers and computational platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) [41]
    provide a way to address computational difficulties and allow state-of-the-art
    tools to operate seamlessly in any region of interest. Many Earth observation
    datasets are made easily accessible and analyzable free of charge through GEE.
    These include the latest Landsat-9 dataset (launched in September 2021 and made
    available in October 2021), which is designed to replace Landsat-7. The combination
    of Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 data collection can provide global observation every
    8 days. With the proliferation of the computational power of GEE and the latest
    free but high-quality satellite data now and forthcoming, there is still an urgent
    need to understand the new satellite data and water mapping algorithms regarding
    their strengths and limitations, especially with quick deployment and automation.
    Therefore, this research aims to (1) investigate the pros and cons of different
    satellite imagery for water surface mapping with a focus on the SAR and optical
    images and (2) compare and evaluate the different automated methods for surface
    water extraction from satellite images and DEM. We achieved these goals by conducting
    a flood inundation study for a flood event in Madagascar (January 2022). This
    study allows us to gain insight into the advances in leveraging remote sensing
    image analysis and cloud computing for developing countries’ flood hazard monitoring
    and management. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area Madagascar is situated
    between the latitudes 12° and 25° S and longitudes 43° and 51° E. It has a tropical
    maritime climate that is conditioned by altitude, proximity to the sea, and monsoons.
    The mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 °C in coastal areas and from
    14 to 22 °C in the highlands. The climate is clearly separated into two seasons:
    a rainy and hot season from November to April, and a dry and cool season from
    May to October, with total annual rainfall ranging from 350 mm on the southwest
    coast to 4000 mm on the east coast. During the rainy season, the eastern and northern
    coasts receive heavy rainfall brought by tropical cyclones. Meanwhile, thunderstorms
    are also common in the central highlands in the same season [42,43]. Excessive
    rainfall caused by two recent (2022) tropical weather systems impacted Madagascar,
    particularly in the country’s capital, Antananarivo, and its surrounding metropolitan
    regions. The rains were driven by an Intertropical Convergence Zone around the
    equator on 17 January 2022 and then increased on 22 January 2022 after a cyclone
    made landfall in the east of the country. The event had driven disastrous hazards
    of loss of life. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
    Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) [44], over 58,000 people were affected across the
    central Analamanga Region, including 58 lives that were lost. Many houses in the
    capital area collapsed or were swept away, leaving others underwater or at risk
    of flooding and landslides. In a developing country such as Madagascar, resources
    are limited, especially during natural hazards. Figure 1 presents the map of Antananarivo
    and its surrounding regions, including the local river channel and the only available
    reference map of flooding and damage grade assessment produced by the EU Copernicus
    Emergency Management Service—Mapping platform (https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/ems/emergency-management-service-mapping,
    accessed on 1 February 2022), which is used as the reference map (28 January 2022)
    for this study. Figure 1. Study area and reference map. 2.2. Data 2.2.1. Precipitation
    and Satellite Images The precipitation data used as a reference in this study
    were obtained from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) version 6 dataset [45],
    which uses the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) algorithm
    at a spatial resolution of 0.1° (11 km). The precipitation product from GPM was
    improved after the calibration process for the study period from December 2021
    to early February 2022. According to the rainfall time series as shown in Figure
    2, the study period can be divided into two different periods (Figure 2): (1)
    the first period (22 December 2021–15 January 2022) as the preflooding period
    and (2) the second period (27 January 2022–2 February 2022) as the after-flooding
    period, which shows the destructive impacts from the consecutive rainfall events,
    especially the major event on 17 January to 22 January 2022. For the first period,
    there is an event (maximum hourly rate > 12 mm/h) on 31 December 2021 that could
    also induce extensive flooding in the study area. Figure 2. Time series of the
    rainfall intensity and satellite-available dates (solid dots show the images with
    lower cloud coverage used in the study) in the study area (rainfall data source:
    GPM). This study uses high-resolution products from Landsat-7/8/9 and Sentinel-1
    and -2 for spatiotemporal analysis of the surface water areas. All the NASA Landsat-7/8/9
    multispectral images provide visible and near-infrared (VNIR), shortwave infrared
    (SWIR), thermal infrared (TIR), and quality assessment (QA) bands. This study
    uses the Green and SWIR bands to calculate the modified normalized difference
    water index (mNDWI) [46] to identify the water surface from the land surface.
    It is noted that the “strip” issue in Landsat-7 data was not addressed due to
    higher cloud coverage. All of the mNDWI layer was processed to 30 m spatial resolution.
    The QA band removes low-quality observations such as clouds, cirrus, and cloud
    shadow to minimize their impacts on the water surface identification. The 30 m
    mNDWI was also calculated and processed from the Sentinel-2 images obtained from
    the European Space Agency (ESA) mission with two twin polar-orbiting satellites
    as a constellation (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B), with a global 5-day revisit
    time. For the synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images, we used Sentinel-1 ground-range-detected
    (S1_GRD) images at C-band (central frequency of 5.404 GHz) with a global 6- or
    12-day revisit time. Sentinel-1 is a mission of ESA with twin satellites (Sentinel-1A
    and Sentinel-1B) as a constellation. In this study, we only use the vertical transmit,
    vertical receive (VV) backscatter data with 10 m spatial resolution, as suggested
    by [47,48]. These data were preprocessed (e.g., thermal noise removal, radiometric
    calibration, and terrain correction) with the Sentinel-1 Toolbox and processed
    to 30 m resolution. The characteristics of the satellite images from Landsat-7/8/9
    and Sentinel-1/2 are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Characters of the satellite
    images used in this study. As shown in Figure 2, a total of 10 satellite images
    were acquired at the following names and dates, respectively: Sentinel-1 (22 December
    2021), Landsat-8 (24 December 2021), Sentinel-2 (26 December 2021), Landsat-9
    (1 January 2022), Landsat-7 (1 January 2022), Sentinel-1 (3 January 2022), Sentinel-1
    (3 January 2022), Sentinel-1 (15 January 2022), Sentinel-1 (27 January 2022),
    Sentinel-2 (30 January 2022), and Landsat-9 (2 February 2022). 2.2.2. DEM Data
    The elevation information is essential for the surface water detection models
    to generate logical results that surface water usually accumulates at the lowest
    relative points within a local drainage system. The elevation data from the digital
    elevation model (DEM) are also required as the surface water mapping model input.
    In this research, we use six different DEM or digital surface model (DSM) datasets
    to compare the associated water surface products, including the (1) Japan Aerospace
    Exploration Agency (JAXA) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) DSM V2.2 product
    [49], (2) World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) HydroSHEDS Void-Filled DEM [50], (3)
    WWF HydroSHEDS Hydrologically Conditioned DEM [50], (4) Multierror Removed Improved-Terrain
    (MERIT) DEM [51], (5) Global Multiresolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010)
    [52], and (6) NASA/USGS Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) V3 product [53].
    Figure 3 shows the terrain maps based on the selected DEM datasets. For more details,
    Table 2 provides additional information on their spatial resolution and references.

    used in this study. 2.3. Automated Satellite-Based Surface Water Mapping In this
    research, the satellite-based surface water mapping assessment was performed using
    the modified toolsets from Hydrologic Remote Sensing Analysis for Floods (HYDRAFloods:
    https://github.com/Servir-Mekong/hydra-floods/tree/master/hydrafloods, accessed
    on 1 May 2022). HYDRAFloods is an open source Python framework for obtaining,
    processing, and generating surface water maps assessed from both optical (e.g.,
    Landsat-7/8/9) and SAR (Sentinel-1) satellite remote sensing images. The framework
    is developed and deployed on the GEE and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which provide
    automated, rapid, and high-quality surface water mapping products to the users
    with minimal effort. In this study, the data downloading, image processing, water
    surface detection, data visualization, and analysis were carried out on top of
    Earth Engine Python API. The results were computed in GCP and evaluated in the
    GEE integrative interface. Figure 4 outlines the workflow of the water surface
    detection using HYDRAFloods, where details of image preprocessing and water mapping
    algorithms are introduced in the following sections. Figure 4. The workflow of
    automated satellite-based surface water mapping. 2.3.1. Image Preprocessing Image
    preprocessing is usually required for the raw satellite images to correct the
    atmospheric and terrain effects for practical applications. For the optical images,
    we used the quality assurance bits in “QA” generated using the C function of mask
    (CFMask) [54] algorithm to remove the pixels that are affected by snow/ice, cirrus,
    cloud, and cloud shadow. The processed images are used to generate mNDWI products
    based on the Green and SWIR bands. The mNDWI is calculated using the equation
    [46]: mNDWI = (Green − SWIR)/(Green + SWIR), (1) For SAR images, since the data
    collection on the GEE was already preprocessed, we will focus on the algorithms
    for SAR speckle filtering and slope correction, respectively. Speckle appears
    in SAR images like granular noise that is caused by the interference of radar
    waves reflected from the elementary scatterers on the ground. Because speckle
    typically lowers the accuracy of image segmentation and classification in SAR
    images, adding speckle filters is a standard preprocessing step to alleviate the
    effects of speckle. The scientific community has developed multiple algorithms
    (e.g., Lee Sigma [55], Gamma Map [56], and Refined Lee [57]) which are also incorporated
    into HYDRAFloods toolsets. In this study, we used the Gamma Map algorithm, as
    suggested by the tool. Meanwhile, the SAR images are also sensitive to the terrain
    effects. In this study, we applied an angular-based radiometric slope correction
    routine using ALOS data to reduce the impact of terrain on the SAR data. More
    details regarding the algorithm and the input arguments can be found in Vollrath
    et al. [58]. 2.3.2. Mapping Algorithm There are multiple surface water mapping
    algorithms provided in the HYDRAFloods toolsets. Many algorithms are developed
    as variations of Otsu’s method [59], a classical method that uses the maximum
    between-class histogram variance as the criterion to determine the threshold value
    for segmentation. However, this Otsu’s method only performs well when the image
    is characterized by a bimodal histogram, but it is not applicable to images with
    a unimodal histogram. In this study, we apply three Otsu’s variation algorithms
    and compare the results: (1) Edge Otsu [31,48], (2) Bmax Otsu [30,48], and (3)
    Fuzzy Otsu [60]. These algorithms provide generic and sensor-agnostic water mapping,
    given some customization of parameters. More detailed information is introduced
    in the following sections. Bmax Otsu The Bmax Otsu algorithm was developed by
    Cao et al. [30] to extract a near-bimodal histogram from the optical or SAR imagery.
    The major steps are presented in Figure 4. Firstly, the algorithm uses chessboard
    segmentation to subset the image into grids. Secondly, the maximum value of normalized
    between-class variance (BCV), or Bmax value, is calculated. The initial threshold
    value needed to start Bmax calculation is set to −16 dB for Sentinel-1 and 0 for
    mNDWI of optical imagery (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7/8/9). Thirdly, the Bmax value
    is used to select the region of the bimodal feature for histogram sampling. Fourthly,
    histogram sampling is conducted to generate the distribution of frequency of occurrence
    of mNDWI or VV backscatter within a specified range. Finally, the segmentation
    threshold value is computed using Otsu’s method. The final surface water map is
    created where areas with dB values less than the threshold are identified as water
    for SAR data, and values greater than the threshold are nonwater. In contrast,
    the threshold value is used inversely, where mNDWI values greater than the threshold
    value are classified as water for optical data, and those that are smaller than
    the threshold are nonwater. Edge Otsu The Edge Otsu algorithm was initially introduced
    by Donchyts et al. [31]. The first step is to generate a binary image from an
    initial segmentation threshold in order to alleviate any edges being defined from
    other classes in the later step. The second step is to use the Canny edge filter
    [61] to extract the edges of features in the satellite imagery with the assumption
    that the edges are water. Some defined edges are filtered by length to remove
    the impacts of small edges that skew the histogram sampling. The algorithm then
    buffers the delineated edges and generates the image for histogram sampling. The
    following steps are the same as the Bmax Otsu, which uses Otsu’s method to compute
    the threshold value applied to the entire image to differentiate water and nonwater
    surfaces. The initial threshold value is also needed and set to −16 dB for SAR
    and 0 for mNDWI, respectively. Fuzzy Otsu The Fuzzy Otsu method [60] modified
    the Otsu method based on the mathematics of fuzzy sets by using both the between-class
    variance and the membership grade from the Fuzzy Gaussian function to improve
    the segmentation performance. The Fuzzy Gaussian function transforms the pixel
    values into a normal distribution, where the midpoint of the normal distribution
    defines the ideal definition for the set, assigning the membership grade to 1,
    with the remaining input values decreasing as they move away from the midpoint
    in both the positive and negative directions until the values move too far to
    remain in the fuzzy set and are therefore assigned zeros [62]. The steps of implementing
    Fuzzy Otsu include (1) segmenting the pixels of water and lands using the initial
    threshold value; (2) randomly selecting features to calculate the minimum threshold
    value using Otsu’s method; (3) filtering the image based on the minimum threshold
    value and calculating the maximum threshold values; (4) calculating the midpoint
    (arithmetic mean) value of the minimum and maximum threshold values; and (5) inputting
    the midpoint into the Fuzzy Gaussian function to map water. Unlike the binary
    image results from Bmax Otsu’s and Edge Otsu, the Fuzzy Otsu exported the image
    decimal values estimated from Gaussian distribution. A parameter (“spread”) was
    set to 0.2 to define the shape of the Gaussian curve. An additional process was
    included in determining the surface water areas using a cutoff value based on
    the empirical judgment that pixel values equal to or greater than 0.999 are classified
    as water, and values less than 0.999 are nonwater. 2.4. Automated DEM-Based Surface
    Water Mapping As an available tool for rapid surface water mapping, the DEM-based
    methods can provide the areal extent of water surface during or after the flood
    event, which can be validated by satellite images, and the rough floodwater depth
    that both are essential information for the first responders and mitigation assessment.
    Here, we used a new cloud-based GIS tool using the DEM information, the Floodwater
    Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET) [40,63,64], for estimating floodwater extent and
    depth based solely on a DEM and a flood inundation map (if available). FwDET allows
    for fast floodwater depth estimation given by the flood extent, and here, we used
    the study area as the flood extent. The DEM data include ALOS, GMTED, HydroSHEDS,
    HydroSHEDS conditioned, MERIT, and SRTM. More details of the steps to generate
    the FwDET water depth and inundation map can be found in [40,64]. 3. Results and
    Discussion 3.1. Satellite-Based Surface Water Mapping Results The surface water
    mapping results from each selected satellite imagery are shown in Figure 5a,b
    during the study period. The first rows of Figure 5a,b show the cloud-masked optical
    RGB images from Landsat-7/8/9 and original Sentinel-1 SAR greyscale images based
    on the VV band. The second rows show the mNDWI maps processed from the cloud-masked
    optical bands from Landsat-7/8/9, as well as the greyscale images from Sentinel-1
    VV band preprocessed by speckle filtering and slope correction algorithms. The
    third to fifth rows show the final surface water maps derived from the second
    rows using the detection algorithms of Bmax Otsu, Edge Otsu, and Fuzzy Otsu, respectively.
    Figure 5. The satellite optical and SAR images, preprocessed VV and mNDWI images,
    and surface mapping in the study area for the period of (a) before the flooding
    event (22 December 2021–15 January 2022) and (b) after the flooding event (27
    January 2022–2 February 2022). The flood reference map of 28 January 2022 is included
    in (b), with flooded areas indicated by A and B. For the first period (22 December
    2021–15 January 2022) shown in Figure 5a, the Sentinel-1 image (22 December 2021)
    shows a limited surface water area, while the Landsat-8 image (24 December 2021)
    indicates much more areas than the Sentinel-1, even though no rainfall occurred
    during the intermediate period. Sentinel-2 image (26 December 2021) shows similar
    coverage at the boundary of the study area to Landsat-8. However, it only presents
    limited areas due to cloud contamination. After several rainfall events occurred
    from 26 December 2021 to 1 January 2022, the Landsat-9 image (1 January 2022)
    presents additional water surface areas, especially in the northern region, where
    the Landsat-7 image at the same date also shows similar water surface areas if
    not covered by the clouds. Compared with Landsat-7 and -9 images on 1 January
    2022, the Sentinel-1 image of 3 January 2022 still shows limited surface water
    area. Sentinel-1 (15 January 2022) shows more surface water in the western region
    due to the consecutive rainfalls between 3 January 2022 and 15 January 2022. For
    the second period (27 January 2022–2 February 2022) shown in Figure 5b, more areas
    are identified as water surfaces, such as the map from Sentinel-1 on 27 January
    2022. However, Sentinel-1 shows many fewer flooded areas in Regions A and B, marked
    by the reference map, indicating that the results from Sentinel-1 (27 January
    2022) underestimate the flood area. Meanwhile, Sentinel-2 (30 January 2022) and
    Landsat-9 (2 February 2022) show a similar flooded area in term of its coverage
    in Regions A and B. Landsat-9 provides a more comprehensive perspective than Sentinel-2
    with less cloud coverage. Additionally, the histogram of the sampling and the
    identified threshold values are presented in Figure 6. While some of the satellite
    images (e.g., Landsat-9 on 1 January 2022) show similar distributions in the histograms
    among different algorithms, most of the histograms are dissimilar, resulting in
    different threshold values. The results from Figure 5 and Figure 6 are summarized
    in Table 3. It is noted that the midpoint threshold values by the Fuzzy Otsu algorithm
    are calculated as the arithmetic mean of the “Max” and “Min” values. Additional
    information on the threshold values for each Otsu algorithm is also included.
    Among the Otsu algorithms for the same dates, the SAR image (i.e., Sentinel-1)
    shows a pattern of Edge > Bmax > Fuzzy for both water surface area and threshold
    values, while for the optical image (e.g., Landsat-7, -8, and -9), a pattern Fuzzy
    > Bmax > Edge is shown regarding the threshold values, and Fuzzy > Edge > Bmax
    is shown concerning the water areas. For the Sentinel-2 images affected by the
    cloud contamination, the Fuzzy surface areas are found to be less than those from
    Edge and Bmax algorithms. For the same algorithm among different dates, the threshold
    also varies based on the inundation areas: (1) SAR Sentinel-1 images show the
    lowest threshold values in no flood (22 December 2021, 3 January 2022), lower
    values in less flooded (15 January 2022), and highest value in most flooded (27
    January 2022) conditions; and (2) optical images from Landsat-7/8/9 and Sentinel-2
    images also show higher threshold values in flooded condition than less flooded
    conditions. Figure 6. The histograms and the threshold values identified by each
    algorithm for the satellite imagery. Table 3. The values of threshold values and
    areas (km2) of each algorithm from the satellite observations. 3.2. DEM-Based
    Surface Water Mapping Results The surface water maps that are based on the FwDET-GEE
    algorithm from each DEM product (ALOS, GMTED 2010, HydroSHEDS, HydroSHEDS Hydrologically
    Conditioned, MERIT, and SRTM) and the reference map are presented in Figure 7.
    Overall, the DEM products show a general consistency with the reference map concerning
    the water surface areas, while some local regions in the north (marked by A),
    middle east (marked by B), and south (marked by C) indicate an overestimation
    of the water surface areas, yet middle west regions (marked by region D) in GMTED,
    MERIT, and SRTM flood products underestimate the flooded area. The spatial resolution
    acts as a key role in affecting the DEM-based products, as indicated by the similar
    results from identical spatial resolution (e.g., 30 m from ALOS and SRTM) products.
    Meanwhile, the products in the same spatial resolution can also produce different
    results, such as the differences found among 90 m HydroSHEDS, HydroSHEDS conditioned,
    and MERIT flood products. Figure 7. Flood water surface maps based on the FwDET-GEE
    algorithm from multiple DEM sources (ALOS, GMTED, HydroSHEDS, HydroSHEDS conditioned,
    MERIT, and SRTM), with flood reference map included, with flooded areas indicated
    by A, B, C and D. Figure 8 further illustrates the ALOS DEM and its elevation
    differences from other DEM datasets. The red regions show an elevation lower than
    ALOS, and the blue regions are higher. The extensive red areas in HydroSHEDS conditioned
    map indicate that many regions are lower than ALOS DEM and, therefore, explains
    more flooded area than those retrieved from ALOS data. The DEM data also show
    that high slope regions marked by A and C drain the water faster and will not
    accumulate the water inundation as much as the model predicted. However, the local
    elevation values may not fully explain the results without considering their relative
    differences from surrounding areas, such that the region marked by D in MERIT
    has a lower elevation than that in ALOS, yet it shows no inundation compared with
    results from ALOS and other datasets, which may be due to its relatively higher
    elevation than the western area near the flood boundary. Figure 8. ALOS DEM, its
    differences with other DEM datasets, and the study area’s watershed and channel
    flow map. 4. Discussion The results in Figure 3 and Table 3 indicate that Bmax
    Otsu and Edge Otsu generally produce similar results compared to those from Fuzzy
    Otsu. Even though the sampling processes to create the histogram are different,
    the threshold values from Bmax Otsu and Edge Otsu are nearly identical, especially
    in the cases of using Sentinel-1 SAR images, which is an indicator of the reliability
    of the threshold values. On the other hand, Fuzzy Otsu seems to be a more robust
    approach that allows the output to be nonbinary. While the Bmax Otsu and Edge
    Otsu show more water areas in the SAR imagery, the Fuzzy Otsu can detect more
    water areas in the optical sensors from Landsat-8/9. Between Bmax and Edge results,
    the flood inundation is slightly wider based on the Edge Otsu algorithm. More
    tuning efforts are needed to find the proper parameters and settings (e.g., spread
    value) to identify water pixels effectively. It is also noted that while the threshold
    values are estimated based on the entire image area, the result is evaluated only
    in part of the region (right corner). For some optical images that are heavily
    affected by cloud contaminations (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7 images in this case),
    this will result in a limited area that is available for histogram sampling and
    will eventually change the threshold values. Therefore, it is critical to conclude
    that image quality is important for water mapping algorithms. In this study, Sentinel-1
    delivers SAR images reliably every 12 days, which is invaluable for monitoring
    floods, especially considering the restrictions imposed by unfavorable weather
    conditions on the optical sensors; however, if an optical image of flooding can
    be acquired, obtaining useful information from this is straightforward and easier.
    In addition, the intercomparison of the SAR and optical sensors shows that the
    surface water areas identified from the SAR images (Sentinel-1) are more likely
    less than those retrieved from optical images. This may result from the images’
    features, such as the band or band-derived indexes (VV or mNDWI), image preprocessing
    and correction, and automated algorithms used in HYDRAFloods. The newly available
    Landsat-9 data demonstrate the capability of effectively delineating flood-impacted
    areas, especially when the other optical images (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7) were
    hindered by cloud contamination. Landsat-9 data will continue playing a critical
    role in adding timely information for flood monitoring, as the recently retired
    Landsat-7 mission has subsided. It is noted that the differences in wavelength
    ranges of Green and SWIR bands among Landsat-7, Landsat-8/9, and Sentinel-2 may
    also marginally change mNDWI values that impact the threshold for water surface
    mapping. Furthermore, high-resolution commercial images (e.g., Worldview, Pleiades,
    Planet optical imagery, and Capella and ICEYE SAR imagery) will provide more precise
    information when incorporated into the algorithms. Still, the increased pixel
    density brings in requirements and challenges of computational cost. This research
    also performs a rapid DEM-based water mapping practice using the FwDET algorithm
    in the GEE platform. The mapping results and quality vary with the resolution
    of DEM, as demonstrated by the differences from each other in Figure 7. Generally,
    the higher the spatial resolution of the DEM data is, the better the details can
    be simulated by the FwDET, as in ALOS and SRTM results. All the DEM mapping results
    can detect flood inundation at low elevations. However, with the land use information
    missing, the urban drainage characteristics cannot be represented in such DEM
    products. The performance of the DEM-based model is limited due to lacking a representation
    of the hydrologic processes, including the infiltration and routing processes
    that could account for the overestimated water surfaces in areas A and C. Even
    with the fact that the DEM-based method is considered for urban pluvial flood
    mapping, urban drainage needs to be included for mapping such a case with this
    DEM approach. Nevertheless, the maps generated from DEM data can still help developing
    countries where credible flood hazard maps (e.g., U.S. FEMA flood layer) are unavailable.
    To better leverage the application of the satellite-based water detection algorithms,
    it is suggested to perform localized sensitivity analysis to explore the validated
    threshold values (for both optical and SAR sensors), which will be used for rapid
    inundation identification in the high flood-risk area. It is also recommended
    to set up a standard workflow concerning water-related variables, data preprocessing,
    mapping algorithms, and validation metrics. Meanwhile, the DEM-based model can
    be improved by using high-resolution LiDAR DEM data as the input, in addition
    to considering the hydrologic and hydraulic processes of water routing, infiltration,
    and levee protection factors in the model. Land cover, land use, floodplain topography,
    and impervious surface percentage of the floodplain can be monitored and estimated
    using satellite observation and machine learning methods for up-to-date land surface
    monitoring to be further included in the DEM-based methods [65,66,67,68]. Finally,
    we would like to discuss the usage of flood detection provided by the aforementioned
    methods. These automated methods are rapid and can be easily applied for locations
    with limited resources, compared with other conventional and extensive hydrologic
    and hydraulic analyses. However, the advantage and disadvantages are somewhat
    obvious as well. Only a rough extent estimation can be provided that might lead
    to inefficient disaster management and rescue efforts, especially during a natural
    hazard. A more effective way to mitigate the impact of flood disasters is to incorporate
    a flood forecasting capability, such as flood early warning systems [69]. Later,
    in February 2022, Madagascar was struck by another cyclone, and the communities
    affected by those floods were left extremely vulnerable to any other hazards.
    While the flooding threat is already substantial, several ongoing trends, including
    rising precipitation intensity, could result in significant increases in flood
    risks in the near future. For a high-concentration climate change scenario, estimates
    from 11 climate models converge on the conclusion that flood frequencies in the
    high flood-risk regions for Southeast Asia, East and Central Africa, and large
    parts of Latin America could increase substantially in this century [1]. Undoubtfully,
    remote sensing data during or after the events can also be integrated into the
    flood models as validation data for rapid response evaluation and data assimilation
    processes in both physical and data-driven methods [70]. Above all, flood hazard
    maps [71], flood early warning systems, and satellite-derived flooding information
    from this research will be valuable to augment the comprehensive information available
    for stakeholders and communities to perform efficient flood management. 5. Conclusions
    This study demonstrates delineated floodwater maps using optical and SAR imageries
    from the Landsat-7/8/9, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 missions, respectively. Three
    popular automated algorithms, including Edge Otsu, Bmax Otsu, and Fuzzy Otsu,
    are compared for the 2022 Madagascar flooding event. All 30 m mNDWI maps produced
    by Edge Otsu, Bmax Otsu, and Fuzzy Otsu show more flooded areas of water bodies
    than those estimated from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery based on the same methods. Compared
    to Fuzzy Otsu, Edge Otsu and Bmax Otsu are more likely to generate similar results.
    The Fuzzy Otsu, as a more flexible method, needs additional model parameter settings
    that require more extensive tuning and calibration efforts to achieve desirable
    results. In addition, a DEM-based tool (FwDET) uses six different DEM data sources
    for water extent estimation for the same event. DEM-based maps show general consistency
    with the reference map and satellite-based mapping results. This study showcases
    that developing countries such as Madagascar will benefit from some of the advanced
    surface water mapping products demonstrated in this study for better flood risk
    assessment in the future. Author Contributions Conceptualization, Z.N.F., W.L.

  description: 'Predicting maize yield using spectral information, temperature, and
    different irrigation management through machine learning algorithms provide information
    in a fast, accurate, and non-destructive way. The use of multispectral sensor
    data coupled with irrigation management in maize allows further exploration of
    water behavior and its relationship with changes in spectral bands presented by
    the crop. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate, by means of multivariate
    statistics and machine learning techniques, the relationship between irrigation
    management and spectral bands in predicting maize yields. Field experiments were
    carried out over two seasons (first and second seasons) in a randomized block
    design with four treatments (control and three additional irrigation levels) and
    eighteen sample repetitions. The response variables analyzed were vegetation indices
    (IVs) and crop yield (GY). Measurement of spectral wavelengths was performed with
    the Sensefly eBee RTK, with autonomous flight control. The eBee was equipped with
    the Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor acquiring reflectance at the wavelengths
    of green (550 nm ± 40 nm), red (660 nm ± 40 nm), red-edge (735 nm ± 10 nm), and
    NIR (790 nm ± 40 nm). The blue length (496 nm) was obtained by additional RGB
    imaging. Data were subjected to Pearson correlations (r) between the evaluated
    variables represented by a correlation and scatter plot. Subsequently, the canonical
    analysis was performed to verify the interrelationship between the variables evaluated.
    Data were also subjected to machine learning (ML) analysis, in which three different
    input dataset configurations were tested: using only irrigation management (IR),
    using irrigation management and spectral bands (SB+IR), and using irrigation management,
    spectral bands, and temperature (IR+SB+Temp). ML models used were: Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN), M5P Decision Tree (J48), REPTree Decision Tree (REPT), Random
    Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A multiple linear regression (LR)
    was tested as a control model. Our results revealed that Random Forest has higher
    accuracy in predicting grain yield in maize, especially when associated with the
    inputs SB+IR and SB+IR+Temp.'

    by the crop. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate, by means of multivariate
    statistics and machine learning techniques, the relationship between irrigation
    management and spectral bands in predicting maize yields. Field experiments were
    carried out over two seasons (first and second seasons) in a randomized block
    design with four treatments (control and three additional irrigation levels) and
    eighteen sample repetitions. The response variables analyzed were vegetation indices
    (IVs) and crop yield (GY). Measurement of spectral wavelengths was performed with
    the Sensefly eBee RTK, with autonomous flight control. The eBee was equipped with
    the Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor acquiring reflectance at the wavelengths
    of green (550 nm ± 40 nm), red (660 nm ± 40 nm), red-edge (735 nm ± 10 nm), and
    NIR (790 nm ± 40 nm). The blue length (496 nm) was obtained by additional RGB
    imaging. Data were subjected to Pearson correlations (r) between the evaluated
    variables represented by a correlation and scatter plot. Subsequently, the canonical
    analysis was performed to verify the interrelationship between the variables evaluated.
    Data were also subjected to machine learning (ML) analysis, in which three different
    input dataset configurations were tested: using only irrigation management (IR),
    using irrigation management and spectral bands (SB+IR), and using irrigation management,
    spectral bands, and temperature (IR+SB+Temp). ML models used were: Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN), M5P Decision Tree (J48), REPTree Decision Tree (REPT), Random
    Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A multiple linear regression (LR)
    was tested as a control model. Our results revealed that Random Forest has higher
    accuracy in predicting grain yield in maize, especially when associated with the
    inputs SB+IR and SB+IR+Temp. Keywords: multispectral bands; UAV imagery; remote

    mays L.) is an agricultural crop of worldwide importance, subsidizing animal and
    human food to biofuel production. The required increase in the crop’s yields due
    to the global population growth, which is expected to rise to more than 9 billion
    by 2050 (ONU, 2019), is one of the main challenges of modern agriculture. Additionally,
    the global climate change scenario raises the need to adopt tools and management
    practices that ensure yield gains with more efficient use of natural resources,
    such as adopting strategic irrigation systems in critical crop stages [1]. Irrigation
    management represents one of the major strains on water resources because of the
    high consumption and low efficiency in most irrigation systems [2]. Thus, with
    the increasing demand for this finite resource, alternatives are needed to minimize
    water use in irrigation by improving its management [3]. Water deficit in the
    crop tends to increase leaf temperature and begins to negatively impact plant
    development [4,5]. C4 plants, such as maize, have higher water-use efficiency
    and higher tolerance to increased leaf temperature [6]. Crop leaf temperature
    is a physiological characteristic and can be used to monitor the plant’s water
    status [7]. In the presence of high atmospheric water demand or low soil water
    availability, the plant triggers its primary mechanism to control water loss,
    which is stomatal closure [8]. Activating this mechanism triggers a series of
    harmful processes in grain production, such as a decrease in photosynthetic activity
    by preventing the entry of CO2 and an increased leaf temperature due to the retraction
    of evaporative cooling by water. This increase in temperature can be on the order
    of many degrees centigrade, depending on the crop and the water supply and demand
    conditions of the soil–atmosphere system [9]. Remote sensing, coupled with high-throughput
    phenotyping techniques, is a tool that can be used to provide fast and non-destructive
    information on crop status [10,11,12]. Multispectral images captured by the sensors
    make it possible to know the canopy reflectance values in the spectral bands of
    blue, green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared. Leaf reflectance allows us to detect
    parameters and relate them to plant water status due to the emission of canopy
    wavelengths in the near-infrared and short-wave infrared ranges, which are influenced
    by various internal leaf structures, such as water content [13]. Despite the advantages
    mentioned above, the information obtained from spectral imagery is very complex
    and generates a large amount of data, which makes the use of Machine Learning
    (ML) techniques an excellent alternative to spectral data processing [14]. Algorithms
    such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Decision Trees, Random Forests (RFs),
    and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be used in studies for yield prediction
    [15,16,17], nutritional status monitoring [18,19], drought stress detection [20,21,22],
    and irrigation mapping [23] using spectral imagery. Advances in high-throughput
    phenotyping techniques are crucial to evaluate the crop water status and making
    inferences about future crop conditions, such as associations with grain yield.
    Plant responses to photosynthetic efficiency under adequate water supply conditions
    are reflected in the crop yield, and to measure these photosynthetic and yield
    traits, traditional laboratory methods using sampling and leaf analysis are employed
    and provide highly accurate information. However, these methods are costly and
    time-consuming and require skilled labor, giving an advantage to using spectral
    data associated with ML modeling [24,25,26]. The use of multispectral sensor data
    combined with irrigation management in maize crops allows further exploration
    of water behavior and its relationship with changes in the spectral bands reflected
    by the crop canopy. Thus, the objective of this study was to test different machine
    learning techniques and input configurations on the dataset (considering irrigation
    management, leaf temperature, and spectral variables) for predicting maize grain
    yield. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area Field experiments were carried
    out at the experimental area of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul,
    in the municipality of Chapadão do Sul-MS, Brazil, with coordinates 18°46′17.9″
    S and 52°37′25.0″ W, and with an altitude of 810.2 m (Figure 1), during two crop
    seasons: 2020/2021 (first season, characterized by a summer harvest) and 2021
    (the second season, characterized by an autumn harvest). The climate of the region
    is characterized as a tropical climate with a dry season in winter (Aw). The area
    had a history of fifteen years of non-tillage system, and soybean was previously
    cultivated as the first crop in the same agricultural year. Soil samples were
    collected at the experimental field, at 0.0–0.2 m depth, for soil chemical analysis.
    Ten sub-samples were taken. The results of the soil analysis are shown in Table
    1. Figure 1. Location of the municipality of Chapadão do Sul/Brazil (A), illustration
    of the experimental field and UAV used (B), and measurement of the temperature
    of the maize crop canopy (C). Table 1. Information on soil pH, organic matter,
    phosphorus, aluminum, potassium, calcium and magnesium, CEC, base saturation (V%),
    and clay content. 2.2. Experiment Installation The dimensions of the experimental
    plots were 20 × 5 m, totaling 24 plots. Each plot was cultivated with maize (Zea
    mays L.), hybrid SYN 555 VIP 3, from Syngenta® (Formosa, Brazil). The maize crop
    was cultivated as a second crop, sown in the third ten-day period of February
    of each experimental year after the harvest of soybean was installed as a first
    crop. This type of crop succession is the most common in Brazil, especially in
    the Cerrado region. Soil served as a basis for the interpretation and recommendation
    of fertilization [27]. Limestone application was carried out in August according
    to the need for both crops in the study areas, raising the base saturation to
    65%. Fertilizing was performed in the sowing furrow at rates of 30 kg ha−1 of
    N (Urea 45% N), 120 kg ha−1 of Phosphorus (Single Superphosphate 20% P2O5), and
    60 kg ha−1 of Potassium (Potassium Chloride 58% K2O). Maize was grown as a second
    crop due to the lower rainfall in the region, allowing for a higher probability
    of water deficit in non-irrigated treatments or with less irrigation level. The
    spacing used between sowing rows was 0.45 m, and the crop population was estimated
    at 65,000 plants ha−1. The seeder used in this process was the Jumil model 2670
    (Batatais, Brazil), with a vacuum seed metering mechanism. At the V4 crop phenological
    stage, the topdressing fertilization with urea (45% N) was carried out at a dosage
    of 150 kg ha−1, according to the recommendation for the soil condition and region
    2.3. Experimental Design The experimental design applied was in randomized blocks,
    containing four treatments (control and three additional irrigation levels) and
    eighteen sampling repetitions. The response variables analyzed were vegetation
    indices (VI) and crop yield (GY). The variables were measured at three different
    sampling points within each plot. The four outer rows were discarded as borders
    to avoid possible interference from other treatments. The four treatments influencing
    the response variables were 0 (no supplemental irrigation), 30, 60, and 100% of
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Supplementary irrigation levels were applied to
    achieve sampling variability among the measured values, mainly leaf temperature
    (Temp). This procedure made it possible to measure the leaf temperature in a situation
    of turgidity and some level of water deficit. 2.4. Irrigation Management The data
    on the weather conditions during the experimental period were obtained through
    an automatic station installed at the experimental field (RX3000 Remote Monitoring
    Station, Bourne, MA, USA). Crop evapotranspiration was calculated by the Penman–Monteith
    FAO method [28]. Conventional sprinkler irrigation was performed using Plonas
    KS 1500 sprinklers (Curitiba, Brazil), operating at a 360-degree angle, with a
    flow rate of 7 m3 h−1, totaling 10 mm h−1. The variation of the irrigation levels
    was initiated in the crop only after its establishment, 15 days after emergence
    (DAE). Irrigation was 100% of the requirement up to that moment in all plots.
    The climate balance containing irrigation and rainfall over the two crop seasons
    is contained in Supplementary Figure S1. 2.5. Obtaining Spectral Variables and
    Plant Assessments Spectral wavelengths reflected by the crop canopy were measured
    from flights carried out with the Sensefly eBee RTK fixed-wing UAV. The eBee has
    autonomous flight control and was equipped with the Parrot Sequoia multispectral
    sensor. Sequoia multispectral sensor acquired reflectance at the wavelengths of
    green (550 nm ± 40 nm), red (660 nm ± 40 nm), blue (496 nm), red-edge (735 nm
    ± 10 nm), and near-infrared (790 nm ± 40 nm). This sensor also captures an RGB
    image at the same scene. Overflights were performed at 100 m height of the local
    soil level, allowing a 0.10 m spatial resolution. In the first crop season, the
    overflights were performed on 30 October 2020, 7 December 2020, and 28 December
    2020, and in the second crop season, they were carried out on 13 March 2021, 10
    April 2021, and 08 May 2021. The overflights were carried out near the zenith
    due to the minimization of the shadows of the plants at 11 a.m., given that the
    multispectral sensor is a passive type (i.e., dependent on solar luminosity).
    The images were mosaic and orthorectified by the computer program Pix4Dmapper.
    The images were acquired with 80% longitudinal and 60% lateral overlaps. Radiometric
    correction of the images was performed using the Pix4D program and the use of
    the camera’s reflective target, in addition to the radiometric sensor coupled
    to the multispectral camera. The multispectral maps were processed using ArcGIS
    10.5 program. The calculation of maize grain yield (GY) was performed by harvesting
    the ears manually at the end of the crop cycle, at each sampling point, and in
    a harvested area of 4.05 m2. Sample weighing was performed, correcting the moisture
    content to 14%. Thermal camera Fotric model 222 s (Shanghai, China) was used in
    the sampling acquisition of the thermal images. This camera has a spatial resolution
    of 320 × 240 pixels, capable of reading within the range of −20 °C ~ 650 °C, with
    thermal sensitivity of ≤0.06 °C and accuracy of ±2%, under the conditions of environment
    temperature 10 °C ~ 35 °C. The images were shot through a mobile application called
    LinkIR. A cell phone with an Android operating system must be coupled to the camera,
    and it makes an RGB image of the same Thermal image (Figure 2). Three evaluations
    were carried out at different phenological stages of the maize crop (V5, V8, and
    R1), at 23 DAE, 31 DAE, and 52 DAE, when data on canopy temperature (TEMP) and
    vegetation indices were collected. All variables were measured at ten points in
    the center of each experimental plot, and their average was used in the statistical
    evaluation. Figure 2. Pearson correlation analysis between the variables grain
    yield, temperature, spectral bands, and vegetation indices. The values shown in
    black indicate the overall correlation, while the colored values indicate the
    correlation between irrigation management. *, ** and ***: significant at 5, 1
    and 0.1% probability by t-test, respectively. 2.6. Statistical Analysis and Machine
    Learning Pearson correlations (r) between the variables grain yield (GY), Temperature
    (Temp), and the spectral bands (red, green, NIR, and red-edge) were estimated
    and represented by a correlation and scatter plot. The analyses were performed
    on the Rbio [29] and R [30] software using the GGEBiplotGUI package. Subsequently,
    canonical variable analysis was performed on the Rbio software to verify the interrelationship
    between the variables evaluated. Data were subjected to regression analysis by
    multiple linear regression (used as control) and ML models (Table 2). ANN has
    been tested using the default Weka’s architecture, consisting of a Multilayer
    Perceptron with a unique hidden layer formed by many neurons equal to the number
    of attributes plus the number of classes, all divided by two [31]. LR has been
    tested with the Akaike information criteria for attribute selection during linear
    regression [32]. The M5P algorithm is a classifier for generating a C4.5 decision
    tree with an additional pruning step based on a reduced-error strategy [33]. REPTree
    is an adaptation of the C4.5 classifier that can be used in regression problems
    with an additional pruning step based on an error reduction strategy [34]. The
    RF model is able to produce multiple decision trees for the same dataset and uses
    a voting scheme among all these learned trees to classify new instances [35].
    SVM performs classification tasks by building hyperplanes in multidimensional
    space to distinguish different classes [36]. All model parameters were set according
    to the default setting of the Weka 3.8.5 software (Waikato, New Zeland). For all
    regression models, three different input dataset configurations were tested: using
    only irrigation management (IR), using irrigation management and spectral bands
    (SB+IR), and using irrigation management, spectral bands, and temperature (IR+SB+Temp).
    Grain yield (GY) was used as the output variable. All models were performed using
    stratified cross-validation with k-fold = 10 and ten repetitions (100 runs for
    each model). Table 2. List of machine learning models used in maize yield prediction.
    Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics were
    used to evaluate the performance of the tested prediction models. An analysis
    of variance was performed to verify the significance of the tested inputs, ML
    techniques, and the interaction between both. When significant, boxplots were
    generated with the means of r and MAE grouped by the Scott–Knott test [37] at
    a 5% probability level. The grouping of means was performed using the Rbio software
    (Viçosa, Brazil), while the boxplots were generated using the ggplot2 and ExpDes.pt
    packages of the R software. 3. Results 3.1. Impact of Irrigation Management on
    Grain Yield and Leaf Temperature in Maize According to the boxplots in the upper
    portion of Figure 2, higher yield values were obtained with 60% or 100% ET. The
    other variables reached higher values with 100% ET followed by 60% ET, except
    for red. Under control irrigation, the yield was low, as well as for the other
    variables, except the red spectral band. The correlations were high between spectral
    variables, which is expected due to the use of spectral bands in the calculations
    of vegetation indices. The low or no correlation between the spectral variables,
    yield, and temperature, is due to the lack of linearity between them. Thus, non-conventional
    analyses such as Machine Learning (ML) techniques should be used to evaluate correlations
    between such variables. Maize yield was higher when irrigation was 100% ET or
    60% of ET. This relationship can be seen by the graph of canonical variables (Figure
    3), in which the GY vector was close to the mentioned irrigation management. Red
    wavelength was close to the control ET vector, i.e., when plants are not adequately
    irrigated, there is a higher reflectance of red wavelength by the canopy. The
    temperature variable was also close to the control irrigation management. Figure

    Green, Blue, NIR, red-edge, NDVI, NDRE, SAVI, EVI, GLI), grain yield (GY), and
    leaf temperature (Temp) with the irrigation managements [control, 60% of the crop
    evapotranspiration (ET) and 100% of ET]. 3.2. Prediction of Grain Yield in Maize
    by Machine Learning Models Table 3 presents p-values obtained by ANOVA for r and
    MAE considering the different ML models and inputs. Regarding r, there was significance
    (p < 0.05) for the ML models tested, while for MAE, there was a significant interaction
    between the models and inputs tested, requiring the unfolding of the interaction.
    Table 3. Summary of analysis of variance for Pearson correlation coefficients
    (r) and mean absolute error (MAE) by different inputs and Machine Learning (ML)
    models tested. The best ML algorithm for predicting maize yield under the different
    irrigation treatments was Random Forest (Figure 4A), according to the Pearson
    correlation coefficient, reaching an average of 0.58. All other algorithms did
    not differ from each other. The lowest MAE found using IR as input was found using
    the LR, M5P, REPT, and RF models. Using IR+SB and IR+SB+Temp as input, the lowest
    MAE was found using the RF models. When comparing each ML with the tested inputs,
    LR, ANN, M5P, and REPT showed no statistical difference. SVM showed lower MAE
    when the input tested was IR+SB+Temp, and RF showed lower MAE using IR+SB and
    IR+SB+Temp (Figure 4B). The RF model using IR+SB and IR+SB+Temp inputs outperformed
    the other algorithms by achieving higher r and lower MAE values. Figure 4. Boxplot

    Irrigation Management on Grain Yield and Leaf Temperature in Maize It is remarkable
    the proximity of the variable GY with the irrigation management 60% ET and ET
    (Figure 3) because the irrigation management has expressive impacts on the crop.
    The effects of water deficit reflect directly on maize grain yield, especially
    in three stages of plant development: (a) blooming and inflorescence development,
    when the potential number of grains is determined; (b) fertilizing time, when
    the production potential is fixed; in this step, the water availability is also
    fundamental to avoid the dehydration of the pollen grain and to guarantee the
    development and penetration of the pollen tube; (c) grain filling, when there
    is an increase in dry matter deposition, which is closely related to photosynthesis
    since stress will result in lower carbohydrate production, which would imply a
    lower volume of dry matter in the grains [4,6,7]. Water stress at 31 DAE, when
    the crop was at approximately V8, may affect the length of internodes, probably
    by inhibiting the elongation of developing cells, thus contributing to a decrease
    in the sugar storage capacity of the stem. Water deficit will also lead to thinner
    stems, shorter plants, and reduced leaf area [38]. The use of information obtained
    by multispectral imaging enables the fast and non-destructive monitoring of several
    physiological and structural characteristics of different crops [39]. The behavior
    of the spectral reflectance of leaves differs according to internal plant characteristics.
    For example, the reflectance in the visible and red-edge bands when plants are
    under adequate hydration and water stress are different [40]. When plants are
    subjected to water stress for a short time, they use mechanisms to avoid further
    damage, which leads to heat emission and altered wavelength reflectance processes.
    When the stress is prolonged, the damage is at the level of chlorophyll detriment,
    which increases the interference with leaf reflectance [41,42]. The reflectances
    emitted by a plant with its biological activity fully active and another one going
    through drought stress showed distinct proximities with the vectors for VIs and
    SB. Red was close to the control ET vector because drought stress leads the plant
    to reduce green reflectance and increase blue and red reflectances [43]. 4.2.
    Prediction of Grain Yield in Maize with Machine Learning Models Yield prediction
    supports improved crop monitoring and policy management, and Yield prediction
    supports improved crop monitoring, policy management, and decision-making before
    the crop is harvested [44]. However, yield data encompass many variables intrinsic
    to crop, management, and climate conditions. Using technologies such as machine
    learning techniques allied to spectral data has an essential role in contributing
    to the productive improvement of farming systems [15]. ML models make it possible
    to process a large and highly complex dataset, circumventing the lack of linearity
    that exists between data [45]. RF proves to be a highly accurate algorithm in
    many agricultural applications [15]. In Figure 4, both for r and MAE, RF presented
    better results than the other techniques used, showing good performance in predicting
    maize yield. Marques Ramos et al. [15] verified the high accuracy of maize yield
    prediction obtained by the RF algorithm using UAV-based imagery. In addition to
    good performance in maize yield prediction, RF has better data generalization
    [46]. When evaluating the inputs tested, those with SB+IR and SB+IR+Temp performed
    better. As both inputs showed similar performance, from the point of view of acquiring
    and processing information, using the spectral bands and irrigation management
    is more advantageous than using the input containing temperature. This is because
    measuring temperature requires a thermal camera, time investment, and increased
    data processing. Another shortcoming of using canopy temperature information is
    that it is greatly influenced by solar radiation, weather conditions, and intrinsic
    leaf characteristics, such as canopy architecture, making it difficult to obtain
    only the shoot temperature, especially when it is affected by water conditions
    [47,48,49]. As plant canopy temperature is directly related to the crop water
    status, it can be elevated by up to 2.3 °C under drought stress conditions [50];
    it is not necessary to use the temperature as an input variable. Using spectral
    bands as input in machine learning algorithms also generates accurate outputs
    for many studies, such as the identification of soybean cultivars [51] and in
    the prediction of agronomic traits such as plant height and maturity [17]. According
    to specific characteristics of the chlorophyll pigments, the wavelengths reflected
    by plants, especially red, are sensitive to chlorophyll alteration and allow correlation
    with crop characteristics [52,53]. Irrigation management strongly influences these
    characteristics. One of the explanations for this effect is that the closure of
    the stomata by plants undergoing drought stress leads to a decrease in net photosynthesis,
    fluorescence and chlorophyll content of the leaves [54]. Physiological changes
    that occur in plants due to water and temperature variations can assist in predicting
    crop yields when leaf area is taken into consideration because it can determine
    the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves and thus estimate the photosynthetic potential
    [55] and correlate this information with the crop’s yield potential. According
    to the results presented here, the superior performance of the RF algorithm may
    be more evident when the response is the product of multiple complex interactions
    between several predictors, such as in agricultural systems where the interactions
    between biophysical, ecological, physiological, and agronomic management can complicate
    modeling. Herrero-Huerta [56] also tested ML models in soybean yield prediction
    using data obtained by a UAV multispectral sensor and verified high accuracy (90.7%)
    by RF. In a study to predict leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) and plant height
    (PH) with machine learning techniques and UAV-based multispectral imagery in maize
    crops in Brazil, Osco et al. [18] also verified superior performance by RF, which
    archived r and RMSE, respectively, of 0.91 and 1.9 g.kg−¹ for LNC, and 0.86 and
    0.17 m for PH. Most RF applications have focused on its utility as a classification
    tool [51,57]. However, recent studies exploring the regression capabilities of
    the RF algorithm to predict crop productivity in tropical territories are very
    limited. Various studies have pointed out numerous advantages of RF as a regression
    tool over traditional regression models [18,56,57]. To date, the applications
    of RF regression in the fields of agronomy and crop science remain scarce. Therefore,
    the results presented here could constitute the basis for initiating new contributions
    to agricultural sciences. 5. Conclusions Our study tested different machine learning
    models and inputs for grain yield prediction in maize. Among the inputs tested
    are spectral bands (SB) obtained with a UAV multispectral sensor, leaf temperature
    (Temp) obtained with a thermal sensor, and irrigation management (IR). Random
    Forest achieved higher accuracy in predicting maize grain yield, especially when
    associated with inputs SB+IR and SB+IR+Temp. Given the results obtained, there
    are no gains in accuracy with the use of leaf temperature obtained with a thermal
    sensor for predicting grain yield in maize. This manuscript reports a promising
    result for estimating grain yield in maize using a multispectral UAV sensor with
    a thermal sensor associated with the random forest algorithm. However, it is important
    to highlight that grain yield is a complex trait governed by many genes and with
    a strong environmental effect. Therefore, future research can be carried out with
    hyperspectral sensors aiming to increase the prediction accuracy of this variable
    in maize. Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be

    of thingssensorssmart aquaculture systems 1. Introduction Aquaculture is a subclass
    of agriculture performed in water bodies (sea, estuaries, and lands) to raise
    consumables (e.g., fish crabs, lobster, sea urchins, etc.), ornamental and commercially
    valuable animals (e.g., pearl oysters and horseshoe crabs). Aquatic animals such
    as fishes, crabs, eels, mussels, etc. are the rich source of protein and micronutrients
    including essential vitamins and minerals that are part of a balanced diet and
    required to overcome the most serious nutritional shortages in the human body
    (Allen et al. 2006; Beveridge et al. 2013). With the increased demand for high
    protein food, aquaculture is a rapidly growing food-producing sector worldwide
    (Deb et al. 2020, 2017). It plays a vital role in the economic boom of developing
    and underdeveloped countries. Conventional methods of aquaculture are largely
    dependent on human participation and intelligence, which is time-consuming, has
    additional labor costs and has compliance issues. Therefore, in the sphere of
    heightened market and global competition, aquaculture industries need smart management
    technologies to address the disruptions during the cultural period (Yuan et al.
    2019). For instance, to produce healthier aquaculture products on a large scale,
    many water-related factors such as dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, salinity,
    ammonia, pH, nitrogen dioxide, bromine, and feed input and diseases need to be
    continuously monitored to anticipate and prevent disasters such as unexpected
    fish mortality and slow growth rate (Chakrabarti 2016; Oddsson 2020; Lopes et
    al. 2021). Thus, to achieve this goal, the smart aquaculture management systems
    (SAMS) are currently in the process of controlling all the parameters remotely
    and effectively, and also reducing the human intervention (Elazhary 2019; Engle
    et al. 2020; Li and Li 2020; Navarro et al. 2020; Kalyani et al. 2021). Particularly,
    IoT is the foundation of SAMS, while big data and artificial intelligence (AI)
    is the core of the intelligent operation of IoT (Basnet and Bang 2018; Ray 2018;
    Jothiswaran et al. 2020; Kamaruidzaman & Nazahiyah Rahmat 2020; Li and Li 2020;
    Yue and Shen 2021). Recently, AI has become a powerful tool for minimizing complexities
    and complications in several applied fields of research, education, and social
    activities such as engineering, creative learning, medicine, and marketing (Li
    et al. 2017; Popenici and Kerr 2017; Sterne 2017; Klumpp 2018; He et al. 2019;
    Li and Li 2020; Rathi et al. 2020). Based on its potency to address the functional
    challenges, the AI has been used efficiently in the field of wastewater treatment
    (Fan et al. 2018; Al Aani et al. 2019; Antwi et al. 2019), water quality management
    (Najah Ahmed et al. 2019; Rajaee et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019), river water quality
    modeling (Elkiran et al. 2019), and water resource recycling (Xu et al. 2019).
    Its usage and development grew with the evolution of technology, being a critical
    tool to study large amounts of data (O’Leary 2013; Duan et al. 2019). Also, AI
    offers great advantages in the aquaculture sector (Šiljić Tomić et al. 2018; Sun
    et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2021), such as ammonia nitrogen prediction (Su et al.
    2020; Yu et al. 2021), sex identification of aquatic animals (Barulin 2019), evaluating
    appetite and feeding pattern (Zhou et al. 2019), behavioral analysis (Yang et
    al. 2021), and feeding control (Zhou et al. 2018). Therefore, with the introduction
    of SAMS using sensors, networking devices, and microcontrollers for quick data
    processing, aquaculture has shifted from conventional labor-intensive farming
    systems to mechanized and automated systems. Besides, the IoT platform can help
    researchers to design different decision support systems for precise scheduling
    and monitoring of variable parameters in aquaculture ponds that affect the production
    yield. It is noted that the application of SAMS is a recent invention, which improved
    the production quantity to a large extent and prevented the environmental deterioration
    due to pollution coming from aquaculture farms. A handful of research is conducted
    in recent years to further improve the IoT-based sensor technology to analyze
    water quality and weather parameters in aquaculture. This review aims to comprehensively
    summarize all the information related to SAMS recently published and discuss their
    potential application in the big aquaculture farms. This study also includes the
    prospect to suggest new research directions for aquaculture practices to improve
    productivity. Overall, the present study will be utilizable for the scientific
    communities for further advancement and tailoring of SAMS with the inclusion of
    modern sensors as well as the current and prospective aquaculture farmers to employ
    technologies and enhance the product yield. 2. Applications of smart aquaculture:
    modern inventions to enhance aquaculture production 2.1. Effect of water quality
    on the aquatic environment To begin with, it is a prerequisite to understanding
    the importance of water quality for the growth and development of aquatic animals
    to develop an efficient SAMS for aquaculture farms. In aquaculture, water quality
    affects directly or indirectly the health, growth rate, feed intake efficiency,
    and survival rate of the aquatic animals. The culture water quality is mainly
    affected by the changes in the nutrients supply, organism metabolism, temperature,
    and water runoff from the agricultural fields (Chouler and Di Lorenzo 2015; Zheng
    et al. 2015; Brochu et al. 2020). Usually, a neutral to slightly basic pH is considered
    optimum for aquaculture (Boyd et al. 2011; Tumwesigye et al. 2022). Change in
    pH toward a more acidic range can lead to hampering the growth of aquatic animals
    (Stevens 2009; Ndubuisi et al. 2015; Mota et al. 2018). Similarly, a saturated
    dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 5 to 9 ppm is desired, and more or less
    to this range causes serious health defects in the aquatic animals (Doudoroff
    and Shumway 1970; Mallya 2007; Kemker 2014). Most importantly, the ammoniacal
    nitrogen concentration should be <0.012 ppm (Meade 1985; Hargreaves and Tucker
    2004; Zhou and Boyd 2015), whereas the biological oxygen demand (BOD) values should
    be below 30 ppm for a good quality aquaculture water (Xinglong and Boyd 2005).
    The feed type (high or low protein and fat content), structure (soluble or floating
    type), and feeding behavior of the aquatic animals govern the ammonia and BOD
    pollution in the water (Chatvijitkul et al. 2015; Bergheim et al. 2019; Dauda
    et al. 2019; Kong et al. 2020). For example, a high protein content feed can release
    a lot of ammonia in the water, whereas feed containing roughage and fiber can
    lead to high BOD (Miles and Chapman 2007; Godoy-Olmos et al. 2022). In this line,
    the soluble feed (water soluble and fat soluble vitamins) will not be accessible
    to the animals and also create devastating pollution, while the floating feed
    can’t be accessed by the bottom dwellers (Kidwell et al. 1995). Moreover, small
    animals can’t consume a large size feed, and ultimately, the leftover feed settles
    on the bottom of the pond, contributing to toxicity and creating a breeding ground
    for harmful bacteria (Dauda et al. 2019; Yeo et al. 2004). Therefore, it is important
    to control these parameters while culturing the animals in the ponds. Such accuracy
    in feed management and feeding behavior cannot be achieved, therefore, continuous
    monitoring of these parameters is important. The pH, DO, and some nitrogen compounds
    can be directly measured using electrical sensors (Jan et al. 2021; Pule et al.
    2017). The organic matter concentrations need to be measured using some prescribed
    methods. The most popular method is the closed reflux method provided by the standard
    protocols of water and wastewater monitoring (APHA 2005). The water color of aquatic
    water bodies indicates turbidity and can also be measured with the help of turbidity
    meters. Highly turbid water could be an indication of a rise in pollution level
    and thus, necessary steps should be taken to reduce it. High-quality water is
    a core factor for ensuring high yield and good quality of aquaculture production
    (Wang et al. 2021). Monitoring water quality parameters in real-time is necessary
    for preventing diseases, identifying breeding anomalies, and reducing corresponding
    risks (Zounemat-Kermani et al. 2019). The methods for monitoring aquaculture pond
    conditions mostly visualizing the changes in the pond dynamics (e.g., algal boom,
    dead animal floating, cloudy water, etc.,) and measuring some water quality parameters
    using chemical evaluation techniques are time-consuming practices and did not
    provide accuracy in the results. Thus, SAMS can provide the actual solution to
    the real problem faced by farmers. 2.2. Smart aquaculture management systems (SAMS)
    The SAMS is a new approach to monitoring aquaculture water quality independently
    with the integration of AI and IoT (Chrispin et al. 2020). Especially, IoT has
    many applications all around the world’s market, engineering sectors, agricultural,
    medical science, industrial, and aquatic infrastructure to increase productivity
    (Ray 2018; Balakrishnan et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2020; Karim et
    al. 2021). The IoT-based SAMS is popular in the field of aquaculture monitoring,
    fish location and behavior monitoring, and fish characteristics monitoring (Karim
    et al. 2021). Recent applications to demonstrate the utility of IoT in SAMS for
    online monitoring of water quality is listed in Table 1. These applications are
    aiding producers in analyzing water quality, animal growth patterns, feed supplements,
    and disease detection, allowing farmers to avoid natural disasters even before
    they occur. Thus, starting from breeding in hatcheries to the packaging and transportation,
    these technologies can reduce monitoring time and the number of workers and reduce
    the cost of management. The most real and reliable data of aquatic water bodies
    and fish environments can be collected and processed through smart IoT applications.
    As a result, in aquaculture, the development of an IoT environment for tracking
    online water quality parameters is likely to employ wireless communication (Ridha
    and Cruz 2001; Pule et al. 2017). The IoT-based SMAS has significant advantages
    in terms of AI to support sequential processing of data from multi-channel sensors
    and activate the alarming systems in full-scale systems (Hu et al. 2020). A typical
    flow diagram of the SAMS is shown in Figure 1. Typically, the IoT system is linked
    with several modules such as water quality data acquisition module (sensors),
    transmission module (4 G wireless modules), cloud server module, terminal display
    module, solar power panels, and long-distance storage segments. The fundamental
    of this study realizes that the real and accurate water quality variables must
    be achieved through collection modules and processing modules for intelligent
    prediction analysis and calculation, and related application services. This method
    not only plays a crucial role in inadequate water quality detection and prediction,
    but it also serves as a foundation for further research into the variability of
    water quality parameters, fish traits, and behavioral mechanisms. Figure 1. IoT
    based smart aquaculture system. Display full size Table 1. Application of IoT-based
    sensors for water quality monitoring under SAMS. Download CSVDisplay Table 3.1.
    Internet of things (IoT) for applications in aquaculture The IoT refers to the
    ever-growing networks of physical objects (such as sensors and data loggers) with
    the interconnectivity of IP addresses and the communication between the objects
    and the other internet-enabled devices and systems, like mobile/computer to wireless
    sensors via software (Deekshath et al. 2018; Moparthi et al. 2018; Brous et al.
    2019). The IoT technology allows objects to be sensed and controlled across existing
    networking infrastructures and creates opportunities for much direct integration
    between the computer-based systems and the physical world, which results in improved
    efficiency, accuracy, and economic benefits in several fields viz. agriculture,
    aquaculture, energy, environmental management, infrastructure management, building
    construction and transportation (Udin Harun Al-Rasyid et al. 2020). Thus, IoT
    is an efficient solution for monitoring different environmental parameters in
    aquaculture ponds and instructing optimal onsite solutions to adverse environmental
    conditions (Geetha and Gouthami 2016; Saha et al. 2018; Tawfeeq et al. 2019).
    It is made up of a variety of components that allow the system to perform various
    functions such as sensing, identification, actuation, communication, and management
    (Ray 2018). For example, Figure 2 shows the system architecture and flow chart
    proposed by Saha et al. ( 2018). The system architecture exhibited various sensor
    devices like DO sensor, pH sensor, conductivity sensor, and temperature sensor
    as the input elements of the system whereas the motor is the output element of
    the system. All the sensors are linked with the Arduino Uno board. Arduino is
    a programmable microcontroller-based open-source electronic device often used
    for making inexpensive electronic sensors and actuators (Moparthi et al. 2018).
    Arduino boards have gained popularity in recent years because of their flexibility,
    ease of use and reprogrammable properties, and easy connectivity with the hardware
    via a universal serial bus (USB) port or using wireless nodes. These handy chipsets
    can be programmed and configured for any environment that can suit for purpose
    and data may be collected for research purposes using its simple communication
    interface. Arduino IDE is used to program the boards, which is an open-access
    programming language and therefore the programs can be tailored according to the
    need of the users and can be loaded onto the boards using a USB connection from
    a laptop/desktop to the boards (Brock et al. 2009). The programs that are loaded
    on the board are called “sketches” (Evans 2011; Arakliotis et al. 2016). Likewise,
    the output/data can be collected from the Arduino board via a USB connection or
    can be collected by wireless connectivity (specific boards provide wireless connectivity).
    The Arduino boards usually incorporate ATmega microcontrollers viz. ATmega328,
    ATmega2560, ATmega8, etc., with a clock speed of 8 or 16 MHZ with auto-reset functionality
    (Badamasi 2014; Louis 2016). The most prominent IoT boards are ARDUINO NANO 33
    IoT, MKR FOX 1200, MKR WAN 1300, MKR Wi-Fi 1010, ARDUINO NANO RP2040 CONNECT,
    etc. The adoption of IoT technology will be more profitable for the suitable industry
    with a proper selection of various components such as sensors, communication protocol,
    data storage, data analytics, and computation. Figure 2. IoT system (a) system
    architecture (b) process flow diagram (adopted from Saha et al. 2018). Display
    full size Besides, one of the most important components of an IoT system is the
    wireless sensor networks (WSN), which provide real-time monitoring capabilities
    and manage the systems remotely (Pule et al. 2017; Ray 2018; Haseeb et al. 2020).
    Along with WSN, the IoT technologies provide the best utilization of resources
    to increase the productivity of aquaculture farms from culture (animal growth
    and required input) to market (finding the best price and distribution) applications
    (Motlagh et al. 2020; Gupta et al. 2022). Even, the rapid development of low-cost
    mobile devices has accelerated the development of IoT and related technologies
    for a variety of applications (El Khaddar and Boulmalf 2017; McPherson and Irvine
    2020). For example, Saha et al. ( 2018) developed and deployed a one-of-a-kind
    IoT-based aquaculture monitoring system, which contained a low-cost fish culture
    monitoring application (FCM app). This integrated device with a low-cost sensor
    module interfaced with custom-made software to communicate via Wi-Fi and produced
    comparable performance results in less time and cost as compared to conventional
    water quality testing systems. The device with the FCM app allows the farmers
    directly see the status of water quality parameters like temperature, DO, pH,
    conductivity, etc. in real-time and compare the results at different time intervals
    via interactive graphs and charts. At present, over 9 billion things are associated
    with the internet and it is expected that the demand will further rise to 20 billion
    in the near future according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations (FAO 2017). In the coming years, it is expected that IoT-based technology
    will offer an advanced level of services in all human activities including land
    or water-based farming practices (Walter et al. 2017; Kamaruidzaman & Nazahiyah
    Rahmat 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más 2020). To comprehend the
    utilization of IoT in SAMS, Figure 3 portrays the synergies of IoT-based decision
    support systems for high precision and productivity. Figure 3. Relationship between
    IoT and the present system for smart aquaculture. Display full size Hence, this
    cutting-edge technology can potentially reduce unnecessary input costs in agriculture
    production modules such as inspections and repair costs, and experimental costs
    for which manual labor was required earlier as well as eliminate different forms
    of waste, such as electricity and products. The real monitoring and controlling
    system for aquaculture-based models are highly effective i.e., the This Then That
    (IFTTT) model and cloud integration (Dzulqornain et al. 2018; Acar et al. 2019;
    Tawfeeq et al. 2019). These models can be easily used by typical farmers who do
    not have computer programming skills. The IFTTT assists farmers in customizing
    their aerator system for efficient DO recharge in the culture ponds (Dzulqornain
    et al. 2018; Yadav et al. 2022). With IFTTT, the user can manually estimate the
    functioning equipment depending on their requirements for the pond state (Arefin
    Mozumder and Sharifuzzaman Sagar 2021). The data from the sensors will be sent
    to the cloud system for analysis and interpreted before being uploaded to the
    mobile terminals (Dzulqornain et al. 2018; Cordova-Rozas et al. 2019; Ubina et
    al. 2021). 3.2. Features of IoT technology 3.2.1. Artificial intelligent (AI)
    The breeding and development phases of aquaculture species need precise technology
    for circulating water treatment, appropriate feeding, water quality monitoring,
    net cleaning, counting, classification, and grading of animals (Wang et al. 2021).
    Moreover, the equipment used in aquaculture systems needs an intelligent support
    system for smooth and accurate outcomes. ( Rembold 2020; C. Wang et al. 2021).
    Therefore, AI is the hardcore feature of IoT for application in SAMS, which controls
    all the operating sensors, mobile or network connectivity, and small or compact
    devices through complex algorithms (Lee 2000; Chrispin et al. 2020; Daoliang and
    Chang 2020; Chang et al. 2021). To begin with, AI technology is the optimum solution
    for controlling the real-time factors of aquatic production and is highly reliable,
    accurate, and secure for application on big farms (Martin 2019). This technology
    essentially makes everything smart, meaning it can enhance every part of data
    collection, algorithms, and networks. The newly invented micro and nanosensors
    (temperature, water level, electrochemical, conductivity, salinity, pH, turbidity,
    and DO sensors) are responsible for monitoring the aquatic environment. Automatic
    electric robots are nowadays used for instinctive operation and inspection, intelligent
    sorting and grading of aquatic animals (Lambrou et al. 2014; Geetha and Gouthami
    2016; Basnet and Bang 2018; Parra et al. 2018; Sharma and Aquaculture 2019; Tawfeeq
    et al. 2019; Su et al. 2020). An in-house used aquaculture sensor and its operation
    using an AI microcontroller-based datalogger for real-time monitoring are shown
    in Figure 4. These sensors efficiently measure the water quality parameters in
    the set time interval, which is analyzed by an AI algorithm in the computer to
    compare the data. If necessary, action is required to control the fluctuation
    in a particular parameter, for instance, decreased DO level or increased ammonia
    concentration, it instructs the associated disaster control management system
    to act. Figure 4. Different types of sensors used for monitoring aquaculture water
    system. Display full size 3.2.2. Electronic sensors and compact devices in IoT-based
    SAMS The sensors are the most important component in IoT, which are usually small
    in size, easy to handle, easily adaptable, cheap, and have low maintenance cost,
    high network connection capability, multi-tasking, and a useful long life (Basnet
    and Bang 2018; Sharma and Aquaculture 2019; Li and Li 2020). Sensors can act as
    the defining instrument and it transforms IoT from a standard passive network
    of devices into an active system of real-world integration (Sanchit 2008; Sethi
    et al. 2017; Parra et al. 2018). At present, different sensors are widely used
    together in the development of SAMS (Su et al. 2020). Table 2 presented different
    sensors used in aquaculture practices and the response system to counteract the
    alarms to manage the parameters in aquaculture. For example, the term intelligent
    aeration system refers to a set of sensors, a network transmission module, and
    an IoT actuator that can precisely monitor and control the DO in water (Huan et
    al. 2020). It may also observe real-time data of the water temperature, air humidity,
    and air pressure during operation. These sensors are generally connected with
    an alarm system in a central server, which upon sensing poor water quality, triggers
    the alarm to activate the management system. For example, when the DO sensor measures
    a low DO concentration (less than 3 mg/L) in the fishpond, immediately an alarm
    signal is sent to the central server to activate the aeration unit. The aeration
    unit will be activated until the DO reaches close to the 9 mg/L and then again,
    the sensor will send a signal to the central server to switch off the aeration
    system (Tolentino et al. 2021). The intelligent aerators can anticipate DO concentration
    in a short period. Some sensors are used to the information via video surveillance
    and transfer the information to a cloud platform that allows for accurate aeration
    management. Kisi et al. ( 2020) developed a new integrated approach to predict
    the DO concentration per hour through the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method.
    The BMA method can be a good approach to reduce the uncertainty in models via
    finding the best possible model mainly for that system, having a high rate of
    unreliability. It was noted that the BMA method can be applied for short-term
    DO prediction. Similar management protocol is also employed for increased ammonia
    concentration in fish ponds by adopting an in-situ ammonia correction approach
    (Liu et al. 2014; Africa et al. 2017). A different strategy based on the condition
    might require managing ammonia concentration in the aquaculture ponds. For instance,
    in intensive culture systems, water exchange is employed to reduce ammonia stress
    (Pattillo 2014). In addition, the biofloc development technique is also utilized
    as an effective strategy for ammonia management (Abakari et al. 2021). Table 2.
    Types of sensors used in aquaculture practices. Download CSVDisplay Table The
    IoT technology uses auxiliary devices for monitoring and accessing the data of
    any system, for instance, mobile phones, tablets, and laptops to achieve its accuracy,
    flexibility, and scalability (Hussain et al. 2020; Piccialli et al. 2020). Principally,
    these devices are inexpensive and easily fixed at any location of the farm without
    any disturbances, helping to operate the system smoothly. The auxiliary devices
    can perform several tasks at a time like data collection, storage, data transfer,
    analysis, optimization, monitoring, data mining, data processing, and management
    in the field of aquaculture. Currently, the aquaculture industry has used a mix
    of big data processing technologies and cloud computing technology starting from
    farming to the final processing of aquaculture produce (Qingling et al. 2018;
    Ray 2018). Aquaculture big data processing technology and cloud computing technology
    is a subset of big data technology that is used specifically in aquaculture practices
    for in-time decision making and operating the necessary equipment to control the
    production line ( Figueroa et al. 2018; Balakrishnan et al. 2019). Aquaculture
    data may be acquired, classified, processed, managed, mined, and analyzed to collect
    useful information and deliver it to farmers and policymakers to obtain reliable,
    insightful, and optimum responses (Dzulqornain et al. 2018). 3.2.3. Network connectivity
    and its utility The IoT supports an aquatic system and its operational conditions
    with suitable network connectivity and quick decision-making capability (Karim
    et al. 2021). Networks can exist on a very small and cheap scale but still be
    practical. The IoT creates a network between several connected devices and determines
    whether the system is on right track. Network connectivity blends the characteristics
    of the aquatic system with real-time monitoring data and shares it with devices
    via Internet, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. Within a 100-meter range, Wi-Fi uses radiofrequency
    waves to send and receive data (Chhabra 2013; Adi and Kitagawa 2019). In some
    ad-hoc arrangements, Wi-Fi allows smart devices to communicate and share data
    without the use of a router. Bluetooth is another communication system that uses
    short-wavelength radio to transmit and receive information over short distances
    while consuming the least amount of required power (Terán et al. 2017). Bluetooth
    5 was recently released by the Bluetooth special interest group (SIG), which supports
    IoT by providing Bluetooth low energy, High-speed, and IP connectivity (Collotta
    et al. 2018). Recently, the ultimate one-size-fits-all networking system delivered
    incredibly low power consumption for smartphones while maintaining the potential
    to easily relay large pieces of data over long distances, and thus remain commercially
    feasible for aquaculture farms and industries (Stonebraker and Çetintemel 2018).
    This technology is the best solution for aquatic water system management based
    on their requirements without the interference of such a huge crowd around it.
    The IoT specifically addresses the needs of the aquatic environment and fish characteristics.
    It mainly supports all possible big data that is sensed through a specific network
    of devices such as sensors and actuators (aerators and water heaters). Maximum
    interaction of the aquaculture farmers with the connected IoT technology is only
    possible based on their proper and frequent use in aquatic bodies for checking
    the daily variations of the water quality and fish characteristics. Tawfeeq et
    al. (2019) proposed an intelligent solar-based aquaculture system that worked
    based on IoT and data analytics to investigate aquaculture farms to allow farmers
    to detect problems at an early stage and take appropriate action to keep the fish
    in the best possible circumstances. In another study, Tawfeeq et al. (2019) investigated
    the IoT-based aquaculture system with cloud analytics. In their study, the authors
    used Arduino, sensors, and actuators to automate the process of managing water
    quality parameters including water level, temperature, and pH. The data from the
    sensors were recorded in the cloud so that farmers may access them from anywhere
    using a mobile application or a web application. The automation in the aquaculture
    sector may develop even more by adopting emerging technologies such as blockchain,
    artificial intelligence, IoT, and mobile applications. The first mobile app Aqua
    Brahma was published in 2015 and the most recent app Mathsya Kiran has been published
    in 2019 (Dhenuvakonda et al. 2019; Dhenuvakonda and Sharma 2020). The same research
    group also developed a mobile app called virtual fisheries for real-time monitoring
    of the pond condition over a wireless network. Nowadays mobile applications are
    new norms, the fisheries industry must collaborate with information technology
    providers to develop long-term solutions based on mobile applications (Javvaji
    and Hussain 2020). All of these new technologies have enormous potential in the
    aquaculture field. Similarly, Balakrishnan et al. ( 2019) developed one IoT-based
    smart aquaculture system to monitor water characteristics such as temperature,
    conductivity, turbidity, and oil layer over the water. They concluded that the
    user may access the system through the internet (cloud), reducing the danger of
    being exposed to so many unforeseen outdoor conditions, such as those found in
    the vicinity of aqua-farming ponds, while also improving the survival rate of
    aquatic animals and productivity. The sensors used in water bodies, in connection
    with cloud management and mobile connection, will keep fishes in the best possible
    habitat and provide sufficient nutrition for growth and feed conversion in the
    aquaculture sector. Usage of real-time sensors to assess individual fish stress
    levels and detect infections in water may be required in the coming days. These
    sensors should be able to provide powerful signals that can be received by equipment
    on the ground and watercraft or spacecraft and be readily implanted into live
    fish or submerged in water bodies (Yue and Shen 2021). The water quality monitoring
    system was designed for aquaculture based on narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT)
    technology by Huan et al. ( 2020). They observed that the NB-IoT technology enables
    data aggregation and transmission over a long distance to the IoT telecom cloud
    infrastructure. Water quality parameter data may be saved at any time using the
    IoT telecom cloud platform. The IoT-based cloud platform applications in various
    sectors are presented in Figure 5. Figure 5. IoT-based cloud platforms applications.
    Display full size 4. Future perspective In aquaculture, the application of sensing
    technologies is advancing quickly, but there are still numerous barriers to overcome
    before they can be fully implemented in aquaculture fields (Kumar et al. 2018;
    Wang et al. 2021; 2021). Conventional aquaculture production techniques need a
    lot of monitoring time and are labor-intensive processes. Therefore, It is essential
    to create a smart system where human interaction can be minimized for precise
    process development. Many intelligent devices such as micro and nano-sensors for
    monitoring fisheries environment, bionic robots for operation, automatic inspection,
    intelligent sorting, and energy-saving processing equipment for aquatic products
    could all be significantly used in the automation of aquaculture systems. It can
    be expected that with the development and use of sensors in every process of aquaculture,
    the production rate can be increased several-fold with significantly less labor
    input. Therefore, SAMS needs an appropriate hardware platform based on the aquaculture
    production process. With the development of the IoT platform, efficient utilization
    of sensors is possible with high precision and data monitoring remotely. The reach
    of IoT-based sensors is limited to rich farmers and big industries. Thus, it is
    highly important to decentralize the technology with government aid and industrial
    interventions for the small farmers. The real use of IoT in aquaculture can only
    be foreseen when a centralized data server will be developed that will provide
    a real-time solution to the farmers at their fingertips. Thus, IoT devices of
    small/medium/large farmers and industries must be linked with the central system,
    where one can store the data and easily access it on the mobile application. Although
    the development of sensors is still a challenging task for collecting a large
    set of data, which is used for analysis or optimization of the process parameters.
    To find out better results from IoT technologies, the uses of IoT technology can
    be integrated with different parameters like water quality, and environmental
    and behavioral parameters of aquatic animals simultaneously to gain a better perspective
    of the larger system. 5. Conclusion This review paper is aimed at exploring the
    advancements in the SAMS currently under research and development and their future
    implications in filed level applications. The IoT technology is the cornerstone
    of SAMS, which can potently enhance the aquaculture production rate with minimum
    manual efforts. The advent of a high-frequency band width for data communication
    (5 G) supported by cutting-edge IoT technology made it possible to operate several
    aquaculture sensors from a remote location and monitor the pond parameters. In
    case of any adjectivity is sensed by the sensors, the SAMS itself take appropriate
    decision with the help of inbuilt AI to minimize the threat. The SAMS even promote
    bidirectional communication of data in the cloud for analysis by the engineers
    and scientists to further prepare strategies to maintain good conditions in the
    pond system. Moreover, big data acquisition analysis for data curing will further
    improve the AI system in SAMS for decision-making in the future without any manual
    assistance in aquaculture industries. Glossary of Acronyms AI = Artificial intelligence

  description: 'CONTEXT: Automated monitoring of the soil-plant-atmospheric continuum
    at a high spatiotemporal resolution is a key to transform the labor-intensive,
    experience-based decision making to an automatic, data-driven approach in agricultural
    production. Growers could make better management decisions by leveraging the real-time
    field data while researchers could utilize these data to answer key scientific
    questions. Traditionally, data collection in agricultural fields, which largely
    relies on human labor, can only generate limited numbers of data points with low
    resolution and accuracy. During the last two decades, crop monitoring has drastically
    evolved with the advancement of modern sensing technologies. Most importantly,
    the introduction of IoT (Internet of Things) into crop, soil, and microclimate
    sensing has transformed crop monitoring into a quantitative and data-driven work
    from a qualitative and experience-based task. OBJECTIVE: Ag-IoT systems enable
    a data pipeline for modern agriculture that includes data collection, transmission,
    storage, visualization, analysis, and decision-making. This review serves as a
    technical guide for Ag-IoT system design and development for crop, soil, and microclimate
    monitoring. METHODS: It highlighted Ag-IoT platforms presented in 115 academic
    publications between 2011 and 2021 worldwide. These publications were analyzed
    based on the types of sensors and actuators used, main control boards, types of
    farming, crops observed, communication technologies and protocols, power supplies,
    and energy storage used in Ag-IoT platforms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The result
    showed that 33 variables measured by various sensors were demonstrated in these
    studies while 10 actuations were successfully integrated with Ag-IoT platforms.
    Perennial crops, which introduced less disturbance to Ag-IoT platforms than annual
    crops, were selected by 64% of researchers. Furthermore, studies in Ag-IoT system
    development were more focused on outdoor than indoor environments. Ag-IoT systems
    based on Arduino were most common among the studies while commercial platforms
    were least adopted, likely due to their inflexibility in customized developments.
    More researchers focused on agricultural applications than the IoT technology
    itself. Soil water content-based irrigation scheduling and controlled environment
    monitoring and controlling were the main applications. Other application areas
    included soil nutrient estimation, crop monitoring based on multiple vegetation
    indices, pest identification, and chemigation. SIGNIFICANCE: Several potential
    future research directions were identified at the end of the review, including
    integration of satellite-based internet connectivity to improve the IoT networks
    in non-connected farms, development of mobile IoT platforms (drones and autonomous
    ground vehicles) with continuous connectivity, and the use of edge-computing and
    machine-learning/deep-learning to enhance the capability of the Ag-IoT systems.'

    technical guide for Ag-IoT system design and development for crop, soil, and microclimate
    monitoring. METHODS It highlighted Ag-IoT platforms presented in 115 academic
    publications between 2011 and 2021 worldwide. These publications were analyzed
    based on the types of sensors and actuators used, main control boards, types of
    farming, crops observed, communication technologies and protocols, power supplies,
    and energy storage used in Ag-IoT platforms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The result
    showed that 33 variables measured by various sensors were demonstrated in these
    studies while 10 actuations were successfully integrated with Ag-IoT platforms.
    Perennial crops, which introduced less disturbance to Ag-IoT platforms than annual
    crops, were selected by 64% of researchers. Furthermore, studies in Ag-IoT system
    development were more focused on outdoor than indoor environments. Ag-IoT systems
    based on Arduino were most common among the studies while commercial platforms
    were least adopted, likely due to their inflexibility in customized developments.
    More researchers focused on agricultural applications than the IoT technology
    itself. Soil water content-based irrigation scheduling and controlled environment
    monitoring and controlling were the main applications. Other application areas
    included soil nutrient estimation, crop monitoring based on multiple vegetation
    indices, pest identification, and chemigation. SIGNIFICANCE Several potential
    future research directions were identified at the end of the review, including
    integration of satellite-based internet connectivity to improve the IoT networks
    in non-connected farms, development of mobile IoT platforms (drones and autonomous
    ground vehicles) with continuous connectivity, and the use of edge-computing and
    machine-learning/deep-learning to enhance the capability of the Ag-IoT systems.

    communication 1. Introduction Crops are essential for human life because they
    provide food, animal feed, fuel, and raw materials for clothing and shelter. Crop
    yield has to be doubled in 2050 compared to 2009 in order to meet the demand of
    a growing population while increasing the food quality and reducing production
    inputs (Fukase and Martin, 2020). Potential solutions to enhance global food security
    include closing crop yield gaps, reducing food waste, changing dietary habits,
    and reducing inefficiencies in resource use (Foley et al., 2011). Reducing inefficiencies
    in input resources (such as water and nitrogen) can be achieved by continuously
    monitoring crops, soil, and microclimate, and then properly controlling inputs
    without sacrificing the yield and quality of the crop. Internet of Things (IoT)
    becomes a key technology that enables continuous monitoring and control in this
    scenario. The ability to generate (near) real-time quantitative data with high
    spatiotemporal resolution is a major advantage of IoT systems (Liao et al., 2017).
    IoTs are considered big data systems due to volumes, velocities, and varieties
    of data they generate. These data are mined and modeled to elucidate the relationships
    between inputs and outputs (Tsai et al., 2014). Correlation, trend analysis, classification,
    and numerical prediction are implemented on the data to reach meaningful control
    decisions. Compared with the conventional wireless sensor networks, the holistic
    approach of IoT technology allows users to incorporate data analytics on the big
    data collected by IoT sensor devices. Generally, connected actuators are enabled
    to control the inputs to achieve desired application rates. For example, an internet-connected
    soil water content (SWC) sensor network measures the plant water deficit and uploads
    data to a cloud-based data analysis platform. The analysis will find the trend
    of soil water deficit to determine the best time and quantity to apply irrigation
    water. There has been a boom in IoT application development in agriculture (Ag-IoT)
    in the last two decades, particularly around crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring.
    However, the application of Ag-IoT at the commercial scale is still at its early
    stages. A deeper and more holistic understanding of the existing IoT system development
    is important for various stakeholders to sketch the future landscape of Ag-IoT.
    Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the key components of
    Ag-IoT including sensors, actuators, data processing, and data transmission, summarize
    its usage in crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring, and identify the research
    needs for successful IoT implementation in the future. Though Ag-IoT is proliferating
    in both crop and animal monitoring and management, Ag-IoT for crop production
    is the focus of this paper. IoT platforms for livestock production, as well as
    other sectors of agriculture (such as postharvest) are not included. IoT can be
    found in the manufacturing industry, consumers products, retail, finance and marketing,
    healthcare, transportation and logistics, smart city, military applications and
    supply chains (Islam et al., 2022). Fig. 1 shows the three main layers of a generic
    IoT architecture: the perception layer, network layer, and application layer (Jabraeil
    Jamali et al., 2020). The perception layer consists of gateways, mobile devices,
    sensors, actuators, power, and energy storage components. Activities in the perception
    layer include sensing, controlling, actuation, energy harvesting, energy storage,
    data transmission, and power management. The perception layer of the Ag-IoT faces
    challenges including harsh environmental conditions, heterogeneity of the applications,
    nonavailability of communication infrastructure, and lack of continuous power
    supplies, to just mention a few. This review therefore emphasizes the perception
    layer of Ag-IoT. The network layer consists of network devices and data transmission
    and processing functions. The application layer is responsible for user-specific
    applications such as data visualization, actuator control dashboards, as well
    as data storage, analysis, and decision making. This three-layer architecture
    of IoT can be expanded to five layers by including transport layer after network
    layer and adding business layer after the application layer (Banu, 2018). The
    transport layer is responsible for data transmission while the business layer
    manages the whole IoT system according to the user''s business model. Download

    is organized as follows. The method of the literature review is presented in Section
    two. Section three details the major elements of Ag-IoT technology. Section four
    describes the challenges that Ag-IoT systems face with emerging solutions. In
    Section five, supporting technologies for Ag-IoT are discussed. How the information
    from Ag-IoT can benefit farm systems analysis and management is discussed in Section
    six. The final section concludes the review article with future research directions.

    in Table 1, a thorough literature review was conducted. The main approach was
    to find the answers based on the recent research carried out in the field of Ag-IoT.
    We have searched for the recent Ag-IoT research published in scientific journals
    and conference proceedings between 2011 and 2021, using keywords through Google
    Scholar and Scopus web search. Keywords used in the search were Internet of Things,
    IoT, Crop Monitoring, Wireless Sensor Network, Smart Agriculture, and Crop Sensing.
    This search resulted in 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings
    papers. After reading the abstracts, 115 papers were determined to be relevant
    to the topic of Ag-IoT. The selected articles are listed in the Appendix, and
    they were used for in-depth analysis. Research papers selected covered countries
    in all six continents (except for Antarctica, Fig. 2a). Asia presented the largest
    number of papers (Scotford and Miller, 2004), whereas Australia had the smallest
    number of papers. In terms of countries, India (Coleman et al., 2022) and China
    (Chen et al., 2014) had the highest numbers of research outcomes. Fig. 2b presented
    the yearly distribution of the research papers. The number of research papers

    In Section 3, we have thoroughly reviewed the major components of Ag-IoT. To conduct
    this review systematically, we have divided this section into multiple subsections.
    These subsections are sensors, IoT platforms/main control board, wireless communication
    technology, IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and energy management, and actuators.
    3.1. Sensors Sensors play a major role in Ag-IoT systems because they serve as
    the converter between real-world signals and their digital representations. This
    section begins with an introduction and categorization of sensors used to measure
    crop, soil, and microclimate parameters. General purpose sensors such as temperature
    sensor, light intensity sensor, accelerometers, soil moisture sensor, etc., can
    be integrated into Ag-IoT systems (White, 1987). Table 2 gives sensor categories
    along with sensor measurands and provides some examples found in the literature.

    et al., 2017) Proper selection of sensors to an application is essential for IoT
    systems developers as well as for users to best use the sensors. The advancement
    of sensor technologies has a major impact on the popularity of IoT. Low energy
    consumption, compatibility in data transmission between the microcontroller and
    the sensor, accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and robustness are major considerations
    to select a sensor for IoT system development. To address research question 2
    in Table 1, we marked and counted the sensors in the 115 research papers reviewed,
    with the total count of each sensor given in Fig. 3. Soil moisture sensors were
    used for the largest number of applications (Ivanova et al., 2016) followed by
    humidity sensors (Hurst et al., 2021) and then air temperature sensors (Haque
    et al., 2021). The reason these sensors were integrated most in Ag-IoT so far
    is likely because of the need for continuous in-situ soil moisture monitoring
    for decision making in irrigated agricultural production. Water scarcity is a
    global issue, and the amount of arable land can be expanded significantly if growers
    can apply water efficiently (Aroca et al., 2018). On the contrary, soil water
    tension measured via soil water potential sensors only appeared in three papers.
    This lower interest in soil water potential sensors is likely due to (1) less
    understanding of the relationship between soil water tension and crop growth,
    (2) less availability of low-cost soil water potential sensors, and (3) the difficulty
    in interfacing the available soil water potential sensors to the IoT platforms.
    Next, we will discuss the Ag-IoT sensors found in the literature according to
    the measurand category it belongs to. Download : Download high-res image (192KB)

    research papers and their frequency. 3.1.1. Acoustic sensors Ultrasound distance
    measurement sensors and microphones are the most common acoustic property measuring
    sensors. Direct use of acoustic measurements is limited in Ag-IoT. Hardwood borer
    identification IoT sensor network is a direct application of microphone used in
    pest detection in forestry (Potamitis et al., 2019). Ultrasonic wind speed and
    direction sensor is an important meteorological sensor used in agriculture to
    estimate evapotranspiration (Kameoka et al., 2017). Compared with the mechanical
    anemometer, an ultrasonic anemometer requires less maintenance due to fewer mechanical
    parts involved. Furthermore, an ultrasonic anemometer can capture sudden changes
    in wind speed and direction very accurately. Acoustic sensors were used indirectly
    to measure biological measurands. Crop canopy height estimation by ultrasound
    sensor is an indirect approach to measure biological parameters (Yuan et al.,
    2018; Elci et al., 2018). IoT-enabled ultrasound distance sensors are widely used
    in irrigation systems to estimate the water volume in tanks, wells and reservoirs,
    and it is an essential sensor for irrigation scheduling in automated irrigation
    systems. Recently ultrasound flow meters replaced the mechanical flow meters due
    to their high accuracy in flow rate measurement with less maintenance. Underwater
    ultrasound scanning is possible for aquatic plant growth monitoring purposes such
    as lotas and seaweed and has a huge potential to determine the harvest stage and
    growth rate monitoring (Kool and Bernard, 2019). Fruit ripeness estimation is
    an interesting example of the indirect use of acoustics in agriculture. Daosawang
    et al. (2020) demonstrated that watermelon ripeness could be estimated by a sound
    generator and receiver. In summary, acoustic sensors advanced in recent years
    while replacing some traditional mechanical Ag-sensors and introducing new applications
    in agriculture. 3.1.2. Biological sensors Above-ground biomass of plant, plant
    height, plant density, leaf angle, leaf area index (LAI), count of plant organs
    (leaf, fruit, flower), chlorophyll concentration, sap flow, and stomata conductance
    are useful biological parameters in crop monitoring. Crop yield and the growth
    stage can be estimated from the plant''s mass (biomass). Loadcells are used in
    indoor farming pots to measure the plant weight directly (Long and McCallum, 2015).
    Almost all the field crop biomass estimations have been measured by indirect sensing
    techniques such as biomass-sensitive vegetation indices (VI) or by image processing-based
    techniques. However, both techniques require time-consuming ground truth data
    collection for model calibration. The accuracy of these techniques is subject
    to lighting conditions, sensor type, crop type, model parameters, and training
    data set. Just like crop biomass, many other biological measurands are also estimated
    indirectly. For example, stomata conductance can be quantified through optical
    measurands, and plant height through acoustic sensors. Therefore, most of the
    biological measurands will be discussed as indirect applications under other measurands.
    3.1.3. Chemical sensors Chemical sensors can be categorized into two main types:
    photochemical and electrochemical. Photochemical sensors measure chemical reactions
    or chemicals by their spectral signature, and electrochemical sensors measure
    the electrical properties due to chemical reactions or the presence of chemicals
    (Angkawinitwong and Williams, 2021). Soil pH, soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen
    (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), pH and conductivity of irrigation water,
    and photosynthesis are the parameters that often measured by chemical sensors.
    Knowing the pH of water and soil is important because pH affects the solubility
    of nutrients and therefore plant nutrient uptake and growth. Soil and irrigation
    water pH measurements with IoT-enabled sensors were demonstrated in the literature
    in nine studies. Spatial variability and the dependency of sensor accuracy on
    soil condition are the issues to address to promote them in agriculture (Chen
    et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). The soil salinity sensor and custom-made nitrate
    sensor were counted only once, which highlighted the difficulty of measuring soil
    chemical properties continuously and in a non-destructive manner. The measurement
    of the real-time nutrient content in the soil, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and potassium (K) are essential for fertigation. These sensors are still
    at the rudimentary stage (Burton et al., 2018) of development. Real-time soil
    nutrient sensing has a huge potential in future agriculture as nutrient leaching
    and groundwater pollution are serious issues people are facing now. Nitrate sensors
    can be fixed to groundwater pumps to monitor the nitrate status of groundwater,
    or installed in leaching water collectors in fields to get reasonable estimation
    about nitrate leaching (Hooper et al., 2019). Soil salinity can be derived from
    the soil''s electrical conductivity (EC), and it was demonstrated three times
    in the literature. This is a very important parameter to measure as soil salinity
    is one of the main soil degrading factors in irrigated agriculture. None of the
    research in the literature highlighted the importance of using EC sensors in soil
    or irrigation systems to ameliorate the soil salinity build-up due to irrigation.
    CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases attributed to climate change and agriculture
    is considered a major source of their emission. Accounting for the sourcing and
    sinking of CO2 and CH4 from soil and crops is important to understand the budget
    of greenhouse gases in agriculture. Research suggested that elevation of CO2 can
    increase crop yield as well as improve water use efficiency (Hatfield et al.,
    2011). Therefore, it is essential to measure CO2 and CH4. There are two types
    of gas sensors available. Metal oxide gas sensors increase the electric resistance
    of the sensor when it contacts certain gas. Optical gas sensors measure the absorption
    spectra to detect spectral signatures unique to the gas. O2 sensors can be used
    to monitor the crop respiration rate. Electrochemical sensors can be used to estimate
    dissolved oxygen as the increased dissolved oxygen in water can improve the quality
    and the yield of the aquatic plants (Shi et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2020). Another
    interesting parameter to measure is stomatal conductance. Plant stomatal openings
    regulate the exchange of water vapor and CO2 between a leaf and the surrounding
    atmosphere. So far, no IoT-enabled sensor has been developed to measure this parameter
    even though handheld sensors are available (Lamour et al., 2022). Chemical sensors
    can be used to monitor the quality of fruits during harvesting. As an example,
    IoT-enabled Ethelene gas sensors have a huge potential to use in fruit production
    to identify the best time to initiate harvesting (Esser et al., 2012). Although
    chemical sensors improved rapidly in the past decade, applications developed based
    on them in agriculture are still at an early stage. More research is needed to
    incorporate these sensors with Ag-IoT. 3.1.4. Electric sensors Electric sensors
    play a key role in Ag-IoT as they have been used in many industries for a long
    period. The main principle is to measure the change of electrical properties due
    to physical or chemical changes in plants, soil, and the environment. Some electrical
    parameters are charge, current, potential difference, electric field, resistance
    (or conductance), capacitance, and inductance. Soil moisture sensors via IoT systems
    were the most tested sensor in the literature. As most of the agricultural lands
    face water shortages and climate change has heavily affected the water availability,
    most of the studies attempted to address this requirement. We found that electrical
    resistance, capacitance, and permittivity of bulk soils were used to estimate
    soil volumetric water content (VWC). Furthermore, soil water tension was measured
    by the electrical resistance of gypsum blocks. For better irrigation scheduling,
    both VWC and soil water tension are important: VWC quantifies the amount of water
    in the soil whereas soil water tension is a better indicator of how difficult
    plant roots can extract water from the soil matrix. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors are the other two dominant sensors researchers have tested. There are
    three types of humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive, and thermal. Crop ET and
    pest or disease forecasting are the potential applications of the air temperature
    and humidity sensing requirements. But 90% of the research just demonstrated the
    capability of plug play these sensors; only 10% of IoT researchers demonstrate
    the capability of using those sensors for a meaningful task like disease forecasting.
    Humidity is an important environmental parameter directly related to ET calculation,
    crop quality, and pest growth forecasting. Sensors can be deployed to measure
    absolute, relative, and specific humidity. For example, the best time to start
    grain harvesting is highly dependent on grain moisture content and if harvested
    without considering the optimal moisture level it may cause extensive post-harvesting
    damage and economic loss (Zoerb et al., 1993). IoT-based ET modeling and irrigation
    scheduling enable low water usage and low irrigation energy consumption. IoT also
    opened the path for non-conventional VWC measurement. Aroca et al. (2018) presented
    the use of RFID to estimate VWC with a received signal strength of the tag with
    R2 > 0.9. A rain sensor based on the electrical conductivity principle was demonstrated
    as an IoT sensor that could detect the start and end of the rain (Andrey Rivas-Sánchez
    et al., 2019). Based on these literature outcomes it can be concluded that electric
    sensors are mature compared to acoustic and chemical sensors and have been used
    in the industry for a long time and have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT.
    3.1.5. Mechanical sensors Mechanical sensors convert a physical parameter of interest
    through a mechanical system to an electrical signal. Parameters such as flow rate,
    acceleration, velocity, direction, orientation, and pressure can be measured by
    mechanical sensors. Examples of IoT-enabled mechanical sensors found in the literature
    include rain gauges, mechanical flow meters, air and liquid pressure meters, and
    anemometers. Rain gauge is important to capture the precipitation accurately to
    determine the timing and quantity of irrigation when combined with soil water
    content sensors and evapotranspiration modeling (Kameoka et al., 2017). Tipping
    bucket rain sensor converts water volume it captures to an electrical signal through
    a simple mechanism. Measuring pressure is important for air, liquid, and soil
    pressure calculation. Air pressure is relevant to measure crop transpiration as
    the opening and closing of plant stomata are partially regulated by vapor pressure
    deficit. Soil compaction can be measured by the pressure sensors inserted into
    the soil, which are useful for measuring the impact of heavy agricultural machinery.
    Irrigation line pressure sensors are critical to monitor the irrigation process
    as the wetting pattern of irrigation systems highly depends on the irrigation
    line pressure. High pressure causes loss of irrigation energy while low pressure
    does not allow maximum irrigation area through sprinklers. Anemometers can be
    used to measure the wind speed which is required for calculating ET and detecting
    high-speed wind that could be hazardous to plants. Gas and liquid flow rate are
    significant parameters for crop, soil, and environmental monitoring. Conventionally
    crop and soil inputs in the liquid or gaseous form, such as water input (including
    rain), leaching water, liquid fertilizer, liquid or gaseous insecticides, are
    measured using flow sensors. Some cash crops or niche crops such as wasabi (Sultana
    and Savage, 1970) and lettuce (Sultana and Savage, 1970) need highly precise environmental
    conditions and flow monitoring sensors are important for meeting those conditions
    in the future if climate change imposes challenges to grow them. Overall mechanical
    sensors play a key role in Ag-IoT systems, but most of the mechanical sensors
    are replaced by non-mechanical sensors due to the fact mechanical sensors need
    frequent maintenance and have long response time. 3.1.6. Optical sensors Optical
    measurands play a key role in modern agriculture. There should be a light source
    and an optical sensor to take the measurements. Ultraviolet (UV), visible, and
    near infrared (NIR) are the main wavelength regions where optical sensors are
    operated. It is important to note that optical sensors appear to have the least
    applications as IoT sensors according to the literature. Typical RGB images were
    used to derive RGB image-based vegetation indexes while multispectral sensors
    were used to derive vegetation indexes such as NDVI and NDRE (red-edge NDVI).
    Most of the optical sensors that generate spectral signatures or images of the
    target produce larger volumes of data and consume a higher amount of power compared
    to other sensors in Fig. 3. This appears to be a significant discouraging factor
    to incorporate these sensors into IoT. Naturally, signals in the visible region
    were used as indicators for many crops and environmental parameters such as maturation
    time, crop quality (Long and McCallum, 2015), crop nutrient requirement, pest
    pressure, as well as water and nutrient level in the soil. Historically people
    used their eyes (only responsive to the visible lights) to evaluate the color
    intensities somewhat qualitatively (e.g., comparing those to standard color cards).
    The introduction of these sensors has significantly improved optical measurements
    of crop and environmental parameters by (Akyildiz et al., 2009) enabling quantitative
    assessments and (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001) extending the spectral regions from
    visible only to UV and NIR. Fruit spectral signature was used to identify defects
    in the fruit that could not be revealed via visible light. NDVI and NDRE were
    used to quantitatively determine crop density as well as the nitrogen and water
    requirements (Scotford and Miller, 2004). We would like to highlight that more
    research is needed to demonstrate the optical measurand use in Ag-IoT as they
    can be used in a wide range of applications in agriculture. 3.1.7. Thermal sensors
    Thermal measurands have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT, and most of them
    are measured indirectly with optical and electrical means; for instance, measuring
    crop canopy temperature with infrared radiometers. In the literature, the frequent
    use of air and soil temperature sensors highlighted their importance in crop ET
    modeling and disease forecasting (Symeonaki et al., 2020). These sensors are cheap
    and readily available as off-the-shelf items and support a wide variety of IoT
    platforms (Mohanraj et al., 2016). Thermal parameters have the potential to indirectly
    measure biological measurands. One such example is the sap flow sensor, which
    was described in one study as a transpiration measuring sensor compatible with
    the IoT system (Villalba et al., 2017). The sensor consisted of a flexible tree
    stem heater and a temperature sensor while the IoT platform calculated sap flow
    based on the applied heat and temperature. This sap flow measurement is proportional
    to transpiration (sap movement in the xylem) and therefore useful in crop ET modeling
    (Villalba et al., 2017). Sap flow monitoring is essential in some crops to understand
    the physiological behavior of plants. Rubber, maple, coconut, and palmyra palm
    sap are the output of the harvest, and in these cases, sap flow monitoring is
    useful to estimate yield, optimize production, and develop high-yielding crop
    varieties. Indirectly measured canopy temperature through infrared radiometers
    estimates the transpiration rate and crop water stress index, which is important
    for water stress detection and irrigation scheduling (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001).
    Identification of pests such as wild boar through thermal measurement is an interesting
    application in agriculture. Furthermore, the temperature is found to affect the
    quality of grapefruits (sugar content) and flowering time of several crops (Pérez-Expósito
    et al., 2017). Temperature sensors can also record the temperature variation in
    plant leaves and flowering buds and give a warning about frosting time (Barker
    et al., 2017). This listing of thermal measurand applications concluded that thermal
    sensors are very important in Ag-IoT and have been demonstrated in the past literature.
    3.2. Sensing platforms and main control board Section 3.2 summarizes the statistics
    of the Ag-IoT sensing platforms and control boards in the literature. The answer
    for Question 3 in Table 1 was derived from Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (196KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main control boards
    of the Ag-IoT systems present in the reviewed papers. 3.2.1. Sensing platforms
    Sensing platforms consist of sensor node including sensors, power supply, energy
    storage, actuators, main control board or the data processing unit, and structural
    components. Structural components determine the sensor node establishment in the
    field. There are two main types of IoT platforms available for crop monitoring.
    Stationery IoT platforms can collect continuous crop data or telemetry data targeting
    a single plant or a group (plot) of plants. The main advantage of stationery IoT
    is the high temporal resolution of the data. Mobile IoT platforms can collect
    data over some areal coverage and with high spatial resolution, but with limited
    temporal resolution. Kumar et al. (2016) presented the development and testing
    of a crop monitoring mobile robot. It is capable of automatically planning the
    path to find crops, recognizing plants using neural networks, applying fertilizer
    timely, and applying water based on the feedback from soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and humidity sensors. 3.2.2. Main control boards The communication and
    data processing hardware for IoT systems reported in the reviewed papers could
    be broadly categorized into three kinds: commercial platforms, custom build, and
    DIY (do-it-yourself) development boards. The commercial platforms are reliable
    but have limited support for integrating different or additional sensors. IPex12
    (Odin Solutions SL, Peru), Particle Electron (Particle Industries, Inc., USA),
    MICAZ (MICAS AG, Germany), IRIS (IRIS IoT Solutions, UK), and Telosb (Advantic
    Sistemas y Servicios S.L., Spain) are commercial IoT systems. In the last decade,
    commercial IoT platforms were still at their development stage, explaining their
    lower use in the reviewed papers. Custom build hardware is designed by researchers
    based on their own requirements. Researchers have the flexibility to decide on
    the number and types of sensors, interfacing connections, microprocessor clock
    speed, IoT node memory capacity, input voltage, and the communication technology
    used in the node. Furthermore, the technical complexities present in developing
    customized sensor interfacing may also discourage researchers from using commercial
    systems. The custom build hardware platforms have high levels of customization
    but require extensive knowledge of embedded system development to design them.
    DIY platforms are IoT nodes designed based on commercially available development
    platforms, including Arduino, EasyPIC v7, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Wapmote. DIY
    development board based IoT systems are popular among researchers because of their
    low cost, high availability, compatibility, and easy programmability. The percentage
    of different hardware platforms used in the reviewed articles is given in Fig.
    4. There were 52 identifiable hardware designs in the list of 115 research. Out
    of them, 29% of the platforms had Arduino only, 8% had Arduino and Raspberry Pi
    hardware jointly, and 2% used Arduino and Arducam hardware together. Ag-IoT research
    was dominated by Arduino-based development systems. Availability, reliability,
    easy programmability, and the option of supporting multiple communication protocols
    made Arduino-based systems popular among Ag-IoT researchers. Raspberry Pi systems
    were demonstrated in 12% of the IoT systems, likely due to their capability of
    capturing images and high computing power compared to Arduino. Selection of the
    IoT platform and the main control board is an important activity in IoT system
    design. The mainboard must support the communication protocols and the power requirement
    (e.g., voltage) of the sensors and actuators. Often voltage and communications
    protocol converters are needed to interface sensors with the main control board.
    Mainboards support three types of digital memories. Volatile memory holds the
    instructions and data of the currently running program until the power is on.
    Volatile memory influences the system''s performance. A larger volatile memory
    is needed for IoT nodes with a large amount of data generated via sensors like
    RGB cameras or spectral sensors. Nonvolatile memory stores data and the program
    when the IoT node power is turned off. The operating system, device identification
    data, and system settings are common data types stored in the nonvolatile memory.
    External nonvolatile memory (e.g., SD cards) can be used to store data or system
    settings, greatly expanding the data storage capability of the Ag-IoT system.
    3.3. Communication technologies and IoT protocols Section 3.3 produces the answers
    to research questions 4 and 5 in Table 1 while discussing findings on the literature
    related to wireless communication technology and IoT protocols. 3.3.1. Wireless
    communication technology Wireless data transmission is a key function of an IoT
    system. To design a successful Ag-IoT system, it is essential to understand the
    radio frequency (RF) contributing factors that impact signal strength, interference,
    system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Also, understanding of pros and
    cons of wireless communication technologies is essential for a better Ag-IoT device
    selection. Received power (Pr) of wireless data transmission in an unobstructed
    line of sight in a radio signal-free area depends on the transmitter power (Pt),
    transmitter and receiver antenna gains (GTX, GRX), the distance between the transmitter
    and the receiver (R), and the wavelength (λ) of the radio. This relationship is
    expressed in Eq. 1. Therefore, long wavelength radio signals such as LoRa in 900
    MHz are suitable for long-distance data transmission compared to short wavelength
    signals such as Wi-Fi operated in 2.4–3.2 GHz without changing other variables.
    For long-distance communication, the plane earth loss formula is used to account
    for the curvature of Earth for signal strength (Nadir et al., 2008). Equation
    1 Friis transmission equation (Shaw, 2013). Furthermore, radio signals are subject
    to reflection, diffraction, and scattering. These phenomena are illustrated in
    Fig. 5. In open flat agricultural fields, reflection, scattering, and diffraction
    may not occur unless there are large agricultural structures. In hilly areas and
    forests, the effects of wireless signal propagation properties may need special
    attention when placing IoT devices. The Fresnel Zone is the area around the visual
    line-of-sight that radio waves propagate out once they leave the antenna. Blockage
    of Fresnel Zone >40% causes severe signal losses (Tate et al., 2008). Therefore,
    factors such as the height and density of the crop canopies nearby, the presence
    of agricultural structures (e.g., irrigation pivots and storage silos), the locations
    to place IoT nodes, and the antenna height and position are important to account
    for in ensuring the signal transmission quality. In fact, the research on wireless
    communications in rural and agricultural landscapes has raised a lot of interest
    recently (Vuran et al., 2022). The signal quality is also affected by channel
    noise, interference, multipath fading, and attenuation. The success of data transmission
    is measured by a parameter called bit rate error (BRE). Based on the above discussion
    we would like to suggest that it is important to use wireless signal strength
    mapping tools during IoT system installations. Such tools will help to select
    the optimum IoT communication technology (for example, Wi-Fi, LoRa, Mobile Communication)
    suitable for each case, accounting for data transmission rates and signal losses.
    This practice would help farmers to reduce the capital and operational costs involved
    with IoT systems. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download

    In the literature, we found that a wide variety of wireless communication technologies
    were used by the researchers. Out of the 35 studies where communication technology
    was clearly mentioned, 34% used Wi-Fi, 17% were conducted using LoRa, and 14%
    used Zigbee. Also 11% of the studies used ethernet or the wired internet connection.
    Less attention was received for mobile communication technologies such as 4G (3%),
    NB-IoT (3%), and GSM (3%). In some cases, researchers used two or more technologies
    to connect different areas in the fields such as LoRa / Wi-Fi, LoRa / TV white
    space (TVWS), and GSM / Zigbee. According to the findings, Wi-Fi and ethernet
    were common in greenhouses while others were favored in outdoor farming practices.

    Fig. 6. Communication technologies in Ag-IoT applications. 3.3.2. IoT protocols
    IoT protocols are data transmission standards that allow communication between
    the endpoint and services with the internet being the common network. IoT protocols
    are broadly classified into two major groups: IoT data protocols and IoT network
    protocols. The data protocols correspond to the application layer whereas network
    protocols correspond to the perception and network layer in the standard IoT architecture
    (Fig. 1). IoT network protocols create networks of device connections. Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and Bluetooth are such network protocols, and the same term is
    used to represent wireless communication technology. Some common IoT protocols
    are listed in Table 3 with specifications such as frequency, data rate, and range
    (Triantafyllou et al., 2018; Farooq et al., 2019). Table 3. Common IoT Network

    and privacy protection, easy to install and connect, faster data transfers Each
    IoT network protocol/wireless communication technology has its advantages (Table
    3). Bluetooth is a popular short-range wireless communication technology standard
    convenient to create personal area networks. It is possible to use Bluetooth in
    indoor applications such as mobile phone-connected soil water sensors and sensor
    networking in small greenhouses. ZigBee is useful in large indoor growing spaces
    and LoRa is suitable for field crop monitoring senor networks. Cellular technology
    is useful for indoor or outdoor spaces where the network coverage is available.
    Wi-Fi is suitable for both small or large indoor spaces as well as outdoor applications
    where there is infrastructure support available to setup Wi-Fi gateways. Cellular
    and Wi-Fi allow transmitting images, videos, and other larger data files such
    as 3D point cloud data. Bluetooth shares the same advantage but is limited to
    a short distance. Compared to LoRa, Zigbee, and cellular technology, Wi-Fi has
    high reliability in data transmission, but power consumption is high too. All
    these protocols were tested in real crop growing environments (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016; Codeluppi et al., 2020). 3.4. Cloud platforms and service models
    3.4.1. Cloud platforms Cloud is an essential part of any IoT system. IoT devices
    are not useful without cloud connectivity. Data gathered via individual IoT sensors
    become useful when connected with other relevant sensors. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling
    ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
    computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
    that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
    service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance, 2011). Essential expected characteristics
    of a cloud system are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,
    rapid elasticity, and measured service. Out of the 115 papers we reviewed, only
    25 papers discussed cloud platforms in detail. Among them, 28% of the researchers
    used the ThingSpeak cloud platform developed by MATLAB as the service provider,
    12% used Microsoft Azure, and 12% used Ubidots platform. Furthermore, 12% of the
    researchers built themselves a local data server with the required functionality.
    Google-based Firebase had 8% usage. Other cloud platform service providers including
    Amazon Web Services, cloud sense, generic cloud, sensorDB, SEnviro, and Huawei
    Cloud had 4% use each. The percentage distribution of these cloud platforms is
    given in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Statistics of cloud service provider selection. 3.4.2.
    Public, private, and hybrid cloud In terms of privacy policies, cloud platforms
    can be divided into three major models: 3.4.2.1. Public cloud Services are offered
    over the public internet and available to anyone who needs to purchase them. Third-party
    cloud service providers own and operate the cloud resources such as servers and
    storage in the public cloud model. Users do not need to spend any capital expenditures
    to scale up; applications can be quickly provisioned and terminated; and users
    pay only for what they use. These are the advantages of the public cloud. Amazon
    Web Services and Microsoft Azure are examples of public cloud services. 3.4.2.2.
    Private cloud A private cloud comprises computing resources used exclusively by
    users from one business or organization therefore hardware must be purchased for
    start-up and maintenance is required. In the private cloud model, infrastructure
    is not shared with users outside the organization. A private cloud can be physically
    placed at a data center owned by the user organization, or it can be hosted by
    a third-party service provider. But the organization has complete control over
    resources and security. 3.4.2.3. Hybrid cloud A hybrid cloud is a computing environment
    that combines a public and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to
    be shared between them. The organizations determine where to run their applications
    while they control security, compliance, or legal requirements. Some organizations
    use a hybrid cloud model to keep sensitive data in the private cloud whereas frontal
    services and web portals are serviced in the public cloud for scalability. Furthermore,
    the public cloud can act as a supporting system if the data and usage exceeds
    the capacity of the private cloud. 3.4.3. Cloud service model Cloud-based services
    provided to the users can be categorized into three major classes based on the
    hierarchy of the service offered. Typical cloud architecture has nine layers.
    They are from bottom to top in order: network, storage, server, virtualization,
    operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. The next section
    will explain cloud service models in detail with hardware and software layers
    they belong. 3.4.3.1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) IaaS was the original
    cloud services model. For IaaS, the cloud service provider will provide the hardware
    and keep it up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration
    are up to the client. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational
    in Microsoft datacenters. The main advantage of the IaaS model is the rapid deployment
    of new computing devices. DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure are some
    examples of IaaS. 3.4.3.2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) In this cloud service
    model, the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources,
    and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
    For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers
    can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical
    hardware and software requirements. 3.4.3.3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) In the
    case of SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment,
    such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.
    The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by
    the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working
    version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. 3.4.3.4. Network-as-a-Service
    (NaaS) Software-defined networking and software-defined perimeters are services
    that belonged to NaaS. NaaS is a cloud model that enables organizations to easily
    operate the network and achieve the outcomes they expect without owning, building,
    or maintaining their infrastructure through the cloud. NaaS can replace hardware-centric
    VPNs, load balancers, firewall appliances, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    connections. Users can scale up and scale down as demand changes, rapidly deploy
    services, and eliminate hardware costs. 3.4.4. Fog and edge computing Edge computing
    is the moving of data processing close to where the data is generated. Wireless
    communication-enabled sensors with microcontrollers can be considered edge computing
    devices. The introduction of the edge computing paradigm was due to issues related
    to centralized cloud computing architecture. Data and control signal transmission
    latency and delays in centralized system data analytics are some disadvantages
    of cloud computing. Therefore, network designers proposed architectures where
    the computing power is distributed more evenly around the network. Fog and edge
    computing push the processing capability out to the edge of the network, closer
    to the source of the data. Such techniques are called fog computing and edge computing.
    Fog computing is a computing layer between the cloud and the edge where edge devices
    send large amounts of data to the cloud. The fog computing layer can get the data
    from the edge layer before it reaches the cloud and filter what is relevant and
    what is not. The filtered data gets stored in the cloud, while the unrelated data
    can be deleted, or analyzed at the fog layer for remote access or to use in localized
    learning models. Precision herbicide applications become popular with field crops.
    There, a moving platform that has a camera, carries and applies the herbicide
    at the exact location of the emerging weed. The image processing hardware and
    software in the moving platform do the image processing instantaneously to reduce
    the delay of cloud-based image processing in larger fields (Coleman et al., 2022).
    The centralized cloud-only needs the weed density from the moving IoT platform
    to forecast the future herbicide need to maintain the required quantity in the
    stocks. Therefore, edge computing is all about placing computing power on the
    very edge of the network, on the actual sensors of the device. Low power consumption
    and low processing power microchips or micro-controllers embedded in the devices
    provide the power for edge computing. For that reason, their processing capacity
    is much more limited but sometimes can be adequate to process images (Chamara
    et al., 2021). 3.4.5. Data analytics in IoT Data analytics is one of the most
    important activities in any IoT system, as the decision-making of an IoT system
    depends on hundreds of sensors and events, which is difficult to analyze manually.
    Data generated by IoT devices fall under three categories. They are structured
    data (such as SQL storage), unstructured data (e.g., images and videos), and semi-structured
    data (like social media feeds). Ag-IoT systems can generate both structured and
    unstructured data (Lea, 2020). Stream processing and batch processing are the
    two main types of data processing techniques. Stream processing is useful for
    mobile Ag-IoT platforms since it allows real-time data processing. Batch processing
    can be applied in irrigation, chemigation, and fertigation applications as data
    are processed as a batch to make the decision. Common data analytics activities
    for IoT platforms are listed in Table 4. Below are some examples how they are
    used in Ag-IoT for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. Alerting allows growers
    to receive an alert message when soil water use exceeds the maximum allowable
    depletion (Gamon et al., 2015). Sensors in the field environment are susceptible
    to problems like physical damage, pest attack, misalignment, and breakdown, which
    cause errors in data streams. These problems can be effectively alleviated by
    error finding. Using time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    or Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to determine the next irrigation or fertigation
    time belongs to trend analysis. Triggering sprinklers in a field based on SWC
    sensor values is an example of signaling. More complex decisions can be formed
    by combining several analytical activities. For example, in automated crop disease
    detection, an average daily temperature above 20 to 25 °C followed by 1–2 in.
    of rain, together with sugar beet leaf color change indicated a sugar beet pathogen
    outbreak (Wolf and Verreet, 2002). This analysis was enabled by data joining,
    tracking, and trend analysis. Table 4. Data analysis activities commonly found
    in Ag-IoT applications. Data analysis activity Function Preprocessing Filter out
    data with little interest to reduce data complexity and duplication Alerting Raise
    an alert if data exceed certain boundary condition Windowing Apply rules on data
    in a predefined time window Joining Combine multiple data streams into a new single
    data stream Error finding Find missing values and anomalies in data streams Tracking
    Identify when or where an event has occurred Trend analysis Quantify change or
    trend of data as a function of time Signaling Send control signal when a decision
    is made 3.5. Power and energy management Power and energy storage are the two
    major driving forces for IoT systems, especially for Ag-IoT located in remote
    fields. In the literature, we found 3 main categories of power management systems.
    Direct main power connected nodes is the first type and most common with indoor
    applications. A rechargeable battery with a recharging option such as solar, hydro,
    or wind is the second option. The third one has a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable
    battery but is designed to consume very low power by sending a very low amount
    of data intermittently. Among the 115 pieces of research we have reviewed, only
    27 of them discussed the IoT system power and energy storage features. Out of
    these 27, 11 platforms used solar power as the main power supply while Lithium
    Polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries were used as the energy storage solution.
    Out of 11 indoor farming applications which explained the power management options,
    9 used the main grid power supply. Research that focused on IoT system setup under
    high dense canopies used high power density and high-capacity battery-only solutions
    such as 12 V lead-acid batteries. Two studies mentioned they used battery with
    solar but did not disclose details about the specifications. It revealed that
    there are very limited power supplies available for in-field IoT implementation
    and the findings are highlighted in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image
    (158KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Power supply and energy storage
    selection of the Ag-IoT systems in the reviewed studies. Unlike edge-computing
    devices, typical IoT end nodes are designed to be less power-hungry. This power
    consumption goes high due to certain reasons such as connected high throughput
    sensors, significant data processing, and massive data transmission. However,
    these power consumptions can be minimized by exploiting different techniques such
    as the semi-active phase and sleep phase (Zhang and Li, 2019). The edge computing-enabled
    devices need more power. It is essential to standardize the IoT power management
    based on the crop and geographical location of the devices. For example, solar
    power is not a very promising solution for locations with large trees such as
    rubber, pepper, and spices that have a dense crop canopy 5–10 m above the ground
    (Villalba et al., 2017). 3.6. Actuators Monitoring and controlling are two agricultural
    operations closely related to each other. Monitoring by itself is an open-loop
    operation; whereas monitoring, controlling, and again monitoring the effects of
    controlling make a system closed loop and can improve the efficiency of the system.
    Efficient controlling of the actuators based on the monitoring is a key feature
    in the agricultural domain for optimizing inputs, maximizing crop yield and quality,
    and reducing the negative environmental impacts. Fig. 9 depicts the number of
    actuators controlled via IoT systems that were reported in our reviewed papers.
    Out of the 115 studies, 54 mentioned IoT-enabled actuation. Some studies used
    more than one actuator, whereas most of the in-field IoT sensor monitoring systems
    did not mention the use of actuators. Download : Download high-res image (130KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Count of actuators controlled via
    IoT systems found in the reviewed papers. Since water is the largest input by
    volume applied to farms, actuators related to water have been mostly discussed
    in the research work. Such controllers are pumps and solenoid valves. Controlling
    these two actuators were demonstrated in 22 and 8 instances, respectively. After
    irrigation, controlling lighting was the most occurred application in indoor farming
    followed by ventilation, fertigation, alert, and air conditioning. Ventilation
    allows outdoor air to come inside the greenhouse while air conditioning includes
    heating or cooling of the air. Alert meant the system sent an email or message
    to the farmer or the operator of the farm when a parameter exceeded a threshold
    value. An IoT-controlled insect repellent actuator was demonstrated twice among
    the 115 case studies evaluated. Automation of soil bed preparation was achieved
    by utilizing stepper motors in one instance of IoT-based indoor farming. According
    to Figure 9, water pumps and valves were the most frequently used actuators, and
    all these systems were closed loop control systems with soil moisture sensors
    and ET modeling. From the study of the above actuator-related research, it can
    be said that there is enormous potential to automate the controlling of the indoor
    crop''s required environment and soil preparation. (See Fig. 9.) 3.7. Ag-IoT for
    crop monitoring Out of the 115 publications reviewed, 71 systems were demonstrated
    in a real environment. Among them, 65% were implemented in the fields, 24% were
    demonstrated in indoor environments, and 11% were simulations. This is an interesting
    finding that reveals the huge potential of implementing outdoor or in-field IoT
    applications. Typically, it is easy to set up indoor IoT sensor networks due to
    fewer technological barriers, such as extreme environmental conditions and sensor
    connectivity issues. Since real applications were available only in 65% (71 out
    of 115) instances, further real implementations can be done to demonstrate the
    capability of Ag-IoT applications. Considering the 71 systems that demonstrated
    the real applications, 49 were practically demonstrated with certain types of
    crops and 22 did not mention the specific crop they used. 15% of these systems
    were demonstrated with grapes while cereal crops accounted for 26%. One research
    was based on both grapes and oranges. In total 50% of the IoT studies focused
    on perennial specialty crops of higher value including grape, moringa, orange,
    citrus, sugarcane, silver maple, apricot, cashew, and olive (Fig. 10). This result
    indicates that IoT can be implemented with diverse crop types to achieve various
    purposes. Ag-IoT systems are easy to set up on perennial croplands as there is
    less soil preparation for the IoT system installation. It is important to develop
    techniques that allow easy IoT implementation to the annual crops as they contribute
    more to global food security. It is also worth to note only one research demonstrated
    the economic viability of IoT implementation (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, future
    research to assess and understand the economic viability of IoT applications in
    various situations is needed. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download

    crop types. 4. Challenges of Ag-IoT systems and potential solutions Ag-IoT faces
    challenges that are unique compared with IoT applications in other industries.
    In this section, we briefly discuss those challenges that are of utmost importance
    for Ag-IoT system researchers and developers. Ag-IoT challenges can be mainly
    classified into three sections: technical challenges, sectoral challenges, and
    business challenges (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.1. Technical challenges Limitations
    of the advancement of technology are the reasons for technical challenges. They
    would likely be effectively addressed as tools and technologies advance with time.
    The Ag-IoT technical challenges are discussed under the three layers of the IoT
    architecture (Fig. 1), namely, perception layer issues, network layer issues,
    and application layer issues. 4.1.1. Perception layer issues Ag-IoT systems''
    perception layer faces unique challenges, because of the requirements it needs
    to meet during crop and environmental monitoring in harsh environments (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Agricultural lands have limited electricity and communication infrastructure.
    It is not practical or cost-effective to use wired power and communication media
    to connect IoT nodes in the field. Therefore, power management, device longevity,
    and ergonomic design are major challenges related to the Ag-IoT perception layer.
    Power management includes Ag-IoT node-level power generation, strategies to reduce
    power consumption, and energy storage. Section 3.5 Power and Energy Management
    revealed that most of the researchers were interested in solar with rechargeable
    batteries as the power source in agriculture. However, there is a challenge to
    introduce suitable power sources for the Ag-IoT systems under the tall and dense
    crop canopy. Micro wind turbines have the potential as an Ag-IoT power source
    but receive less attention in the literature (Jawad et al., 2017). Continuous
    improvements have been made to rechargeable batteries due to the demand for high
    energy to weight ratio batteries. There are several approaches available to reduce
    power consumption. One approach is to select sensors, actuators, and wireless
    protocols with low energy consumption. Selection of a node duty cycle that turns
    the sensor or actuator on when it reads, sends, or receives signals is another
    viable approach (Estrada-Lopez et al., 2018). Harsh environmental conditions such
    as wind and rainfall, continuous high solar radiation, sub-zero temperatures in
    winter, chemicals commonly used in agriculture, and animal attacks make it difficult
    to keep Ag-IoT nodes in the field in operable conditions for a long time (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Sensors, cables, and enclosures should be designed to withstand
    such conditions. Standards are available to follow in most cases, but the cost
    becomes high when required standards need to be escalated. Analog signals (Analogue
    voltage or current), Inter-Integrated Circuits (I2C), Serial Data Interface at
    1200 baud rate (SDI-12), and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
    are the common sensor to microcontroller data transmission techniques. The microcontroller
    development boards and commercial IoT platforms are designed to work with different
    voltage levels, such as 3.3 V, 5 V, 7 V, and 12 V. These different communication
    protocols and operation voltages have created barriers to the interoperability
    of the devices in Ag-IoT implementation. Research and development to standardize
    data communication and power supply in Ag-IoT systems would substantially increase
    the scalability, upgradability, and interoperability in the perception layer.
    Improving ergonomic design and reducing the labor intensiveness for deploying
    Ag-IoT systems in the field are urgently needed. IoT-based soil water content
    monitoring is a good example to show this issue. Often soil sensors are buried
    underground for continuous measurements during a season. These sensor nodes also
    have an aboveground section to allow wireless communication, which could interfere
    with farm operations such as tillage, fertilizer application, and chemical spraying,
    and should be closely monitored. For annual crops, the need to remove the sensors
    when crops are harvested and reinstall them in the next season represents a significant
    logistic issue for using them effectively. Research on underground wireless communication
    technology (Akyildiz et al., 2009) and Internet of Underground Things (Vuran et
    al., 2018) is ongoing, bearing the promise to alleviate this challenge associated
    with Ag-IoT node installation and maintenance. No standards are currently available
    on Ag-IoT installation as agricultural fields and practices are highly heterogeneous.
    Novel solutions are necessary to encourage Ag-IoT users. 4.1.2. Network layer
    issues The most common Ag-IoT network layer issues are internet coverage, standard
    interception, interference, propagation losses, communication range, wireless
    link quality, network expansion, network management, communication protocols,
    latency, and throughput. As most farms are in rural areas, remote locations, or
    mountain regions, it is a huge challenge to get internet connectivity to them
    since these underpopulated areas have limited internet infrastructure. One solution
    could be creating a local network, a concept similar to a hybrid cloud. This type
    of system does not connect to the internet but still allows local servers to perform
    the basic IoT functionality (Akyildiz et al., 2009). Due to the recent advancement
    in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it would soon be possible to have internet
    connectivity via satellite as illustrated in Fig. 11 on a commercial scale (Ivanova
    et al., 2016). Therefore, we anticipate that, in the future, many agricultural
    fields will rely on satellite-based connectivity to connect their gateways to
    the internet. This system consists of a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) type
    ground antenna which is connected to the nodes through multiple gateways. Gateways
    can follow different communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, or Zigbee.
    One disadvantage of satellite-based internet connectivity is that it needs a clear
    sky to make a successful connection. Therefore, it is logical to have a local
    server for data storage and decision-making when the connection is interrupted.

    Fig. 11. Future Ag-IoT system with satellite connected internet. Standard interception
    refers to difficulties in using the full potential of a communication technology
    due to standards imposed by regulatory authorities to limit the use. Recent advancements
    on long-range low throughput communication technologies such as LoRa become widely
    known communication protocols in Ag-IoT. To promote fair use of LoRa bandwidth,
    governments can regulate the use of wireless frequencies. For example, in Europe,
    the duty cycle or the transmitter uptime of the LoRa node is between 0.1% to 10%.
    This is a challenge in most Ag-IoT applications as there are higher volumes of
    data to transmit and many sensors and actuators to connect. When many IoT nodes
    are deployed, the interference may occur because the data transmission could use
    the same frequency, especially in unlicensed spectrums, such as ZigBee, Sigfox,
    LoRa, and Wi-Fi. Signal interference causes data loss and reduces the reliability
    of the systems (Elijah et al., 2018). Wireless signal propagation strength, communication
    range, and wireless link quality depend on the humidity, temperature, crop growth
    status, and crop morphological characteristics in agriculture fields (Tzounis
    et al., 2017; Cama-Pinto et al., 2019; Vuran et al., 2022). Thus, wireless signal
    propagation strength simulation and visualization software are essential in the
    future for the mass installation of Ag-IoT sensor nodes. Such software will reduce
    the complexity of node placement issues. 4.1.3. Application layer issues Data
    security, data privacy, and data analysis are application layer issues. Ag-IoT
    data is important for a country''s food security as well as for the Ag business
    model security. In the modern competitive world, data breaching could lead to
    a competitive disadvantage on Ag-business model over a competitor as well as risk
    the food security of a country. Therefore, more focus should be put into improving
    the security and privacy of data generated via Ag-IoT systems. 4.2. Sectoral challenges
    4.2.1. Regulatory issues Data ownership creates another business challenge. Companies
    that provide Ag-IoT services can use the data for improvements in their systems,
    but farmers do not receive compensation for that. There is a challenge to implement
    such a system to prevent data monopoly (Misra et al., 2020). Therefore, regulation
    and legal frameworks about the control and rights of data between farmers and
    IoT companies need to be established (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.2.2. Interoperability
    issue According to Elijah et al. (2018), interoperability involves the ability
    to have technical, synthetic, semantic, and organization interoperability. Technical
    interoperability involves the effortless communication among IoT devices using
    protocols. Data interchanging between systems is semantic interoperability. Synthetic
    interoperability deals with IoT system-generated digital data exchange with humans,
    while organization interoperability involves information sharing among different
    regions, infrastructures, and cultures (Elijah et al., 2018). Here we would like
    to introduce a challenge associated with Ag-IoT system interoperability. As most
    of the farmers have crop rotations and multi-cropping systems, it is essential
    to have Ag-IoT systems with context awareness that allows them to work with different
    cropping systems. The heterogeneity of agricultural systems imposes the system
    interoperability challenge. 4.2.3. Business issues The cost and non-availability
    of skilled personnel in Ag-IoT is a business issue. Cost is a challenge for Ag-IoT
    implementation. There are three types of costs involved with Ag-IoT systems: the
    setup cost or the capital expenditure, running cost or operational cost, and upgrading
    cost. Due to the nature of IoT business models and being a relatively new technology,
    analysis on return on investment of Ag-IoT systems is not yet discussed considerably
    in the literature. Chen et al. (2019) highlighted that application of IoT systems
    on irrigation controlling in turmeric turned out to be profitable. Several factors
    increase capital expenditure. Remote and harsh environmental conditions that Ag-IoT
    systems must bear increase the production cost of Ag-IoT systems. Ag-IoT end nodes
    require materials that do not wear and tear due to sun, rain, and chemicals applied
    during crop cultivation. Communication cost is usually a standard rate, but the
    initial investment is required to set up the internet connection, and this cost
    depends on the infrastructure availability where the farms are located. Theoretical
    knowledge and practical experience about the sensing/actuating system and parameters
    of interest are essential to set up a successful Ag-IoT system. Sensor data interpreters
    need an overall understanding of the agroecological principles to reach a decision
    (Duff et al., 2022). Reluctance to use new technology and unskilled manpower are
    apparent obstacles to implementing Ag-IoT in commercial production crop monitoring
    systems. More extension programs are needed to solve this issue while standards
    are necessary for Ag-IoT system development to improve the common Ag-IoT platforms
    that have interoperable qualities. 5. Supporting technologies 5.1. Augmented reality
    and IoT applications Data visualization and real-time decision-making are important
    to IoT. Based on past literature this sector is the least explored area. Wearable
    augmentation devices improve crop monitoring and control. Smart glasses have the
    real-time data visualization capability to indicate the status of crops, soil,
    or environment (Hurst et al., 2021). An irrigation activity can be controlled
    manually by a farmer if he can visualize the real-time soil water content change
    in the field. The conditions within a greenhouse can be controlled in real-time
    and actuators can be controlled via voice command through a smart glass. Harvesting
    can be more enjoyable and more efficient (lower loss) based on image processing
    capable smart glasses. Vegetable or fruit pickers can be assisted through a smart
    glass by viewing what it detects in the fruit to decide whether to pick it or
    not. Untrained labor usage-related losses can be reduced by augmented reality
    related training. 5.2. Big data Big data generated by Ag-IoT are mostly of heterogeneous
    types. The most common IoT agricultural big data are machine-generated data (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). These data are generated from a massive number of sensors and smart
    machines used to measure and record farming processes; which are in turn boosted
    by the IoT. Machine-generated data range from simple sensor records to complex
    computer logs. Big data in agriculture are generated mostly when we introduce
    smart sensing and monitoring with the help of IoT. The main sources of big data
    in Ag-IoT are: sensors, robotics, open data, data captured by airborne sensors
    (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014; Cole et al., 2012), weather/climate data, yield data,
    soil types, agricultural census data (Chen et al., 2014) and so on. Typically,
    telemetry data is generated by sensors such as temperature, rotary, or linear
    encoder. These data are well-structured in contrast to imagery data which need
    post-processing. Such unstructured data have issues in terms of availability,
    quality, and formats (Liu et al., 2015) and can be a concern. As the number of
    sensors is increasing and data volumes are growing rapidly, it is becoming a matter
    of utmost importance to store and process big data. Some approaches to handle
    big data are data shrinking, scale up, scale out, and high-performance computing.
    Data shrinking is the process of throwing away some less important data and still
    being able to reconstruct the original data. Scale-up (vertical scalability) is
    adding additional storage and RAM to store and process the big data in the processing
    node. But this technique has its capacity limit. Scale out (horizontal scalability)
    is the concept of using parallel computers to store and process that big data.
    High-Performance Computing is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to handle
    big data, where computers with multiple cores are grouped to create an efficient
    network to deal with the big data. These techniques are essential for successful
    data handling in Ag-IoT. 5.3. Artificial intelligence in Ag-IoT Techniques that
    enable machines to mimic human behavior are artificial intelligence (AI), while
    a subset of AI that gives machines the ability of learning without being explicitly
    programmed is machine learning. Deep learning techniques are a subset of machine
    learning techniques with multilayer neural network feasibility. The data generated
    from the Ag-IoTs are often used to train machine learning models for specific
    agricultural use cases such as yield forecast, crop stress detection, and pest
    spreading prediction. To be more specific, for the agricultural IoT applications,
    raw sensing information such as field and weather conditions and crop status can
    be collected and used for model training locally or in the remote end that has
    more computational resources. These trained models can later be used to control
    actuators for variable rate irrigation and site-specific pesticide/ herbicide
    applications. Deep learning techniques are heavily used with image processing
    applications in agriculture. Trained deep learning models are available for crop
    type detection (de Filho et al., 2020), plant phenotyping (Pound et al., 2017),
    fruit (Patel et al., 2011), flower (Dias et al., 2018), and leaf detection (Chamara
    et al., 2021), and weed detection for herbicide applications (Coleman et al.,
    2022). AI becomes an integral part of IoT due to its capability of using it as
    a data analytics tool. 6. Ag-IoT for farming systems analyses and management In
    this section, we briefly discuss and envision how Ag-IoT would benefit and potentially
    transform farming systems analyses and management, enabled by its unprecedented
    data, analytics, and connected sensors and actuators. Perhaps the most obvious
    advantages of Ag-IoT come from the high spatiotemporal resolution of farm-level
    data it generates concerning crops, soil, and microclimate (Kagan et al., 2022).
    The high spatial resolution data would quantify the the spatial variability of
    crop parameters (such as yield and leaf area index) and soil parameters (such
    as pH, organic matter, and water holding capacility), and elucidate the relationships
    between them to identify yield-limiting factors at different parts of the field
    (Alfred et al., 2021). This is the underlying principle of site-specific crop
    management, which will be greatly enhanced through Ag-IoT. Modern Ag-IoTs take
    measurements at hourly and sub-hourly intervals. This high temporal resolution
    data allow us to observe the crop responses to environmental cues at finer time
    steps, and enhance our understanding on how basic plant physiological processes
    such as transpiration and photosynthesis vary due to short-term environmental
    fluctuations. Process-based crop and soil models, which are widely used to evaluate
    the economic and environmental consequences of farming practices, usually suffer
    from the lack of site-specific data to parameterize and calibrate them, especially
    the in-season crop data and soil data. These data are exactly what Ag-IoT sensors
    are good at generating, and therefore would improve the accuracy of these models
    for farm-level management assessment. Networked sensors and actuators of Ag-IoT,
    along with the real-time data processing, transmission, and modeling, would greatly
    improve the decision-making cycle of farm-level management practices (Chaterji
    et al., 2021). The traditional crop management decision-making has several limitations.
    First, the decision is usually based on a single set of data, because other datasets
    are unavailable or expensive to obtain. Second, there is usually long latency
    between data generation and decision-making (e.g., several days or weeks). This
    long latency is in contrast to the fact that many stresses in the field (such
    as pest outbreak) occur and develop quickly and need real-time intervention to
    prevent substantial loss. Thirdly, the present management practice only addresses
    one factor at a time whereas in reality crops can undergo multiple stresses simultaneously.
    Altogether, these limitations reflect our inability to capture the complexity
    of the farming system. Ag-IoT has the potential to transform farm-level decision-making
    by enabling multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategies, powered by real-time
    data processing and relevant models run in the cloud to shorten the latency. For
    example, crop, soil, and microclimate sensors can simultaneously measure the crop
    water and nitrogen status, soil moisture content and nitrate content, and weather
    variables. These multi-source inputs can be fed into the models to output two
    variables: a nitrogen sufficiency index and a water sufficiency index. These two
    variables can further be converted to a nitrogen and water application rate for
    site-specific fertigation. This paradigm has several advantages. First, it is
    a multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategy that accounts for the interaction
    between the water and nitrogen stresses. Second, it reduces the cost of implementation
    and shortens the management cycle because two actions are combined into one (one
    pass of field equipment instead of two). In a similar fashion, decisions such
    as pesticide applications and other chemicals (fungicides, growth regulators)
    could potentially be further stacked to make crop production more efficient. Traditionally,
    farm system analyses and management happen at the individual farm level (Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2019). In other words, data are usually not shared or co-analyzed
    across the farm boundary. In the era of Ag-IoT where farm data are shared and
    stored in the cloud, there represents an opportunity where the analysis and modeling
    of Ag-IoT data can cover a group of farms or at a regional scale. These regional
    analyses would answer other important questions such as regional yield forecasting,
    pest tracking, or agricultural resource prioritization. These questions are not
    necessarily important for individual growers, but are at the heart of other stakeholders
    such as policy makers and input suppliers. Data ownership and privacy, covered
    in Section 4, are two big issues that should be resolved before this type of analysis
    may occur. 7. Conclusions and future directions 7.1. Conclusions Ag-IoT is a promising
    technology that would increase resource use efficiency in agricultural systems,
    and is an essential tool for digital agriculture transformation. In this paper,
    we have overviewed impactful research related to Ag-IoT in the past decade. The
    data collected from these papers were categorized and analyzed under six main
    Ag-IoT system design parameters namely sensors, sensing platforms and main control
    board, communication technology and IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and
    energy management, and actuators. According to the analyzed data, it is revealed
    that there is an increased global attention towards the Ag-IoT system-related
    research in the recent years. However, there are certain research gaps found in
    the literature. One of them is that the implementations of the sensors and the
    actuators seem to be limited to soil and environmental parameter monitoring and
    irrigation controlling. Furthermore, crop macro and micronutrient demand analyses
    are still at the infant stage due to the non-availability of sensors that can
    measure nutrients in real-time. Therefore, it is essential to improve the sensor
    and actuator applications in crop monitoring and controlling. In addition, heterogeneity
    of the system parameters (such as data, platforms, required power) is a major
    challenge to the Ag-IoT systems implementation, to which the improvement of the
    context-awareness could be a solution. Power harness options for Ag-IoT nodes
    need more exploration as there are limited options available and it would be a
    big advantage for the perennial crop monitoring. The perception and the network
    layers of Ag-IoT systems require more improvements to meet the sensor implementation
    ergonomics and long-range high-throughput data transmission, respectively. Edge
    computing can be a replacement of the high throughput long-range communication,
    but to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of practical applications
    have been developed based on edge computing to date. Mobile Ag-IoT platforms such
    as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have a huge potential to increase the spatiotemporal
    resolution in Ag-IoT-based monitoring and controlling. 7.2. Future directions
    From the finding of this review, authors would like to highlight some important
    future requirements for Ag-IoT. The entire Ag-IoT research community needs to
    propose a complete system design for Ag-IoT that will be viable, open, and interpretable.
    The objective is to enable the interconnectivity of heterogeneous systems and
    sharing resources to obtain more detailed and specific agricultural data. Furthermore,
    in the future research work, there is a need to develop complete information perception
    standards and design multi-protocol compatible gateways. With some significant
    efforts in the above-mentioned future research directions, the entire research
    community will be able to solve the problems of inconsistent device interfaces
    and protocols, making the system faster, robust, and more convenient. Making full
    use of long-range low throughput communication technology, virtual reality/augmented
    reality, and big data/AI for Ag-IoT is yet to be thoroughly explored. Declaration

    Notes Abstract Water crises due to climate change, high population growth and
    increasing demands from industry and agriculture claim for increasing efficiency
    and universalizing water resources management strategies and techniques. Water
    monitoring helps providing necessary evidences for making sound decisions about
    managing water resources both now and in the future. In this work, a low cost
    and “do it yourself” communication device is proposed to record water production
    and energy consumption of electric pumpings from deep boreholes/wells, and to
    predict the impact of the ongoing and previous pumpings in the evolution of the
    water level in the aquifer. The proposal incorporates an edge-computing approach
    for the simulation of the aquifer response in real-time. Computation of results
    of interest is performed at the sensor, minimizing communication requirements
    and ensuring almost immediate results. An approximated solution to physically
    based modeling of aquifer response is computed thanks to the a priori expression
    of the water level time evolution in a reduced basis. The accuracy is enough to
    detect deviations from expected behaviour. The energy consumption of the device
    is very much reduced with respect to that of a full modelling, which can be computed
    off-line for calibrating reduced model parameters and perform detailed analyses.
    The device is tested in a real scenario, in a mountain subbasin of the Ebro river

    Keywords: groundwater monitoring; low-cost device; do-it-yourself device; LoRa
    communication; Raspberry Pi 1. Introduction The United Nations has proposed 17
    actions known as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for reducing poverty, protecting
    the planet and ensuring peace and prosperity for the entire world by 2030. Number
    six of these goals is “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water
    and sanitation for all”. Some of the actions for achieving this include improving
    water quality by reducing pollution, increasing water use efficiency and managing
    water resources. Therefore, better monitoring of water and sanitation interventions
    is essential for achieving this SDG in a more cost-effective and efficient way.
    The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the monitoring of water consumption
    and quality is a very active field of research [1,2]. However, a key issue for
    universalizing proposals, as SDGs fulfilment needs, is the relatively expensive
    cost of equipment, mainly intended for large water-management companies. The challenge
    is to achieve efficient water-monitoring systems at an affordable cost. For this
    reason, various initiatives are currently aimed at the design and commercialization
    of low-cost equipment for monitoring water consumption and quality, for instance,
    water-quality monitoring equipment for use in the context of Citizen Science [3]
    or water-meter designs to be deployed in hand pumps of Africa [4,5]. In fact,
    water monitoring is not a single point problem as it typically requires several
    sensor nodes that can communicate amongst themselves. In this regard, several
    communication technologies have been analyzed to determine if they are suitable
    for application in these environments [6]. In the specific case of wells and water
    sources located outside urban and suburban areas, long-distance communication
    infrastructures are required, with SigFox and LoRa being fairly good options.
    The difference between them is mainly that LoRa is based on a Do-It-Yourself (DIY)
    approach that does not require the infrastructure provided by a telecommunications
    operator and therefore does not depend on its coverage. In addition to data communication,
    there is a complementary aspect related to data collection. In many cases, a large
    amount of information is collected for use in subsequent processing calculations,
    analysis and decision making [1]. The bandwidths available for the sensor node
    data can be too low to allow pass-through of all data, in both the LoRa and SigFox
    technologies [6]. To alleviate this problem, the amount of monitoring data to
    be transmitted is typically reduced in two ways: (1) by reducing the sample rate
    and (2) by preprocessing the information in the nodes. Reducing computational
    time, energy or resources because at a certain moment an “exact” prediction of
    a model is not necessary, is not a novel idea. In fact, it is an emerging computing
    paradigm known as approximate computing [7]. Examples of this are the use of floating
    point formats with less precision [8], which have been shown to be effective in
    achieving energy efficiency at the cost of obtaining a result that is accurate
    enough for the purpose of the calculation, but no more. Influence of arithmetic
    precision, data uncertainty and modelling uncertainty on prediction capabilities
    depend strongly on specific characteristics of the problem in hands. In this work,
    we propose a low-cost device with LoRa communication technology that monitors
    the water flow and electrical consumption during pumping from deep boreholes/wells,
    and that predicts the water level evolution using a simplified model of the aquifer.
    The proposal follows not only an approximate computing but an edge-computing approach.
    This later paradigm focuses on the preprocesses and computation of outputs of
    interest directly at the nodes, minimizing the needs of bandwidth and of time
    delay to inform of the predictions at the node. Recording data from water meters
    and energy sensors is straightforward, but real-time computation and estimation
    of water level evolution is not. Both, the approximate and edge computing perspectives
    are used in the proposal to minimize use of energy and communication resources.
    Estimating the water level of a water well is neither easy nor cheap. Normally
    these types of systems have a price that can be too high if a number of wells
    need to be monitored. The advantage of our approach is that it does not require
    an expensive infrastructure to collect these data since the necessary measurement
    equipment is affordable, automatable and would be present in the same device.
    The proposed system has been introduced, validated and analyzed in a deep well
    pumping for irrigation in the middle part of the Matarraña river basin, a tributary
    of the Ebro river, Spain. The area is characterized by a arid-mediaterranea climate,
    with annual precipitation about 600 mm. The big aquifer “Puertos de Beceite” (number
    ES091MSBT096 in the Ebro river basin characterization and planing [9]), is below
    the upper part of the basin. In the middle part, still in a mountain context,
    there are smaller aquifers in conglomerates and Oligocene sandstones, typically
    confined at high depth, and of relatively reduced productivity. The uncertainties
    associated to aquifer modelling are high, and the impact of pumping in the water
    table is sometimes significant, which makes it an illustrative example for the
    proposal. The main contributions of this work are the following: a low-cost device
    with a “do-it-yourself” metering and communication approach for analysing water
    production and energy consumption of pumpings, specifically designed for deep
    boreholes/wells; the computation of an approximated model in the device for predicting
    water-level change due to pumping; a complete description of all hardware and
    software aspects of the proposed device; a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility
    of the proposed device in terms of temperature, power consumption and performance;
    the practical application of the presented device in a real environment. The paper
    is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the state of the art of water monitoring
    systems and their data acquisition, transmission and processing approaches. Section
    3 identifies the existing problems in the current measurement systems as well
    as the requirements of the proposed solution. Section 4 presents an overview of
    our proposal. Section 5 and Section 6 provide the hardware and software details
    of the proposal, respectively. The validation of the device in terms of temperature,
    energy consumption and performance is shown in Section 7. Section 8 describes
    the deployment of the proposed device in the real application. Finally, Section
    9 summarizes the main conclusions. 2. Related Work Water monitoring systems help
    to identify the state, changes and trends of water resources, infrastructures
    and services. Data acquisition, transmission and processing are three of the main
    stages that can be identified in these systems from a data-analysis perspective.
    2.1. Data Acquisition Water monitoring systems usually acquire data with local
    devices located in the same place of action. These devices generally incorporate
    several specific sensors to analyze the chemical, physical or biological properties.
    For instance, they can measure the oxygen level to determine the health of the
    ecosystem, pH level to measure the acid or base quality of the water, electrical
    conductivity to assess the purity of the water, degree of salinity to estimate
    the concentration of dissolved salts in water, turbidity to analyze the relative
    clarity of a liquid, or temperature to detect thermal pollution, among other properties.
    Beyond the use of local sensors, remote sensors can also be used for data acquisition.
    In this way, Andres et al. [10] also provide a description of various techniques
    for monitoring water and sanitation by collecting data with satellites or even
    unmanned aerial vehicles. In general, images collected by cameras and other spectral
    instruments are used in a wide range of wavelengths. In our proposal, data acquisition
    is limited to electrical power consumption [11,12,13,14] by submerged pumping,
    and water flow [15,16,17] throughout a water-meter. 2.2. Data Transmission Data
    transmission can deal with several types of wireless (radio, satellite, cellular,
    WiFi, Bluetooth, etc) and wired (DSL, coaxial cable, fiber, etc) communication
    technologies. It is a key challenge in water monitoring systems, particularly
    in environments where there is no power outlet and the system’s operability depends
    on the battery life. Although nowadays batteries have a greater longevity, their
    charge is still limited to a certain amount. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are
    a reliable and efficient approach for achieving a scalable and secure network
    to deliver data by means of interconnected sensor nodes that monitor physical
    or environmental conditions of a given place of action. Therefore, they have been
    widely used in fields as diverse as environmental protection, intelligent transportation
    of goods, human health, disaster prevention, military intelligence, and many more.
    Water monitoring also uses this type of network. Zhang et al. [18] present a water-monitoring
    system based on wireless sensor networks to be used in breeding aquatic plant
    and animal species. The proposed wireless sensor network ensures that the monitored
    data are received in real time and are reliable, and also makes the sensor devices
    operate for a longer period of time. Adu-Mani et al. [19] provide an overview
    of several quality-monitoring systems, mainly focusing on data transmission by
    means of wireless sensor networks. They highlight the low level of security that
    this type of network incorporates and the difficulty in keeping them operational
    for long periods of time because there is no continuous power source. Finally,
    Calderwood et al. [20] developed an automatic network of low-cost, open-source
    wireless sensors for real-time monitoring of groundwater using acoustic sensors.
    This fully functional and operational proposal is compared to equivalent commercial
    systems that are several times less expensive in monetary terms, mainly due to
    the processing and visualization environment built with free software. In summary,
    WSNs are a group of sensor nodes connected without a cable to collect some data,
    but there is no direct connection to the internet. In contrast, any IoT system
    should always have present the internet and involves anything that can be connected
    to it. In this way, IoT has recently gained attention as a potential approach
    for water monitoring as it allows information to be exchanged among various devices
    and data collected in real time to be analyzed to take appropriate corrective
    measures. Geetha and Gouthami [21] provide state of the art techniques and tools
    used in existing intelligent water-quality control-systems and also introduces
    a simple and smart approach based on IoT technology. A real implementation of
    a groundwater level monitoring network was deployed in Nova Scotia, Canada [22].
    In this case, low-cost Internet-of-Things devices transmit the data collected
    through custom made meters to visualize and compare the water levels in real time
    of several domestic wells of private users. In other areas of action, it should
    be noted that access to healthy and clean water is a key challenge in most communities
    around the world. Traditional water-dispenser systems usually break down within
    a few years and they are not often fixed since there is no maintenance revenue.
    eWaterPay [23] is a solution that uses mobile technology, IOT and Near-Field Communication
    (NFC) technology to solve this problem. Ingram and Menom [4] analyze the robustness
    of this system in terms of accuracy of the flow meter and flow rate. The Low Powered
    Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is a wireless system that enables long distance data
    transmission and devices to be connected with a low energy consumption approach.
    They appear as a valid transport protocol option for certain needs of the IoT.
    Examples of LPWAN technologies are LoRa, Sigfox and Weightless. In particular,
    the LoRaWAN [24,25,26,27,28,29] protocol has been widely proved to be an effective
    way of transmitting and receiving quick data with battery-operated devices in
    scenarios with low power requirements. For instance, Pietrosemoli et al. [30]
    outline the design of a simple and affordable device to obtain weather data from
    commercial weather stations with a limited wireless range and retransmit the data
    to cover long distances by means of the LoRaWAN protocol. Cano-Ortega and Sanchez-Sutil
    [31] use LoRaWAN to build a prototype that monitors induction motors of electrical
    machines. This proposal benefits from secure communications, low energy-consumption
    and a long signal-range both outdoors and indoors. On the other hand, Dayana et
    al. [32] integrate a LoRaWAN module into an electric meter to send details of
    the users’ electricity consumption. They achieve a wide range of information transmission,
    lower energy use and non-significant data loss. You et al. [33] propose applying
    the enhanced LoRaWAN security protocol in the context of efficient parking management
    in smart cities. They achieve a significant improvement and better performance
    in terms of network latencies compared to previously applied approaches. Finally,
    Nakamura et al. [34] propose a flexible architecture for situations with limited
    resources located in remote rural areas. The main idea of this proposal is that
    it adopts LoRa technology to allow long-range transmissions with low-power consumption
    from sensor nodes to a central node, that transfers the data to the server via
    the internet. Focusing on water monitoring, LoRaWAN is becoming a popular technology
    for data transmission due to its substantial advantages in terms of performance,
    energy consumption and cost. Ngom et al. [35] apply LoRa technology in a water-quality
    monitoring system of a pool in a botanical garden, in which data were previously
    collected by manual measurement. They show that this protocol together with a
    low-cost infrastructure for capturing and processing data in real time can achieve
    an efficient and reliable water-monitoring system. Miles et al. [36] carry out
    a LoRaWAN study to determine whether it is the most suitable communication network
    to be applied in smart agriculture. The authors experimentally model an open farm
    concluding that LoRaWAN has a lot of potential for IoT applications. Apart from
    these more experimental and personalized proposals, there are already commercial
    water sensors and water-monitoring systems (for instance Telog-41 of TrimbleWater
    [37] and DO-IoT-Compact of Umweltleistungen [38]) on the market that use low-power
    LoRa technology so that the sensor batteries last for several years with fairly
    reasonable data transmission intervals. Finally, there is a very interesting project
    at La Marina de Valencia (Spain) proposed by Battulga et al. [39]. In their project
    they use a network of sensors deployed throughout the sea to measure parameters
    such as the weather and the movement of marine vehicles. This sensor network uses
    open-source software and LoRaWAN communication technology to transmit the collected
    data to a fog computing platform that processes the data in real time. This project
    is similar to the one proposed in this work, except that in our case the real-time
    data processing to make decisions is carried out in the sensor node and not only
    from real data but also from estimated data. 2.3. Data Processing Data processing
    for identifying the pumping influence in the aquifers has been widely researched
    in the past, directly linked to the development of physically based theories and
    mathematical models representing aquifer behaviour [40,41,42,43,44]. The first
    models dealt with confined aquifers, in simplified geometries, and typically in
    contexts of constant flow pumping and posterior recovery. At times they have been
    the only option for estimating aquifer hydraulic properties. Nowadays, it is a
    topic that still arouses interest due to the difficulty in estimating aquifer
    characteristics; and as a first step to solve the partial differential equations
    representing realistically 2D and 3D heterogeneous aquifers and systems of aquifers.
    Non-constant water flow can be modelled by superposition principle, provided that
    the math model is kept linear. Mishra et al. [45] introduce an analytical method
    for confined, unconfined, and leaky aquifers that focuses on numerically transforming
    discrete pumping rate data signals into the Laplace transform domain (as proposed
    by Roumboutsos and Stewart [43]) but avoids numerical instabilities by means of
    a discrete-time convolution integral. A special case of non-constant water-flow
    is found when the pumping is performed at constant-head pumping. Trabucchi et
    al. [46] extend Agarwal’s method [42], which is based on recovery tests combined
    with mathematical models for water-level estimation. Recall that historical data
    of instantaneous water-flow rate and instantaneous pumping electrical real power-consumption
    are needed in order to compute estimations for the water level using simplified
    analytical solutions and qualify the fulfilment of underlying hypothesis (constant
    flow rate, or constant head pressure). Thus, their availability is mandatory for
    the data processing of the water table evolution. 3. Problem Statement and Requirements
    The main aim of this work is to monitor the extraction of water from a well and
    to predict the evolution of the position of the water table within. Thus, not
    only to have an estimation of the instant position of the water table, but also
    to provide expected future evolution of it. In order to predict these values,
    a simplified modelling of the energy balance of the pumping scheme, plus an approximation
    to the water mass balance in the aquifer are used. Prediction depends on magnitudes
    characterizing the pumping periods and can be computed at the device. Water table
    evolution during non-pumping periods, referred usually as recovery, depends on
    previous pumping periods. It is not the goal of this approach to be used to monitor
    water level position without pumping, just measuring it. There are several ways
    to directly measure the water level, each with its advantages and disadvantages.
    It is possible to use tape measures, sonic sensors or piezometric sensors [47].
    The tape measure is manual, while the sensors are automatic. It means a relatively
    cheap initial investment for tap measure, but its cost is high in the long term
    as well as inefficient, since it requires labor and travel to perform the measurements.
    Instead, sensors are usually with devices which automatically computes and transmits
    the water level values but at non-reduced costs. For instance, prices of sonic
    probes or piezometric probes range between EUR 500 and EUR 1200 [48]. Piezometric
    probes require the installation of sensors within the borehole, in contact with
    water, and they are pre designed to work with certain ranges of pressures, which
    represents an additional limitation in boreholes with large withdraws. Sonic probes
    are non invasive and can be used to track deep water level locations, but the
    accuracy, even high (errors less than 1%), can represent a problem for water levels
    in tens (or even a hundred) of meters. For these two main reasons, costs and high-but-insufficient
    accuracy for real-time control of pumping, we propose an alternative approach
    based on the approximate and edge-computing paradigms. The proposal requires the
    measurement and recording of pumped water and electrical power consumption. The
    position of the water table is directly related to the water pressure within the
    aquifer, and this is influenced by the real power of the pump, energy losses in
    the water pipes, the pumping history, but also by the geometric and material characteristics
    of the aquifer and their water recharge mechanisms. Aquifer data are usually the
    most uncertain. However, main characteristics of time-dependent solutions can
    be checked in advance, and model parameters can be calibrated with punctual real-data
    of water table evolution during a pumping–recovery sequence. A water-meter with
    pulse emitter is the simplest way to approximate instantaneous water flow within
    a pipe. Water-meters are designed to produce a reduced water energy loss at nominal
    water flow rates; additionally, they are usually installed to have a minimum control
    of the pumping use (and typically they are required in legalized pumping schemes
    in most countries). Water meters with pulse emission type MJ-SDC can obtain the
    information digitally in order to transmit it later. There are devices that measure
    the amount of water that passes through them at a reasonable price unless the
    remote transmission of the information is also required. For instance, prices
    of Zenner, Woltman and AO-Electronics range between EUR 300 and EUR 1200 with
    remote transmission functionality, and between EUR 50 and EUR 300 without this
    remote transmission functionality AlphaOmega Electronics [49], NingBo Water Meters
    [50]. In addition, a clock will be necessary that, through a small electronic
    circuit (microcontroller/PLC), can calculate the water flow rate. Energy power
    consumption can be measured with voltmeters and ammeters. Similarly to the water-meters,
    their cost is quite reasonable unless the functionality of remotely transmitting
    the collected information is necessary. For instance, prices of voltmeters and
    ammeters range between EUR 60 and EUR 1200 with the remote transmission functionality,
    and between EUR 30 and EUR 60 without this remote transmission functionality [51].
    For single-phase current measurements, a voltmeter and an ammeter are sufficient,
    however, for three-phase current measurements, three voltmeters and four ammeters
    are recommended to not depend on the hypothesis of balanced system functioning.
    Finally, to provide data communication between the extraction points and the centralized
    server system, we need solutions that do not depend on commercial cellular networks,
    since distribution companies would not build large communications installations
    because the territory is rural, remote and there is little possibility of recovering
    their investment. The most common and low-cost solutions such as Bluetooth and
    Wi-Fi, are not considered either because they have a very short communication
    range. Therefore, our solution must cover our communication needs, which are:
    (a) distances of several kilometers, (b) rural locations with little or no commercial
    communication infrastructures, and (c) little need for bandwidth (a few bytes
    per second). In summary, although there is a large number of commercial solutions,
    they tend to have a high cost in monetary terms. To the best of our knowledge,
    there is no device on the market that can measure or estimate the behavior of
    a well and that can be replicated at a reasonable cost. We proposed a device with
    a minimum cost of EUR 200 per unit (within EU in 2019) for three-phase pumping.
    4. Proposal: Overview Figure 1 shows the data flow scheme that we propose for
    our monitoring system in which four main stages can be distinguished: (1) Data
    Acquisition, (2) Model Calibration, (3) Data Processing and (4) Results Transmission.
    The Data Acquisition stage is responsible for obtaining data from the different
    sensors (energy consumption and flow meter). The Model Calibration stage includes
    the calibration of the model parameters, only once, combining data with the data
    from the acquisition stage with direct water table evolution measurement. The
    model can be calibrated as many times as necessary, but a priori only once would
    be sufficient for normal system operation. The Data Processing stage is responsible
    for estimating the water level and the behavior of the well based on the model
    calibrated and the new data obtained from the acquisition stage. Finally, the
    Results Transmission stage sends the data through an appropriate communication
    system to the server or end user. Notice that the model is calibrated once and
    the behavior of the well is calculated constantly and in real time. Figure 1.
    Data flow Monitoring System. Voltmeters and ammeters are used to measure power
    energy consumption. In a three-phase system, electricity intensity by phase and
    neutral, and the voltages between phase and neutral are of interest. Sensors are
    connected to a microcontroller that through an Analog-to-Digital converter can
    obtain instant values of all magnitudes, and compute the RMS value of intensities,
    voltages and real and apparent powers by line. This can be efficiently computed
    using a rapid FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) transform of signal data. Note that
    RMS magnitudes needs a minimum sampling time to be computed which depends on electricity
    frecuency. For measuring the water flow, the on–off signal of the pulse emitter
    is recorded. The instantaneous water flow rate can be approximated considering
    the constant water volume characteristic of each water-meter and the time increment
    between signals. The average water flow from pumping start depends on total time
    and total number of signals emitted. A water level meter (300 m) has been used
    for manually measuring the water level. Data collected is used for model calibration
    and validation off-line. Model parameters are updated in the device for the computations
    during Data Processing stage. The microcontroller receives the real-time data
    from the sensors, computes the estimated water level position, and makes the necessary
    transmissions through the installed communications system. There is a wide range
    of microcontrollers on the market, but in our case we rely on those that are widely
    recognized and accepted and that have a large range of user-tested hardware and
    software extensions. In this sense, the de facto standard based on Arduino and
    Raspberry Pi are the most suitable. Nowadays there is a great interest in the
    use of Arduino and Raspberry Pi systems, either individually or combined, for
    low-cost monitoring environments. In this way, we can identify several examples
    that combine Arduino and Raspberry Pi, such as to control the temperature of a
    photovoltaic generator [52] or to manage the charging process of an electric vehicle
    [53], and examples that deal with Raspberry Pi individually, such as for photovoltaic
    water pumping systems [54] or for monitoring the energy performance of buildings
    [55]. Arduino is a Plug and Play microcontroller. As soon as it is plugged in,
    it starts executing the single program that has been loaded. This is programmed
    in C/C++ and is developed and compiled in the Arduino IDE environment from a PC,
    and then transferred to the microcontroller through a USB connection. As it is
    a single program, it must integrate all the functionalities that our application
    needs, and therefore it is not very flexible to modifications and extensions of
    functionalities. However, it is suitable for performing a single repetitive task
    efficiently and effectively, such as measuring RMS real power consumption. In
    this sense, any board that has AD converters and the possibility of communication
    via serial line would be sufficient. On the other hand, Raspberry Pi, being a
    whole computer, with a Linux operating system installed and access to all the
    development software and Linux libraries, offers great flexibility to be programmed
    in any need and can be easily modified and expanded. It has 40 well-known input/output
    pins, with a series of integrated adapters (USB, Ethernet, etc.) and a storage
    system based on MicroSD cards, where the operating system and the applications
    that we need are located. Among them, any compatible board would give equivalent
    results (Raspberry Pi, Asus Tinker, Lepotato, Rock64, Banana Pi, Orange Pi, Odroids,
    PocketBeagle) and within the Raspberry Pi family there are some alternatives available
    that have sufficient computing power, from the Pi Zero to the Pi4. As outlined
    above, we require a communication approach that can cover distances of several
    kilometers in an environment with little communication infrastructure and low
    bandwidth needs. These requirements made us consider than the LPWAN (Low Power
    Wide Area Network) style protocols are suitable. Of these technologies LoRa and
    LoRaWAN are considered the most appropriate, given that these communication protocols
    are in full expansion and fit perfectly into the characteristics of the needed
    communication. In fact, LoRa is a wide spectrum modulation technology with a high
    network range and low power consumption at the cost of low bandwidth compared
    to other wireless technologies. However, this is not a problem since our device
    only generates a small volume of data. In summary, we will use an Arduino micro
    controller for real power consumption, and a Raspberry Pi to record real power,
    water flow, interpolate both temporal series, compute water level and proceed
    to communicate at desired time-intervals. The included sensors are ammeters, voltmeters
    and a pulse of the water meter. Finally, the communications system used is the
    LoRa technology. 5. Proposal: Hardware Aspects This section describes the selected
    low-cost solution proposed in this work. It describes the different components
    necessary to take measurements, perform calculations and transmit the results
    for the correct modeling of the behavior of the water well. Figure 2 shows the
    block diagram and the real image of the hardware prototype. Particularly, Figure
    2a depicts the main components of the single-phase board prototype and the internal
    and external connections, and Figure 2b shows an image of the single-phase prototype
    with its main boards, sensors and interconnections. Figure 2. Board and sensor
    assembly. (a) Hardware block diagram. (b) Sensors and Boards. 5.1. Selected Board:
    Arduino + Raspberry Pi For the acquisition of electricity data we chose an open
    source solution from the company LeChacal. This company offers various kits, which
    by means of an Arduino controller and a series of voltage and ampere sensors are
    capable of measuring the electricity consumption that passes through a cable.
    Specifically we chose the RPIZ_CT3V1 kit [56], which is the kit that can be integrated
    easily with a Raspberry Pi Zero [57], and the RPIZ_CT4V3 kit with Raspberry Pi
    3A+ or 3B+ [58] for the three-phase current system. This already microprogrammed
    kits acquires the data from its sensors and performs the consumption calculation,
    giving values of RealPower in watts, Irms in milliamps and Vrms in volts. This
    information is sent through a serial line and can be collected through the serial
    port /dev/ttyAMA0 of a Raspberry Pi, as described in the company’s tutorial. This
    kit has installed, and uses, the YHDC-SCT013 current sensors [59] and a AC/AC
    adaptor-voltage sensor IdealPower 77DE-06-09 [60]. Raspberry Pi boards offer enough
    computing power for our needs, are priced very affordably, and integrate seamlessly
    with the Arduino microcontroller from LeChacal. These systems have been installed
    with the Raspbian Lite version based on Debian 10.0, which offers all the programs
    and services of an entire Linux system. We also have all the power of a Linux
    system to perform extra calculations and communications with the outside world.
    The pulse emitter of the water-meter has been connected to three GPIO of the raspberry
    Pi: one pin to ground, another pin to 3v3 voltage and the third to data on GPIO17.
    The internal Arduino pull-up resistor is used to protect the circuit and two LEDs
    with their resistors have been added to visualize the on–off signal of the water
    meter. Remarkably, some water–meters emit pulses of predefined length once a volume
    of water has been detected. Others, the most basic models, emit an on–off signal
    directly from the reed switch on the counting wheel. At constant water flow, time
    of pulse is less than 0.5 of time of a wheel round. Unequal pulses are better
    registered as on–off and off–on changes. The water volume per round depends on
    the meter and the counting wheel with the sensor installed. A separate battery
    clock was installed to provide accurate time at all times, corresponding to the
    RTC PI v3 kit from ABelectronicsUK [61]. This board makes it possible to keep
    the real time while the system is off and/or disconnected from a power outlet.
    Finally, tests were carried out with USB devices for the communications part,
    specifically, a Fast-Ethernet USB-RJ45 device and a LoRa LilyGO-TTGO-LORA32 device
    [62]. 5.2. I/O and Communication Following an ascending order, we discuss the
    different ways in which the system components communicate. On the one hand, the
    SCT-013 current sensors and the AC/AC adaptor-voltage sensors are connected via
    a three-pole jack (although only two are used) in an analog way to the Arduino
    RPIZ_CT3V1 board. This in turn is connected to the serial port of the 40-pin GPIO
    bus of the Raspberry Pi Zero W/Pi 3 board. Between the two boards, the RTC PI
    v3 real time clock is also connected to the 40-pin GPIO bus. Finally, the connection
    of the water meter is made with a two-pole jack that is connected directly to
    one of the digital input pins of the GPIO of the Raspberry Pi. The whole system
    is powered by a 5V USB power supply. External communication is carried out through
    the Wi-Fi built into the Raspberry Pi and can also be carried out through the
    USB connector, where a USB-RJ45 Ethernet device can be plugged in. The communication
    tests with LoRa were carried out with LilyGO-TTGO-LORA32 devices, which allow
    easy installation and use in the Raspberry Pi board. 5.3. Board Assembly It is
    not difficult to assemble the components and it is possible to Do-it-Yourself.
    You just have to follow the manufacturer’s assembly instructions for building
    the different components (they can be accessed from the references). As can be
    seen in Figure 2b, the ammeters surround the current cable that they want to measure,
    in this case and for single-phase current they cover both the phase cable (brown)
    and the neutral cable (blue). We can also see the cables from the water meter
    (black and red), which are the ones that connect to a GPIO port of the Raspberry
    Pi. 6. Proposal: Software Aspects In this section we present the system’s operating.
    First, we discuss the general mode of operation, then the different algorithms
    that are executed, next the water well-modeling software and finally the communication
    mechanism used. Figure 3 details the dataflow and code that are executed on the
    devices. Particularly, the block marked in a dashed orange circle corresponds
    to the code that is executed on the Arduino board while the blocks marked in dashed
    black circles correspond to the codes that are executed on the Raspberry Pi. Figure
    3. Flowchart block diagram. 6.1. Operating Mode The procedure to take measurements
    begins as soon as the two devices are plugged in: the Arduino and the Raspberry
    Pi. From that moment on, the Arduino microcontroller, which already has the program
    to run, begins taking measurements from the sensors, calculating the current values
    in real time and sending the values through the serial line to the Raspberry at
    a preconfigured cadence (values between 1 and 5 s). The Lite version of Raspbian,
    that is based on Debian 10.0, has been installed in the Raspberry Pi system and
    through an installed service it starts a script that executes the water well-modeling
    program. As values are obtained, the well-modeling algorithm is applied to calculate
    the water level in real time. Once the water extraction is completed, the summary
    values of the extraction that has been carried out are sent with the LoRa protocol
    at a predetermined rate by the program settings. Typically, the devices do not
    turn off between different water withdrawals but when the exploitation is stopped
    (seasonally, weekly, power interruption, etc). In order to minimize the risk of
    file system data corruption and loss of data, the writings to file are always
    accompanied by the flush command, and thus it is guaranteed that the writing is
    performed on the physical device. 6.2. Stage Algorithms As it is shown in Figure
    1, our approach is divided into several stages to estimate the behavior of the
    well: (1) Data Acquisition, (2) Model Calibration, (3) Data Processing and (4)
    Results Transmission. Each of these stages has its own code to perform the tasks
    assigned to them. In the following subsections we describe each of these codes
    in detail. 6.2.1. Data Acquisition The data acquisition stage is responsible for
    obtaining data from the energy consumption sensor and flow meter sensor. These
    data will be used in the following stages. The energy consumption acquisition
    code runs on both controllers in the system (Arduino board and Raspberry Pi board).
    The RMS values are calculated in the Arduino board by reading the data provided
    by the voltage and amp sensors. The code that the Arduino board executes is the
    one provided by the LeChacal company as part of the energy consumption measurement
    kit. The results are sent through the serial line to the Raspberry Pi board. The
    Raspberry Pi board executes a code that is constantly reading through its serial
    line and realizes some preprocess to generate real power data and save them with
    a time stamp. It is important to note that data are received by passive waiting,
    and in this case, as long as no new data arrive, no CPU is consumed by the Raspberry
    Pi processor. The frequency of sending and receiving the values can be configured.
    A minimum of 0.2 s for sensor reading and RMS computation is needed (10 cycles
    with electricity at 50 Hz), thus values over 1 s are proposed. The flow meter
    acquisition code is in charge of receiving pulses generated by the water meter
    that is at the outlet of the well pump. This pulse is connected to a GPIO pin
    in the Raspberry Pi. The GPIO signal handles an interrupt routine, executed each
    time the signal changes. Because of this passive waiting, CPU utilization is very
    low. Each time a change is detected, code saves the time of the change and computes
    instantaneous and mean pumped water-flow since beginning. 6.2.2. Model Calibration
    The model calibration stage is responsible for calibrating the model parameters
    which characterize water level evolution. These parameters are related to different
    terms appearing when considering water mass balance in the aquifer and energy
    balance in the pumping system. We choose a reference model based on expected aquifer
    characteristics: The Theis model [40], which corresponds to the analytical solution
    of the boundary value problem of the water pressure in the aquifer for a simplified
    case (confined aquifer of infinite extension, homogeneous, horizontal and with
    a constant thickness, with a small diameter pumping borehole totally penetrating
    the aquifer strata, and with a constant pumping flow starting instantaneously
    at time zero). In these conditions, the aquifer response is characterized by two
    material coefficients: Transmissivity, T, and storativity, S. The water pressure
    draw down is given at a distance r of the borehole center and at time t starting
    at 𝑡=0 , by 𝑠(𝑟,𝑡)= 𝑄 𝑎 𝑊(𝑢)/(4𝜋𝑇) , with 𝑢= 𝑟 2 𝑆/(4𝑇𝑡) , 𝑊(𝑢)= ∫ ∞ 𝑢 𝑒 −𝑢 /𝑢𝑑𝑢
    , and 𝑄 𝑎 the constant flow rate. In single well contexts 𝑟= 𝑟 𝐵 , the radius
    of the borehole is considered representative of the real water table position,
    thus the water level evolution is given by 𝐻(𝑡)= 𝐻 𝑠 +𝑠( 𝑟 𝐵 ,𝑡) , with 𝐻 𝑠 the
    initial water level position referred usually as static level (level without previous
    pumping influences). Model unknowns T and 𝑟 2 𝐵 𝑆 are unlikely to change once
    determined, but the static water level can be expected to suffer changes occasionally.
    Even the reality of the aquifer does not fulfil previous hypothesis for the Theis
    model, the two parameters T and S are the basis for more complex aquifer modelling.
    We calibrate aquifer parameters with the model considering non constant flow pumping
    and both pumping and recovery periods. Superposition cannot be applied to each
    variation of the real–time signal, few seconds. We assume near to constant head
    pumping conditions and adjust an exponential interpolation of 𝑄(𝑡) for each pumping
    period, fitted with a penalized minimum least square problem to force the capture
    of the total water volume. Optimization is solved with a genetic algorithm. Finally,
    the inverse Laplacian of the analytical solution on the Laplace space is computed.
    We apply superposition principle for recovery and to include influence of past
    pumping in subsequent pumping–recovery periods. As the reference model cannot
    be solved repeatedly on a real-time basis, we propose using the Jacob’s approximation
    to Theis solution, considering the average water flow previously pumped, 𝑞 𝑎 (𝑡)=
    ∫ 𝑡 0 𝑞(𝜏)𝑑𝜏 , as the reference constant water flow. The classical Jacob’s approximation
    is found considering only first two terms of the approximation of 𝑊(𝑢) by a series,
    obtaining 𝑠(𝑟,𝑡)= 𝑄 𝑎 ln(2.25𝑇𝑡/( 𝑟 2 𝑆))/(4𝜋𝑇) , valid for 𝑢<0.03 . In the case
    of recovery after a pumping period of 𝑡 𝑃 time span, the superposition principle
    leads to 𝑠 𝑅 (𝑟,𝑡)= 𝑄 𝑎 ln(𝑡/(𝑡− 𝑡 𝑃 ))/(4𝜋𝑇) . After rearranging, water level
    during recovery is found as 𝐻 𝑅 (𝑡)= 𝐻 𝑠 + 𝐶 𝑞𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑅 𝑞 𝑎 ( 𝑡 𝑃 ) log 10 (𝑡/(𝑡− 𝑡
    𝑃 )) , with 𝐶 𝑞𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑅 related with T. For pumping periods we use a storability-alike
    parameter, 𝑆 ̂ , which differs from the one characteristic of the aquifer and
    calibrated previously with the full model. The use of two storability parameters
    was previously found useful by [63], and discussed by [64]. In our approach, the
    storability-alike parameter for pumping captures the influence of time lapse between
    start pumping and the water meter signal and possible changes on water head. Thus,
    water level during pumping is approximated by 𝐻 𝑃ℎ (𝑡)= 𝐻 𝑠 + 𝐶 𝑞𝑎 𝑞 𝑎 (𝑡)+ 𝐶
    𝑞𝑎𝑙𝑡 𝑞 𝑎 (𝑡) log 10 (𝑡) , with 𝐶 𝑞𝑎 and 𝐶 𝑞𝑎𝑙𝑡 related to T and 𝑆 ̂ . Additional
    terms can be included in 𝐻 𝑃ℎ (𝑡) and 𝐻 𝑅 (𝑡) to consider the impact of previous
    pumping periods in actual simulation. Summarising, model calibration of hydraulics
    requires the calibration of four parameters, involving both the reference and
    the simplified hydraulic models, and with data involving pumping and recovery
    periods ( 𝑞(𝑡) and measured 𝐻 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝑡) ). On the other hand, the power effectively
    transferred from pumping to water is transformed into energy losses by friction
    of water flow with pipes and valves system, potential energy, i.e., increment
    of water height with respect to initial position, and kinetic energy, which is
    assumed negligible. Water energy losses can be considered proportional to square
    water flow rate in standard operational conditions (with limited water flow velocity
    inside the pipe). Energy transferred with pumping is given by the pump curve,
    which is provided by the manufacturer, and relates the increment of water pressure
    with the water flow, usually, with a quadratic function and referred to nominal
    power. Water level can be approximated considering energy balance by 𝐻 𝑃𝑒 (𝑡)=
    𝐶 𝑒 𝑒(𝑡)+ 𝐶 𝑒𝑞2 𝑒(𝑡)𝑞 (𝑡) 2 + 𝐶 𝑞2 𝑞 (𝑡) 2 , with 𝑒(𝑡) the real power time evolution
    and 𝑞(𝑡) the instantaneous water flow. A minimum of three parameters are needed
    to relate water level position during pumping with water flow and real power consumption,
    with two characterizing the pump. These parameters are calibrated using least
    squares with 𝑒(𝑡) , 𝑞(𝑡) and measured 𝐻 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝑡) data during pumping. Note that
    during pumping periods, both mass and energy balance should be fulfilled, which
    implies 𝐻 𝑃 (𝑡)= 𝐻 𝑃ℎ (𝑡)= 𝐻 𝑃𝑒 (𝑡) . 6.2.3. Data Processing The data processing
    stage estimates the water level and the behavior of the well based on the model
    calibrated in the Calibration stage and the new data obtained from the acquisition
    stage every time an extraction is made. With no pumping active ( 𝑒(𝑡)=0 , 𝑞(𝑡)=0
    ) water level estimate is the static water level 𝐻 𝑠 . In case that there has
    been a previous pumping recorded 𝐻 𝑅 (𝑡) is computed from 𝑡 𝑃 and 𝑞 𝑎 ( 𝑡 𝑃 )
    values (the pumping time span and the total water volume pumped). When pumping
    starts, signal of 𝑒(𝑡) increases from near zero to nominal pumping power in a
    period of some, even tens of, seconds. During this time water starts flowing up
    through the pipe until it reaches the water meter and water provision point. It
    can delay up to a couple of minutes. Then water meter signal indicates the water
    flow 𝑞(𝑡)>0 . With pumping active ( 𝑒(𝑡)>0 and 𝑞(𝑡)>0 ) the proposed prediction
    for 𝐻 ̂ 𝑃 (𝑡) is equal to ( 𝐻 1 (𝑡)+ 𝐻 2 (𝑡))/2 . The value of 𝐸 𝑃 (𝑡)=( 𝐻 1 (𝑡)−
    𝐻 2 (𝑡))/2 is considered an indicator of the error of the estimation 𝐻 ̂ 𝑃 (𝑡)
    . Recall that real time computation is based on an approximated model, which could
    not be accurate in the short term after starting. Both computations, 𝐻 ̂ 𝑃 (𝑡)
    and 𝐸 𝑃 (𝑡) , are linear combinations of powers and cross products of 𝑒(𝑡) , 𝑞(𝑡)
    , 𝑞 𝑎 (𝑡) and log(𝑡) . Pumping finishes once real power consumption drops to zero,
    which implies no pumping and stopping water flow. The water meter last signal
    is previous to last real power signal clearly above zero. 6.2.4. Results Transmission
    The results transmission stage sends the data through an appropriate communication
    system to the server or end user. In this way, LoRa communication is used to wirelessly
    connect all the well pumping stations of an aquifer with the server. LoRa is able
    to communicate small amounts of data over long distances with low power consumption;
    however, unfortunately, latencies can be very high. This means that LoRa is not
    suitable for sending real-time data or control commands from the server in the
    event of an error. The supervision of the operation, as well as the detection
    and action in the event of an error, is programmed in the microcontroller of the
    pumping station, following the Edge Computing approach. Therefore, LoRa communication
    can be used to inform the server of problems or errors in the pumping station;
    however, it is not feasible to wait for orders or commands from the server. The
    data generated by the sensors are also processed locally in the Raspberry Pi microcontroller.
    As shown in Section 7.3, CPU usage for this processing is low and can be carried
    out easily in the microcontroller. Therefore, once they have been processed, the
    data to be transmitted to the server will be summaries of a water extraction and
    values of the behavior of the well and the underlying aquifer. The communication
    period is long, from minutes to hours, and therefore LoRa offers enough bandwidth
    for our needs. Each LoRa data communication will send just a few values: pumping
    starting time, duration of pipeline transport, pumping end time, total extracted
    water and average power consumption. Therefore, the LoRa communication protocol
    meets our needs for a minimum communication infrastructure, low bandwidth needs
    and long-distance communication in rural environments (a few kilometers). Figure
    4 shows the throughput experimentally obtained with TTGO LORA32 test devices.
    Two devices, one as an emitter and one as a receiver, have been used in a laboratory
    environment separated by a few centimeters from each other. The throughput obtained
    in a given SF (spread factor) with different message sizes has been measured.
    Particularly, SFs from 7 to 12 with message sizes ranging from 1 byte to 200 bytes
    have been tested. Results show that low SFs (SF7 and SF8) have a higher throughput
    (4900 bps and 2800 bps) compared with throughput (400 bps and 214 bps) obtained
    with high SFs (SF11 and SF12). Figure 4. Throughput between two TTGO LORA32 devices.
    Given these specifications, we will use low profile LoRa settings that make sufficiently
    effective communication possible. With this idea, for measurements of a small
    number of water wells, high SFs (spread factors) of 11 or 12 will be used, since
    they have sufficient bandwidth and allow transmissions at a greater distance (10
    to 20 km). The biggest disadvantage of these SF is that they occupy the transmission
    channel for a longer time. On the other hand, for a basin with a greater number
    of wells, the communication parameters of each of the wells could be configured
    differently. Configuring the closest wells with lower SFs of 7 or 8, which occupy
    less channel time, have greater bandwidth, but have a transmission distance limited
    to a few km (2 km approximately). As the wells get further away from the server,
    they would use higher SFs that allow greater transmission distances, and SF 12
    would be used in those that are further away. In summary, LoRa communication fits
    perfectly in this approach as we deal with low rates of data communication, long
    range distances, low power requirements, and there is no need to communicate real-time
    data or commands. 7. Proposal: Verification This section presents the validation
    of the device in terms of power consumption, temperature and performance. A prototype
    that is powered by single-phase alternating current was used in the laboratory.
    The simulation of the pulses of the water meter was obtained from a pulse generator.
    The main target of the test is to determine the limits of the device at room temperature
    and at high temperatures in the shade. In both cases, the CPU usage is varied
    from idle to 100%, going through the normal usage it would have while taking measurements
    from the well. 7.1. Energy Consumption Power consumption is very important in
    battery operated systems. However, in our case the highest energy consumption
    is produced by the water-pump motor. It varies a lot depending on water flow and
    well depth. Values from one thousand to several tens of thousands are typical.
    The sensors and microcontroller used have very low energy consumption (from 1
    W to 4 W), which can be several hundreds of watts less than the consumption of
    the water-pump motor (from 1000 W to 10,000 W), which means that the consumption
    of the box represents less than 0.4% of the total energy consumed. 7.2. Temperature
    The safe working temperature for a Raspberry Pi, for all its components, is from
    0 °C to 70 °C (Celsius degrees) and the working range of the SoC/CPU is from −40
    °C to 85 °C [65]. Two types of temperatures are measured: first the SoC temperature
    (by reading the internal temperature sensor) and second the temperature inside
    the box (with a DS18B20 temperature sensor connected through 1-wire to another
    Raspberry Pi that is outside the box). A series of experiments were carried out
    with different external temperatures and different CPU loads on the Raspberry
    PI to check the temperature limits in execution of the selected boards. Table
    1 shows all the experiments carried out in the laboratory. Table 1. Temperature
    ranges (Celsius degrees °C) of the BOX and SoC with two different external ambient
    temperatures. Box and SoC temperature measurements were made at an ambient temperature
    of 20 °C and 40 °C. These measurements, in turn, were carried out under three
    operating conditions of the Raspberry PI CPU. The first in an Idle state, with
    no program running, the second with a program running the well-modeling code while
    it is taking measurements of power consumption using voltmeters and ammeters,
    and measurements of an electronic pulse that indicates turns of a flowmeter (it
    was simulated with a pulse generator every 2 s), and the third executing a code
    (stress) that uses the CPU at 100%. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the temperature
    of the two sensors that were used in the two ambient temperature experiments (20
    °C and 40 °C), while the use of the CPU is modified, from idle, through execution
    of the modeling code, until using the CPU at 100%. It is worth mentioning that
    the use of the CPU is altered by the experiment itself, since the measurements
    of temperature and the use of the CPU of the SoC are made with the Raspberry PI
    itself; therefore, initially the CPU already starts from a CPU usage of 5%. This
    is not a problem for our experiment, since we are looking for the upper limits
    of the running temperature of the system. Just say that these initial values will
    have a slightly lower temperature. However, the temperature of the box has been
    taken from another external Raspberry PI and in this case it does not alter the
    CPU usage of the internal Raspberry PI. Figure 5. Box and CPU temperature in different
    ambient conditions and %CPU usage. As shown in Table 1, in any of the six situations,
    the limit temperature of the Raspberry and Arduino boards is not reached. We highlight
    the case of executing the modeling code at an ambient temperature of 40 °C where
    the CPU temperatures are between 50 °C and 54 °C and the box is between 43 °C
    and 46 °C. 7.3. Performance In this section, we evaluate the cost in CPU consumption
    of different alternatives for model calibration and data processing codes. Reference
    and simplified models are calibrated with codes developed in the R language (R
    is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics [66]). Libraries
    GA v 3.2.2 [67,68] and Pracma v. 2.3.8 [69] are used. Data acquisition and processing
    stages at the Raspberry Pi are performed in codes written in Fortran 90. Data
    acquisition stage at the Arduino is written in C. For comparative purposes, Cython
    and Python versions of the Fortran code for data processing has been developed.
    Cython [70] is an optimizing static compiler for Python, so we can obtain additional
    performance by executing compiled code instead of interpreted Python code. Table
    2 contains the execution time of the five codes considered: R-dp (for data process
    stage), R-cal-GA (for calibration stage), and F90-dp (in Fortran 90), Cython-dp
    and Python-dp corresponding data-process codes. These codes were executed in four
    systems with diverse computing powers: a Xeon+Quadro workstation (server), a Laptop
    computer with Celeron CPU, and two models of Raspberry PI (PI 4 and Pi Zero W).
    Only the Raspberry PIs are suitable for our purposes, but the more powerful laptop
    and server systems give us an estimation of the minimum execution times for these
    codes. Table 2. Real time [seconds], and %CPU execution time for a period of one
    hour, of the codes for the calibration stage (R-cal-GA) and the data acquisition
    and process stages (R-dp, F90-dp, Cython-dp and Python-dp) in four computing systems.
    It can be observed in Table 2 that the R-cal-GA is the code that takes the longest
    to execute, followed by the R-dp, and the Python, Cython and finally Fortran 90
    versions. Cython is about 10% faster than Python, and Fortran twice faster than
    Cython. Regarding the four computing systems tested, the fastest is the server,
    followed by the laptop, then Raspberry Pi 4, and Raspberry Pi Zero W (the slowest
    one). Although it is the slowest system, the Raspberry Pi Zero W is fast enough
    for data acquisition and process stages. Raspberry Pi 4 is an option for R-calibration-GA
    code, but twice time slower than the laptop. Table 2 also shows %CPU usage data
    for the five codes and four computing systems, as the average value for a period
    of 1 h of execution. As mentioned above, despite being the slowest system, Fortran
    and Cython codes executed in Raspberry Pi Zero W last between 2 and 4 s (in 1
    h), that is, less than 0.1% of CPU usage. It is not necessary to have a more powerful
    system. Finally, in Figure 6, we analyzed the effect of the number of input data
    samples in the execution time of the five versions of the code in the four considered
    computing systems. Figure 6a–d correspond to the execution times (in seconds),
    while Figure 6e–h show the relative time of the Python code version ( 𝑇 𝑝𝑦 ) compared
    to the other code versions ( 𝑇 𝑜𝑡 ) and computed as 𝑇 𝑜𝑡 / 𝑇 𝑝𝑦 . In general,
    the execution time increases with the volume of data to process, except the R-cal-GA
    code, with an almost constant execution time (because the data processing represent
    a small percentage of the total execution time, compared with optimization computations).
    From the slowest code to the fastest one, we have R-cal-GA, R, Cython, Python
    and Fortran 90 “dp” versions, as seen in Table 2. Regarding the four computing
    systems, the server is one order of magnitude faster than the Laptop, the Laptop
    computer is slightly faster than Raspberry Pi 4, and our Raspberry Pi Zero W is
    about one order of magnitude slower than Raspberry Pi 4, but powerful enough to
    execute the data capture and process stages, with the lowest energy consumption.

    systems. (a) Server execution time; (b) Laptop execution time; (c) Raspberry Pi
    4 execution time; (d) Raspberry Pi Zero W execution time; (e) Server relative
    time; (f) Laptop relative time; (g) Raspberry Pi 4 relative time; (h) Raspberry
    Pi Zero W relative time. 8. Field Case Application To test and validate the proposal,
    a prototype was installed in an operational pumping for irrigation in the Matarraña
    valley. The tested prototype is for a three-phase current supply. The case study
    is characterized by a reference static water level 𝐻 𝑠 =83.65 m and a radius of
    the perforation of 𝑟 𝑝 =0.11 m. The aquifer is confined and the pump is located
    at 130 m. Pump curve is given by 𝐶 𝑒 =4.498× 10 −2 m/w, 𝐶 𝑒𝑞2 =8.008× 10 −3 m
    s 2 /(w dm 6 ) at nominal real power of 𝑒 𝑛 =4961 w. Two sets of data including
    manual measurement of water level evolution are available: First, 11 January 2019,
    and second, 11 April 2019. The first involves one pumping–recovery period and
    it was used to calibrate the model. The second set includes three consecutive
    pumping–recovery periods, although third is covered partially. Information from
    April is used to validate the model. They were not performed in same conditions,
    a situation that is detected by the error indicator during validation. In the
    following, main results for calibration and validation are commented. The first
    pumping period is used here for the recalibration of the model, and two strategies
    are compared: automatically, in the sensor, and off-line. The water flow and real
    power consumption during calibration case are shown in Figure 7. The pumping duration
    was approximately 2 h and 15 min, and it was performed with almost constant head
    conditions. Note the delay in the starting time of water flow (at surface) with
    respect to real power starting curve, about 50 s. Water flow starts at 1.6 L per
    second and finishes at 1.4, a reduction of 15%. Figure 7. Calibration. Time evolution
    of water flow and electric power, measured data. Pumping starting (left) and ending
    (right). Two sets of parameters provide good results with the full model: one
    for better adjusting the pumping and the other for recovery. Other pairs in between
    provide also acceptable results. Even the values are quite different. Differences
    are in the usual range and they are in agreement with T values reported in the
    area (from 0.28 to 158 m 2 /day [9]). Values of parameters and corresponding constants
    are indicated in Table 3. Figure 8 summarizes main results of calibration for
    both sets of aquifer parameters. First, left to right, the water flow adjusted
    by an exponential function from experimental data is shown. Total water volume
    is represented with an error less than 0.05%. Second, the water level evolution
    simulated with the reference model and first set of parameters is depicted. Results
    are graphically in very good agreement. Third and fourth are the results with
    the second set of parameters, during just the pumping period or including recovery,
    with both reference and simplified models. The results of both models are almost
    indistinguishable. The error during the recovery of second set of parameters is
    slightly higher than first set, and it can be identified in Figure 8; but adjustment
    for pumping is slightly better. Figure 8. Calibration. (a) Left: Water flow evolution,
    measured (black) and adjusted (blue). Right: Water level evolution, measured (black)
    and simulated with the reference model and the 1st set of parameters (blue). (b)
    Water level measured (black) and simulated with the reference model (blue) and
    the simplified one (red), with the 2nd set of parameters. Left: Pumping period.
    Right: Pumping and recovery. Table 3. Calibrated parameters, T and S, for the
    reference model; and constants for the simplified model, 𝐶 𝑞𝑎 and 𝐶 𝑞𝑎𝑙𝑡 . The
    value 𝐶 𝑉 𝑞𝑎 corresponds to a recalibrated value during validation. The parameter
    related to water energy losses due to pipe transport is calibrated using the real
    power data, obtaining 𝐶 𝑞2 =−13.136 m s 2 /(dm 6 ). With all parameters adjusted,
    results of the simulations with both sets of parameters are presented in Figure
    9. The estimated water levels 𝐻 𝑒𝑠𝑡 are indicated in red color, overimpressed
    to the orange curves corresponding to 𝐻 𝑃𝑒 . Measured data are plotted in black.
    Both results are in good agreement with data. The error diminishes with time,
    being less than 1% of H except during the first 10 to 15 min. Overestimation of
    first set of parameters is larger the second one during this starting time. Figure
    9. Calibration. (a) Left: Water level evolution, measured (black) and simulated
    (orange and red) with the 1st set of parameters. Right, error estimation evolution.
    (b) Same results as (a) with the 2nd set of parameters. Figure 10 shows the results
    obtained when applying calibrated set of parameters to the data of first pumping
    of the validation case. Remarkably the results given by the aquifer model are
    in very good agreement with experimental data; but energy does not provide correct
    estimators (orange curve) and therefore model estimate (red curve) is incorrect.
    This fact is detected by the error indicator which does not converge to zero with
    time. This is in agreement with the documented change in water provision. Figure
    10 shows the evolution of the error in terms of water flow rate. Most of the time
    the error is around 6.5 m. A simple estimate of the water energy losses parameter
    is given by the mean value of the error, discarding staring time. This gives 𝐶
    𝑉,𝑆1 𝑞2 =−19.683 m s 2 /dm 6 for 1st set of parameters and 𝐶 𝑉,𝑆2 𝑞2 =−19.867
    for the second. Note that these values can be updated during the data process
    stage with a simple computation (arithmetic mean). The value can be also updated
    with least squares considering the water level measured data, off-line, in the
    calibration stage. This later result is similar to previous ones 𝐶 𝑉 𝑞2 =−19.919
    m s 2 /dm 6 , and common to both cases as it is computed directly from measured
    water level data. Figure 10. Validation. 2nd set of parameters. (a) Left: Water
    flow evolution, measured (black) and adjusted (blue). Right: Water level evolution,
    measured (black) and simulated (blue, orange and red). (b) Error estimation evolution,
    left, and relationship with water flow square, right. The parameter 𝐶 𝑎𝑞 which
    characterizes simplified hydraulic modelling has been recalibrated with first
    pumping period of validation. Results are indicated as 𝐶 𝑉 𝑎𝑞 in Table 3. Variations
    with respect to calibration are low, specially considering the overall range of
    variation of this parameter. Results are indistinguishable with the second set
    of parameters. There is a slightly larger difference (not reproduced here) with
    the first one. Figure 11 shows the estimated results for the overall validation
    period. Errors during staring pumping and recovery are significant, punctually
    of 5% of H with the second set of parameters. However, most of the time are close
    to zero. The signal during the third pumping period was lost, thus the model predicts
    the recovery water table evolution from this time forward. Without real-time information
    of real power and water flow rate the model fails to predict water table evolution.
    Three details of the overall validation test are presented in Figure 12. The results
    are in very good agreement, except during transitions between recovery–pumping,
    for a short period of time. Figure 11. Validation. (a) Left, water level evolution,
    measured (black) and simulated (red) with the 1st set of parameters (updated).

    parameters (updated). Figure 12. Validation. 2nd set of parameters. Water level
    evolution. Zoom. 9. Conclusions and Future Work Water is currently a scarce and
    precious good and, therefore, mechanisms for managing it that are affordable,
    particularly for those communities with limited resources, should be provided.
    In this work we introduce a low-cost water monitoring device a LoRa communication
    approach. The device performs measures of real power consumption, instant and
    accumulated water flow, an estimates the present and future location of the water
    table in a fairly precise way. The proposal only needs off-line computation for
    calibration of system parameters in terms of measured water level evolution during
    a pumping–recovery cycle, which makes it possible to reduce communication costs.
    This device has been tested and evaluated in a laboratory environment in terms
    of energy consumption, temperature and performance. The energy consumption of
    the device is negligible compared to that of the monitored water pump. The device
    always operates in safe temperature ranges even in the worst conditions. The execution
    of data process stage with Fortran or even Python is fast enough in the cheapest
    hardware system (Raspberry Pi Zero W) with a CPU usage as low as 0.1%. Moreover,
    the proposed device was also tested in a real environment and its deployment shows
    that it is being very effective in evaluating the location of the water table.
    Our proposal introduces some limitations due to the different decisions that have
    been taken in its design. First, a number of simplifications of the well/aquifer
    behavior implicit in the Theis and Jacob model have been assumed and calibrated,
    but the actual well/aquifer behavior might differ slightly over time, thus some
    kind of periodic calibration processes would be necessary. Secondly, our device
    incorporates two microcontroller boards, but another approach could have been
    the use of a single microcontroller board providing a cheaper and more compact
    solution. On the other hand, the number of input/output ports dedicated to data
    sensors is determined by the current selection of Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards
    and, although it is suitable for our approach, it would not be very scalable assuming
    monitoring or control of complex irrigation systems. Finally, as our proposal
    is a do-it-yourself device, it can be difficult to use it in massive environments
    and also in technologically isolated areas, due to the need for end-user training
    for correct maintenance, or specialized technical services in the implementation
    areas. As future work, it is intended to efficiently deploy several prototypes
    of the device presented to build a distributed system along pumping systems sharing
    the same aquifer, so the different nodes can share the measurements and take into
    account crossing influences in the water level evolution of ecah one. Model extensions
    to deal with more complex aquifer modelling are expected to accurately reproduce
    other cases. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.M. and A.P.-F.; methodology,

  description: The rapid development of artificial intelligence together with the
    powerful computation capabilities of the advanced edge servers make it possible
    to deploy learning tasks at the wireless network edge, which is dubbed as edge
    intelligence (EI). The communication bottleneck between the data resource and
    the server results in deteriorated learning performance as well as tremendous
    energy consumption. To tackle this challenge, we explore a new paradigm called
    learning-and-energy-efficient (LEE) EI, which simultaneously maximizes the learning
    accuracies and energy efficiencies of multiple tasks via data partition and rate
    control. Mathematically, this results in a multi-objective optimization problem.
    Moreover, the continuously varying communication rates introduce infinite variables,
    which further complicates the problem. To solve this complex problem, we consider
    the case with infinite server buffer capacity and one-shot data arrival at sensor.
    First, the number of variables is reduced to a finite level by exploiting the
    optimality of constant-rate transmission in each epoch. Second, the optimal solution
    of the multi-objective problem is found by applying the stratified sequencing
    or merging of objectives. By assuming higher priority of learning efficiency in
    stratified sequencing, the optimal data partition is derived in closed form by
    the Lagrange method, while the optimal rate control is proved to have the structure
    of directional water filling (DWF), based on which a string-pulling (SP) algorithm
    is proposed to obtain the numerical values. The DWF structure of rate control
    is also proved to be optimal in merging of objectives, which combines different
    objectives in a weighted manner. By exploiting the optimal rate changing properties,
    the SP algorithm is further extended to tackle the more challenging cases with
    limited server buffer capacity or bursty data arrival at sensor. The performance
    of the proposed joint data partition and rate control design is examined by extensive
    experiments based on public datasets.

    of artificial intelligence (AI) [1] due to the strengthened computation capability
    of cloud servers and the tremendous data generated by Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    devices for model training [2]. Nonetheless, sending vast amount of data from
    IoT devices to the cloud server for learning causes a heavy communication burden
    in such machine-type communication system [3]. With the strengthened computation
    capability of edge servers (e.g., the network virtualization architecture standardized
    by 3GPP [4]), such a dilemma can be resolved by deploying AI tasks at the networks
    edge, which is known as edge intelligence (EI) [5]. In contrast to the conventional
    designs for maximizing the throughput, the communication designs for EI aim at
    improving the learning performance [6]. The new objective has led to a set of
    new communication techniques [7]–[16]. Realizing that the information required
    by learning tasks can be the statistics of data rather than the data itself, a
    series of research works advocate a new technique called over-the-air computation
    to support simultaneous access of multiple IoT devices and facilitate the data
    transmission for EI [7]–[11]. Another branch of research focuses on improving
    learning accuracy with the limited communication and/or computation resources
    [12]–[16]. To illustrate the impact of communication on learning accuracy, an
    empirical classification error model supported by learning theory was proposed
    in [12], based on which a learning centric power allocation scheme was designed.
    To accelerate the learning process, the joint optimization of batch-size selection
    and resource allocation was investigated in [13], while the joint design of computation
    load and bandwidth allocation was proposed in [14]. To improve the learning accuracy,
    the resource allocation and device scheduling were jointly optimized in [15] and
    [16]. Despite the extensive efforts on improving learning accuracy, energy consumption
    becomes non-negligible in both the communication and learning processes [17].
    To acquire enough energy, a sustainable learning scheme was proposed in [18] and
    [19] that leverages intermittent harvested energy from environments. Moreover,
    wireless power transfer was adopted in [20] to power the devices for data transmission
    and model training. Another vein of research tackles the shortage of energy in
    EI via resource allocation [21]–[24]. For instance, by exploiting the data redundancy,
    an energy-aware analog transmission scheme for EI was designed in [21]. To minimize
    the energy consumption in EI, the computation and communication resource allocations
    were jointly optimized in [22] and [23]. In [24], the heterogenous CPU-GPU computation
    capabilities were exploited to improve the energy efficiency of EI. It should
    be noted that the above works focus on myopic resource allocation assuming only
    a single learning task is conducted at the server, while a server may have multiple
    models to be trained sequentially over different types of data. The rate-control
    policy over different types of data accounting for such scenario remains uncharted.
    The investigation of rate control policy can be traced back to the earlier works
    on conventional communication networks. It was found in [25] that the energy for
    transmitting given amount of data can be reduced by varying packet transmission
    time. Based on such finding, a long-term rate control scheme with string-pulling
    (SP) structure was proposed to minimize the energy consumption under the quality
    of service constraints [26], and was extended for the case with limited data buffer
    capacity [27]. Inspired by the SP structure, the subsequent work investigated
    long-term rate control schemes for a variety of communication systems [28]–[30].
    In energy harvesting systems, the SP structure was proved to be optimal in power
    control for minimizing the transmission delay given the profiles of energy arrivals
    [28] and battery capacity [29]. In mobile edge computing systems, the optimal
    offloading data size over the whole computing duration for energy consumption
    minimization was determined based on the SP structure given the CPU-state information
    [30]. Despite the rich literature on long-term rate control policy in the literatures,
    there exists an additional data partition problem on top of the rate control to
    guarantee the learning accuracy for a EI system with multiple tasks. To incorporate
    the data partition in transmission design for EI, the current work investigates
    the effects of data sample size on the learning accuracy and energy efficiency.
    In particular, collecting more samples for model training can improve the learning
    performance especially when the server falls short of data, while the data transmission
    brings extra energy consumption. Such effects lead to a tradeoff between the learning
    accuracy and energy consumption, where the former can be characterized by a well-known
    classification error model in [12], [31]–[34] derived using the learning theory
    [35], and the latter is based on the Shannon’s theory. To achieve learning-and-energy
    efficient (LEE) EI, the data partition and rate control for long-term transmission
    are jointly designed in this paper. Since the control variables emerge in both
    the performance metrics of learning and energy, which causes nontrivial coupling
    and thus complicates the problem. By exploiting the optimal structure of data
    transmission as well as the optimization theory, the optimal designs are derived
    accounting for multiple scenarios. The main contributions of this work are summarized
    below. Joint Data Partition and Rate Control (JDPRC) Design: Consider one-shot
    data arrival at sensor and infinite server data buffer capacity. To improve the
    learning accuracy as well as the energy efficiency, the data partition and rate
    control are jointly optimized, which results in a multi-objective optimization
    problem. Moreover, the continuous varying rates introduce infinite variables,
    which further complicates the problem. To solve this complex problem, we first
    reduce the number of variables to a finite level by exploiting the optimality
    of constant-rate transmission in each epoch. Second, the optimal solution of the
    multi-objective problem is found by applying stratified sequencing or merging
    of objectives. By assuming higher priority of learning efficiency in stratified
    sequencing, the optimal data partition is derived in closed form by the Lagrange
    method, while the optimal rate control is proved to have the structure of directional
    water filling (DWF), based on which a string-pulling (SP) algorithm is proposed
    to obtain the numerical values. The DWF structure of rate control is also proved
    to be optimal in merging of objectives via weighted summation. JDPRC with Limited
    Server Data Buffer Capacity: The above solution approach is further extended to
    account for the case with limited server data buffer capacity. Geometrically,
    the optimal rate control policy involves finding a shortest path under the constraints
    of the required data size and data buffer capacity. By exploiting the optimal
    rate changing properties, a revised version of SP algorithm for rate control is
    proved to be optimal. JDPRC with Bursty Data Arrival at Sensor: The continuous
    data arriving curve at sensor adds infinite constraints on the rate control, which
    makes the optimization problem hard to be solved. For the tractability concern,
    such curve is approximated by finite segments, based on which the SP algorithm
    is revised to obtain the transmission rates. Validation by Testing on Public Datasets:
    Extensive experimental results based on public datasets (including Scikit-learn,
    MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, ModelNet-40) show that the proposed JDPRC is able
    to achieve higher accuracy as well as lower energy consumption than the schemes
    with the equal data partition and/or equal rate control. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows. The system model and problem formulation are described
    in Section II. The optimal data partition and rate control in the case with one-shot
    data arrival at sensor and infinite server data buffer capacity are presented
    in Section III, which is further extended to account for the cases with limited
    data buffer capacity and bursty data arrival in Sections IV and V respectively.
    The experimental results based on public datasets are presented in Section VI.
    The conclusions are drawn in Section VII. SECTION II. System Model and Problem
    Formulation As depicted in Fig. 1, the EI system comprises one server and one
    sensor both equipped with single antenna. The server has N model training tasks
    in a sequencing manner at instants { t 1 , t 2 ,… t N } . The number of data samples
    for training the n -th model at the server is x n =⌊ D n d n ⌋+ c n ≈ D n d n
    + c n , (1) View Source where D n represents the bits of data transmitted by the
    sensor for training the n -th model, d n represents the bits of data per sample,
    and c n denotes the previously stored samples at the server for the n -th model.
    The approximation is based on ⌊x⌋≈x when x≫1 . The model training and data transmission
    processes are presented in the following sub-sections. Fig. 1. EI system with
    multiple learning tasks. Show All A. Model Training Process The data samples are
    assumed to be independent and identically distributed. Therefore, the relationship
    between the learning error e n and the number of data samples x n can be depicted
    by the widely adopted inverse power law model in [12], [31]–[34], which is supported
    by statistical mechanics of learning [35] and expressed as e n ( x n , a n , b
    n )= a n x − b n n , (2) View Source where a n >0 and b n >0 are learning hyper-parameters.
    To train the n -th model with error no larger than e n , at least D n bits of
    data need to be passed from the sensor to the server before t n .1 The time interval
    between any two successive task instants is regarded as an epoch with the length
    T n = t n − t n−1 for n=1,…N and t 0 =0 . Datum with different types are assumed
    to be collected by and stored in the sensor before the transmission with the total
    amount of D , which is also known as one-shot data arrival at t 0 . A more practical
    scenario w.r.t. bursty data arrival is further analyzed in the subsequent sections,
    where the data collection and transmission are simultaneously processed at the
    sensor. B. Data Transmission Process To satisfy the requirements of model training,
    the sensor transmits data continuously and its rate can be varied via power control.
    Specifically, the sensor can choose transmission rate r(t) at any instant t .
    The energy consumption for transmitting the required data by all N learning tasks
    can be expressed as E=E[ ∫ t N t=0 ( e r(t)/B −1) σ 2 g dt]= ∫ t N t=0 ( e r(t)/B
    −1) σ 2 h dt, (3) View Source where B , σ 2 , and g denotes the bandwidth, noise,
    and instantaneous channel power gain, respectively. E denotes the expectation
    over channels coefficients and thus h=1/E[1/g] represents the power gain of ergodic
    channel [36].2 The transmit power budget is assumed to be large enough such that
    the rate resulting from optimization can never be larger than what is allowed
    by the power constraint. To guarantee the execution of each task, the amount of
    transmitted data should be no less than the required one, which is known as the
    data transmission constraints: ∫ t j t=0 r(t)dt≥ ∑ n=1 j D n ,j=1,…N. (4) View
    Source If the size of data that can be transmitted in the n -th epoch is larger
    than the size of required data by the n -th task, such epoch can be used to transmit
    the data for subsequent tasks. The extra received data at the server can be stored
    in a data buffer. To gain the insights, the capacity of data buffer is assumed
    to be infinite and the channel condition is assumed to be fixed throughout the
    training duration. The analysis is further extended to the case with limited data
    buffer capacity. C. Problem Formulation To achieve the energy efficient data transmission
    for high accuracy model training, both the learning errors and the transmission
    energy consumption need to be minimized by optimizing data partition and rate
    control. Therefore, the performance metrics can be expressed as f({ D n },r(t))=[{
    f 1 ( D n )}, f 2 (r(t))], (5) View Source where f 1 ( D n )= a n ( D n d n +
    c n ) − b n and f 2 (r(t))= ∫ t N t=0 ( e r(t)/B −1) σ 2 h dt denotes the learning
    errors and transmission energy consumption, respectively. The server is assumed
    to be provisioned with adequate computing power. The corresponding optimization
    problem can be formulated as min { D n ≥0}, {r(t)≥0}  f({ D n },r(t)) (P1)s.t.  ∫
    t j t=0 r(t)dt≥ ∑ n=1 j D n ,j=1,…N, ∑ n=1 N D n ≤D. (6a) (6b) View Source Note
    that ∫ t N t=0 r(t)dt= ∑ N n=1 D n must hold, otherwise one can always decrease
    some r(t) without conflicting any constraints, and thus reduce the energy consumption.
    The constraint in Eq. (6a) guarantees the transmission of required amount of data.
    The constraint in Eq. (6b) gives the total data budget. As there are multiple
    objectives in this problem, there exists a set of optimums at which improving
    the performance w.r.t. one objective will sacrifice that of others. Moreover,
    since r(t) is continuous in [0, t N ] , there are infinite optimization variables
    in problem (P1). To deal with such problem, a series of properties are exploited
    in the subsequent section. SECTION III. Optimal Data Partition and Rate Control
    In this section, the original problem is first simplified without loss of optimality
    by converting the continuous variables {r(t)} into discrete variables { r n }
    based on the optimal structure of rate control. Next, to tackle the challenge
    of multiple objectives, two methods namely stratified sequencing and merging of
    objectives are proposed. The former is to optimize the data partition and rate
    control in a sequential manner by assuming that the learning accuracy has high
    priority, while the later is based on the weighted summation of multiple objectives.
    A. Optimal Structure of Rate Control As for the objective of energy minimization,
    since the constant-rate transmission within each epoch is energy-efficient [27],
    the optimal structure of rate control is given in the following lemma as proved
    in the extended version [38]. Lemma 1 (Optimality of Constant Transmission Rate):For
    any data partition { D n } , a constant-rate transmission is optimal in a time
    interval [ t a , t b ) if it satisfies the data transmission constraints in that
    interval. Based on Lemma III-A, the optimal data transmission rate r(t) in the
    n -th epoch should be a constant denoted as r n , and thus the problem (P1) can
    be simplified as: min { D n ≥0}, { r n ≥0}  f({ D n },{ r n }) (P2)s.t.   ∑ n=1
    j r n T n ≥ ∑ n=1 j D n ,j=1,…N, ∑ n=1 N D n ≤D. (7a) (7b) (7c) View Source B.
    Solution Approach Based on Stratified Sequencing Suppose that the training error
    minimization has higher priority than energy consumption minimization, a stratified
    sequencing method is proposed in this sub-section. The original problem (P2) can
    be divided into two sub-problems, where the first one aims at minimizing the weighted
    summation of classification errors via data partition, i.e., min { D n ≥0}  ∑
    n=1 N β n a n ( D n d n + c n ) − b n (P2a)s.t.   ∑ n=1 N D n ≤D. (8a) (8b) View
    Source It can be easily observed that (P2a) is a convex problem with convex objective
    function and linear constraints. The Lagrange function of this problem can be
    expressed as L= ∑ n=1 N β n a n ( D n d n + c n ) − b n +λ( ∑ n=1 N D n −D). (9)
    View Source Then, applying Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions leads to the following
    necessary and sufficient conditions: ∂L ∂ D n =λ− β n a n b n d n ( D n d n +
    c n ) − b n −1 =0, λ( ∑ n=1 N D n −D)=0. (10a) (10b) View Source Combining these
    conditions yields the optimal data partition given as D ∗ n = d n ( β n a n b
    n λ ∗ d n ) 1 b n +1 − c n d n . (11) View Source It can be observed that λ≠0
    (otherwise D ∗ n is infinite large), and thus ∑ N n=1 D n =D must hold: ∑ n=1
    N [ d n ( β n a n b n λ ∗ d n ) 1 b n +1 − c n d n ]=D. (12) View Source Since
    the left hand side monotonically decreases with the increasing λ , the optimal
    λ ∗ can be derived by the bisection search as illustrated in Algorithm 1. Algorithm

    Calculate D ∗ n = d n ( β n a n b n λ ∗ d n ) 1 b n +1 − c n d n . 12: Return
    the optimal data partition { D ∗ n } . After determining the optimal { D ∗ n }
    by solving problem (P2a), the second sub-problem aims at energy consumption minimization
    via rate control: min { r n ≥0}  ∑ n=1 N ( e r n /B −1) σ 2 T n h (P2b)s.t.   ∑
    n=1 j r n T n ≥ ∑ n=1 j D n ,j=1,…N. (13a) (13b) View Source If can be observed
    that problem (P2b) is convex with convex objective and linear constraints. The
    Lagrange function of this problem can be expressed as L= ∑ n=1 N ( e r n /B −1)
    σ 2 T n h + ∑ j=1 N μ j ( ∑ n=1 j D n − ∑ n=1 j r n T n ). (14) View Source Then,
    applying KKT conditions leads to the following necessary and sufficient conditions:
    ∂L ∂ r n = e r n /B σ 2 T n hB − ∑ j=n N μ j T n =0, μ j ( ∑ n=1 j D n − ∑ n=1
    j r n T n )=0, j=1,…,N. (15a) (15b) View Source Combining these conditions yields
    the optimal transmission rates given as r ∗ n =B [ln hB ∑ N j=n μ ∗ j σ 2 ] +
    . (16) View Source It can be observed from Eq. (16) that the optimal rates depend
    on the Lagrange multipliers { μ j ≥0} . To derive the specific values, the property
    of optimal rate control is exploited in the following lemma as proved in the extended
    version [38]. Lemma 2 (Optimality of Non-increasing Transmission Rates):For any
    epoch n , the optimal transmission rate r ∗ n is monotonically decreasing, i.e.,
    r ∗ n+1 ≤ r ∗ n . Moreover, if the data buffer is non-empty at the instant t j
    , i.e., ∑ j n=1 r n T n > ∑ j n=1 D n , the optimal transmission rate must obey
    that r ∗ j+1 = r ∗ j . Such property can be referred to the directional water-filling
    scheme in energy harvesting investigation [37], while the water levels represent
    transmission rates here. As shown in Fig. 2, if r 1 < r 2 , part of data for subsequent
    learning tasks can be passed in the former epoch so that the levels can be equalized.
    However, no data can flow from left to right since the data received in later
    epochs cannot be used for training the previous models though r 2 > r 3 . Fig.
    2. Directional water-filling scheme for rate control. Show All Based on Lemmas
    III-A and III-B, one can characterize the optimal rate control in the following
    way. Given task instants { t n } and learning hyper-parameters { a n , b n } ,
    the required size of data is plotted as a function of t , which is a staircase
    curve in Fig. 3. The total amount of transmitted data up to time t can also be
    represented as a continuous curve, depicted by the dashed line in Fig. 3. In order
    to satisfy the data transmission constraints, the curve of transmitted data size
    must lie above the curve of required data size at all times. Based on Lemma III-A,
    the optimal curve of transmitted data size must be linear in each epoch, and the
    slope of the segment corresponds to the transmission rate. Lemma III-B implies
    that whenever the slope changes, the curve of transmitted data size must touch
    the curve of required data size at that instant. Therefore, the first linear segment
    of the curve of transmitted data size must be one of the lines connecting the
    origin and a corner point on the curve of required data size. Because of the monotonicity
    property of the rate given in Lemma III-B, among these lines, the one with the
    maximal slope should be picked. Otherwise, either the data transmission constraints
    or the monotonicity property given in Lemma III-B will be violated. Based on the
    above analysis, the structure of the optimal policy can be expressed in the following
    proposition as proved in the extended version [38]. Fig. 3. Interpretation of
    rate control satisfying Lemmas III-A and III-B. Show All Proposition 1 (Optimal
    Rate Control Policy):Consider a policy with transmission rate vector r=[ r 1 ,
    r 2 ,…, r i ,…] and corresponding duration vector T=[ T 1 , T 2 ,…, T i …] . This
    policy is optimal if and only if it has the following structure: j i = r i = T
    i = arg max j: j i−1 <j≤N ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ∑ j n= j i−1 +1 D n t j − t j i−1 ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ , ⎧ ⎩
    ⎨ ∑ j i n= j i−1 +1 D n t j i − t j i−1 ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ , t j i − t j i−1 , (17a) (17b)
    (17c) View Source where j i is the index of instant when the rate r i is switched
    to r i+1 . From the results, one can conclude that given the required data amounts
    { D n } and starting instants { t n } of learning tasks, the optimal rate control
    policy is known via Proposition 1. In particular, the optimal rate control policy
    is the one that yields the tightest piecewise linear curve of transmitted data
    size that lies above the curve of required data size at all times and touches
    the curve of required data size at { t j i } , which is known as string-pulling.
    The procedure to obtain the optimal rate control policy is summarized in Algorithm

    on Merging of Objectives As an alternative approach for solving the multi-objective
    problem, the weighted summation is applied to merge the multiple objectives into
    one. The weights of energy consumption and training errors are denoted by α and
    { β n } respectively, which satisfy that α+ ∑ N n=1 β n =1 . The corresponding
    problem can be expressed as min { D n ≥0}, { r n ≥0}  α ∑ n=1 N ( e r n /B −1)

    that the optimality of non-decreasing rates given by Lemma III-B still holds for
    the joint optimization of data partition and rate control after merging of objectives.
    The specific values of D ∗ n and r ∗ n can be obtained by the CVX Toolbox [39]
    for convex programming. D. Solution Approach for Guaranteeing the Worst-Case Learning
    Performance From the perspective of minimizing the energy consumption while guaranteeing
    the worst case learning performance, the problem can be formulated as: min { D

    observed from Eq. (24b) that the optimality of non-decreasing rates given by Lemma
    III-B still holds in the joint design for guaranteeing the worst-case learning
    performance. The specific values of D ∗ n and r ∗ n can be obtained by the CVX
    Toolbox [39] for convex programming. E. Extension to General Coupling Relationships
    Between the Objectives As for other coupling relationships between the objectives
    including exponential, logarithm, multiplication, and division, the optimization
    problems will become non-convex and thus need relaxation to obtain the sub-optimal
    solutions. For instance, the division between the summation of learning accuracies
    of tasks and energy consumption is defined as the energy efficiency of learning
    (EEL). The corresponding problem can be formulated as max { D n ≥0}, { r n ≥0}  ∑
    N n=1 β n (1− a n ( D n d n + c n ) − b n ) α ∑ N n=1 ( e r n /B −1) σ 2 T n h

    which is non-convex. To derive the solution, the Dinkelbach’s transform [40] can

    Capacity Case Inspired by the policy in the previous section, the data partition
    and rate control for limited data buffer capacity case are investigated in this
    section. Constrained by the maximum capacity D max of the buffer, the size of
    stored data should obey the data buffer constraints: ∑ n=1 j r n T n − ∑ n=0 j−1
    D n ≤ D max ,j=1,…N, (28) View Source where D 0 =0 represents that no data is
    required at instant t 0 . After incorporating the data buffer constraints, the
    optimization problem can be formulated as min {0≤ D n ≤ D max }, { r n ≥0}  f({
    D n },{ r n })  s.t. ∑ n=1 j r n T n ≥ ∑ n=1 j D n ,j=1,…N, (P8) ∑ n=1 j r n T

    Source A. Stratified Sequencing for the Case of Limited Buffer Capacity Similar
    to the solving approach for problem (P2), problem (P8) can also be divided into
    two sub-problems w.r.t. learning errors minimization and energy consumption minimization.
    The former sub-problem has the exact form of problem (P2a) plus the constraints
    0≤ D n ≤ D max  ∀ D n and can be solved by the CVX Toolbox, while solving the
    latter one requires exploiting the properties in the following lemmas proved in
    the extended version [38]. Lemma 1 (Sub-optimality of Data Buffer Overflow):Any
    transmission rate policy yielding a data buffer overflow is strictly sub-optimal.
    Lemma 2 (Rate Changing Condition):In the optimal transmission rate policy, the
    transmission rate does not change unless the data buffer is either full or empty.
    Lemma 3 (Rate Changing Direction):For optimal data transmission design, the change
    in rate r(t) cannot be negative (or positive) unless the data buffer is empty
    (or full) at this instant. Denote the subsequence of { t n } at which the transmission
    rate changes as { t u i } , the transmission rate has to be the form of r(t)=
    r i , ∀t∈[ t u i−1 , t u i ). (30) View Source Note that once the specifics of
    the first interval [0, t u 1 ] is determined, the remaining of the problem can
    be considered as a separate energy minimization problem. That is, given the duration
    of this interval t u 1 , and the amount of energy consumption in this epoch (
    e r 1 /B −1) σ 2 t u 1 h , it remains to solve for the optimal rate from a modified
    problem with task starting instants shifted by t u 1 and a new initial data buffer
    state r 1 t u 1 − ∑ u 1 n=0 D n . This means that once the first slot of the optimal
    rate is identified, the remaining rates can be found recursively with the same
    algorithm using updated parameters. Therefore, we shall focus on determining the
    optimal rate in the initial epoch. The modified problem described above is known
    as the shifted optimization problem. We define two sets of rates { r e [1], r
    e [2],…} and { r f [1], r f [2],…} , where r e [j] and r f [j] are the constant
    rates that would result in an empty data buffer at t + j or a full data buffer
    at t − j respectively if employed in [0, t j ] . We then define the set r={r[1],r[2]…}
    with elements as the closed intervals r[j]=[ r e [j], r f [j]] between corresponding
    elements of the two sets { r e } and { r f } . This translates to a range of constant
    rates that would be feasible for the j -th epoch when the feasibility at previous
    epochs are disregarded. Therefore, we have r e [j]= r f [j]= r[j]= ∑ j n=0 D n
    t j , ∑ j−1 n=0 D n + D max t j , [ r e [j], r f [j]]={r| r e [j]≤r≤ r f [j]},
    (31a) (31b) (31c) View Source for j=1,…,N . Based on this definition of the feasible
    rate region, it can be deducted that for a constant rate transmission starting
    from t=0 to the u -th task starting instant without violating data feasibility,
    its rate should be contained in the range r[j] for j=1,…,u , i.e., the step should
    be feasible through all display it extends over. This yields an upper bound u
    b on the length of the first constant rate transmission, which can be calculated
    as u b =max{u| ⋂ j=1 u r[j]≠∅,j=1,2,…,N}. (32) View Source As for the later displays,
    a feasible constant rate contained in all previous feasible rate ranges do not
    exist. Given the sets of { r e [j]} and { r f [j]} , assume that a constant rate
    r 1 and duration t u 1 is feasible. This transmission then satisfies r 1 ∈ ⋂ u
    1 j=1 r[j] and cannot extend beyond t u b , as it is rendered infeasible at t
    u b +1 by one of the constraints. As shown in Fig. 4, a transmission with constant-rate
    r 1 either fails to satisfy the required data size or overflows the data buffer
    at t u b +1 . The former case implies that the rate after t u 1 needs to increase,
    and the latter implies that the rate needs to decrease. This can be verified by
    calculating updated values of r e [j] and r f [j] for a shifted problem after
    the first step of the policy is determined. By Lemma 3, an increase or decrease
    in rate can occur only at a instant with the data buffer empty or full. Hence,
    the choice of r 1 in the optimal policy is restricted to r e [ u 1 ] or r f [
    u 1 ] respectively for the two cases in consideration, where u 1 =max{u| r e [u]∈
    ⋂ u b j=1 r[j]} if r[ u b +1] falls below ⋂ u b j=1 r[j] , otherwise u 1 =max{u|
    r f [u]∈ ⋂ u b j=1 r[j]} . Based on the above findings, Algorithm 3 is designed
    for energy efficient rate control with the optimality given in the following theorem
    as proved in the extended version [38]. Algorithm 3 String Pulling for Rate Control

    Fig. 4. The region of feasible rates. Show All Theorem 1 (Optimal Rate Control
    for Limited Data Buffer Capacity Case):Algorithm 3 yields the optimal transmission
    rate control. The feasible data transmission tunnel with limited data buffer capacity
    is shown in Fig. 5. The lower solid boundary represents the required data size
    for learning tasks and the upper solid boundary is the lower boundary shifted
    up by an amount of D max . The cumulative data transmitted by Algorithm 3 forms
    a continuous line, and must stay within this tunnel. A transmission rate that
    goes above the tunnel causes a data buffer overflow, while one that goes below
    the tunnel fails to transmit the required amount of data. The sets { r e [j]}
    and { r f [j]} correspond to the slopes of lines from the origin to each of the
    corner points in the tunnel as shown with dashed lines. The algorithm first determines
    the longest constant-rate transmission that stays within this tunnel, and then
    determines whether the furthest point on a wall that a line passing through the
    origin can reach is an upper bound or a lower bound. This is accomplished by comparing
    the first unreachable interval r[ u b +1] with the earlier ones. Finally, the
    algorithm selects the longest feasible constant-rate transmission that ends in
    one of the sets { r e [j]} and { r f [j]} , allowing a change in transmission
    rate for the rest of the problem. Fig. 5. The feasible data transmission tunnel

    Limited Buffer Capacity):It can be observed from Eq. (35b) that the optimal transmission
    rate might increase or decrease between epochs. If the data buffer is non-empty
    at the instant t j , i.e., ∑ j n=1 r n T n > ∑ j n=1 D n , then μ ∗ j =0 and thus
    the optimal transmission rate won’t decrease. In contrast, if the data buffer
    is not full at t j , i.e., ∑ j n=1 r n T n − ∑ j−1 n=0 D n < D max , then υ ∗
    j =0 and thus the optimal transmission rate won’t increase. Moreover, if the data
    buffer is neither empty nor full at t j , then the optimal transmission rate won’t
    change since μ ∗ j =0 and υ ∗ j =0 . The above findings are in accordance with
    Lemmas 1–3. The specific values of D ∗ n and r ∗ n can be obtained by the CVX
    Toolbox [39] for convex programming. SECTION V. Data Partition and Rate Control
    for Bursty Data Arrival Case In this section, a more practical scenario is considered
    where the data for model training is not stored in the sensor at the beginning
    but arrives during transmissions. As depicted by the upper solid curve in Fig.
    6, the amount of data collected by sensor is a continuous non-decreasing function
    with time denoted by A(τ) , which adds a series of constraints as follows ∫ τ

    tunnel with bursty data arrival. Show All Problem (P10) can be divided into two
    sub-problems w.r.t. training error minimization and energy consumption minimization.
    The former sub-problem can be formulated as   min { D n ≥0}  ∑ n=1 N β n a n (
    D n d n + c n ) − b n (P10a) s.t. ∑ n=1 N D n ≤D,  ∑ n=1 j D n ≤A( t j ),j=1,…N.

    problem with convex objective function and linear constraints. Therefore, the
    optimal data partition { D ∗ n } can be obtained by applying the CVX ToolBox.
    As for energy consumption minimization, it should be noted that the continuous
    function A(τ) impedes the discretization of optimization variables {r(t)} . For
    the tractability concern, the data arrival curve is approximated by M segments
    with total {A( t m )} bits of data collected by the instants { t m } as depicted
    by the dotted lines in Fig. 6, where { t n }⊂{ t m } and t N = t M .3 The corresponding

    [m] denote the lowest constant rate that can satisfy the data transmission constraint
    and r high [m] denote the highest constant rate that can satisfy the data arrival
    constraint in [0, t m ] . The range of constant-rate levels that would be feasible
    for the m -th epoch is defined by the interval r[m]=[ r low [m], r high [m]] .
    Therefore, we have r low [m]= ∑ n:0≤ t n < t m D n t m , r high [m]= A( t m )

    Source Given the sets of { r e [j]} and { r f [j]} , assume that a constant rate
    r 1 over duration t v 1 is feasible. This transmission then satisfies r 1 ∈ ⋂
    v 1 m=1 r[m] and cannot extend beyond t v b , as it is rendered infeasible at
    t v b +1 by one of the constraints. A transmission with constant-rate r 1 either
    fails to satisfy the data transmission or arrival constraint at t v b +1 . The
    former case implies that the rate after t v 1 needs to increase, and the latter
    implies that the rate needs to decrease. Since an increase or decrease in rate
    can occur only at the instant when the data arrival or transmission constraint
    is active, the choice of r 1 in the optimal policy is restricted to r low [ v
    1 ] and r high [ v 1 ] respectively for the two cases in consideration, where
    v 1 =max{v| r e [v]∈ ⋂ v b m=1 r[m]} if r[ v b +1] falls below ⋂ v b m=1 r[m]

    Results This section provides simulation results to evaluate the performance of
    the proposed algorithms. Each point in the figures is obtained by averaging over
    10 simulation runs, with independent channels in each run. All the algorithms
    are programed in Matlab R2021a on a desktop with Intel Xeon E5-1620 v3 CPU at
    3.5 GHz and 32GB RAM. All the optimization problems after merging of objectives
    are solved by the CVX Toolbox in the same Matlab platform. All the classifiers
    are trained by Python 3.6.12 on a GPU server with Intel Xeon E5-2678 v3 CPU at
    2.5 GHz and NVIDIA TITAN XP GPU. A. Parameter Settings For the EI system, we consider
    the case of N=5 different learning tasks at the server: 1) Classification of Scikit-learn
    dataset [41] via support vector machines (SVM); 2) Classification of MNIST dataset
    [42] via convolutional neural networks (CNN); 3) Classification of Fashion-MNIST
    dataset [43] via CNN; 4) Classification of CIFAR-10 dataset [44] via 32-layer
    deep residual network (ResNet-32); 5) Classification of 3D point clouds dataset
    ModelNet40 [45] via PointNet. These 5 tasks are expected to be executed at instants
    {10,20,30,50,100}s , respectively. The architectures of the neural networks are
    depicted in Fig. 1. In task-1, the SVM uses the penalty coefficient C=1 and Gaussian
    kernel function K( x i , x j )=exp(−γ×|| x i − x j | | 2 ) with γ=0.001 . The
    SVM classifier is trained on the digit dataset in the Scikit-learn Python machine
    learning toolbox, which contains 1797 images of size 8×8 from 10 classes, with
    5 bits (corresponding to integers 0 to 16) for each pixel. Therefore, each data
    sample contains D n =8×8×5+4=324 bits (4 bits are reserved for the labels of 10
    classes). Out of all images, the SVM is trained using the first 1000 samples and
    the later 797 samples are used for testing. By varying the sample size x 1 as
    { x (o) 1 }={30,50,70,100,300,500,700,1000} , one can obtain the classification
    error Φ 1 ( x (o) 1 ) for each sample size x (o) 1 , where o=1,…,O with O=8 denoting
    the number of points to be fitted. By applying the following non-linear least
    squares fitting min { a n ≥0},{ b n ≥0} 1 O ∑ o=1 O | Φ n ( x (o) n )− e n ( x
    n , a n , b n ) | 2 , (43) View Source the tuning parameters for task-1 can be
    obtained as ( a 1 , b 1 )=(8.58,0.86) . The task-2 is to train a 6-layer CNN based
    on the public MNIST dataset. Since the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset
    are grayscale images with 28×28 pixels (each pixel has 8 bits), in this case each
    data sample contains 8×28×28+4=6276 bits. The input image is sequentially fed
    into a 5×5 convolution layer (with ReLu activation, 32 channels, and SAME padding),
    a 2×2 max pooling layer, then another 5×5 convolution layer (with ReLu activation,
    64 channels, and SAME padding), a 2×2 max pooling layer, a fully connected layer
    with 128 units (with ReLu activation), and a softmax output layer (with 10 outputs).
    The training procedure is implemented via Adam optimizer with a learning rate
    of 10 −4 and a mini-batch size of 100. After training for 5000 iterations, the
    model is testified on a validation dataset with 1000 unseen samples to compute
    the classification error. By varying the sample size x 2 as { x (o) 2 }={50,100,300,500,1000,3000,5000,10000}
    , the tuning parameters for task-2 can be obtained as ( a 2 , b 2 )=(3.94,0.53)
    . As for task-3, the CNN model in task-2 is trained based on the Fashion-MNIST
    dataset, which comprises 28×28 grayscale images of 70000 fashion products from
    10 categories, with 7000 images per category. The training set has 60000 images
    and the test set has 10000 images. By varying the sample size x 3 as { x (o) 3
    }={50,100,300,500,1000,3000,5000,10000} , the tuning parameters for task-3 are
    obtained as ( a 3 , b 3 )=(3.89,0.52) . The task-4 is to train the ResNet-32 with
    1.7 M parameters using the CIFAR-10 dataset as the input images. The image in
    the CIFAR-10 dataset has 32×32 pixels (each pixel has 3 Bytes representing RGB),
    and each image sample has a size of (32×32×3+1)×8=24584 bits. The training procedure
    is implemented with a diminishing learning rate and a mini-batch size of 100.
    After training for 50000 iterations, the trained model is tested on a dataset
    with 10000 unseen samples, and obtain the corresponding classification error.
    By varying the sample size x 4 as { x (o) 4 }={500,1000,5000,10000,20000,30000,40000,50000}
    , the tuning parameters for task-4 are obtained as ( a 4 , b 4 )=(9.56,0.44) .
    As for task-5, the PointNet with 3.5 M parameters applies feature transformations
    and aggregates point features by max pooling to classify 3D point clouds dataset
    ModelNet-40. In ModelNet-40, there are 12311 CAD models from 40 object categories,
    split into 9843 for training and 2468 for testing. Each sample has 2000 points
    with three single precision floating-point coordinates (4 Bytes), and the data
    size per sample is (2000×3×4+1)×8=192008 bits. Given the sample size x 5 as {
    x (o) 5 }={50,100,500,1000,3000,5000,7000,9000} , after training for 250 epochs
    with a mini-batch size of 32, the tuning parameters for task-5 are obtained as
    ( a 5 , b 5 )=(2.55,0.38) . The fitting curves for the above 5 tasks are depicted
    in Fig. 7. In practical scenarios, the estimated values of ( a n , b n ) can be
    obtained via extrapolation [12]. It has been tested that the estimation error
    can be controlled within 5% by selecting the proper amount of experimental data
    for curve fitting. The number of local samples at the server for the 5 tasks are
    assumed to be {10,100,100,1000,100} , respectively. According to the settings
    in NB-IoT [46], the spectrum bandwidth B=180 KHz and the noise power σ 2 =−114.4
    dBm. The channel is assumed to follow Racian fading, and thus is modeled as g=
    Ω n K 1+K − − − − − − √ g ¯ + Ω n 1+K − − − − − − √ g ˆ , View Source where the
    Rician factor K=10 , the average fading power gain Ω=5× 10 −4 × d −2 , the distance
    between the sensor and server d is assumed to be 1 m, the line-of-sight (LOS)
    component g ¯ is equal to one, and g ˆ n is a random value with distribution CN(0,1)
    representing small-scale fading. The weights of energy consumption and training
    errors are randomly selected with the summation equal to 1. In addition to our
    proposed joint design of data partition and rate control denoted by JDPRC, 3 benchmark
    schemes are considered for performance comparison. The EDP scheme is to equally
    partition the data to 5 tasks and optimize the rate control. The ERC scheme is
    to optimize the data partition based on a constant transmission rate over the
    whole duration. The EDPRC scheme adopts both the equal data partition and constant
    transmission rate. Fig. 7. Curve fitting for the learning tasks. Show All B. JDPRC
    for One-Shot Data Arrival and Unlimited Data Buffer (ODAUDB) Case To examine our
    proposed JDPRC scheme, the performance metrics (i.e., weighted summation of energy
    consumption and testing errors on public datasets) versus the total amount of
    data are plotted in Fig. 8(a). It can be observed that the performance metrics
    monotonically decreases with the increasing the total amount of data, while the
    decreasing trend is becoming less steep. This is due to the fact that more available
    data can help reducing the classification errors to some extent, but such benefit
    disappears when there are enough data samples for model training. Moreover, our
    proposed JDPRC scheme can significantly reduces the weighted summation of energy
    consumption and classification errors compared with other 3 benchmark schemes,
    which verifies the performance gain brought by the joint optimization. Given total
    10 7 bits of data samples, the specific data partition and rate control structures
    based on JDPRC scheme are depicted in Fig. 8(b). One can observe that the optimal
    transmission rates are non-increasing and only decreases when the data buffer
    is empty, which is in accordance with the Lemma III-B. Fig. 8. a) Performance
    metrics versus total amount of data with N=5 ; b) Optimal structure of data partition
    and rate control with N=5 and D= 10 7 bits; c) Theoretical and experimental classification
    errors with D= 10 7 bits; d) Classification errors of individual tasks with D=
    10 7 bits. Show All To testify the accuracy of curve fitting, the theoretical
    values based on fitting curves and the experimental values based on public datasets
    are illustrated in Fig. 8(c) given total 10 7 bits of available data. It can be
    observed that the theoretical results align with the experimental results very
    well. From Fig. 8(d), it can be observed that the learning accuracies of the EDP,
    ERC, and EDPRC schemes are highly imbalanced due to excessive transmission of
    samples for learning tasks 1-2 and insufficient transmission of samples for learning
    tasks 3-5. The proposed JDPRC effectively mitigates such unfairness and achieves
    the desired balanced performance. Therefore, it achieves a significantly smaller
    weighted average classification error than that of other benchmark schemes. C.
    JDPRC for Limited Data Buffer (LDB) or Bursty Data Arrival (BDA) Cases The performance
    of our proposed JDPRC scheme is further testified in the cases with limited data
    buffer or bursty data arrival, respectively. Without loss of generality, the capacity
    of data buffer is set as D max =2.6× 10 6 bits, while the arrived data amounts
    are approximately set as [0.5,2,3.5,4,8,9,10]× 10 6 bits at instants {10,20,30,40,50,70,100}s
    . As shown in Fig. 9(a), the JDPRC scheme has similar performances in these three
    cases at the shortage of data, while the gap between them becomes larger with
    the increasing amount of data. This is due to the fact that the limited data buffer
    capacity in LDA case or limited amount of arrived data in BDA case becomes the
    main impediment for data partition given the abundant total amount of data. Fig.
    9. a) Performance metrics versus total amount of data in different cases; b) Optimal
    structure of data partition and rate control in LDB case with; c) Optimal structure
    of data partition and rate control in BDA case; d) Energy consumption and weighted
    average classification error in different cases. Show All Given total 10 7 bits
    of data samples, the specific data partition and rate control structures for LDB
    and BDA cases are depicted in Fig. 9(b) and Fig. 9(c), respectively. One can observe
    that the transmission rate decreases only when the data buffer is empty and increases
    only when the data buffer is full in LDB case, which is in accordance with Lemma
    2 and 3. As for BDA case, the transmission rate decreases only when the data buffer
    is empty, and increases only at data arrival instant before which all data at
    sensor is transmitted. As shown in Fig. 9(d), the energy consumptions caused by
    the JDPRC scheme are quite similar in all three cases, and the performance gap
    is mainly due to the difference between classification errors. SECTION VII. Conclusion
    In this paper, we have investigated the design of data partition and rate control
    for learning-and-energy efficient long-term transmission. The joint design has
    been formulated as multi-objective optimization problems and solved by using convex
    optimization theory. In the case with finite server data buffer capacity and one-shot
    data arrival at sensor, the DWF structure is proved to be optimal for rate control
    and a SP algorithm is proposed to obtain the numerical values. Such findings are
    further extended to account for the cases with infinite server data buffer capacity,
    bursty data arrival at sensor, or time-varying channels. All the proposed schemes
    are testified on public datasets. This work opens a new direction for learning-and-energy
    efficient EI. The current design can be extended for more complex scenario with
    multiple sensors. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

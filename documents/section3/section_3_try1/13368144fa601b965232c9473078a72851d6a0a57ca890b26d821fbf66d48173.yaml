    8 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Core Ideas Several redundant sensors for the
    same variable are required for quality control. Weighing lysimeters record rainfall
    more accurately than do tipping bucket gauges. Southern High Plains rainfall is
    variable, even within a 1-km radius. Scatterplots and time-series graphical and
    statistical analyses aid quality control. Weather mediates the complex interactions
    of soil, water, plants, atmosphere, and agricultural and environmental interventions.
    Accurate and representative weather data are thus important to agricultural and
    environmental research, but particularly to simulation model development and testing.
    USDA-ARS research using large weighing lysimeters at Bushland, TX, has produced
    30 yr of evapotranspiration and ancillary data related to different methods of
    irrigation application and management, dryland cropping, crop choice, and agronomic
    management and weather. To support crop simulation modeling, weather data were
    gathered on a 15-min basis at a research weather station adjacent to the weighing
    lysimeters since the inception of the project in 1987, as well as at nearby stations.
    The goal of this article is to review and demonstrate Conservation and Production
    Research Laboratory (CPRL) weather data quality management procedures. Data quality
    management has involved both quality assurance planning and operations as well
    as quality control methods. Data analysis revealed the importance of having multiple
    sensors replicating the same weather measurement because sensor failure or degradation
    often created gaps in data that required another data source to fill, but also
    because replicate sensors aided in detecting sensor error. Data from multiple
    stations also revealed issues of datalogger time keeping and spatial variation
    of weather. And, comparisons of data on the same weather measurement from various
    sensors that used different operating principles revealed systematic errors in
    some sensors. Methods of quality assurance and control involved long-term planning
    for sensor calibration, maintenance and replacement, and daily and longer-term
    quality control efforts based on data stream analysis. Abbreviations CPRL Conservation

    Unit Ta air temperature U2 horizontal wind speed At the USDA-ARS Conservation
    and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL), Bushland, TX, four large weighing lysimeters
    were used by scientists in the Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU)
    for research on crop growth, water use, and associated energy and water balances
    beginning in 1988 and continuing to the present (Howell et al., 1995; Marek et
    al., 1988) (Fig. 1). Research has focused on crop water use and water and energy
    balances as affected by weather, crop, tillage, irrigation method and management,
    and agronomic methods, and has included both full and deficit irrigation regimes
    and dryland cropping (Evett et al., 2016). Other avenues of research have included
    simulation modeling, sensor and sensing system research, development and testing,
    etc. The 30-yr Bushland weighing lysimeter data sets can have great utility in
    simulation model development and testing only if data quality can be ensured.
    In addition to lysimeter measurements of evapotranspiration (ET), agronomic methods
    and timing, soil water status, and irrigation and precipitation data, weather
    data are required as input for simulation models, and those data should match
    the lysimeter data in quality. Evett et al. (2012c) and Marek et al. (2014) described
    methods to ensure lysimeter ET data assurance and quality. Allen (2008) discussed
    quality assessment of weather data, mainly as put forth by ASCE (2005). Allen
    et al. (2011a, 2011b) discussed measurement accuracy and documentation needs related
    to quality assurance concerns for lysimeter, weather, and other data associated
    with the soil water balance. DeJonge et al. (2015) discussed how errors in weather
    sensor calibration can adversely affect calculation of ETo. They found that solar
    irradiance errors had the strongest effect on ETo accuracy, followed by anemometer
    errors for windy locations. Sadler et al. (2017) discussed statistical inference
    methods for detecting bias in data from single and duplicate sensors and suggested
    they could be used in a quality assurance program. Sadler et al. (2018) examined
    the use of truth tables in quality control to replace if-then-else statements
    in quality control computer programs. Neither of these approaches was used in
    the present study. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer Satellite imagery showing relative
    locations of the SWMRU research weather station and the four large weighing lysimeters
    at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory. For scale, note
    that the lysimeter fields outlined by the red box measure ∼425 m E–W by 455 m
    N–S. This article focuses on the methods used by the SWMRU to ensure quality year-long
    15-min data sets of solar irradiance (Rs, W m−2), relative humidity (RH, %), air
    temperature (Ta, °C), wind speed (U2, m s−1), and precipitation (P, mm) that will
    be useful for computer simulations. Precipitation is a special case for the following
    reasons. First, precipitation varies spatially over the four large weighing lysimeter
    fields, such that one precipitation data set would not necessarily apply to each
    lysimeter. Second, it has been shown that the lysimeter mass change during precipitation
    events is often a more accurate measure of precipitation than the readings from
    tipping bucket rain gages, particularly during the intense summer thunderstorms
    that deliver much of the precipitation in the Southern High Plains (Evett et al.,
    2011, 2012c). Third, irrigation events also cause lysimeter mass changes that
    can be used to determine irrigation depths, but must be discriminated from precipitation.
    Fourth, having concluded that lysimeter mass change data should be used to measure
    precipitation (except in rare cases), the quality assurance and control methods
    used with lysimeter mass change data are more relevant than the methods discussed
    herein. Thus, precipitation data quality assurance and control are treated herein,
    but much of the lysimeter data manipulation is done in separate spreadsheets using
    methods described in part by Marek et al. (2014) and Evett et al. (2018). These
    methods will be described more fully in an upcoming article on lysimeter data
    quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures updated since the report
    of Marek et al. (2014), with particular emphasis on dew and frost formation. We
    note here that lysimeter freeboard is ∼50 mm and the combination of freeboard
    and infiltration that occurs during precipitation ensure that only truly exceptional
    and rare precipitation events cause runoff from the lysimeter. Fields around the
    lysimeters are furrow diked to minimize runoff, which in combination with the
    freeboard protects lysimeters from runon except in very rare cases. Data taken
    during such rare events are carefully screened to avoid accepting data that are
    compromised by runon or runoff. Procedures for soil state variables are also treated
    elsewhere: heat flux and temperature (Agam et al., 2012; Evett et al., 2012a;
    Howell and Tolk, 1990), water content and soil water storage (Evett, 2007; Evett
    et al., 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012b; Hignett and Evett, 2002; Schwartz
    et al., 2016). Quality assurance and QC are both aspects of data quality management
    at the SWMRU. Quality assurance is focused on the long-term fulfillment of quality
    requirements by institution of policies for sensor choice, datalogger choice,
    calibration, purchase, repair and replacement, quality control, data acquisition,
    storage, and format. One policy for quality assurance is the installation of more
    than one sensor for the important microclimate variables, including precipitation,
    solar irradiance, net radiation and its components, air temperature and relative
    humidity, and wind speed, including sensors at both 2- and 10-m heights. To the
    extent possible, duplicate or more sensors have been used at the CPRL, both by
    operating more than one weather station and also by duplicating sensors at some
    stations (Table 1). Quality assurance includes ensuring that gaps in primary data
    (in this case, the SWMRU station data, see Table 1) are filled, which highlights
    the importance of cooperation with other stations. This article focuses more on
    quality control than on quality assurance because sensor and datalogger choice
    and sensor calibration have been discussed in previous publications (e.g., Dusek
    et al., 1987, 1993; Dusek and Howell, 1996; Evett et al., 2012c, 2016; Howell
    and Dusek, 1995; Howell and Tolk, 1990; Howell et al., 1993, 1995). Quality assurance
    also involves choice of analog to digital conversion technology to obtain the
    best results possible from sensors at affordable cost. Dataloggers chosen by the
    SWMRU were the Campbell Scientific CR7X in 1987, and continuing until they were
    replaced by the Campbell Scientific CR6 in 2015 and 2016 after extensive β testing
    of the CR6 by SWMRU personnel. Table 1. Locations for weather data sensing at
    the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL). 1. The CPRL Soil and
    Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station (lat. 35.186714°,
    long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m asl). This station was established in 1987
    in conjunction with the installation of the four large weighing lysimeters in
    1987 and 1988 (Dusek et al., 1987; Evett et al., 2016). The SWMRU station was
    built on a 56 × 56 m plot just east of and immediately adjacent to the weighing
    lysimeter fields and planted to a cool-season grass, which was flood irrigated
    (Fig. 1). Irrigation was converted to subsurface drip irrigation in 1994 when
    a weighing lysimeter was installed to determine grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ET), and the plot was sodded to a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. cv.
    Green Emerald) (Schneider et al., 1998). Data were recorded as 15-min means (some
    5-min data are available). Data were continuous to the extent possible during
    the growing season and usually throughout the year. See Appendix A for details.
    2. The four large weighing lysimeters. A full suite of weather data was collected
    at each large weighing lysimeter (Dusek et al., 1987) (Fig. 1), but the suite
    has changed substantially over the years (Evett et al., 2012c, 2016). Data are
    available on a 15-min basis and may be used for gap filling if satisfactory correlations
    with SWMRU weather data are established. Sensor heights vary by year and crop,
    but are typically fixed with reference to the soil surface. In some years, adjustable
    masts were used and adjusted weekly to keep the sensors at a fixed height above
    the crop. Data were continuous to the extent possible during the growing season
    and often well before and well after, but data typically were not available year-round.
    See Appendix B for details. 3. The CPRL U.S. National Weather Service station
    (lat. 35.187857°, long. -102.079888°, elevation 1164 m asl). Located in an open
    field of native buffalograss [Bouteloua dactyloides (Nutt.) Columbus] west of
    the headquarters complex of buildings (Fig. C1), this station has operated since
    1939. Data were collected at first daily using manual methods, then on an hourly
    basis since 1983 using Campbell Scientific dataloggers, and since 2012 at 15-min
    intervals. Data were continuous to the extent possible. Data may be used for gap
    filling if satisfactory correlations are obtained. See Appendix C for details.
    4. A Texas High Plains Weather Network weather station (Marek et al., 2005; Marek
    and Porter, 2009). Hourly data from this station located on the SWMRU research
    weather station plot are available for some years and may be used for gap filling
    if satisfactory correlations are obtained. The station was maintained by Texas
    A&M Research and Extension personnel. 5. The Texas A&M AgriLife Bush Farm. A weather
    station at the Bush Farm is maintained by Texas A&M Research and Extension personnel.
    Located 4.2 km northeast of the SWMRU station, this station is distant enough
    that data were used only rarely for gap filling. Data storage and formatting policies
    have changed at the CPRL over the years as both software and hardware technologies
    have changed. In most cases, paper data files were converted to digital records.
    Digital records have been converted to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets in almost
    all cases. In many files, missing data are indicated by a −999.9 value, but these
    are being converted to the Excel “NA()” function, which appears as “#N/A” in a
    spreadsheet cell. The Excel “ISNA()” function can be used to identify “#N/A”,
    and when combined with an “IF” statement, can be used to quickly convert missing
    values in our data to another missing value indicator, even a −999.9 value if
    desired. In the 1990s, primary QA/QC on weather data at the CPRL was implemented
    using a compiled computer program that read comma separated value (CSV) files.
    Lack of computer programming resources in the face of rapidly changing operating
    systems led to these functions being implemented in spreadsheet files, first Quattro
    and then Excel. Excel was chosen not for its speed or programmability, but because
    it is an ubiquitous standard for data sharing that all our cooperators are able
    to use. Quality control is focused on ensuring that data meet quality requirements,
    and at the CPRL it includes both short-term (daily) procedures and longer-term
    (seasonal) procedures that include sensor cross correlation and gap filling. Quality
    control begins with daily longitudinal plotting against time of all sensor data
    for visual identification of sensor failure and other abnormalities (out of range,
    dirty sensor, hail damage, etc.) that require immediate intervention to repair,
    adjust, or replace sensors or dataloggers. Sensor repair, adjustment, and replacement
    is done routinely at the CPRL in response to daily QC analysis. In some cases
    these plots indicate other interventions that are needed outside of the data realm
    to correct or adjust for agronomic, irrigation, or other mistakes or mishaps.
    Although not involving data correction or gap filling, these interventions can
    have a direct effect on data quality. The day after a weekend or holiday, the
    daily plots for the weekend and holiday days are examined. One reason for daily
    data examination is that it reduces the need to go to the field to inspect sensors.
    Not only does this save time and money, but it reduces the disturbance to the
    crop under study. The following discussion includes both daily and year-long longitudinal
    plotting as well as scatter plotting and linear regression methods as applied
    to each of the five weather variables, Rs, Ta, RH, U2, and P. In the following,
    the presence of multi-day or even multi-week data gaps may cause the reader to
    question why such long gaps occurred when daily quality control procedures were
    in place. Some gaps in data were due to weather events that caused damage that
    could not be quickly repaired, or that occurred during times when other duties
    and the knowledge that substitute data were available made quick repair a lesser
    priority. In other cases, data gaps existed because sensors were installed only
    for observations during growing seasons and for short periods before and after
    those seasons. This was common for lysimeter instrumentation that was brought
    in from the field for repair, maintenance, and calibration after crop harvest
    and reinstalled at the lysimeters in the spring before planting. Development of
    Weather Input Data Sets for Modeling Standard practice at the CPRL SWMRU is to
    create separate spreadsheets for each complete calendar year for the CPRL National
    Weather Service station, the SWMRU grass weather station, and the weighing lysimeters—northeast
    (NE) and southeast (SE) lysimeter data in one spreadsheet, northwest (NW) and
    southwest (SW) lysimeter data in another spreadsheet. This is done not only to
    avoid contamination of data sets, but also because spreadsheets become too large
    to manipulate if data from all these sources are combined into one (e.g., >300
    Mbyte for 1 yr of lysimeter data). An additional reason is that for many of the
    past 30 yr the NW and SW fields were managed together as the “West” fields, while
    the NE and SE fields were managed together as the “East” fields. Sometimes crops
    and water management methods were different in East and West fields, for example
    when dryland production was compared with irrigated production. In 2013, subsurface
    drip irrigation was installed on the East fields and lysimeters, and the West
    fields and lysimeters were irrigated with a 10-span linear move system, establishing
    a long-term contrast study of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and sprinkler irrigation
    that continues to the present. The large individual spreadsheet sizes are also
    partly due to data other than weather data being included in them, but also because
    data are included in 5-min (lysimeters), 15-min, 30-min, hourly, and daily forms
    in separate sheets. Because the four main data sources all have 15-min data available,
    and rather than have several spreadsheets open at the same time, the 15-min data
    sheets from all sources are copied to a single weather data file, 15-min_NE_SE_SWMRU_CPRL.xlsx
    (sources are NE and SE lysimeter file, SWMRU weather station file, and CPRL weather
    station file). This spreadsheet serves as a template for quality control and gap
    filling for the four standard weather variables typically used as input weather
    data for simulation models, solar irradiance (Rs, W m−2), relative humidity (RH,
    %), air temperature (Ta, °C), wind speed (U2, m s−1), and precipitation (P, mm),
    and for development of a modeling data set consisting of those values. The graphs
    and gap filling exercises described in the following have been implemented in
    this spreadsheet. It will serve as the public facing weather data source for the
    CPRL. It contains the sheets described in Table 2. Contact the authors for the
    full spreadsheet. As this spreadsheet is completed for each year, the results
    will be placed on the Ag Data Commons and associated with a DOI. The results spreadsheet
    will contain the sheets, Authorship, Keys and Conventions, Notes, Modeling data,
    and Rso (clear sky solar irradiance), where Modeling data contains the 15-min
    weather data (the doi for 2016 data is: doi: 10.15482/USDA.ADC/1482548). Table
    2. Sheets in spreadsheet file, “15-min_NE_SE_SWMRU_CPRL.xlsx,” which is used to
    create quality controlled year-long 15-min weather data as input for simulation
    models. Sheet name Purpose Authorship Identifies scientific authors of the data,
    their contact information, and coauthoring responsibilities of any party utilizing

    Sheet copied from the spreadsheet for the Soil and Water Management Research Unit
    (SWMRU) grass weather station data file. It contains 15-min microclimate data.
    See explanation in the parent spreadsheet Bush_Precip Sheet contains daily precipitation
    data from manually read standard 20.3-cm (8-inch) orifice U.S. Weather Bureau
    gauge at the CPRL U.S. National Weather Service station. In some years may contain
    data from other manually read gauges. CompareCharts_Rs Sheet created for quality
    assurance/quality control (QA/QC) scatterplots of solar irradiance (Rs) data with
    regression relationships between Rs data from different data sources and VLOOKUP
    table for plotting daily dynamics of Rs data from different sources. Also contains
    longitudinal plots of Rs data from different sources for all days of the year
    for identification of missing data, and data sources that may be used for gap
    filling. CompareCharts_RH Sheet created for QA/QC scatterplots of relative humidity
    (RH) data with regression relationships between RH data from different data sources
    and VLOOKUP table for plotting daily dynamics of RH data from different sources.
    Also contains longitudinal plots of RH data from different sources for all days
    of the year for identification of missing data, and data sources that may be used
    for gap filling. CompareCharts_Ta Sheet created for QA/QC scatterplots of air
    temperature (Ta) data with regression relationships between Ta data from different
    data sources and VLOOKUP table for plotting daily dynamics of Ta data from different
    sources. Also contains longitudinal plots of Ta data from different sources for
    all days of the year for identification of missing data, and data sources that
    may be used for gap filling. CompareCharts_U2 Sheet created for QA/QC scatterplots
    of wind speed (U2) data with regression relationships between U2 data from different
    data sources and VLOOKUP table for plotting daily dynamics of U2 data from different
    sources. Also contains longitudinal plots of U2 data from different sources for
    all days of the year for identification of missing data, and data sources that
    may be used for gap filling. CompareCharts_P Sheet for QA/QC plots of precipitation
    data on a 15-min and daily basis, including longitudinal and year-long accumulative
    plots. Modeling data Sheet created for combining data from various sources into
    a year-long 15-min data set of solar irradiance (Rs, W m–1), relative humidity
    (RH, %), air temperature (Ta, °C), wind speed (U2, m s–1), and precipitation (P,
    mm). Rso Sheet for computation of theoretical clear-sky solar irradiance using
    methods in ASCE (2005). Working with the spreadsheet for a particular year begins
    with updating the Authorship, Keys and Conventions, and Notes sheets using data
    from the primary source files. Next, the year-long 15-min data sheets are copied
    from the four primary sources files, the SWMRU research weather station file,
    the NE and SE lysimeter data file, the NW and SW lysimeter data file, and the
    CRPL National Weather Service station file. Once a 15-min data sheet is copied
    to the spreadsheet, its data can be copied to the relevant sheet shown in the
    preceding table using a formula that references the imported data sheet. An “IF”
    statement along with the “ISNA()” function can be used to convert −999.9 values
    to “#N/A” during this copy. The formula would look like: where sheet “NewData-15”
    is the name of the sheet of data just copied from the primary source file and
    B2 references a specific cell in that sheet. The entire relevant sheet can then
    be copied and pasted in place as values to remove the references to the sheet
    that was copied into the spreadsheet. That sheet can then be deleted. This procedure
    preserves the references for all the formulae and charts in the “CompareCharts…”
    sheets. Once the new data are imported as described, data for the five standard
    weather variables can be examined in the sheets named “CompareCharts_XX” where
    “XX” is either Rs, Ta, RH, U2, or P. Cross correlations between like data from
    different sources can be examined and any necessary adjustments made to references
    in sheet “Modeling data,” and to any regression relationships used to convert
    secondary data for gap filling. The procedures are described in the previous sections
    for the four standard variables. Explanation of Data in Sheet “Modeling data”
    The data in sheet “Modeling data” are 15-min data. As with all other sheets, time
    is U.S. Central Standard Time, not adjusted for daylight savings time. Data are
    mean values over the corresponding 15-min time period. Times reported are for
    the end of the averaging period. Thus, the value reported at 0330 h is for the
    period from 0315 to 0330 h and would be centered on 0322.5 h. Energy fluxes (W
    m−2) are taken as positive going toward the surface (combined plant and soil),
    summing to zero at the surface. The sheet contains year-long longitudinal plots
    of the 15-min data, and also longitudinal plots to identify missing data as shown
    later. A “Notes” column contains notes about gap filling, including source of
    data and any regression relationship used to convert/correct source data. Relative
    humidity and air temperature are sensed at a 2-m height above grass mown to maintain
    a maximum 0.12-m grass height at the tower in the SWMRU weather station, and at
    a 1.4-m height in the cotton belt shelter at that station. Relative humidity and
    air temperature are sensed at fixed heights above the soil surface at the NE and
    SE lysimeters. The height was 3 m in 2016 to ensure that the anemometer remained
    above the corn (Zea mays L.) plants throughout the season. Wind speed is sensed
    at 2-m height on the tower at the SWMRU weather station with both an RM Young
    cup type anemometer and with a Windsonic 2-D sonic anemometer. Wind speed at the
    NE and SE lysimeters is sensed at a fixed height above the soil surface at the
    NE and SE lysimeters using both an RM Young anemometer and a Windsonic 2-D anemometer.
    In 2016, that height was 3 m. The height in other years can be found by viewing
    the weighing lysimeter data files. Solar Irradiance: Sheet “CompareCharts_Rs”
    Daily longitudinal plotting can be easily accomplished using the VLOOKUP function
    in Excel (Table 3). In the following example table, entering a day of year (DOY)
    value in the blue cell caused the decimal day of year to be calculated for the
    96 15-min intervals in that day. The cells under the headings for solar irradiance
    (Rs, W m−2) were populated with VLOOKUP formulae that referred to the decimal
    DOY values in the first column (the “lookup value”). Each formula referred to
    an array of values in a sheet of 15-min data containing the Rs data for the sensor
    noted in the top row, and a “column index number” that indicated the column in
    that array containing the needed Rs data. The table was populated automatically
    when DOY was changed. Note that the Rso was also plotted. It was calculated using
    methods in ASCE (2005). It is a theoretical maximum solar irradiance for given
    altitude, longitude, latitude, and time of day. If values of a sensor are consistently
    greater than Rso, then the sensor is out of calibration. If sensor values are
    always less than Rso, then the sensor is also likely out of calibration. Note,
    however, that passing white clouds may reflect sunlight, temporarily increasing
    Rs beyond Rso. Table 3. Data for day of year (DOY) 51,2016, assembled for daily
    longitudinal plotting using the VLOOKUP function in Excel. In the example Table
    3, a value of 51 was entered for DOY and the table showed that solar irradiance
    data were missing from the albedometer (model CMA11, Kipp & Zonen, Delft, the
    Netherlands) at the NE lysimeter, and that values were zero just after and before
    midnight in DOY 51 for all three pyranometers at the SWMRU station (two model
    Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP), Eppley Laboratories, Newport, RI, USA; and
    one model LI-200R, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Also, data were sometimes very small
    positive numbers for the CPRL station sensor (model LI-200X, LI-COR, Lincoln,
    NE, USA). The zero values are as expected since data from the lysimeters and SWMRU
    station are screened automatically and assigned zero values when the sun is below
    the horizon, which is determined using the equations of time (Evett et al., 2011).
    The data plot showed that values from the LI-COR sensor were somewhat larger than
    those from the other sensors, particularly PSP #2, and also could be greater than
    the calculated Rso (Fig. 2). Plotting for several other days confirmed that the
    LI-COR sensor routinely reported values larger than Rso, indicating that it was
    out of calibration. Data from PSP #2 were smaller than from the other sensors
    for a period of time from midmorning until noon, which was traced to bird feces
    on the east side of the sensor. Finding this on the next day allowed timely cleaning
    of the sensor. Data from the 2016 calendar year are used in the examples. Figure
    2 Open in figure viewer Longitudinal plot of solar irradiance from several sensors
    at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory for DOY 51, 2016. Changing
    the DOY value to 55 revealed that data were missing for both the NE lysimeter
    sensor and the LI-COR sensor (data not shown). The daily plot also indicated that
    data from the CPRL sensor were plotting earlier than data from the other sensors
    and earlier than the calculated Rso, which alerted us to a data logging time error
    that was corrected (Fig. 3). Note that plotting Rs values with Rso values is the
    easiest way to quickly identify datalogger time stamp problems after the fact.

    sensors at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory for DOY 55, 2016.
    Finally, daily data plots can indicate data processing errors such as that illustrated
    in Fig. 4 for DOY 100, which shows data from the NE Rs sensor plotting as zero
    values after sunrise and before sunset (Table 4). This was due to an error in
    the function calculating time of sunrise and time of sunset. That function was
    used in processing the data from the SWMRU station and from the lysimeter sensors
    so that Rs values would always be set to zero at night. It was not used in processing
    data from the CPRL station as indicated by the very small nighttime values from
    the CPRL Rs sensor. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer Longitudinal plot of solar
    irradiance from several sensors at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory
    for DOY 100, 2016. Table 4. Data for day of year (DOY) 100 assembled for daily
    longitudinal plotting using the VLOOKUP function in Excel. Longer-term quality
    control procedures, including identification of data bias and gap filling, involve
    scatterplots and regression relationships between like data from duplicate sensors
    installed at the SWMRU station or at other stations such as the lysimeters or
    CPRL station (Fig. 5). For example, scatterplots of short-wave irradiance (PSP
    #1 vs. LI-COR, PSP #2 vs. LI-COR, Fig. 5A, 5B) for 2016 indicated that the LI-COR
    sensor reported larger values than either PSP sensor, and that one PSP sensor
    (PSP #2) was dirty for a period of time (Fig. 5C). Additional scatterplots of
    LI-COR data vs. data of solar irradiance from albedometers at the NE and SE lysimeters
    showed relatively good agreement between both albedometers and the LI-COR sensor
    for periods near gaps (e.g., Fig. 5D). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Scatterplots
    and regression relationships between short-wave irradiance sensors at the Soil
    and Water Management Research Unit station and the NE lysimeter. (A) PSP #1 reports
    4.5% smaller values than the LI-COR sensor. (B) PSP #2 reports 8.1% smaller values
    than the LI-COR sensors. (C) PSP #1 reports 3.9% larger values than PSP #2, and
    PSP #1 is dirty for a period of time. (D) The incoming short-wave values from
    the NE lysimeter albedometer are 2.9% larger than values from the LI-COR, but
    very well correlated for a period of time as indicated by the row numbers. Year-long
    longitudinal plots allow identification of large gaps due to missing data, such
    as in Fig. 6A, showing solar irradiance from different sensors. For example, gaps
    were obvious for the LI-COR sensor (green), and data were available from the PSP
    #1 sensor (blue) earlier in the year, and from both the PSP #1 sensor and the
    NE lysimeter sensor (red) later in the year. With the establishment of suitable
    regression relationships, gaps in data from the SWMRU station could be filled
    with data from the CPRL station early in the year and with data from the NE lysimeter
    albedometer later in the year. Because the plotting of data from several sensors
    can cause data points to be covered or the lack of data points to be hidden by
    data plotting on top of them, the spreadsheet contains several versions of Fig.
    6A, each plotting data only from one for two sources. Figure 6 Open in figure
    viewer (A) Year-long longitudinal plot of solar irradiance values from several
    sensors at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory revealed gaps in
    data from some sensors but also what data were available for filling those gaps.
    (B) Longitudinal plot of Rs data from the NE lysimeter sensor compared with Rso.
    Note that Fig. 6A is not useful for identifying calibration or other factors (dirt
    on sensor surfaces) that can compromise data from individual Rs sensors. For that,
    longitudinal plots for individual sensors are useful when combined with a plot
    of Rso (Fig. 6B). This longitudinal plot of data from the NE lysimeter sensor
    revealed consistent values greater than Rso, which indicated an inconsistent calibration
    problem causing values of Rs to be too large. Because some data gaps are too short
    to be apparent in longitudinal plots such as these, a spreadsheet table was created
    to contain a blank if data were available and a 1 if data were missing (either
    −999.9 or the Excel function NA(), which displays as “#N/A”) as shown in Table
    5 in which two solar irradiance data are missing. Note also that the “AVERAGE()”
    function in Excel returns #N/A if there are any #N/A values in the cells being
    averaged (see Mean values in the figure), which is another way to identify the
    existence of missing values. Table 5. Spreadsheet table for identification of
    short-term missing data.† Decimal DOY Year DOY Time Mean Sum Formulas following

    DOY when data are missing. In this example, the cursor was placed on the left
    hand point plotting as 1, and the decimal DOY was shown as 1.052083, which matches
    the table. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer Graph showing missing data indicators
    (values of 1) for single times of missing data illustrated in Table 4. Wind Speed:
    Sheet “CompareCharts_U2” Another example of longer-term quality control is shown
    in scatterplots of the 2-m wind speed (U2, m s–1) from the 2-m sonic anemometer
    (model Windsonic, Gill Instruments, Lymington, UK) vs. that from the 2-m 3-cup
    anemometer (model 12102, RM Young, MI, USA) at the SWMRU station (Fig. 8A). The
    plot showed that the sonic anemometer recorded larger wind speeds than the cup
    type anemometer at small wind speeds. It also showed the small wind speed cutoff
    for the cup type anemometer (no wind speeds recorded that were less than a given
    minimum speed), while for the sonic anemometer there were wind speed values approaching
    zero. The regression relationship appeared to show that the sonic anemometer reports
    smaller wind speeds at the larger values, but this was to some degree only an
    apparent bias caused by the preponderance of larger wind speeds reported by the
    sonic anemometer in the 0 to 2 m s−1 range. Setting the intercept to zero resulted
    in the regression relationship: Windsonic (m s−1) = 0.9903 (RM Young), r2 = 0.99.
    This allowed gap filling with the RM Young data. The scatterplot of 10-m wind
    speeds shows a very close correlation, which allows one-for-one replacement of
    data from one sensor to fill gaps in data from the other (Fig. 8B). Figure 8 Open
    in figure viewer Scatterplots of wind speed data showing relationship between
    the Windsonic sensor and the RM Young 3-cup anemometer at (A) the 2-m height,
    and (B) the RM Young horizontal axis propeller type anemometer at the 10-m height.
    The year-long longitudinal plot of wind speed data indicated a gap in 2-m Windsonic
    and RM Young sensor data at the SWMRU station beginning on DOY 292 (Fig. 9). The
    gap ended for the RM Young sensor on DOY 330, but continued through the end of
    the year for the Windsonic sensor. The data from the Windsonic sensor at the NE
    lysimeter indicated larger wind speeds than reported by the sensors at the SWMRU
    station from DOY 78, when the NE lysimeter sensor was installed, to approximately
    DOY 165 when rapid growth of the corn crop in the lysimeter field caused the NE
    Windsonic to report smaller wind speeds than reported at the SWMRU station. The
    corn crop was harvested on DOY 290, at which time the NE Windsonic began reporting
    values similar to those from the SWMRU Windsonic (briefly) and RM Young sensors
    (between DOY 322 and 356). Regression between RM Young and NE Windsonic sensors
    using data from DOY 322 to 356 resulted in the equation: RMYoung (m s−1) = 0.9362(NE
    Windsonic) – 0.0433 m s−1, which was used to fill the gap in wind speed data by
    converting data from the NE lysimeter. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer Year-long
    longitudinal plot of wind speed data from Windsonic and RM Young anemometers at
    2-m height at the Soil and Water Management Research Unit station and at 3-m height
    above the soil at the NE lysimeter (NE Windsonic). Relative Humidity: Sheet “CompareCharts_RH”
    Daily longitudinal plots of relative humidity (RH, %) allow identification of
    periods when sensors consistently report 100% as well as inconsistencies between
    sensors. Figure 10A shows that the CRPL station sensor and the SE lysimeter sensor
    both remained at 100% for several hours after midnight, whereas the SWMRU station
    sensors reported values between 95 and 98% (HMT 330 #1 and #2, and tower 2-m sensor).
    Figure 10B shows that data from the SWMRU station tower at 2-m were larger than
    100% for a short period of time and were consistently larger than values from
    the other sensors. For 3 h after midnight the CPRL station sensor reported larger
    values than the HMT 330 sensors. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer Relative humidity
    (%) daily plots of 15-min data. (A) Day of year (DOY) 339 data from the SE lysimeter,
    Conservation and Production Research Laboratory station, the HMT 330 #1 and #2
    at the Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) station, and the sensor
    at 2-m height on the tower at the SWMRU station. NE lysimeter data were missing.
    (B) Data for DOY 90, 2016 for the same sensors. Year-long longitudinal plotting
    of relative humidity data revealed gaps in data from the SWMRU 2-m sensor data
    earlier in the year and all SWMRU station RH data in the DOY 294 to 313 period.
    Adding NE and SE lysimeter as well as CPRL RH data to the plot revealed that only
    SE lysimeter RH data were available for gap filling in the DOY 294 to 313 period
    (Fig. 11), but that the SE RH sensor returned values that were larger than those
    from the SWMRU station, probably due to a calibration problem for the SE lysimeter
    sensor. The regression relationship for the period DOY 313 to 367 was HMT330 #1
    (%) = 0.8712(SE RH) + 3.35%, r2 = 0.98, which confirmed this and allowed the SE
    lysimeter data to be scaled down appropriately to fill the data gap. Figure 11
    Open in figure viewer Year-long longitudinal plot of 15-min relative humidity
    data from several sources. Air Temperature: Sheet “CompareCharts_Ta” A longitudinal
    plot of 15-min air temperature (Ta, °C) data from DOY 230, 2016, showed similar
    values from the CPRL and SWMRU stations, but smaller values in midday from the
    NE and SE lysimeters over an irrigated corn crop (Fig. 12). Nighttime values were
    slightly larger at the lysimeters than at the stations. These differences in air
    temperature between lysimeters and the weather stations are expected since crop
    evapotranspiration and cooling from irrigations can cause smaller air temperature
    values at the lysimeters during daytime, and heat storage in the crop canopy may
    buffer air temperature decline during nighttime. Figure 12 Open in figure viewer
    Daily longitudinal plot of 15-min air temperature data from sensors at the Conservation
    and Production Research Laboratory and Soil and Water Management Research Unit
    stations, and at the NE and SE lysimeters. A year-long longitudinal plot of 2016
    air temperature data revealed gaps in those data that could be filled from other
    sources, including the SE lysimeter temperature data for the period after harvest
    (DOY 294–313) (Fig. 13). Regressing the HMT 330 #1 sensor data against the SE
    lysimeter data for DOY 313 to 333 resulted in a regression relationship: HMT 330
    #1 = 1.0398(SE) – 0.469°C, r2 = 0.99, which was used for gap filling. Figure 13
    Open in figure viewer Year-long longitudinal plot of air temperature data from
    several sources at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory. Precipitation:
    Sheet “CompareCharts_P” Precipitation (P, mm) data from tipping bucket rain gauges
    appears in sheets “NE-SE_Lys-15,” “CPRL-15,” and “SWMRU-15.” Sheet “Bush_Precip”
    contains data gathered manually from a standard USWB gauge with 8-inch orifice.
    Data in “Bush_Precip” may sometimes be off by a day or two depending on when the
    gauge was read, which could have been after a weekend or holiday during which
    an event occurred. Also, the amount reported may be for more than one precipitation
    event that occurred during the period between manual readings. The data from the
    manually read gauge are, however, generally quite reliable as accumulative totals
    and as such are an important check on tipping bucket rain gauge accumulative totals.
    Since this gauge is approximately 800 m from the lysimeter fields, it is not unusual
    for the manual gauge reading to differ from the precipitation amount received
    by the lysimeters. Data are compared in sheet “CompareCharts_P,” where precipitation
    “catch” data from analysis of lysimeter change in water storage data (NE, SE,
    NW, and SW lysimeters) are also imported on both a 15-min and a daily basis. As
    for other weather variables, 15-min data from individual days may be compared
    in a longitudinal plot. Because of the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation,
    such plots are less useful than for other weather variables, but still can be
    used to examine problems that may have occurred on particular days. It is often
    useful to compare data from two sources in a scatterplot to reveal bias or the
    lack thereof (Fig. 14). Figure 14 shows that there was negligible bias between
    the NW and SW lysimeter precipitation catch data, but that there were differences
    for the three largest events, which contributed to the 7 mm difference in total
    annual precipitation: 398 mm for the NW and 391 mm for the SW, a 2% difference.
    Also useful are longitudinal plots of daily total precipitation, which can indicate
    when data are missing or when precipitation amounts recorded varied widely. For
    example, precipitation amounts from the NW and SW lysimeter catch were usually
    comparable, but differed for some of the larger events, which would be associated
    with convective thunderstorms that have well-defined rain shafts (Fig. 15). Perhaps
    most useful are plots of accumulated precipitation during the year. For example,
    Fig. 16 indicates important discrepancies between accumulated precipitation from
    the different data sources. In particular, the accumulated precipitation determined
    from the CPRL station tipping bucket rain gauge was greater than 450 mm, ∼40 mm
    more than what was recorded from the CPRL manual rain gauge or any other gauge,
    and also ∼60 mm more than the total determined from lysimeter change in storage
    data (lysimeter catch). Figure 14 Open in figure viewer Scatterplot of precipitation
    catch data from the NW and SW lysimeters in 2016. Figure 15 Open in figure viewer
    Longitudinal plot of daily total NW and SW lysimeter catch precipitation for the
    year 2016. Figure 16 Open in figure viewer Longitudinal plot of accumulated precipitation
    from different gages at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory. DOY
    is day of year. The reason that accumulative amounts from the NE and SE lysimeter
    tipping bucket rain gages did not agree with precipitation quantified by lysimeter
    change in water storage (Fig. 16) is that the tipping bucket rain gauges at the
    lysimeters were at fixed height and for a substantial part of the year were below
    the corn canopy where they were shielded from precipitation. The CPRL manual and
    tipping bucket gauge data were substantially less than the NE and SE lysimeter
    catch data early in the year, but began to exceed those values after DOY 215 when
    precipitation from convective thunderstorms happened to be greater at the CPRL
    station than at the lysimeters. In comparison with manual gauge data, the lysimeter
    catch data allowed 15-min resolution in precipitation data. Because precipitation
    in this region is so spatially heterogeneous, data used for computer simulations
    should come from the actual lysimeter catch. This is illustrated in Fig. 17, where
    accumulative data are compared for precipitation caught by the four weighing lysimeters
    and the Bushland manual gauge. The total precipitation ranged from 376 mm at the
    SE lysimeter to 398 mm at the NW lysimeter, compared with a total of 412 mm measured
    at the CPRL station. The 9-m2 surface area of each lysimeter and the fact that
    this effective orifice is at ground level are other good reasons to prefer lysimeter
    catch for precipitation data. Figure 17 Open in figure viewer Longitudinal plot
    of accumulated precipitation as caught by the four weighing lysimeters and the
    manual gauge at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory. The label
    “SE “catch”” denotes that precipitation caught by the SE lysimeter was the least
    among the four lysimeters. The label “CPRL manual” corresponds to the legend “Bushland
    manual,” which totaled slightly more than any of the lysimeters for the year,
    although it accumulated less than any of the lysimeters until after day of year
    (DOY) 220. SUMMARY Quality assurance and control procedures at the USDA-ARS Conservation
    and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX, for research weather data and
    lysimeter data are designed to produce accurate, reliable 15-min mean data on
    precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar irradiance
    suitable for simulation model development and testing as well as for other research
    purposes. Because the procedures utilize data from six weather stations (CRPL,
    SWMRU, NE lysimeter, SE lysimeter, NW lysimeter, and SW lysimeter) and from duplicate
    sensors at some of the stations, the chance that inaccurate and incomplete data
    are provided to end users is quite small. The intercomparisons shown herein should
    give pause to those who deploy only one sensor for each weather variable in a
    research study. No matter how accurate the sensor when deployed, sensor drift,
    dirt, contamination, weather extremes, and accidents can render a sensor inaccurate,
    and that inaccuracy can be difficult to impossible to detect without comparative
    data based on a duplicate or more than one duplicate sensor. It is our experience
    that this extends to other sensor systems, including eddy covariance, scintillometer,
    Bowen ratio, soil water sensing, etc. There is little doubt that our literature
    is contaminated with many cases of undetected inaccuracy in weather data that
    has resulted in misleading conclusions, which is one reason for including our
    results in a journal that publishes redundant studies, which may or may not be
    confirmatory. DISCLAIMER Mention of trade names or commercial products in this

    Management Research Unit (SWMRU) Research Weather Station The Conservation and
    Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) Soil and Water Management Research Unit
    (SWMRU) research weather station was established in 1987 in conjunction with the
    installation of the four large weighing lysimeters in 1987 and 1988 (Dusek et
    al., 1987; Evett et al., 2016). Elevations range from 1171 m on the west side
    of the lysimeter fields to 1170 m asl at the weather station. The SWMRU station
    was situated on a 56 m E–W by 56 m N–S plot just east of and immediately adjacent
    to the weighing lysimeter fields (Fig. 1) and planted to a cool-season grass,
    which was flood irrigated. Irrigation was converted to subsurface drip irrigation
    in 1994 when a weighing lysimeter was installed to determine grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ET), and the plot was sodded to a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. cv
    Green Emerald) (Schneider et al., 1998). Data were recorded as 15-min means (some
    5-min data are available). Data were continuous to the extent possible during
    the growing season and usually throughout the year. An Excel file is available
    for each calendar year of operation. Instrumentation used in a particular year
    are detailed in the spreadsheet for that year. Table A1 gives details of sensors
    used in a year when short-wave and long-wave radiation balances and corresponding
    sensor capabilities were studied using sensors of different types for incoming
    and outgoing radiative fluxes (Howell et al., 1993). Table A1. Instruments at

    are deployed discontinuously for studies of radiation balance and net radiometer
    calibration. APPENDIX B Weighing Lysimeter Weather Instrumentation A full suite
    of weather data was collected at each of the four large weighing lysimeters (Fig.
    1) at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) (Dusek et al.,
    1987), but the suite has changed substantially over the years (Evett et al., 2012a,
    2016). Data are available on a 15-min basis and may be used for gap filling if
    satisfactory correlations with Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU)
    weather data are established. Sensor heights varied by year and crop, but were
    typically fixed with reference to the soil surface. In some years, adjustable
    masts were used and adjusted weekly to keep the sensors a fixed height above the
    crop. Data were continuous to the extent possible during the growing season and
    often well before and well after, but data were typically not available year-round.
    Table B1 shows details of sensors deployed in 2012 when a cotton crop was grown.
    Because of their nearness to the SWMRU station, data from the NE and SE lysimeters
    were often used for gap filling when stable and strong regression relationships
    could be established. Lysimeter locations are: NE, lat. 35.188127°, long. –102.095543°;
    SE, lat. 35.186095°, long. –102.095560°; NW, lat. 35.188135°, long. –102.097929°;
    SW, lat. 35.186100°, long. –102.097938°. Table B1. Instrumentation at each large

    U.S. National Weather Service Station The Conservation and Production Research
    Laboratory (CPRL) U.S. National Weather Service station is located in an open
    field west of the headquarters complex of buildings (Fig. C1), lat. 35.187863°,
    long. –102.079876°, elevation 1164 m asl. Fetch in the direction of the prevailing
    S–SW winds is ∼200 m over native buffalograss [Bouteloua dactyloides (Nutt.) Columbus,
    a short grass]. To the south and southwest is the playa, a type of circular depression
    common to the Texas High Plains. To the west and northwest are terraces supporting
    dryland production or fallow, depending on the time of year and year. The playa
    is not irrigated and supports a mix of grasses and forbs, and some low-growing
    cactus. Data were collected beginning in 1939, at first daily using manual methods,
    on an hourly basis since 1983 using Campbell Scientific dataloggers, and since
    2012 at 15-min intervals. Data were continuous to the extent possible. Data may
    be used for gap filling if satisfactory correlations are obtained. Instruments
    used were standard U.S. National Weather Service accepted instruments. Those used
    in 2016 are detailed in Table C1. Due to its distance from the Soil and Water
    Management Research Unit (SWMRU) station, data from the CPRL station are not the
    first choice for gap filling, but can be used if stable and strong regression
    relationships can be established. Figure C1 Open in figure viewer Locations of

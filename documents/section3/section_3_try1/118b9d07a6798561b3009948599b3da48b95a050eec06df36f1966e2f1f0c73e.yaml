  description: Irrigation is an important management measure for maintaining grassland
    health and improving productivity in arid and semi-arid areas; however, it can
    also impact hydrological regimes. Owing to terrain and water source constraints,
    suitable grassland areas for irrigation are limited and widely dispersed, making
    it difficult to accurately extract the area and spatial distribution of irrigated
    grasslands. In this study, we used the Google Earth Engine platform and optical
    remote sensing (Sentinel-2) data to classify irrigated grassland and other land-use
    types in the Bayin River Basin, a typical arid endorheic river basin. The classification
    results were then combined with measured irrigation information from the Delingha
    Irrigation Management Bureau and input into the SWAT–MODFLOW coupled model to
    simulate differences in plant growth status, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration
    between irrigated and non-irrigated (rain-fed) grasslands. The accuracy of grassland
    extraction and secondary classification of irrigated grasslands based on optical
    remote sensing images was high. Irrigation effectively increased the leaf area
    index of grasslands during later stages of the growing season and significantly
    increased the groundwater recharge depth, evapotranspiration, and total water
    yield during the irrigation season, as well as the annual depth of groundwater
    replenishment. These changes stabilised annual evapotranspiration and substantially
    reduced the impact of annual precipitation.

    is an important management measure for maintaining grassland health and improving
    productivity in arid and semi-arid areas; however, it can also impact hydrological
    regimes. Owing to terrain and water source constraints, suitable grassland areas
    for irrigation are limited and widely dispersed, making it difficult to accurately
    extract the area and spatial distribution of irrigated grasslands. In this study,
    we used the Google Earth Engine platform and optical remote sensing (Sentinel-2)
    data to classify irrigated grassland and other land-use types in the Bayin River
    Basin, a typical arid endorheic river basin. The classification results were then
    combined with measured irrigation information from the Delingha Irrigation Management
    Bureau and input into the SWAT–MODFLOW coupled model to simulate differences in
    plant growth status, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration between irrigated
    and non-irrigated (rain-fed) grasslands. The accuracy of grassland extraction
    and secondary classification of irrigated grasslands based on optical remote sensing
    images was high. Irrigation effectively increased the leaf area index of grasslands
    during later stages of the growing season and significantly increased the groundwater
    recharge depth, evapotranspiration, and total water yield during the irrigation
    season, as well as the annual depth of groundwater replenishment. These changes

    1. Introduction Grasslands have a range of functions, including carbon storage,
    biodiversity maintenance, water purification, and erosion control, and are one
    of the most widely distributed terrestrial ecosystems on Earth. Covering approximately
    one-third of the global land surface (Zhang et al., 2020) and accounting for 70
    % of the world’s agricultural area, grasslands are vital for livestock farming
    that supports the livelihoods and food security of nearly one billion people worldwide
    (FAO, 2009). Drought can seriously damage grasslands and reduce productivity (Huang
    et al., 2017, Yin et al., 2021). Therefore, in arid and semi-arid areas, irrigation
    has become an important management measure for maintaining grassland health and
    improving productivity (Yin et al., 2021). Irrigation is also an important factor
    influencing hydrological regimes, especially in arid and semi-arid parts of the
    world (Hashemi et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2019). Understanding the impact of irrigation
    on hydrological regimes, such as changes in soil moisture, groundwater levels,
    groundwater and surface water interactions, and water balance, is crucial for
    the sustainable development of inland river basins in water-limited arid areas
    (Hu et al., 2010, Xu et al., 2019). Many studies have analysed the impacts of
    agricultural and forestry irrigation on hydrological processes at the regional
    scale, using distributed hydrological models as a research tool. For example,
    Xu et al. (2019) used the GIS-based SWAP-EPIC model to simulate water cycle processes
    under irrigation in the middle reaches of the Heihe River irrigated area in Northwest
    China. Pool et al. (2021) used the Tetis model to simulate the impact of flood
    irrigation and drip irrigation on evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge
    in an irrigated area of the Mediterranean Region of Valencia, Spain. In these
    studies, the irrigated areas were continuous blocks with a known area and spatial
    distribution, enabling the direct use of hydrological models. However, owing to
    terrain and water source constraints in arid and semi-arid areas, suitable grassland
    areas for irrigation are limited and widely dispersed, making it difficult to
    accurately extract the area and spatial distribution of irrigated grasslands (Reinermann
    et al., 2020), which is crucial for evaluating the impacts of grassland irrigation
    on hydrological regimes. Grassland vegetation exhibits strong intra- and inter-annual
    variability (Huang et al., 2017). Thus, remote sensing techniques are frequently
    employed for effective large-scale vegetation monitoring at seasonal and annual
    scales (Bolton et al., 2020), and can even automatically obtain information on
    grassland quality and quantity to some extent (Kolecka et al., 2018). Multispectral
    optical remote sensing images containing rich spectral information, such as Landsat,
    Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Sentinel-2, and hyperspectral
    images, can be used to obtain information on vegetation greenness, cover, and
    density (Bolton et al., 2020, Karlsen et al., 2021). Synthetic aperture radar
    (SAR) images, such as those derived from Sentinel-1 and TerrainSAR-X satellites,
    can provide information on vegetation height, canopy structure, and soil properties
    using backscattering and interferometric or polarimetric detection methods (Bazzi
    et al., 2020, Hajj et al., 2014). Indeed, many studies have applied satellite
    remote sensing data to monitor the effects of grazing, harvesting, and mixed management
    on grassland vegetation (Brittany et al., 2015, Dusseux et al., 2014, Lobert et
    al., 2021, Qin et al., 2021). The results showed that vegetation indices extracted
    from Sentinel-2 were more effective for monitoring grazing intensity. These studies
    and other relevant research imply the following conclusions. 1) Effective detection
    of intra- and inter-annual changes in grassland vegetation requires repeat satellites
    with medium to high temporal resolution. The spatial resolution of remote sensing
    images also plays an important role, particularly in regions where small-scale
    grassland management is interspersed and scattered. 2) Vegetation indices, such
    as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index,
    leaf area index (LAI), and vegetation cover extracted from optical remote sensing
    images are the most commonly used indices for the remote sensing-based monitoring
    of grassland management, whereas other indices, such as the normalised difference
    water index, green chlorophyll vegetation index, and land surface water index,
    are less frequently employed. 3) Classification, correlation/regression analysis,
    and time-series analysis are all methods used for the remote sensing-based monitoring
    of grassland management, with classification being the most common method. Different
    classifiers and specific targets were used in each study. Irrigation is one of
    the most important management methods for grasslands in arid and semi-arid areas;
    however, few studies have employed remote sensing to monitor grassland irrigation.
    Because irrigation causes changes in the soil moisture content of grasslands,
    some studies have attempted to monitor irrigation activities using TerraSAR-X,
    COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1 radar backscattering information, for example, in
    research in southeastern France, which confirmed the potential to monitor grassland
    irrigation using radar data (Bazzi et al., 2020, Hajj et al., 2014). However,
    few studies have applied optical remote sensing data to monitor irrigation events
    in grasslands. Therefore, the aim of this study is to accurately extract the area
    and spatial distribution of irrigated grasslands in an arid inland river basin
    and better understand the impact of irrigation activities on grassland hydrological
    processes. The study area is the Bayin River Basin, a typical inland river basin
    in the arid northwest region of China. The area is characterised by a high altitude,
    aridity, an uneven spatial distribution of water resources, a large area of grassland,
    and an interconnected distribution of irrigated and rain-fed grasslands. This
    context provides an effective basis for answering the following research questions:
    (a) Can optical remote sensing images effectively distinguish between irrigated
    and rain-fed grasslands? (b) How does irrigation affect grassland vegetation growth?
    (c) How does irrigation affect hydrological processes in grasslands? Although
    we focus on the middle and lower reaches of the Bayin River, similar climatic
    conditions, underlying surface conditions, and grassland management measures are
    found in many parts of the world. Therefore, although the results of this study
    are particularly relevant to the middle and lower reaches of the Bayin River,
    our response to the first research question has implications for other regions
    with similar climate and surface cover. 2. Materials and methods First, we used
    the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain optical remote sensing (Sentinel-2)
    data, then extracted irrigated grasslands and other land cover types. Combined
    with the measured irrigation information from the Delingha Irrigation Management
    Bureau, this information was input into the SWAT-Modular Three-Dimensional Finite-Difference
    Groundwater Flow Model (MODFLOW) coupled model. Based on the simulation results,
    differences in plant growth status, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration
    were analysed between irrigated and non-irrigated (rain-fed) grasslands to reveal
    the impact of irrigation on the hydrological regimes of grasslands. Fig. 1 illustrates

    area The Bayin River Basin is a typical arid inland river basin located in Qaidam
    Basin, Northwest China (Fig. 2). Runoff forms on the southern slope of the Zongwulong
    Mountains in the Qilian Mountain region and dissipates onto the plain below the
    mountains (middle and lower reaches). The middle and lower reaches of the Bayin
    River include the main urban area of Delingha City and two major irrigation areas:
    Delingha and Gahai (Fig. 2). The climate in this area is dry and cold, with abundant
    sunshine and large temperature differences between day and night. Groundwater
    resources are abundant and surface groundwater conversion is frequent (Jin et
    al., 2022). The main land-use and land cover (LULC) types are grassland and bare
    land. Download : Download high-res image (325KB) Download : Download full-size

    of irrigated grassland in the middle and lower reaches of the Bayin River The
    extraction process for irrigated grassland is shown in Fig. 3. First, all available
    Sentinel-2 images from May to September 2020 (vegetation growing season) were
    obtained from GEE and sorted according to the percentage of cloudy pixels. The
    image with the lowest cloud percentage was selected and cropped to obtain the
    best cloud-free image of the study area. Second, based on the Sentinel-2 agricultural
    bands (B11, B8, B2) and shortwave infrared bands (B12, B8A, B4), vegetation indices
    such as the NDVI, green chlorophyll vegetation index, land surface water index,
    modified normalised difference water index, normalised difference built-up index,
    and terrain characteristic index (slope) of the study area were constructed. Feature
    selection was performed based on field sampling points and the random forest classification
    method was used to extract seven LULC types: forest land, cultivated land, grassland,
    buildings, water bodies, bare land, and wetlands. Random forest is an ensemble
    learning method that uses decision trees as its base classifier (Belgiu and Drăguţ,
    2016) creates multiple subsets of samples through iterative sampling from the
    original dataset, builds decision trees based on each subset, and combines the
    generated decision trees into a classifier that classifies input data using a
    voting mechanism (Belgiu and Drăguţ, 2016). Here, we randomly selected 401 samples,
    with 80 % of the samples used as the training set and 20 % used as the test set,
    and the decision tree was set to 25. Classification accuracy was verified using
    a confusion matrix. Based on the Sentinel-2 image, the normalised difference moisture
    index was calculated and grasslands were selected using the random forest classification
    method combined with the second feature selection. Then, 181 samples were randomly
    selected, with 80 % of the samples used as the training set and 20 % used as the
    test set. The decision tree was still set to 25. Finally, the accuracy of the
    results was verified using a confusion matrix.The random forest classification
    method has shown excellent performance in automatic extraction of remote sensing
    information owing to its advantages, such as fast speed, high accuracy, and good
    stability (Tariq et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res
    image (337KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Schematic showing the
    process for extracting irrigated grassland. We used four factors: overall accuracy,
    produce accuracy, user accuracy, and kappa coefficient to evaluate the land-use
    classification results. Overall accuracy provides a macroscopic description of
    the data and is a statistical measure with probabilistic significance. It is the
    ratio of the number of pixels correctly classified to the total number of pixels
    in the reference data (Story and Congalton, 1986). Produce accuracy is the proportion
    of correctly classified pixels in a specific class to the total number of pixels
    in that class in the reference data. A low produce accuracy indicates a high omission
    error, meaning that pixels of that class were incorrectly classified as other
    classes (Congalton, 1991, Foody, 2002). User accuracy is the probability that
    a pixel of a certain class is correctly classified as that class. It represents
    the probability that a randomly selected pixel from the classification result
    corresponds to the ground truth. User accuracy is the proportion of correctly
    classified pixels in a specific class to the total number of pixels classified
    as that class (Congalton, 1991, Foody, 2002). Kappa coefficient is a measure of
    classification accuracy that combines both producer and user accuracy using multivariate
    analysis. The kappa coefficient ranges from −1 to 1, with higher values indicating
    higher classification accuracy and better classification performance (Congalton
    et al., 1983). 2.3. SWAT–MODFLOW coupled model SWAT is a physically based, semi-distributed
    hydrological model comprising hydrology, climate, sediment transport, soil temperature,
    crop growth, nutrients, and agricultural management modules (Arnold et al., 2012).
    However, the SWAT model cannot simulate groundwater movement processes (Arnold
    et al., 2012, Bailey et al., 2016). The SWAT model first divides the watershed
    into several sub-watersheds based on elevation data, and it then further subdivides
    each sub-watershed into hydrology response units (HRUs) (Arnold et al., 2012).
    HRUs are regions within the same sub-watershed that have the same land use type,
    soil type, and slope (Arnold et al., 2012). The water balance within each HRU
    is calculated as follows: where is the soil water content (mm) at the end of the
    time period; is the soil water content (mm) at the beginning of the time period;
    represents the time step (d) of the model simulation hydrological process; represents
    precipitation (mm) on the i-th day; represents surface runoff (mm) on the i-th
    day; represents actual evapotranspiration (mm) on the i-th day; represents soil
    infiltration (mm) on the i-th day; and represents return flow (mm) on the i-th
    day. MODFLOW is a physically based, distributed, three-dimensional groundwater
    model that uses the finite-difference method to solve the differential equation
    of groundwater flow with the aim of simulating and predicting the flow process
    of complex groundwater (Niswonger et al., 2011). However, MODFLOW typically represents
    the boundary conditions in a form that must be calibrated to match real-world
    situations and improve the accuracy of the final groundwater simulation, which
    is very difficult (Bailey et al., 2016). The differential equation for groundwater
    flow in the MODFLOW model is as follows: where , , and represent the components
    of the permeability coefficient in the , , and directions, respectively. Here,
    we assume that the main axis direction of the permeability coefficient is consistent
    with the direction of the coordinate axis, with dimensions of (LT − 1); represents
    the hydraulic head (L); W represents the unit volume flow rate (T − 1), which
    is used to represent the water flowing into the sink or from the source; represents
    the specific yield of the porous medium (L − 1); and represents time (T). The
    SWAT–MODFLOW coupled model utilises the advantages of both SWAT and MODFLOW models.
    It uses groundwater recharge based on the hydrological response units calculated
    by the SWAT model as the input of the MODFLOW model, which then calculates groundwater
    flow between the groundwater aquifer and the river and returns it to the SWAT
    model (Bailey et al., 2016). This approach allows for a more accurate simulation
    of the frequent surface water–groundwater conversion process in the middle and
    lower reaches of the Bayin River (Bailey et al., 2016, Jin et al., 2022). In this
    study, daily temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and solar
    radiation data obtained from the Delingha Meteorological Station were combined
    with the harmonised world soil database released by the Food and Agriculture Organisation,
    the ASTER digital elevation model, previously obtained land-use data, and irrigation
    and inflow data of the middle and lower reaches of the Bayin River to establish
    the SWAT model. The hydrological process-related parameters of the SWAT model
    were calibrated based on monthly operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance
    (SSEBop) evapotranspiration data (https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/product/460)
    of the watershed (see Jin et al., 2022 for details). SSEBop is based on a simplified
    land surface energy balance model, which calculates potential evapotranspiration
    using meteorological data via the Penman–Monteith equation (Chen et al., 2016).
    To obtain actual evapotranspiration, it then calculates the ratio between actual
    evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration using MODIS data (Chen et
    al., 2016). The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the determination coefficient
    (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the SWAT model upon evapotranspiration
    simulation. The MODFLOW model was established using research area drilling, groundwater-level
    observations, river networks, and digital elevation model data. The model effectively
    simulated the source and sink terms of each grid unit in the study area, including
    precipitation supply, irrigation supply, shallow groundwater evapotranspiration,
    river leakage infiltration, and the interaction between groundwater and river
    networks. The original MODFLOW model covered the entire study area, which was
    discretised into uniform grids with a horizontal size of 100 m × 100 m. According
    to the hydrogeological characteristics of the basin, the aquifer was discretised
    into one layer. After parameter calibration (see Jin et al., 2022 for details),
    the MODFLOW model simulated an annual average groundwater recharge of 2.793×108
    m3/year, an average groundwater discharge of 2.769×108 m3/year, and a total cross-sectional
    runoff of 2.814×108 m3/year, equal to a relative error of less than 5 %. This
    indicated the reliability of the hydrological, meteorological, and related parameters
    used in this study. After coupling the calibrated SWAT and MODFLOW models, the
    relevant parameters of the coupled model were fine-tuned using groundwater-level
    observation data and operational simplified surface energy balance evapotranspiration
    data until optimal evapotranspiration and groundwater-level simulation effects
    were obtained (Fig. 4), as reported by Jin et al. (2022). The NSE and R2 were
    used to evaluate the performance of the SWAT–MODFLOW in evapotranspiration simulation,
    and R2 was used to evaluate the performance of the SWAT–MODFLOW in groundwater-level
    simulation. As shown in Fig. 4, the NSE of the final simulated sub-watershed scale
    evapotranspiration was greater than 0.76, and the R2 was greater than 0.75 (Fig.
    4). The R2 of the final simulated groundwater level for each observation well
    evapotranspiration was greater than 0.85. Download : Download high-res image (994KB)

    initial classification results for seven LULC types (forest, farmland, grassland,
    buildings, water bodies, bare land, and wetlands) in the middle and lower reaches
    of the Bayin River was evaluated using a confusion matrix (Fig. 5a). The overall
    accuracy was 96 % and the kappa coefficient was 0.93 (Table 1), indicating high
    classification accuracy. Among them, user accuracy was highest for bare land and
    farmland (0.97), lowest for forest (0.87), and above 0.9 for all other land-use
    types, indicating the best extraction effect and credibility for bare land and
    farmland, and slightly lower credibility for forests. Producer accuracy was highest
    for grassland (0.98) and lowest for urban land (0.64). Overall, the high uniformity
    and low complexity of the internal texture features of bare land, farmland, and
    grassland, as well as their distinct differences from surrounding land, led to
    high classification accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (265KB) Download

    0.93 According to the initial classification results, grasslands were concentrated
    in high-altitude mountainous areas and low-lying areas in the central and southern
    regions (Fig. 5b), with favourable water and temperature conditions. However,
    irrigated grasslands extracted in the subsequent classification were mainly distributed
    in the plains and intermingled with cultivated land and rain-fed grasslands. The
    area of irrigated grassland in the middle and lower reaches of the Bayin River
    was 33.41 km2, accounting for 4.6 % of the total grassland area. The overall accuracy
    of the classification results was 96 %, with a kappa coefficient of 0.92 (Table
    2). The user and producer accuracies of rain-fed grassland and irrigated grassland
    were 0.95 and 0.98, and 99 % and 0.78, respectively, indicating a high recognition
    rate for both grassland types. Overall, the classification results were deemed
    satisfactory. Table 2. Classification accuracy of irrigated and rain-fed grassland.

    grasslands According to the simulation results of the SWAT–MODFLOW coupled model,
    we obtained the average LAI changes of irrigated and rain-fed grasslands during
    the growing season (May to September). Both LAIs continued to increase from May
    to August and reached a maximum in August before decreasing in September (Fig.
    6a). The trend of LAI changes in both types of grasslands, except from July to
    August, was consistent with changes in precipitation. The difference in LAI between
    irrigated and rain-fed grasslands was minimal in the early growth stage (May to
    June), then increased considerably in the middle and late growth stages (July
    to September), with the LAI more than 60 % higher in irrigated grasslands than
    in rain-fed grasslands. Moreover, irrigation did not alter the seasonal trends
    in LAI. Download : Download high-res image (281KB) Download : Download full-size

    a) during the growing season and b) from 2017 to 2021. On an inter-annual scale,
    the LAI of irrigated and rain-fed grasslands reached a maximum in 2018 with the
    highest annual precipitation (397 mm). The difference in annual average LAI values
    between irrigated and rain-fed grasslands was also smallest in that year (43.8
    %) (Fig. 6b). In 2020, which had the lowest annual precipitation (131 mm), the
    annual average LAI for both grassland types was relatively small, with the largest
    difference being 53 %. The vegetation growth status of irrigated grasslands was
    more stable and less affected by annual precipitation. Over the five-year period,
    the annual average LAI value of irrigated grassland was more than 43 % higher
    than that of rain-fed grassland. 3.3. Groundwater recharge changes in irrigated
    grasslands Groundwater plays a dominant role in the water cycle of inland river
    basins in arid areas and is a key foundational resource for natural systems (Fan
    et al., 2013). Changes in groundwater recharge caused by irrigation can cause
    fluctuations in the groundwater table, which can in turn affect groundwater resources
    and regional ecological environments. Therefore, we focused on the depth of groundwater
    recharge caused by grassland irrigation. Fig. 7a shows the depth of water recharging
    the water table in different months for rain-fed and irrigated grasslands. Both
    depths reached a maximum in July, with the highest monthly precipitation (74 mm)
    and irrigation (270 mm), whereas both depths were zero in January, February, October,
    and December, when there was little precipitation and no irrigation. Except for
    June, which had the second-highest precipitation (61 mm), rain-fed grasslands
    exhibited very little groundwater recharge in the remaining months. Irrigated
    grasslands showed substantial groundwater recharge in April, June, August, September,
    and November, when irrigation amounts were relatively high. Download : Download

    recharging the water table for rain-fed and irrigated grasslands: a) for different

    values for both rain-fed and irrigated grasslands were higher in 2018 (397 mm)
    and 2019 (358 mm), reaching a maximum in 2019. Groundwater recharge in rain-fed
    grasslands was very low in all other years. In irrigated grasslands, the depth
    of groundwater recharge reached a minimum in 2020 (131 mm), when precipitation
    was also at a minimum. The inter-annual difference in the depth of groundwater
    recharge for irrigated grasslands ranged from 0.31 to 4.4 mm. 3.4. Evapotranspiration
    changes in irrigated grasslands Evapotranspiration is critical for maintaining
    the surface water balance and surface energy balance in arid inland river basins.
    In this study, we analysed changes in evapotranspiration in irrigated and rain-fed
    grasslands at monthly and annual scales (Fig. 8). Monthly changes in evapotranspiration
    in rain-fed grassland were consistent with monthly changes in precipitation, with
    both reaching a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. Differences in evapotranspiration
    between months ranged from 1.62 to 54.46 mm. In irrigated grasslands, evapotranspiration
    was lowest in winter and highest in April, July, and November, when irrigation
    was higher. Monthly differences in evapotranspiration ranged from 4.88 to 75.49
    mm. Evapotranspiration values in irrigated grasslands were higher than those in
    rain-fed grasslands for all months, with the greatest difference occurring in
    April, when precipitation was low and irrigation was high (43.75 mm), and the
    lowest difference in January, when precipitation was low and irrigation was lacking
    (3.53 mm). Download : Download high-res image (271KB) Download : Download full-size

    months; b) in different years. ET, evapotranspiration. On an inter-annual scale,
    annual evapotranspiration changes in rain-fed grassland were consistent with annual
    precipitation changes, with large inter-annual differences in evapotranspiration
    of 12.14–148.33 mm (Fig. 8b). In comparison, such differences were smaller for
    irrigated grasslands, ranging from 18 to 45.37 mm. Evapotranspiration values in
    irrigated grasslands were higher than those in rain-fed grasslands in all years,
    with the greatest difference occurring in 2020, when precipitation was lowest
    (302.36 mm), and the lowest difference in 2018, when precipitation was highest
    (136.02 mm). To further investigate the effects of precipitation and irrigation
    on grassland evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge, we calculated the average
    precipitation from 2017 to 2021 (301 mm), with 2017 (300 mm) as a normal precipitation
    year, 2018 (397 mm) as a high-precipitation year, and 2020 (131 mm) as a low-precipitation
    year, to obtain the corresponding groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration
    values for rain-fed and irrigated grasslands under different precipitation conditions.
    As shown in Fig. 9, both groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration values were
    substantially higher in irrigated grasslands than in rain-fed grasslands under
    all precipitation conditions. Annual precipitation had a greater impact on evapotranspiration
    in rain-fed grasslands than in irrigated grasslands, with evapotranspiration exhibiting
    a considerable decrease when annual precipitation decreased. In irrigated grasslands,
    an increase in annual precipitation did not lead to an increase in evapotranspiration.
    Conversely, the impact of annual precipitation on groundwater recharge was relatively
    weak in rain-fed grasslands but stronger in irrigated grasslands, with higher
    annual precipitation corresponding to higher groundwater recharge. In particular,
    for rain-fed grasslands, the groundwater recharge from precipitation was 0 mm
    in the low-precipitation scenario and 0.29 mm in the high-precipitation scenario.
    Alternatively, for the irrigated grasslands, groundwater recharge from precipitation
    and irrigation was 1.94 and 20.56 mm in the low-precipitation scenario and 5.78
    and 20.37 mm in the high-precipitation scenario, respectively. Download : Download

    Water yield changes in irrigated grasslands Streamflow in the main channel derives
    from surface runoff, lateral flow, and baseflow generated in different parts of
    the watershed (Arnold et al., 2012). We analysed changes in different streamflow
    components in irrigated and rain-fed grasslands at monthly and annual scales (Fig.
    10). On a monthly scale, the total water yield (surface runoff + lateral flow
    + baseflow) of the rain-fed grassland was lowest in February (5.08 mm) and highest
    in July (14.88 mm); its variation was consistent with the trend of precipitation.
    Moreover, for the total water yield of the rain-fed grassland, the baseflow comprised
    over 50 % from January to May and from August to December, whereas the lateral
    flow comprised over 50 % in June and July. For the irrigated grassland, the total
    water yield was lowest in January (0.66 mm) and highest in July (126.09 mm); its
    variation was consistent with the trend of irrigation. For irrigated grasslands,
    the proportion of the lateral flow increased significantly, especially during
    the irrigation months, when the proportion exceeded 88.72 %. The proportion of
    baseflow decreased significantly in each month. On an inter-annual scale, annual
    total water yield of the rain-fed grassland was lowest in 2020 (70.52 mm) and
    highest in 2019 (103.87 mm); its variation was generally consistent with the trend
    of precipitation. The proportion of baseflow to the total water yield exceeded
    60 % for each year. Specifically, in 2020, which had the least precipitation,
    the proportion of baseflow was the highest, reaching 92.5 %. In the years (2018
    and 2019) with more precipitation, the proportion of baseflow was relatively lower,
    approximately 63 %. For irrigated grasslands, the overall change in total water
    yield was generally consistent with the change in total water yield for rain-fed
    grasslands. However, the proportions of surface runoff, lateral flow, and baseflow
    to the total water yield for irrigated grassland were different from those for
    rain-fed grassland. The proportions of surface runoff and lateral flow markedly
    increased, with those of lateral flow reaching over 90 %. Download : Download

    classification accuracy for the middle and lower reaches of the Bayin River in
    2020 was relatively high, with a total accuracy of 96 % and a kappa coefficient
    of 0.93. Grassland, as the classification basis for rain-fed and irrigated grassland,
    had a user accuracy of 0.95 and a producer accuracy of 0.98. We compared the grassland
    classification results from this study with the 2020 10-m resolution land cover
    dataset produced by the European Space Agency (ESA, https://viewer.esa-worldcover.org/worldcover)
    and the 2020 30-m annual China land cover dataset (CLCD) (Fig. 11). Grassland
    areas classified by the three methods were 718.62, 180.61, and 1,091.54 km2, respectively,
    accounting for 40 %, 10 %, and 61 % of the total basin area. From a spatial perspective,
    the grassland areas extracted in this study were widely distributed in northern
    high-elevation mountainous parts of the study area, which is consistent with the
    surface coverage characteristics of this region. In the central agricultural area,
    grassland and cultivated land exhibited a mixed distribution, which is consistent
    with the actual situation of some cultivated land being converted to grassland,
    abandoned land, and other land-use types in this region. In the central and southern
    wetland areas, grasslands and wetlands were interwoven, which is consistent with
    the scattered distribution of wetlands caused by the influence of terrain and
    groundwater levels on water distribution. However, the ESA dataset only reflects
    the concentration of grassland in the northern high-elevation mountainous area,
    with few grassland areas in agricultural and wetland zones, which does not reflect
    the mixed distribution of farmland, wetland, and grassland. In addition, a large
    amount of grassland was misclassified as bare land by ESA. The grassland extracted
    from the CLCD dataset showed a continuous distribution in the northern and eastern
    regions of the study area; however, a large area of bare land and other land-use
    types was also classified as grassland, with almost no wetland. Therefore, compared
    to ESA and CLCD datasets, our classification method boasted more spatial details
    and higher extraction accuracy. The reasons for differences in the spatial distribution
    and area of grassland among the three datasets may be as follows. First, the Landsat
    images used in the CLCD dataset have a slightly lower resolution of 30 m, resulting
    in low distinguishability between grassland and other land-use types, which reduces
    the extraction accuracy of each land class in the CLCD dataset. Second, classification
    was only performed for the middle and lower reaches of the Bayin River in this
    study, whereas the ESA and CLCD datasets perform classification on a global and
    national scale, leading to substantial differences in the classification results.

    input to SWAT–MODFLOW to simulate the hydrological processes from 2017 to 2021.
    However, LULC may vary between and within years, which could potentially affect
    the water cycle, especially when the LULC dramatically changes in the simulation
    period (Jin et al., 2019). Alternatively, in the present study, our simulation
    period was relatively short, and we used LULC data from the middle year of the
    simulation period, which can to some extent avoid the influence of intra- or inter-annual
    LULC changes on the simulation results (Arnold et al., 2012, Nie et al., 2011).
    4.2. Impact of irrigation on grassland growth status LAI is a common indicator
    for characterising vegetation growth status and an important parameter connecting
    plant growth processes with hydrological processes, such as canopy interception
    and transpiration, in the SWAT model (Ma et al., 2019). Therefore, comparing the
    differences in LAI between irrigated and rain-fed grasslands at different timescales
    can clarify the impact of irrigation on grassland growth status. Irrigation exhibited
    a notable promoting effect on the growth status of grasslands in the middle and
    lower reaches of the Bayin River. At the seasonal scale, LAI showed little difference
    between irrigated and rain-fed grasslands in the early growth stage of grassland
    (May to June), indicating that irrigation had little effect on the grassland growth
    status during this period. This is mainly because grasslands in high-altitude
    and arid regions such as the study area are mainly influenced by temperature during
    the early growth stage (Ganjurjav et al., 2020). In the middle and late grassland
    growth stages (July to September), irrigation began to have an impact on grassland
    growth (An et al., 2020, Ding et al., 2013), at which time the LAI value of irrigated
    grassland was more than 60 % higher than that of rain-fed grassland, indicating
    that irrigation effectively compensated for the water deficit of grassland vegetation
    during this period (Munro, 1958, Wu et al., 2019). At the inter-annual scale,
    the impact of irrigation on grassland growth was strongest in 2020, when precipitation
    was lowest, and weakest in 2018, when precipitation was highest. Owing to factors
    such as the overall low amount and uneven temporal and spatial distribution of
    annual precipitation in the study area (Jin et al., 2022), irrigation had a clear
    impact on grassland growth each year, as shown by an LAI difference of more than
    43 % between the two types of grassland. Moreover, the growth status of irrigated
    grasslands was more stable than that of rain-fed grasslands because of the stable
    water conditions (Wu et al., 2019), as shown by the small difference in LAI values
    between years. 4.3. Impact of grassland irrigation on watershed hydrological processes
    At the seasonal scale, except for a small amount of groundwater recharge in June
    and July when precipitation was relatively high, rain-fed grasslands exhibited
    little groundwater recharge. This was also true at the inter-annual scale, except
    for a small amount of groundwater recharge in years with higher annual precipitation,
    such as 2018 and 2019. This is related to multiple factors such as soil texture
    in the distribution area of rain-fed grasslands, the water head depth in aquifers,
    the timing, duration, and intensity of rainfall, and daily temperature (Ebrahimi
    et al., 2016). Irrigated grasslands showed obvious groundwater recharge in April,
    June, July, August, September, and November, when irrigation events occur, and
    the recharge depth was 3–6 mm higher than that of rain-fed grasslands. At the
    inter-annual scale, the groundwater recharge depth of irrigated grasslands was
    22–26 mm higher than that of rain-fed grasslands. According to Fig. 9, irrigation
    return flow is an important resource for groundwater recharge in the middle and
    lower reaches of the Bayin River relative to precipitation, which is consistent
    with previous research results in drought-prone areas such as Iran, Pakistan,
    and Florida in the United States (Ebrahimi et al., 2016, Hashemi et al., 2012,
    Shukla and Jaber, 2006). The low contribution of precipitation to the groundwater
    recharge depth is mainly attributed to the high intensity and short duration of
    convective rainfall in such areas (Ebrahimi et al., 2016, Ghazavi et al., 2012).
    In addition, the impact of annual precipitation on groundwater recharge was relatively
    weak in rain-fed grasslands but stronger in irrigated grasslands. This difference
    may have arisen because some of the precipitation events may have occurred following
    irrigation. Whereas irrigation (especially the flood irrigation) could help maintain
    soil moisture levels, which are essential for facilitating percolation and infiltration
    of water into the groundwater system (Kendy et al., 2003, Lawston et al., 2017),
    when the soil is already saturated or near saturation consequent to high levels
    of irrigation, it allows for better recharge from precipitation (Kendy et al.,
    2003, Lawston et al., 2017). The fact that seasonal and inter-annual variations
    in evapotranspiration in rain-fed grasslands responded to precipitation is consistent
    with previous research results in the arid regions of Northwest China (Huang et
    al., 2017). However, irrigation disrupted seasonal and inter-annual variations
    in evapotranspiration in the study area. That is, irrigation considerably increased
    evapotranspiration in grasslands during spring (especially April) and autumn (especially
    November). At the inter-annual scale, irrigation increased the stability of grassland
    evapotranspiration in response to annual precipitation changes (Fig. 8, Fig. 9).
    Similar studies have also revealed the strong impact of irrigation, particularly
    flood irrigation, on land cover types and regional evapotranspiration in arid
    regions (Pool et al., 2021, Suyker and Verma, 2009, Yin et al., 2021). Irrigation
    significantly increased the total water yield (the sum of surface runoff, lateral
    flow, and baseflow) of grassland during the irrigation season and for each year,
    This indicates that the irrigation return flow in the grassland areas of the middle
    and lower reaches of the Bayin River is relatively high, which is related to the
    large irrigation water volume of the grassland (Hu et al., 2017). In addition,
    irrigation altered the proportion of each runoff component to the total water
    yield for each month and each year in grassland. The proportion of lateral flow
    increased significantly, whereas the proportion of baseflow markedly decreased.
    This outcome is related to the large irrigation water volume of the grassland
    and runoff generation conditions (Zeng et al., 2016, Yin et al., 2021). 4.4. Limitations
    In this study, irrigated grassland areas were extracted using optical remote sensing
    images from Sentinel-2. However, combining optical images with radar backscattering
    information may be more accurate and effective for extracting additional irrigation
    information from grasslands, such as irrigation frequency, irrigation dates, and
    irrigation area, because radar backscattering information is often sensitive to
    soil moisture information (Bazzi et al., 2020, Hajj et al., 2014). In addition,
    we only compared the extracted grassland with that extracted by ESA and CLCD land-use
    datasets but did not compare the additionally classified irrigated and rain-fed
    grasslands with any other datasets. However, this was primarily because of the
    lack of similar datasets. The SWAT model calculates LAI through an ideal leaf
    area development model based on the effective accumulated temperature and considers
    the effects of temperature, water, nitrogen, and phosphorus stress on plant growth
    (Arnold et al., 2012, Ma et al., 2019). However, this model can only simulate
    the growth of a single crop and does not consider the impact of irrigation on
    grassland plant diversity (Tianming et al., 2012). In addition, the simulation
    of LAI depends on multiple complex parameters (Lai et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2019);
    thus, it is difficult to calibrate these parameters using only measured water
    data. Moreover, we assumed that the default grassland growth parameters employed
    in the SWAT model were optimal. All of these factors may have affected the LAI
    simulation results. Finally, we only considered the impact of flood irrigation
    on grassland growth status and corresponding hydrological processes. However,
    small-scale water-saving irrigation measures such as sprinklers and drip irrigation
    have previously been implemented in the research area. Therefore, comparing the
    effects of various irrigation modes on regional ecological–hydrological processes
    would provide better support for the reasonable planning of regional water resources
    (Graham et al., 2016). This is an important topic for future research. 5. Conclusion
    In this study, we used the GEE platform to obtain optical remote sensing (Sentinel-2)
    data and extract irrigated grasslands, as well as other land cover types. Combined
    with measured irrigation information from the Delingha Irrigation Management Bureau,
    we input grassland irrigation information into the SWAT–MODFLOW coupled model.
    According to the simulation results, we then analysed differences in plant growth
    status, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration between irrigated and rain-fed
    grasslands to reveal the impact of irrigation on the hydrological regimes of grasslands.
    The key findings were as follows. The accuracy of grassland extraction and secondary
    classification of irrigated grasslands based on optical remote sensing images
    was high. Irrigation effectively increased the LAI of grasslands during later
    stages of the growing season. Irrigation significantly increased the depth of
    groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, and total water yield in irrigated grasslands
    during the irrigation season, as well as the annual depth of groundwater replenishment,
    which stabilised the annual evapotranspiration and significantly reduced the impact
    of annual precipitation. CRediT authorship contribution statement Xin Jin: Conceptualization,

    water supply strategy is imperative for obtaining tomatoes of a high yield and
    quality; the lack of one has caused resource wastage and quality deterioration.
    To determine the suitable irrigation amount and simulate daily transpiration under
    these optimal irrigation conditions, a two-year greenhouse cultivation experiment
    was conducted over 2022–2023. Commencing at anthesis, three distinct irrigation
    gradients were triggered and designated as irrigation controls with the lower
    limits set at 80% (T1), 70% (T2), and 60% (T3) of the substrate water-holding
    capacity. We determined the optimal irrigation amount by ranking the treatments
    using the TOPSIS method, balancing the tomato yield and quality. A segmented daily
    transpiration model under optimal irrigation conditions driven by crop and environmental
    factors was established using the Marquardt method and data from 2022, and the
    model was validated using data from 2023. The results indicated that T2 was the
    optimal irrigation amount, with the water use efficiency increased by 18.0%, but
    with a 10.9% decrease in yield, while the quality indices improved significantly.
    The R2 values of the segmented model in the flowering and fruit-setting stage
    and the picking stage were 0.92 and 0.86, respectively, which could provide support
    for optimized water management for tomato planting in greenhouse substrate cultivation.
    Keywords: deficit irrigation; greenhouse; tomato; transpiration; yield; water
    use efficiency 1. Introduction Tomatoes are extensively cultivated in greenhouses
    [1,2]. Soil-less cultivation techniques have gained widespread attention, given
    their advantages in overcoming rotation obstacles, increasing yields, and saving
    energy and labor [3,4]. Coconut coir, which is characterized by a low cost and
    minimal environmental risk, is an excellent substrate for soilless cultivation
    [5]. Irrigation substantially determines the yield and quality of substrate-cultivated
    tomatoes [6,7]. Using current production practices, the irrigation amount is often
    overlooked in favor of unilaterally increasing the yield. Apart from resulting
    in water and nutrient loss, excessive irrigation triggers pest and disease, leading
    to a decline in the tomato quality [8]. Moderate water stress, by contrast, can
    enhance the tomato quality and water use efficiency, while maintaining the yield
    [9,10]. Given these considerations, it is important to investigate the optimal
    irrigation strategy for substrate-grown tomatoes and establish a corresponding
    transpiration estimation model under substrate-cultivated conditions. The FAO
    recommends using the product of reference crop transpiration (ET0) and crop coefficient
    (Kc) to determine crop transpiration under standard conditions. This value (ETc)
    is then is multiplied by a specific stress index (Ks) to obtain the crop transpiration
    under stress (ETa) [11]. As the transpiration of greenhouse crops is mainly influenced
    by micrometeorological factors under sufficient water supply conditions [12],
    ETc can also be evaluated indirectly using greenhouse micrometeorological data
    [13]. Prior studies have focused on simulating transpiration under a sufficient
    water supply condition, such as the FAO Penman [14], FAO Radiation [15], FAO-56
    Penman–Monteith [11], Hargreaves [16], and Priestley–Taylor models [17]. However,
    given that these indirect models are based on specific climatic conditions and
    the modeling parameters are difficult to obtain, their generalization and application
    in production practice are limited. Therefore, other researchers [18,19] tried
    to simplify the model based on the correlation between crop transpiration and
    the greenhouse microenvironment, including factors such as radiation, temperature,
    and humidity. For instance, some models are based on cumulative solar radiation
    [20,21], while others are based on cumulative pan evaporation [22,23]. These simplified
    models have been extensively applied in production practices due to their simplicity
    and practicality. However, these indirect models are based on a single variable.
    Regarding a particular crop, the transpiration rate depends not only on the crop’s
    growth and development stage, but also on other factors, such as the temperature,
    wind speed, and water vapor pressure deficit [24]. Therefore, other researchers
    performed the multivariate fitting of greenhouse meteorological factors, crop
    factors, and measured transpiration value and used the optimized equation obtained
    by multivariate fitting to estimate the rate of transpiration [25]. The transpiration
    rate of a crop changes throughout its growth, and the greenhouse micrometeorological
    factors also change. Liu et al. [26] and Li et al. [27] established multivariate
    nonlinear transpiration estimation models for greenhouse-grown melons and tomatoes,
    respectively. However, the versatility of the model may be poor as it lacks consideration
    for the changes in water consumption intensity and greenhouse microenvironment
    during crop growth and development. In addition, due to the interaction between
    crop transpiration and the greenhouse microenvironment, the effect of the former
    on the latter gradually increases with the growth and development of the crops
    [28]. Therefore, the sensitivity of the crop to the greenhouse microenvironment
    is different at different growth stages [29]. The correlation between daily transpiration
    and the greenhouse microenvironment at the different growth stages of crops must
    be explored, and a segmented daily transpiration model of the water demand of
    crops must be established. Therefore, the objectives of this study were the following:
    (1) investigate the influence of irrigation on tomatoes and detect the optimal
    amount of water; (2) simulate daily transpiration under optimal irrigation conditions.
    We took tomatoes grown in a greenhouse substrate as the research subject and set
    three different irrigation gradients. The changes in the water consumption characteristics,
    morphological parameters, and greenhouse microenvironment of tomatoes were observed
    in a two-year experiment. A comprehensive evaluation of the irrigation levels
    was conducted based on their impact on the yield, quality, and water use efficiency
    to determine the optimal irrigation level. A multivariate estimation model of
    the daily transpiration of tomatoes at different growth stages under deficit irrigation
    was established, which could provide a theoretical basis for high-yield, high-quality
    tomato production in a Venlo-type greenhouse substrate culture. 2. Materials and
    Methods 2.1. Experiment Site and Plant Information The experimental site was located
    in Xinxiang City, Henan Province (35°19′ N,113°53′ E; altitude: 73.2 m). The average
    annual temperature is 14.1 °C, the frost-free period lasts for 210 d, and the
    annual sunshine duration is 2398.8 h. The experiment was carried out in a Venlo
    greenhouse at the Xinxiang Comprehensive Experimental Base of the Chinese Academy
    of Agricultural Sciences. The greenhouse was situated north, facing south. The
    main frame was made from light, hot-dipped galvanized steel, and the outer sheath
    was made from 8 mm-thick double-layer glass, covering an area of 560 m2 (28 m
    × 20 m). The specific greenhouse structure information is shown in Figure 1a.
    Figure 1. Schematic side view of the experimental greenhouse and plant information.
    (a) is the schematic side view of the experimental greenhouse, the arrow in the
    figure refers to direction of airflow under different ventilation conditions.
    (b) is the experiment photo and plant information, including plant spacing and
    row spacing. The growth of the tomatoes was divided into three stages: the seedling,
    flowering and fruit-setting, and picking stages. The experimental tomato variety
    was Provence, which was planted on 21 August 2022 and 28 March 2023. The seedling
    stage lasted from 21 August to 27 September 2022 and from 28 March to 27 April
    2023; the flowering and fruit-setting stage lasted from 27 September to 9 November
    2022 and from 27 April to 31 May 2023; the picking stage lasted from 9 November
    2022 to 9 January 2023 and from 31 May 2023 to 8 July 2023. Coconut coir was used
    as the cultivation substrate in the experiment, with a sufficient water supply
    at the seedling stage. During the flowering and fruit-setting stages, the water
    content of the substrate was taken as a control factor, and three lower limits
    were set, which were 60% (T1), 70% (T2), and 80% (T3) of the water-holding capacity
    of the substrate. Each treatment was repeated three times, and 24 plants were
    studied for each trial. The volume of coconut coir after foaming was 100 cm ×
    20 cm × 10 cm, which was wrapped in plastic film on six sides, with drainage holes
    only on the bottom edge. Two substrate strips were selected for each treatment,
    and a return tank was installed under the substrate strips. The scale (with an
    accuracy of 1 g) was weighed at 8:00 in the morning and 18:00 in the evening every
    day. The weight data in the morning and the weather conditions during the day
    were used as the basis for irrigation. The calculation formula is as follows [9]:
    𝑇 𝑑 = 𝑊 𝑖 + 𝐼 𝑖 − 𝑅 𝑖 − 𝑊 𝑖+1 (1) where Td represents daily transpiration per
    tomato plant, in kg; Wi represents the sum of the weight of the substrate tank
    and the substrate and plant weights at 8:00 on day i, in kg; Ii represents the
    amount of irrigation on day i, in kg per plant; Ri represents the irrigation return
    volume on day i, in kg; and Wi+1 represents the sum of the substrate tank, substrate,
    and plant weights at 8:00 on day i + 1. Due to the coconut chaff being wrapped
    in a six-sided plastic film, the evaporation of the substrate surface was negligible.
    The transpiration of tomato plants grown in the substrate was measured by weighing
    lysimeters (accuracy = 1 g). Three tomato plants were planted in the lysimeter
    with the same spacing as the other plants. To minimize the boundary effects, the
    lysimeter was placed in the middle of the greenhouse, and records were taken every
    half an hour. The transpiration measurement, Tm, is expressed in energy units
    (mm·d−1), which was transformed using the following formula [28]: 𝑇 𝑚 =𝜆 𝑃𝐷×Δ𝑚×35.3
    Δ𝑡 (2) where λ represents the latent heat of water vaporization, in w·m2; PD represents
    the planting density of tomato, in plants per m2; and Δm represents the change
    in the quality of the substrate tank during the period Δt (s), in g. 2.2. Measurement
    Items and Methods An automatic meteorological recording system was installed at
    a height of 2 m in the center of the greenhouse, as shown in Figure 1a. The monitoring
    items included solar radiation (Rs), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (Ta),
    and wind speed (W). Rs was measured with a radiometer (LI200X, Campbell Scientific,
    Inc., Logan, UT, USA) with an accuracy of 0.2 kW (m2 (mV))−1. Ta and RH were measured
    with a temperature and humidity sensor (CS215, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA). The wind speed above the canopy was measured with an ultrasonic anemometer
    (Wind Sonic, Gill, London, UK) with an accuracy of 0.02 m/s. All data were recorded
    with intervals of 10 s, and the average was calculated once every 30 min and stored
    in the CR1000 data collector (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA). All sensor
    probes were calibrated before the experiment began. Two weeks after transplanting,
    six uniform plants in each treatment group were marked. The plant height, stem
    diameter, leaf length, and maximum leaf width of the plants were measured every
    10 days, and the leaf length and width and plant height were measured with a tape
    measure. The leaf area index (LAI) is the ratio of leaf area per plant to unit
    area, and the leaf area per plant of tomato is the product of a single leaf’s
    area (leaf length × maximum leaf width) and the reduction coefficient of 0.64
    [30]. The LAI per day within the time interval of two measurements was obtained
    with a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation using MATLAB R2022a software. The
    stem diameter was measured at 2 cm from the stem base in two directions with a
    digital caliper (accuracy = 0.01 mm), which was recorded as the stem diameter.
    At the maturity stage the yields of 12 representative plants in the middle of
    each treatment plot were studied. Each treatment was repeated three times, and
    the number of red and pest-free fruits picked from 12 plants was recorded. The
    weight of each single fruit was weighed using an electronic balance with an accuracy
    of 0.1 g, and the total yield was calculated. The water use efficiency (WUE, kg·m−3)
    was calculated using the following formula [8]: 𝑊𝑈𝐸= 𝑌 𝑎 𝑇 (3) where Ya represents
    the yield of tomatoes (kg·plant−1) and T represents the water consumption of the
    crop (m3 per plant−1). The crop was planted in wide and narrow rows, with a wide
    row spacing of 1 m, a narrow row spacing of 0.4 m, and a plant spacing of 0.3
    m, as shown in Figure 1a. The nutrient solution formula was the Hoagland solution.
    The watering method was drip irrigation. A drip irrigation pipeline was laid in
    each row. The dripper flow rate was 1.98 L·h−1, and the dripper spacing was the
    same as the plant spacing. An irrigation controller and a water meter accurate
    to 0.001 m3 were installed at the head of each plot to irrigate the tomatoes regularly
    and strictly control the irrigation. There were two ventilation modes in the greenhouse:
    natural and forced ventilation, as shown in Figure 1a. Natural ventilation was
    provided by the combination of a side window and roof vent. Before topping, to
    prevent the steep growth of seedlings, forced ventilation was controlled with
    a wet curtain and negative pressure fans. After topping during the picking period,
    forced ventilation was adopted to also provide external shade. When the temperature
    exceeded 30 °C, the forced ventilation system turned on. Conversely, the roof
    vent and side window were closed when the temperature was lower than 15 °C, and
    natural ventilation was applied at other times. Six mature fruits with uniform
    size and color and no damage were selected from each plot for measuring the quality
    indices. Total soluble solids were measured using a portable sugar meter digital
    refractometer (ATAGO, PR-32α, Tokyo, Japan). Vitamin C was measured using the
    2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol sodium titration method. Soluble sugar content was
    determined via enthrone colorimetry. Soluble acid was measured via titration [31].
    Microsoft Excel 2019 was used for statistics; SPSS 25 and MATLAB R2022a software
    were used to process and analyze the data. The mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square
    error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient
    (NSE) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model simulation. The calculation
    formulae are as follows [13]: 𝑀𝐴𝐸= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 | 𝑇 𝑖 − 𝑀 𝑖 | (4) 𝑅𝑆𝑀𝐸= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1
    𝑛 ( 𝑇 𝑖 − 𝑀 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (5) 𝑀𝑅𝐸= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 (| 𝑇

    ith simulated value of the model calculation; Mi represents the ith measured value
    of the lysimeter measurement; and M represents the average value of Mi. When the
    NSE is close to 1, the model fitting effect is better. 3. Results 3.1. Variation
    in Microclimate Parameters and Daily Transpiration under Different Irrigation
    Conditions Figure 2 shows the dynamic changes in daily accumulated solar radiation
    (DAR), wind speed (W), water vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature (Ta),
    and daily transpiration of the tomatoes under different irrigation conditions
    from flowering and fruit-setting to picking in 2022 and 2023. As shown in the
    diagram, there are obvious differences in the DAR, VPD, and Ta at the different
    growth stages. In 2022, the daily average DAR values during the flowering and
    fruit-setting period and the picking period were 83.67 and 50.60 mm·d−1, respectively,
    while the daily average VPD values were 0.48 and 0.27 kPa, and the daily average
    Ta values were 21.27 and 16.06 °C, respectively. In 2023, the daily average DAR
    values were 119.70 mm·d−1 and 99.21 mm·d−1, while the daily average VPD values
    were 0.71 kPa and 0.84 kPa, and the daily average Ta values were 21.99 °C and
    26.23 °C, respectively. The DAR showed a significant correlation with the VPD
    and Ta, and the VPD and Ta fluctuated with the fluctuation in the DAR. At the
    daily scale, Ta fluctuated more in 2022 than it did in 2023, as shown in Figure
    2c1,c2 There was no significant difference in wind speed between 2022 and 2023,
    and the average W values in the flowering and fruit-setting periods were 0.10
    and 0.12 m·s−1, respectively. The average wind speeds in the picking stages were
    0.09 and 0.17 m·s−1 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The two-year average for the
    maximum daily wind speed did not exceed 0.3 m·s−1. Notably, there was no significant
    difference in wind speed between the flowering and fruit-setting and picking periods
    in 2022, which was almost close to 0. However, in 2023, there were differences
    in the daily scale and wind speed changes at the different growth stages. The
    wind speed fluctuation during the picking period was stronger than that during
    the flowering and fruit-setting periods, as shown in Figure 2c2. Figure 2. Variations

    different irrigation conditions in 2022 and 2023. DAR represents daily accumulated

    are the variation of DAR in 2022 and 2023. (a1,b1,c1,c2) are the variation of
    microenvironmental factors in 2022 and 2023, the bule and grey area in (c1,c2)
    represents standard deviation of air temperature and wind speed recorded by the
    meteorological station every 30 min during a day, respectively. The variations
    in the daily transpiration of tomatoes cultivated under different irrigation conditions
    in 2022 and 2023 are shown in Figure 2a2,b2. The water demand of the tomatoes
    under different irrigation conditions tended to increase daily at the initial
    stage. The daily transpiration rate increased gradually with the increase in the
    LAI at the flowering stage. There were differences in the daily transpiration
    rate at the different irrigation levels. These differences were most significant
    when the intensity of water demand reached its peak. In 2022, the tomatoes’ water
    demand peak occurred during the fruit enlargement period in mid- and late October.
    During this peak (15–25 October), the daily average transpiration rates of T1,
    T2, and T3 were 2.9 mm·d−1, 2.1 mm·d−1, and 1.7 mm·d−1, respectively. In 2023,
    the maximum water demand occurred at the picking stage. During this period (5–15
    June), the daily average transpiration rates of T1, T2, and T3 were 3.7 mm·d−1,
    2.7 mm·d−1, and 2.1 mm·d−1, respectively. The daily transpiration rate remained
    relatively stable with the LAI after entering the picking period. The daily water
    requirements varied across the different growth stages, while the daily transpiration
    rate gradually decreased with the decrease in irrigation amount. The average daily
    transpiration rates of T1, T2, and T3 during the flowering and fruit-setting period
    were 1.96 mm·d−1, 1.53 mm·d−1, and 1.30 mm·d−1 in 2022. In contrast, during the
    picking period, the daily transpiration rates were 0.88 mm·d−1, 0.75 mm·d−1, and
    0.62 mm·d−1 for T1, T2, and T3, respectively. In 2023, the average daily transpiration
    of T1, T2, and T3 in the flowering and fruit-setting period was 1.74 mm·d−1, 1.48
    mm·d−1, and 1.24 mm·d−1, and the daily transpiration rates in the picking period
    were 3.24 mm·d−1, 2.29 mm·d−1, and 1.80 mm·d−1, respectively. 3.2. Effect of Different
    Water Deficits on Morphological Characteristics of Tomatoes During growth, the
    physiological indices of T1, T2, and T3 increased at first, reached their maximum
    value, and then slightly decreased, but remained relatively stable. The trends
    of the growth indices of tomatoes under different irrigation conditions were basically
    the same, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1. The effects of irrigation
    amount on tomato growth indices 2022. Table 2. The effects of irrigation amount
    on tomato growth indices in 2023. As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the effect
    of a water deficit was significant for the LAI and plant height (p < 0.01), but
    not for the stem diameter, 50 days after transplanting (30 days after the beginning
    of the water deficit). At 40 days after transplanting (the 20th day of water deficit),
    the plant height and LAI of T1, T2, and T3 were significantly different (p < 0.05),
    and the plant height and LAI gradually decreased with the decrease in irrigation
    amount. A significant difference in plant height was observed among the different
    irrigation plots as the tomatoes grew (p < 0.01). The LAIs for T1, T2, and T3
    were significantly different after 42 days, but the difference between T2 and
    T3 was not significant. Compared with the plant height and LAI, water stress had
    the smallest effect on the stem diameter. The differences between T1, T2, and
    T3 started to show after 40 and 62 days of transplanting in 2022 and 2023, respectively
    (p < 0.05). 3.3. Effects of Different Irrigation Amount on Yield, Quality, and
    Water Use Efficiency of Tomatoes As shown in Table 3, the effect of water stress
    on the tomato fruit quality was significant. Apart from the total soluble solids
    content in 2022, the difference under different irrigation conditions reached
    a significant level in 2022 and 2023 (p < 0.01). The total soluble solids content
    (TSS), soluble sugar content (SSC), and organic acidity (OA) had a negative correlation
    with the irrigation level. As the irrigation amount decreased, the TSS, SSC, and
    OA levels of the fruits gradually increased, and the ratio of sugar to acid (SAR)
    also gradually increased as irrigation levels decreased. With the decrease in
    irrigation amount, the content of VC first increased, and then decreased; the
    levels of VC in the plants was ranked in the order of T2 > T3 > T1, and the content
    of VC in T2 and T3 was significantly higher than that in T1. Furthermore, the
    fruit nutritional quality indices were higher in 2022 than those in 2023. Table
    3. The effects of irrigation amount on fruit quality. As shown in Table 4, the
    yield of tomatoes was positively correlated with the irrigation amount, while
    the water use efficiency was negatively correlated with this value. The effect
    of a water deficit on the yield and water use efficiency (WUE) reached a quite
    significant level (p < 0.01). With the decrease in irrigation amount, the yield
    per plant gradually decreased. For example, the yield per plant of the groups
    T2 and T3 in 2022 decreased, respectively, by 10.94% and 21.09% compared with
    that of T1, and the total yield decreased by 13.17% and 23.20%. In 2023, the yield
    per plant of the groups T2 and T3 decreased by 13.08% and 26.15%, respectively,
    and the total yield reduced by 10.90% and 24.38%. With the decrease in irrigation
    amount compared to that of T1, the WUE of the groups T2 and T3 increased by 6.94%
    and 10.58%, respectively, in 2022; these values increased by 18.01% and 24.89%,
    respectively, in 2023. However, the water use efficiency of the groups T1, T2,
    and T3 decreased by 45.73%, 30.07%, and 27.09% more, respectively, in 2023 compared
    to those in 2022. Table 4. The effects of irrigation amount on yield and water
    use efficiency. 3.4. The Determination of Optimal Irrigation Amount Using TOPSIS
    By conducting a comprehensive comparison using TOPSIS, GRA, and PCA, Li et al.
    [31] proposed that TOPSIS can be better applied to the comprehensive evaluation
    of greenhouse tomato yield and quality in north China. Based on the experimental
    results from 2022 and 2023, this study utilized the TOPSIS method and chose the
    yield, water use efficiency, soluble solids, VC content, and sugar–acid ratio
    as indicators to evaluate the different irrigation amounts. Comprehensive scores
    were obtained and ranked, as shown in Table 5. According to Table 5, the experiments
    in 2022 and 2023 had a comprehensive ranking of the irrigation methods in the
    order of T2 > T3 > T1. T2 had the highest comprehensive score, and T1 had the
    lowest one. Thus, under the conditions of high yield and high quality, the optimal
    irrigation amount was that of T2. Table 5. Integrated evaluation of different
    irrigation amounts using TOPSIS. 3.5. Modeling the Diurnal Transpiration of Tomatoes
    in Substrate Cultivation 3.5.1. Determination of Model Factors Based on the daily
    transpiration data of tomatoes measured with a lysimeter (Tm) in the flowering
    and fruit-setting and picking periods of T2 in 2022, the daily accumulative solar
    radiation (DAR), daily average wind speed (W), daily average water vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD), daily average air temperature (Ta) at a height of 2 m from the
    ground, and leaf area index (LAI) were selected for path and correlation analyses,
    as shown in Table 6. Table 6. Correlation and pathway analyses between T2 daily
    transpiration and environmental factors at different fertility stages. As shown
    in Table 6, there were different correlations between the Tm and various variables
    at the different growth stages. The correlations between the Tm and other variables
    during the flowering and fruit-setting stages were ranked from strong to weak
    as follows: VPD > DAR > LAI > Ta > W. Here, the correlations between the VPD,
    DAR, LAI, Ta, and Tm were significant. The correlation between the VPD and Tm
    was the strongest, with a correlation coefficient of 0.864. The path analysis
    of Tm and the environmental factors showed that VPD had the biggest impact on
    the Tm, regardless of whether it was direct or indirect. However, the correlation
    analysis between Tm and the related variables in the picking period showed that
    the correlation between the Tm and DAR was the strongest, and the correlation
    coefficient between each related variable and the Tm was ranked in the order of
    DAR > VPD > W > Ta > LAI. Among them, the correlations between the DAR, VPD, W,
    Ta, and Tm reached a significant level, while the correlation between LAI and
    Tm was the weakest and was not significant. Meanwhile, the path analysis of Tm
    and the related variables showed that the influence of the VPD and LAI on Tm decreased,
    the influence of the DAR and W on Tm increased, and the DAR had the greatest influence
    on Tm both directly and indirectly. 3.5.2. Establishment of Daily Transpiration
    Model The analysis in Section 3.5.1 showed that the relationship between the daily
    transpiration rate (Tm) and the environmental factors changed with the growth
    and development of the plants. The leaf area index (LAI) gradually increased with
    crop growth and reached its peak at the end of the flowering and fruit-setting
    period. In this stage, the daily averaged water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) had
    the most significant effect on the Tm, followed by the daily cumulative solar
    radiation (DAR) and the LAI, and the correlation between the daily mean temperature
    (Ta) and the Tm was also significant, but the correlation between the Tm and wind
    speed (W) was not significant. Therefore, the VPD, DAR, Ta, and LAI were selected
    as parameters to simulate the Tm during the flowering and fruit-setting period.
    However, once in the picking stage, the DAR had the most significant effect on
    the Tm, followed by the VPD, W, and Ta. The correlation between the LAI and Tm
    was negative and not significant, which indicates that the LAI had a smaller effect
    on the Tm, and the Tm was mainly controlled by meteorological factors at this
    stage. Therefore, the DAR, VPD, Ta, and W were selected as parameters to simulate
    Tm during the maturation period. Based on the relationship between the chosen
    parameters and the Tm at various growth stages, Marquardt parameter estimation
    was utilized to derive the daily transpiration model for T2 at the different growth
    stages as follows: 𝑇𝑠={ 0.001𝐷𝐴 𝑅 1.261 +0.689ln(𝑉𝑃𝐷)+0.399ln(𝑇𝑎)+0.527ln(𝐿𝐴𝐼)
    1≤𝐿𝐴𝐼<𝐿𝐴 𝐼 𝑚𝑎𝑥 0.011𝐷𝐴 𝑅 1.04 +0.189exp(𝑉𝑃𝐷)−0.110ln(𝑇𝑎)+5.625ln(𝑊)−6.01 𝐿𝐴𝐼=𝐿𝐴
    𝐼 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (8) where Ts represents the simulated daily transpiration rate, in mm·d−1;
    DAR represents the daily accumulated solar radiation, in mm·d−1; Ta represents
    the daily average temperature; W represents the daily average wind speed, in m·s−1;
    and LAI represents the leaf area index, in m2·m−2. 3.6. Model Validation Liu et
    al. [26] and Li et al. [27] proposed an unsegmented multivariate fitting equation
    for estimating the Tm over the full life span of the tomatoes based on the relationship
    between daily transpiration, Tm, meteorological factors, and the LAI, which ignored
    the variations in crop development and greenhouse meteorological conditions. To
    validate the necessity of establishing a segmented model, an unsegmented daily
    transpiration estimation model T′ was established by using the meteorological
    data of the measured daily transpiration rate and greenhouse for the year 2022,
    as shown below: 𝑇′=0.514ln(𝐷𝐴𝑅)+0.08ln(𝑉𝑃𝐷)+0.379ln(𝑇𝑎)+1.05ln(𝑊)+0.006exp(𝐿𝐴𝐼)+0.249
    (9) where Ts represents the simulated daily transpiration rate, in mm·d−1; DAR
    represents the daily accumulated solar radiation, in mm·d−1; Ta represents the
    daily average temperature, in °C; W represents the daily average wind speed, in
    m·s−1; and LAI represents the leaf area index, in m2·m−2. Figure 3 is the comparison
    between the daily measured and simulated values obtained by segmented modeling
    Ts and unsegmented modeling T′ in 2023. Table 7 depicts the comparison of the
    simulation accuracies of the Ts and T′ in the flowering and fruit-setting and
    picking stages. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 7, unsegmented modeling T′ underestimated
    the Tm at the flowering and fruit-setting stage, with a mean absolute error (MAE)
    and root-mean-square error (RSME) of 0.27 mm·d−1 and 0.34 mm·d−1, respectively,
    and an NSE of 0.66. The mean relative error MRE of the segmented model Ts was
    improved by 5% compared with that of the T′ model, and the MAE, RSME, and NSE
    were 0.15 mm·d−1, 0.18 mm·d−1, and 0.91, respectively, which were smaller than
    those of the T′ model. The simulation accuracies of the T′ model were improved
    during the maturation period, at 12.99%, 0.25 mm·d−1, and 0.30 mm·d−1 for the
    MRE, MAE, and RSME, respectively, while those of the Ts model were 11.07%, 0.20
    mm·d−1, and 0.25 mm·d−1. In addition, the NSE of the Ts model simulation is 0.85,
    while the NSE of the T′ model is 0.73; thus, the Ts model was still better than
    the T′ model. Figure 4 shows the linear fit of the simulated and measured values
    of the segmented model Ts at the flowering and maturation stages. The correlation
    coefficients R2 of the Ts model at the flowering and maturation stages were 0.92
    and 0.86, respectively. The synthesis of the statistical indicators in Table 7
    and Figure 3 and Figure 4 shows that the simulation accuracy of the Ts model was
    higher than that of the T′ model; in addition, fewer parameters were required
    by the Ts model than by the T′ model. Therefore, the segmented model Ts was better
    than the unsegmented model T′, which could accurately simulate the daily transpiration
    of Venlo-type greenhouse substrate-cultivated tomatoes. Figure 3. Comparison of
    simulated and measured values of daily transpiration; Ti represents the value

    The aim of facility vegetable production has always been to achieve a high yield
    and quality [8,31]. Several studies [32,33,34] have indicated that an appropriate
    degree of water stress can improve the quality of tomatoes, while ensuring a stable
    yield. Using the current production practices, an improper water supply has resulted
    in wasted water resources and a reduced fruit quality [35]. To determine the optimal
    irrigation lower limit, this study established three different irrigation gradients
    (T1, T2, and T3) according to the matrix water-holding capacity from the beginning
    of flowering and investigated the effect of the irrigation amount on the tomato
    yield and quality. Previous studies [36,37] have shown that crop transpiration
    is positively correlated with the irrigation amount, and crop quality is negatively
    correlated with irrigation amount within a certain threshold. In this study, with
    the increase in irrigation amount, the daily transpiration rate, plant height,
    stem diameter, LAI, and yield increased. The water use efficiency (WUE), total
    soluble solids (TSS), soluble sugar content (SSC), and sugar–acid ratio (SAR)
    decreased progressively with the increase in irrigation amount. The VC content
    increased first, and then decreased with the decreased irrigation amount (Table
    1, Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4), which is consistent with the results of previous
    studies [8,31,37]. However, compared with other studies in a nearby area [8,24,31],
    it was found that under the same irrigation conditions, the quality indices, such
    as the TSS, SAR, and SSC, of the tomatoes in this study were better than those
    of the -soil grown tomatoes, which is consistent with the results of several studies
    [38,39,40]. Due to the different effects of a water deficit on the different yield
    and quality indicators, the comprehensive evaluation of different irrigation amounts
    in this study was conducted by utilizing the TOPISIS method. The results showed
    that the T2 treatment with a 70% matrix water-holding capacity significantly improved
    the WUE and quality of the tomatoes when there was no significant decrease in
    yield, and the comprehensive score was the highest (Table 5). Therefore, it is
    recommended to take a 70% matrix water-holding capacity as the lower limit of
    irrigation for high-yield and high-quality tomato production. However, due to
    the different sensitivities of tomatoes to water at the different growth stages
    [41], the impact of water stress on the tomato yield and quality during the various
    growth stages remains to be elucidated. Therefore, different water treatments
    need to be conducted at different growth stages to further investigate the effects
    of water stress on the yield and quality of tomatoes grown in a substrate. In
    this study, correlation and path analyses were conducted on the daily transpiration
    rate (Tm) and environmental factors in the flowering, fruit formation, and maturation
    periods of tomatoes grown in a substrate (Table 6). The results indicated that
    the Tm at the different growth stages was mainly influenced by meteorological
    factors. During the flowering and fruit formation stage, the Tm was primarily
    influenced by the vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while during the picking period,
    the Tm was primarily influenced by the daily cumulative amount of solar radiation
    (DAR). This may be attributed to the interaction between the greenhouse microenvironment
    and plants [42]. Crop transpiration causes cooling and humidification [30], and
    the transpiration rate of crops will gradually increase during growth. The canopy
    of the greenhouse may obstruct ventilation, which will increase during crop growth,
    resulting in a gradual increase in the volatility of the wind speed (Figure 2c2).
    Additionally, as the crops grew in 2023, the temperature gradually increased due
    to external environment influences, and the relationship between the Tm and meteorological
    factors, such as wind speed and temperature, also changed. For instance, previous
    studies [43,44] have shown that a temperature of 25 °C is the most suitable for
    tomato growth and development. In the range from 15 °C to 25 °C, the increase
    in temperature promotes the growth and development of tomatoes. When the temperature
    exceeds 25 °C, the growth and development of tomatoes are inhibited [45]. In 2023,
    the average daily temperature during the tomato flowering and fruit-setting period
    was 21.99 °C, while it was 26.23 °C during the picking period. The increased temperature
    during the flowering and fruit formation stage promoted the growth of the tomatoes.
    However, as they grew, the Ta gradually increased, and the increase in temperature
    during the picking period inhibited the growth of the tomatoes. The impacts of
    temperature on the daily transpiration of tomatoes in a substrate culture were
    different at the flowering and fruit-setting and picking periods. Due to the selection
    of model parameters, the Tm gradually increased with the increase in LAI during
    the flowering and fruit-setting period, and the correlation between the daily
    transpiration rate of tomatoes and the LAI reached a significant level (p < 0.01).
    To accurately simulate the Tm, the change in LAI must be accounted for, while
    considering the meteorological factors. During the picking period, the LAI remained
    stable, and the correlation between the Tm and LAI was not significant. The Tm
    fluctuated with the DAR, and the Tm was influenced by meteorological factors.
    Thus, it was imperative to adjust the model parameters to match the crop’s growth
    period alterations. The FAO indicated that the estimation of evapotranspiration
    based on pan-evaporation data for a period of 10 days or longer was warranted
    [11]; however, the water-holding capacity of the substrate was much lower than
    that of the soil. Thus, this method, which is widely used for the irrigation management
    of greenhouse soil-cultivated crops, could not satisfy the requirement of precise
    irrigation management in greenhouses. The Penman–Monteith model, which is the
    most widely used approach in evapotranspiration simulation [15,46], has been validated
    under various climatic conditions around the world; yet, it is difficult to obtain
    the necessary parameters, limiting its application in practical production [29].
    Therefore, when simulating the daily transpiration of tomatoes cultivated in a
    greenhouse substrate, instead of following the lead of the previous studies [46,47],
    which first determined the potential transpiration of the crop and then determined
    the daily transpiration under insufficient irrigation conditions by calculating
    the stress index, this study screened the model parameters by analyzing the relationship
    between the daily transpiration of tomatoes under deficient irrigation conditions
    and the factors affecting daily transpiration (Table 6). A segmented model for
    the daily transpiration of tomatoes grown in a Venlo greenhouse substrate was
    established based on the correlation between daily transpiration and environmental
    factors at the different growth stages, where the greenhouse environmental factors
    and LAI were the driving forces, the experimental data from 2022 were used for
    training, and the experimental data from 2023 were used for verification. The
    R2 during the flowering and fruit-setting and picking periods were 0.92 and 0.86,
    respectively (Figure 3 and Figure 4). The segmented model proposed in this study,
    compared with the model proposed by Liu et al. [26], integrates the physiological
    processes of the crop itself and the changes in environmental factors and expands
    the wind speed and water vapor pressure deficit terms, which covers the factors
    more comprehensively. Therefore, this model is more sensitive to the changes in
    meteorological parameters and more versatile. However, the training of the model
    was based on the 2022 fall data and verification was based on the 2023 spring
    data, which only verifies the applicability of the model for tomatoes grown in
    spring. The applicability of the model to tomatoes grown in fall must be investigated.
    Nevertheless, because the model parameters were easy to obtain, this is a simple
    and fast method for estimating the daily transpiration of tomatoes, which can
    serve as a basis for the irrigation of high-yield and -quality tomato production
    in a Venlo greenhouse in northern China. 5. Conclusions Substrate cultivation
    can be used to more successfully obtain high-quality fruits when compared to soil
    cultivation. It is recommended to use a 70% substrate water-holding capacity as
    the lower limit of irrigation for Venlo-type substrate tomato cultivation in north
    China, which can increase the water use efficiency by 18.00%, while the tomato
    yield decreases by 10.90%. Meanwhile, the sugar–acid ratio, VC content, total
    soluble solids, soluble sugar content, organic acidity, and other nutritional
    quality of tomatoes were improved, which reflects an improved quality, while ensuring
    a high tomato yield. Daily transpiration during the flowering and fruit-setting
    stage was mainly influenced by the vapor pressure deficit, and it mostly correlated
    with the daily accumulated solar radiation value; the model considered the greenhouse
    environmental and crop factors as drivers. The R2 during the flowering and fruit-setting
    and picking stages was more than 0.85, which could be used to easily and effectively
    estimate the daily transpiration of tomatoes and could provide support for the
    irrigation management of high-quality and -yield tomatoes in Venlo greenhouse
    substrate cultivation. Author Contributions P.Y.: investigation, data curation,

  description: Adopting and developing sustainable precision irrigation systems allows
    for improving productivity, reducing water and energy losses in agricultural fields.
    This paper deals with the development and real-time implementation of a smart
    precision irrigation system (SPIS). The proposed system combines two irrigation
    approaches, processed by a feedback fuzzy logic (FL) controller, and long-range
    data transmission and monitoring via the LoRa protocol. The combined approaches
    not only enhance overall performance but also address several limitations commonly
    associated with existing approaches. The proposed system uses the collected data
    from the sensors unit to provide the optimal irrigation decision and communicates
    it with the operator (farmer) via a developed IoT platform. Data from soil moisture,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, and rainfall sensors are processed through
    the FL controller to adjust the irrigation times. The inputs and outputs are fuzzified
    by trapezoidal and triangular membership functions. Mamdani's fuzzy inference
    is used to control the system through a set of linguistic control rules for a
    more accurate decision for each scenario. The field experimentation of the developed
    SPIS in the eastern region of Morocco shows high efficiency and reliability by
    saving water and energy compared to traditional irrigation control. The proposed
    system, with remote data monitoring, promotes better management of irrigation,
    water, and energy consumption, and it is suitable to be mounted with any type
    of irrigation installation in the field, without extensive modifications.

    saving 1. Introduction Agriculture is considered a key issue of national development
    due to the important economic, social, and territorial stakes of this sector (Knox
    et al., 2012). In Morocco, agriculture is the first contributor to the gross domestic
    product (GDP) with a variation of 11 % to 18 %, which is mainly influenced by
    climatic conditions. Moreover, Moroccan agriculture employs nearly half of the
    active population and provides 23 % of the nation''s exports1. In 2022–2023, water
    scarcity in Morocco is considered a major concern as water reserves have been
    reduced by 59 %, which exposes them to spatial and temporal irregularity issues.
    Fig. 1 (a) shows the rainfall deficit percentage and Fig. 1 (b) shows the drought
    index of January 2023 in Moroccan regions2. Given the enormous evolution of irrigated
    agricultural areas that consume huge amounts of water, the unpredictability of
    rainfall may lead to increasing and deepening the problem of water availability
    and the failure to meet the irrigation needs of crops, resulting in rising drought
    areas and a decline in agricultural productivity. One of the factors contributing
    to this is the use of permanent alimentation solenoids to activate irrigation
    systems and low performance irrigation approaches (Avşar et al., 2018, Le et al.,
    2020). These solenoids require a continuous power supply, leading to increased
    energy demands. The reliance on such solenoids is prevalent in various agricultural
    processes, including irrigation systems, crop harvesting machinery, and automated
    greenhouse controls. The constant power requirements of these solenoids contribute
    significantly to the overall energy consumption in the agricultural sector, further
    straining the already limited resources. Addressing this issue and exploring alternative
    energy-efficient solutions could mitigate the environmental impact and reduce
    the sector''s overall energy consumption. Download : Download high-res image (466KB)

    (%), (b) The drought index of January 2023 of Morocco. For the agricultural areas
    of eastern Morocco, irrigation water and energy losses are generally caused by
    two factors: the first factor is the manual control of the pump and valves in
    the pressurised irrigation system. According to Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020,
    Xie et al., 2022, the inefficiency of these irrigation systems extends beyond
    Morocco and has been observed in other regions as well. The studies highlight
    that these traditional irrigation systems, which rely on manual pump activation,
    contribute to significant losses in irrigation water and energy. These findings
    suggest that the low efficiency of such systems is not limited to a specific geographical
    area but is a widespread issue that affects multiple agricultural regions (Kumar
    et al., 2023). In those cases, farmers use their prior knowledge of crop response,
    or by observing leaf stress, to determine the duration of irrigation. This technique
    cannot be relied upon since it does not reflect the actual water needs of the
    plants, which are related to the growth stage and weather conditions (Jaafar et
    al., 2021). On the other hand, the second factor is the losses due to the process
    in which irrigation water is released into the atmosphere as vapor, caused mainly
    by the high temperature and solar irradiance rates. This factor can be solved
    by using drip irrigation methods, but it is also necessary to adopt advanced control
    techniques. The development and design of smart precision irrigation systems and
    mechanisms with the use of IoT technologies for the visualization and monitoring
    of different parameters of agriculture and irrigation is the key solution to managing
    irrigation water resources efficiently and sustainably by delivering the exact
    amount of water required by the crop (Capraro Fuentes et al., 2018). In addition,
    optimizing the energy supplied to operate the various actuators (Qaisar et al.,
    2021, Mellit et al., 2021). Irrigation systems are classified into two categories
    according to their control, open-loop and closed-loop control systems. Open-loop
    control, also called no-feedback control, is a type of controller that generates
    decisions based on the current state, i.e., it has no feedback to determine if
    the assessed input has achieved the desired objective, in our case satisfying
    the crop''s water needs with precision while considering climatic-soil conditions
    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). Therefore, an open-loop irrigation system cannot
    be reliably used to deal with the challenges of precision irrigation. Programmable
    irrigation controller, also called irrigation timers are among the systems based
    on this control technique. The scheduling of the period and duration of the irrigation
    remains constant without knowing the real needs of irrigation in the crop. Closed-loop
    control systems are the most efficient and robust in terms of decision support
    and allow for precision irrigation (Bwambale et al., 2022). The action depends
    on the output provided by the system; the input varies according to the output,
    which produces a more accurate decision. The feedback loop also allows for automatic
    adjustments to be made in real time, which improve the accuracy, stability and
    performance of irrigation decisions. Sensor units are used to provide this feedback
    to the processing unit. According to agriculture experts and scientific research,
    three approaches are distinguished (Abioye et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). The
    first approach is based on the measurement of soil moisture, which indicates the
    amounts of water consumed and absorbed by the crop during a period, and then decides
    on the scheduling of future irrigation times by setting a percentage of soil moisture,
    so the irrigation system works until it reaches the set value of moisture (Soulis
    et al., 2015). An intelligent urban irrigation system is discussed in (Mason et
    al., 2019) aiming at decreasing water use without reducing crop yield. The system
    includes a wireless soil moisture sensor network and controllable valves and tested
    in nine climatic regions of the contiguous United States. Tomatoes are chosen
    due to their sensitivity to water stress. The second approach is to control irrigation
    according to the evolution of the meteorological conditions (Kool et al., 2014).
    The measurement of environmental variables in real time such as: air temperature
    and humidity, solar irradiance and wind speed allows estimating the reference
    evapotranspiration level (ET0) (Chiew et al., 1995), which indicates the water
    losses suffered by the plant and the soil (J. Doorenbos et al., 1976). Weather
    stations or IoT-based sensor networks are used to provide such information. In
    (González-Briones et al., 2018), a monitoring system able to collect various data
    on its environment, by sensing temperature, solar irradiance, pH, humidity, and
    wind speed is presented. The objective of this research is to build virtual organizations
    of agents based on several master and slave nodes that are connected to ensure
    data exchange from sensors while monitoring the crops. The development of a platform
    (IoT) with a fibrous capillary irrigation system based on the climatic demand
    estimated by the weather condition was reported by (Abd Rahman et al., 2019).
    The experiment has been conducted using a Choy sum plant as a test crop in a greenhouse.
    Demand tracking, management of the irrigation system, and the use of weather information
    allowed for near real-time estimation of the crop''s water requirements, which
    also allowed the monitoring of the progress of water consumption by the plants.
    The last approach is the survey of the plant evolution parameters, such crop water
    stress index (CWSI), which determine the water needs of the plant, through the
    measurement of canopy temperature. Most irrigation systems are based on simple
    control techniques and algorithms (Davis, and Dukes, 2010; Singh et al., 2023),
    containing a single input or a threshold value to be set by the operator to decide
    on starting or ending the irrigation. The reliability and efficiency of those
    controls’ techniques are limited and unable to reliably schedule irrigation since
    precision irrigation involves the evaluation and processing of multiple inputs.
    Fuzzy logic (FL) is one of the intelligent control techniques that allow to manipulation
    of multiple input variables while taking account of the output action. So, it
    is more suitable for non-linear systems due to its flexibility in data processing
    and it is very effective for decision-making problems that require precision (Zadeh,
    1999). The operation of fuzzy logic has been thoroughly tested in a diverse and
    challenging field (Yahyaoui et al., 2017). It is structured with three main modules,
    a fuzzification module, an inference engine, and a defuzzification module. Mamdani
    and Sugeno are the two popular approaches in FL (Omomule et al., 2020, Shafaei
    et al., 2017), each with its own distinct characteristics. The key difference
    lies in how they handle the fuzzy rule’s consequences. In Mamdani-FL, the output
    membership function is a fuzzy set representing the degree of membership of the
    output variable. This allows for linguistic descriptions, where the output can
    be interpreted in terms of linguistic terms (Pourjavad et al., 2019). On the other
    hand, Sugeno-FL employs a more mathematical approach, where the output is represented
    as a crisp value or a mathematical function of the input variables. This enables
    precise numerical calculations and facilitates mathematical modelling. The advantage
    of the Mamdani-FL lies in its ability to incorporate linguistic rules and provide
    interpretable outputs. By using linguistic terms, the system''s behaviour becomes
    more understandable and intuitive to humans, making it suitable for applications
    where transparency and explainability are crucial. It allows experts to easily
    define rules using their domain knowledge and linguistic terms, making it a powerful
    tool in decision-making processes (Hamam et al., 2008). Additionally, Mamdani-FL
    supports a wide range of inference methods and can handle complex and nonlinear
    systems effectively. While Sugeno-FL has its own advantages, such as its computational
    efficiency and ability to handle mathematical modelling, the interpretability
    and linguistic-based nature of Mamdani-FL make it a preferred choice in agriculture
    applications (Urbieta Parrazales et al., 2021). A FL-based irrigation controller
    is designed and integrated into a field in India, to perform multi-criteria decision-making,
    this allows to select of the most efficient and adequate irrigation sub-system
    (Yilmaz and Harmancioglu et al., 2010). Another application of FL has been reported
    in (Krishnan et al., 2020). The objective is to automatically control the irrigation
    through the measurement of soil moisture to decide the necessary flow for irrigation.
    Six fuzzy rules have been implemented. DC motor is activated in cases where the
    soil moisture value is between medium and very low values, otherwise the contrary.
    The modelling and simulation of a fuzzy irrigation system have been presented
    in (Mushtaq et al., 2016). The approach is based on the calculation of ET by a
    fuzzy inference system. The input variables are temperature, humidity, wind, and
    solar radiation. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy system
    in accurately determining and compensating the water loss due to ET. Another work
    (Kurniawan et al., 2017) presented the combination of a prediction algorithm and
    fuzzy control. The combination of fertilization and irrigation precisely to reduces
    the amount of irrigation water and the waste of chemical fertilizers. This results
    in further saving and reducing production costs and improving agricultural efficiency.
    In our previous work (Benzaouia et al., 2021) we developed an intelligent irrigation
    system based on FL controller for the automatic watering of agricultural areas
    (Oriental Morocco). The simulation results proved that the irrigation system allows
    to keep the soil moisture measurements higher than the value specified by the
    user and eliminates the under-irrigation risk. In the presented research works,
    the utilization of FL is primarily focused on simple applications. These applications
    involve employing fuzzy sets and membership functions to handle vague or uncertain
    data and make decisions based on fuzzy reasoning. Moreover, a noteworthy aspect
    of these works is the use of minimal control rules, implying that the number of
    rules employed in the fuzzy logic systems is kept to a minimum. In the realm of
    modern field management, it is crucial not only to adopt advanced control systems
    but also to incorporate communication IoT protocols to enable seamless data transmission
    and enhanced control. The integration of IoT offers numerous benefits, including
    real-time data acquisition, remote monitoring, and improved decision-making capabilities.
    Various communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and others,
    can be utilized to establish reliable connections in field management applications.
    Table 1 provides a summary of these technologies and their application for irrigation
    monitoring, outlining their respective ranges and power consumption. The common
    characteristic among these technologies is their low data transmission range.
    However, in the case of large agricultural areas, it becomes necessary to employ
    technologies that can cover vast distances with improved sending capabilities
    which makes them very limited. LoRa technology stands out as one of the promising
    solutions that has proven its effectiveness in various industrial applications
    (Kaur et al., 2022), additionally, in fields such as telemedicine (Ayat et al.,
    2023). It offers several advantages for IoT applications, its long-range capability
    allows for communication over large distances, while its low power consumption
    ensures minimizing energy consumption. The cost-effectiveness of LoRa, coupled
    with its scalability and secure communication features, also makes it suitable
    for large-scale deployments. The flexibility of LoRa enables its use in diverse
    environments, and its open standard promotes interoperability. Table 1. IoT technologies

    smart precision irrigation system with a combined weather-soil approach is proposed
    and designed, to efficiently schedule the irrigation of apple trees in fields
    located in the eastern region of Morocco. Soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar irradiance, and rainfall are the inputs of the FL controller. They are sensed
    through different sensors, and subsequently transmitted to apply the well-designed
    fuzzy rules for irrigation control, while the output is the duration and timing
    of irrigation which depends on the crop requirements in the field. This allows
    for optimizing the soil water content, enhancing plant health and product quality.
    The system also includes a long-range LoRa communication module for wireless transmission
    and a developed IoT platform for visualization and monitoring to enhance the mentioned
    drawbacks of discussed IoT techniques in irrigation. The techno-economic study
    between the proposed system in the literature and the one available on the commercial
    market, proved the reliability of the proposed SPIS to manage the irrigation process
    in a precise and intelligent manner with low-cost installation. This is the first
    research study reported on the design of an intelligent precision irrigation system
    adapted to the eastern climate of Morocco. The main contributions of the paper
    can be summarized as follows: • The design of an automated intelligent irrigation
    controller based on FL inference that evolves in real-time the weather-soil monitoring
    approach to decide the optimal irrigation time and impulse solenoid-valve opening.
    The system is highly efficient and tested in an agricultural field under real
    scenarios. • The development of a real-time visualization and monitoring IoT platform
    for irrigation and field data such as system status, soil moisture, air humidity,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, irrigation time, energy, water consumption,
    etc. • Provide a reliable and efficient irrigation system at a low cost. The article
    is organized as follows, Section 2 presents the design and control of the proposed
    irrigation system. Section 3 describes the operating steps of the system. Section
    4 discusses the software and hardware implementation. The experimental performance
    evaluation and the techno-economic study are given in Section 5. Conclusion and
    future improvement are reported in the last Section 6. 2. Design and control of
    the proposed irrigation system The structure of the proposed smart precision irrigation
    system based on an effective strategy that combines both weather and soil approaches
    is given in Fig. 2. It consists of five essential sub-systems: (1) the sensors
    unit, (2) the controller unit, (3) the irrigation unit, (4) the IoT communication
    unit, and finally (5) the power unit. A detailed description of the methodology
    of the development of these subsystems is given in the following sections. Download

    The structure of the smart precision irrigation system. 2.1. Location and specification
    of the study field An agricultural field situated around the eastern region of
    Morocco has been selected to carry out the experimentation of the developed irrigation
    system (See Fig. 3). The location and global positioning are a latitude of 34.811835
    and a longitude of −1.967141 (34°48′42.6″N 1°58′01.7″W). Download : Download high-res
    image (271KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Geographical view of
    the field of experimentation. The field is divided into three areas (A), (B) and
    (C). The focus is only on the A and B zones, the irrigation system in the first
    zone (A) is controlled by the proposed smart precision irrigation system and the
    second zone (B) temporised controller is used. Note that the area A and B are
    about 1300 m2 for each and contain about 140 apple trees, with an irrigated surface
    approximately 100 m2. The experiment region exhibits a unique semi-arid climate
    influenced by its geographical location and topography. Situated in the eastern
    part of the country, this region experiences distinct climatic conditions that
    have significant implications for agriculture and socio-economic activities. The
    climate can be classified as Mediterranean with semi-arid characteristics. It
    is characterized by hot and dry summers with limited rainfall and mild, wet winters.
    The region is known for its high temperatures during the summer months, often
    exceeding 40 °C (104°F). Additionally, the area experiences high ET rates due
    to the combination of high temperatures and limited rainfall, resulting in the
    loss of water from both the soil and vegetation. Precipitation is moderate, with
    most rainfall occurring between October and April. However, there is considerable
    variability in precipitation patterns, leading to occasional drought conditions.
    The unique semi-arid climate of the region plays a crucial role in shaping agricultural
    practices, water resource management, and overall livelihoods in the area. 2.2.
    Sensors unit The sensors unit consists of specific field sensors for soil moisture
    measurement, and climatic sensors for measuring ambient temperature, relative
    air humidity, solar irradiance, and rainfall. All the used sensors are calibrated
    to prevent any drift that could be generated during their operation. 2.2.1. Soil
    moisture sensing Soil moisture information is extremely important for the control
    and scheduling of irrigation periods. It allows to identify the characteristics
    of diffusion or storage of water in a defined soil, which is usually influenced
    by its composition and texture (sandy, clayey and silty soil). There are two main
    techniques for determining soil moisture, the direct method and the indirect method.
    The direct method, known as gravimetric, consists of drying a soil sample and
    then determining the weight of the water contained in the sample. This method
    is not adapted to real-time applications and remains expensive. Indirect methods
    consist in measuring the electrical conductivity or the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil and then converted to volumetric soil water content. For this application,
    a UM-MS-10 sensor is selected. This sensor is dedicated to precision irrigation
    applications while offering very accurate measurements, and a high sensitivity
    to amounts of water applied to the soil with a low error range (about ± 2 % and
    ± 4 % for a water content between 0 and 53 % and 53–100 % respectively), in addition
    to the possibility of calibration for specific soils. Determining the number of
    soil moisture sensors is based on several factors, including the size and nature
    of the area being monitored, the type of crops, the depth of the root zone, the
    soil properties, and the way that the area is exposed to weather variations. In
    our research focused on apple trees, a case study to examine soil moisture levels
    in zone A has been conducted firstly. Multiple sensors have been strategically
    placed at different locations within the zone to capture comprehensive data. The
    analysis revealed consistently low measurement errors, attributable to the soil''s
    homogeneity and absence of geographical irregularities. Consequently, a single
    sensor has been selected and positioned at a depth of 0.3 m. This depth is justified
    based on the relevant findings reported in our previous research (Benzaouia et
    al., 2021). To ensure the generalizability of our results across the entire field,
    further investigations are planned. These subsequent examinations will involve
    subdividing the field into smaller zones, allowing for the optimization of sensor
    placement, and determining the minimum number of sensors required for accurate
    soil moisture assessments. This approach enhances the scientific rigor of the
    study and provides valuable insights into the spatial variability of soil moisture.
    2.2.2. Ambient temperature sensing As temperatures increase toward limit values,
    the plants'' ET rates increase and the water balance of the soil decreases, therefore
    the scheduling of irrigation according to temperature variations is also crucial.
    The DHT-11 sensor is a reliable sensor for measuring ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, requiring no external calibration, and able to measure temperatures
    from −40 to + 125 °C with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and relative humidity ranges
    from 0 to 100 % with an accuracy of ± 2 %. 2.2.3. Solar irradiance sensing Solar
    irradiance is a source of energy that comes from a thermal process, which also
    contributes to the evaporation process. So, it is important to schedule irrigation
    during a period of minimal solar irradiance. Several devices are available to
    measure and quantify the intensity of solar irradiance, including pyrometer, LDR,
    photoristor and others. However, most of them are expensive and usually require
    an adapter to exploit the collected data. For economic and technical reasons,
    a BH1750 sensor has been selected to estimate solar irradiance intensity. It allows
    a measurement range from 1 lx to 100.000 lx, with an error of ± 3 % for low and
    high ranges, additionally to its robustness against IR radiation (Very small effect
    of IR radiation). 2.2.4. Rainfall sensing To save the water and energy consumption
    of the proposed irrigation system in the agricultural field in case of precipitation,
    a rain sensor or rain switch is integrated, allowing the detection of rainfall.
    Hence, if the feedback received from the sensor indicates the availability of
    high rates of rainfall, the system is turned off and the irrigation periods are
    rescheduled by referring to fuzzy logic rules. 2.3. Controller unit The controller
    is held responsible for intelligent data processing for irrigation scheduling,
    and the generation of the output control signal, namely the duration, time, and
    period of irrigation unit opening and activation which is decided by FL programmed
    and implemented in ATmega2560 microcontroller. In addition, this unit is responsible
    for receiving and transmitting time-series data from the sensor’s unit to the
    developed visualization and monitoring platform. 2.3.1. Mathematical modeling
    The proposed FL controller is composed of three key components, namely the fuzzification
    module, the inference engine, and the defuzzification module, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. The system operates by developing a universe of discourse ( ) that entails
    a membership function and defining an interval of ( ) represented by . In this
    context, is characterized as a membership function that comprises a set of ordered
    pairs of elements and the probability that e belongs to ( ), as described by Pazouki
    et al., 2021. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Flow-chart of FL inference-based irrigation controller. The system
    requires three input parameters, namely soil moisture (SM), temperature (T), and
    solar irradiance (SR). Each of these parameters comprises three membership functions
    that are identified by a fuzzy subset of ( ). Specifically, variable represents
    soil moisture, variable represents temperature, and variable represents solar
    irradiance. The degree to which a given value of belongs to variables , , and
    is expressed by the membership functions , and . Equations (2), (3) respectively
    provide the fuzzy intersection and union set for the three variables. The purpose
    of the fuzzification step is to transform a digital input obtained from a sensor
    into a linguistic variable by means of membership functions. A membership function
    can be defined as a function that specifies the degree of membership of a numerical
    input to a linguistic variable. In this context, the membership function employed
    regulates a variety of parameters, including fluctuations in soil moisture, temperature,
    and solar irradiance. The proposed irrigation system commonly employs triangular
    and trapezoidal membership functions to make appropriate decisions. Equations
    (4), (5) depict the triangular and trapezoidal shapes, respectively, for a three-value
    fuzzification system. Fig. 5 illustrates the membership functions for both the
    inputs and outputs of the FL controller. (2) (3) (4) (5) Download : Download high-res

    functions. The fuzzy inference process involves the interpretation of input values
    gathered from sensors, which are then utilized to determine output values based
    on sets of rules. To accomplish this, a set of if-then rules has been formulated
    to operate with the membership functions of each input. The literature describes
    two types of fuzzy inference systems that can be implemented: Mamdani type and
    Sugano type. The Mamdani type has been selected for the proposed irrigation system
    because it is well-suited for expert system applications. In each given scenario,
    the output of the controller is represented by the irrigation duration, time and
    periods which varies in accordance with the fuzzy rules grouped in Table 2, Table
    3, and Table 4. Table 2. Rules of the output (duration of irrigation in min) for
    dry soil. Temperature (°C) Solar irradiance (%) Dark Medium Light Cold Very Long

    serves as the final step. After fuzzification, the rules are applied to generate
    a fuzzy output which is subsequently transformed into a scalar quantity. The selection
    of the centroid defuzzification method has been based on its precision in producing
    reliable outputs. Equation (6) expresses the defuzzified output ( ). (6) 2.3.2.
    Simulation and validation of proposed system A preliminary simulation of the irrigation
    system has been carried out using the FL toolbox available in the Matlab/Simulink
    environment in order to build the fuzzy rules for each irrigation scenario and
    verify the system responses. The fuzzy rules are based on Mamdani''s “if-then”
    conditions. The 3D graphical representation of the temperature and soil moisture
    variables as a function of the irrigation time is given in Fig. 6. It is clear
    that the system allows the irrigation process with variable duration according
    to the parameters of the plants, the soil, and the weather conditions. Download

    3D Fuzzy logic graph of rules. 2.4. Irrigation unit The irrigation unit is composed
    of an impulse solenoid and diaphragm valve, distribution pipes, and emitters.
    The solenoid is controlled through the output signal provided by the controller
    unit. The opening time and duration can be adjusted according to the decision
    of the FL controller and vary depending on the conditions affecting the irrigation.
    The efficiency of the system is considered. For this purpose, a flow meter is
    located next to the valve to measure the water consumption in the distribution
    line. Moreover, the overall energy consumed during the operation under the adopted
    irrigation strategy is calculated from the installed voltage and current sensors.
    The obtained values are used to calculate the energy consumed per time unit. 2.5.
    LoRa based IoT communication unit In order to closely monitor the status of the
    irrigation system and to visualize the evolution of the parameters related to
    precision irrigation to fulfil the customer''s display requirements, ten parameters
    are displayed in a developed platform (See Fig. 7). This platform allows to follow
    in real-time the evolution of each parameter as well as the implementation of
    alerts (e-mail, telegram, and SMS) in case of failure (problems at the level of
    the sensors, condition on the irrigation parameters), moreover the transversal
    communication between the hardware and software part. The main page that is displayed
    contains an indication of the status of the system (on/off), the air temperature,
    the soil moisture, the soil temperature, the electrical conductivity, and the
    salinity. The irrigation duration provided by the FL controller, the evolution
    of the solar irradiance (the parameter is displayed as a percentage just to simplify
    the display) during each day is also displayed, and finally, the water flow rate
    distributed to the plant for each irrigation decision. An example of visualization

    the multiple advantages that it presents, namely the robust development language
    Python, the ability to run with any client-side infrastructure, return data in
    any format namely HTML, RSS, JSON, XML, and provides robust security features
    that avoid common security errors (Srivastava et al., 2021). MySQL database is
    chosen as a manager owing to its many advantages in terms of rapidity, and ability
    to perform various operations using interfaces written in C, C++, Python, Java
    and PHP (Rao et al., 2014). The configuration of the manager is done at the Django

    communication between the HTTP client and the platform is done through an API,
    which allows to interface and translate the requests received by the HTTP client
    to the server and return a response to the clients (when the Rest-API has what
    it needs, it sends back a response to the clients, typically be in JSON or XML
    format) (Ong et al., 2015). ATmega2560 programming is based on the Processing
    IDE and programmed with Arduino IDE software. The code is called a sketch and
    the assembly of several for functionalities are called libraries, which simplifies
    the user''s programming tasks by hiding the code in the libraries as a “black
    box”. The ATmega2560 can be programmed within the limits of 256 Kb of Flash memory
    with a clock rate of 16 MHz, moreover in this application of the smart precision
    irrigation system, it is autonomously working without being connected to an interface
    (computer) for control exchange. 2.6. Power unit The power consumption of the
    controller and sensor units, which represent a node in the proposed SPIS, is presented
    in Table 5. Specifically, the sensor unit consumes approximately 1.3 mA. Current
    investigations are being conducted to test the effectiveness of using small batteries
    to power this node. Based on initial estimations, two batteries of 6600 mAh associated
    in parallel could potentially provide a supply duration of around 1 year. This
    allows for reliable data collection with long-range capabilities and the ability
    to record hourly data. Table 5. Current consumption of the proposed system. Sensor

    the primary goal is to gather precise and comprehensive data. To achieve this,
    an integrated system that relies on a PV panel for power supply coupled with batteries.
    3. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system The operating steps of the
    proposed system are shown in Fig. 10. In the first step, the precipitation status
    is checked, if the sensor indicates that availability, the system is turned off,
    otherwise the system proceeds to the next step of sensing the values received
    by the sensor unit hourly (ambient temperature, solar irradiation and soil moisture).
    The time and duration of irrigation is given after applying the appropriately
    designed fuzzy rules by reasoning according to the information from these sensors.

    Fig. 10. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system. In this study, the
    information generated by the soil moisture sensor indicates the requirement for
    irrigation. According to the expert of agriculture, the optimal threshold of soil
    moisture for apple tree’s is 30 %. Therefore, the measurement of this variable
    is taken into account in this study. For each situation and variation of the input
    variables of the FL controller, the result is determined by the rules summarized
    in tables 2,3 and 4. Some real scenarios examples are given as follow: • If the
    soil is wet, i.e. exceeds 30 %, and regardless of the values of solar irradiance
    and ambient temperature, the irrigation decision is given by a duration equal
    to zero. • If the soil moisture equals 30 %, and regardless the value of all input
    variables, the system remains turned off, with a null irrigation duration decision.
    • If the soil contains an average soil moisture value, with an average temperature
    and solar irradiance, then the irrigation duration is set to very short duration.
    • If the soil is dry with a high temperature and a minimum solar irradiance, the
    duration is set to zero, since the high temperatures generate an increase in evaporation
    and water loses. In the area where the experiment is conducted, the process of
    water aspiration through the soil has been estimated at 60 min. This duration
    is based on experimental measurements for a well-known soil constitution. The
    system is programmed to restart the same sequences, which justifies the frequency
    of sending data to the platform. 4. Software and hardware implementation The FL
    controller has been implemented in real-time through a code in C language adapted
    with ATmega2560 microcontroller, the structure of the code is given as follows:
    firstly, a declaration of the libraries to be used, namely that of the FL, the
    sensors used, the actuators (relay) that is used to control the impulse solenoid
    and the display. After acquiring the data, the processing by fuzzy controllers
    begins. The fuzzy logic code is devised in three parts, first is the design of
    the membership functions by using equations (4), (5) on each of the three inputs
    (soil moisture, ambient temperature, and solar irradiance) and defining the variation
    ranges. Secondly the design of the fuzzy rules, in our case 27 rules are implemented.
    The last part is the defuzzification, which consists in assigning the results
    to the output in the form of linguistic variable to be exploited afterwards. The
    output being the duration and the time of irrigation, this value is converted
    into control signal form to activate the relay that enables to activate the electro
    valve and pump to start the irrigation process. The controller is programmed to
    repeat the same sequences every hour, the program performs and schedule automatically
    the duration and times of irrigation periods without any human intervention. The
    communication between the control unit (ATmega2560), the sensors unit, the irrigation
    unit and the IoT platform is realized via the ESP32 development board by sending
    instructions. The SPIS prototype is shown in Fig. 11, and the irrigation unit
    is shown in Fig. 12. The control unit, which provides decisions, and the sensor
    unit are assembled in a case with an IP67 degree of protection. After receiving
    the decision from the FL controller, an electric control signal is sent back to
    the solenoid. It should be noted that the solenoid is impulse driven, i.e., for
    switching on and off states, it is sufficient to send only one impulse for micro-seconds.
    The operation of the solenoid according to the time decided by the proposed fuzzy
    controller, operates on the internal membrane of the valve. The component list
    used in its conception is summarized in Table 6. Download : Download high-res

    in the agricultural area (A), are presented in Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig.
    17. The experimentation has been conducted over ten days of two different seasons,
    the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2023, this allowed to obtain an overview
    of the behaviour of the system as well as to perform a test under different meteorological
    variations in order to approve the efficiency of the adopted soil-weather approach.

    data for the summer period from 05/09/2022 to 14/09/2022 are presented in Fig.
    14 (a) The data are sensed hourly and consist of temperature (T) and solar irradiance
    (G) measurements. The highest and lowest temperatures are 37.72 °C and 15.32 °C
    respectively. The solar irradiance values vary from 0 to 1000 W/m2, indicating
    the intensity of solar radiation received during each hour. It can be observed
    that lower solar irradiance values occur during the night-time hours, indicating
    the absence of sunlight. As the day progresses, the solar irradiance values increase,
    reaching their peak at 1000 W/m2. The temperature fluctuations correlate with
    the solar irradiance values, as higher solar irradiance leads to higher temperatures.
    The collected data from the sensor unit of the SPIS have been cross validated
    with the measurements obtained from a trusted meteorological station. These validations
    have confirmed the accuracy of the collected data, with minimal margin of error.
    During the 10-day performance evaluation, it can be observed that the FL controller
    effectively avoids operating the system during periods of high temperatures and
    intense solar radiation, as depicted in Fig. 14 (b) and Fig. 14 (c) and decides
    on short durations when input variables are medium. This strategy significantly
    contributes to the reduction of ET losses throughout the day. Additionally, by
    referring to the well-designed fuzzy rules, the FL controller selects the appropriate
    timing and duration for system operation. Consequently, the actual soil moisture
    closely tracks the desired value of 30 % with smooth oscillations (See Fig. 14
    (d)), in contrast to traditional single input- single output (SISO) feedback systems
    that often result in low irrigation performance. This performance evaluation over
    the 10-day period demonstrates the effectiveness and improved performance of the
    FL in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels while minimizing water loss. An
    extensive performance analysis has been conducted on two specific days of summer
    period (13 and 14 September), to understand the overall operation of the SPIS
    (See Fig. 15). September 13th (13/09/2022) represents the operational conditions
    of the system that persist throughout the 10-day experimental period in September
    (summer). By observing the system''s performance on this day, valuable insights
    can be gained regarding its sustained operation throughout the experiment. In
    addition, September 14th (14/09/2022) has been chosen due to the presence of precipitation.
    This provides an opportunity to assess the system''s performance under the same
    conditions (high weather parameters variation), but with the added factor of precipitation.
    Analysing its behaviour on a day with precipitation allows for an evaluation of
    the system''s ability to cope with such weather conditions. Throughout the selected
    two-days observation period, it is evident that the FL-based irrigation system
    allowed for considerable irrigation durations during periods of minimal variation
    in meteorological conditions as seen in point A (See Fig. 15). However, it effectively
    avoided irrigation during high-temperature and solar radiation conditions, as
    observed in point B. Consequently, the system reprograms the irrigation decision
    until conditions reached minimal or intermediate values. These decisions have
    been automatically made by the system based on fuzzy rules summarized in Table
    2, Table 3 of section 2.3. Given the high hourly ET rate during the observed period
    in point B, it was apparent that the amount of water applied during irrigation
    would be lost to the air without benefiting the crops. This finding aligns with
    expert recommendations on irrigation practices. In the case of point C, where
    soil moisture is about 24 % and the solar irradiance variable is at a minimum
    value (G = 17 w/m2) while the temperature in a medium value (T = 29 °C), the irrigation
    duration is decided as medium. This approach effectively minimized losses in terms
    of ET. A similar decision was observed in point F, where G = 330 w/m2 and T =
    24 °C. The system consistently made the decision to withhold irrigation when soil
    moisture reached the pre-defined value set by the farmer. This is being observed
    in multiple points during the experimental days, particularly at points D. Additionally,
    the system maintained the same decision (null duration of irrigation) in the presence
    of precipitation, as observed in points E. The average applied amount of water
    for the first day was 529,6L, over the irrigated area which is approximately 100
    m2. It follows that the proposed FL-irrigation control system provides appropriate
    duration to the irrigation unit of the field to apply an average of 5.29L/day/m2,
    that is, 5.29 mm/day. This is similar to the daily estimated ET value using the
    Penman-Monteith FAO model, which is about 5.31 mm/day (according to data collected
    from the sensor unit). Similarly for the second day, the system permit applying
    an average of 471,4L/day/m2, while the ET value is about 4,73 mm/day. The proposed
    irrigation-based soil-weather approaches have been verified under summer period,
    the FL controller avoids applying water during periods when there are significant
    variations in weather conditions (See Fig. 16), this avoids the loss of water
    through evaporation processes, while keeping the plants in a better condition,
    i.e., no stress. In addition, as noted, the duration of irrigation varies depending
    on the conditions measured by the sensors, namely, soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar radiation, air humidity and rainfall. 5.2. Inter period Likewise, the obtained
    results during the winter period over 10 days (From 11/01/2023 to 20/01/2023)
    show that the irrigation system is operating in efficient mode and compensates
    the quantities of water required by the plants while considering the values of
    solar irradiance and temperature which are practically small and average during
    this period. A daily average of 1.98 mm/day, has been applied to the soil, which
    permits maintaining a soil moisture close to the predefined value of soil moisture
    30 % defined by the user (See Fig. 17). During this period, the system considers
    the presence of rainfall rates, to minimize the over-irrigation that influence
    the plants. The evolution of soil moisture is shown in Fig. 17 (d). It is remarkable
    that this variable reaches maximums of about 48 % since the precipitation rate
    are important. The duration and period of irrigation are always optimized during
    the variations of solar irradiance and temperature (See Fig. 17 (b) and Fig. 17
    (c)). The system avoids applying water to the plants during the night period,
    this is justified by the minimal ET rate during this period, and low irradiance
    and temperatures values therefore the irrigation durations are at mid-days. In
    summary, the aforementioned results indicate that the proposed irrigation system
    based on the soil-weather approach and fuzzy concept effectively compensates water
    losses in semi-arid regions where the experiment has been conducted, ensuring
    optimal hydration for well-watered and actively growing crops. The SPIS also has
    the capability to adjust water requirements according to weather conditions that
    influence the irrigation process, thereby facilitating improved irrigation management.
    Achieving a forecast of irrigation duration for several days would entail the
    creation of suitable artificial intelligence algorithms, such as artificial neural
    networks (ANN), long term short memory (LSTM), and support vector machines (SVM)
    which can be trained using extensive data collected through the SPIS. At present,
    our team is actively engaged in the development of these algorithms, as well as
    expanding the system to cover larger agricultural areas. 5.3. Water and energy
    consumption analysis The energy and water consumption at the level of the “irrigation
    unit” in the ‘A’ and ‘B’ areas of the experiment field have been carried out.
    It should be noted that the ''A'' area is furnished with drip irrigation pipes,
    along with the proposed SPIS and an impulse solenoid valve, and ‘B’ area is equipped
    only with a manual drip irrigation based commercial timer to preset the applied
    water flow and period which are performed according to the knowledge and visualisation
    of the water-stress on the leaves by the farmer. It is noted also that the ‘B’
    area contains a classical solenoid, which require a significant current to maintain
    the On state compared to the adopted impulse solenoid. During the summer period,
    the farmer refers to a commercial timer to regulate a fixed water flow rate of
    approximately 11 mm/day for ‘B’ area. This estimation was based solely on the
    observation of climatic conditions, neglecting the influence of irrigation quantities
    on plant growth and soil moisture dynamics. Conversely, the proposed irrigation
    system demonstrated its efficacy in area ‘A’ through the evaluation of climatic
    and soil variables. It effectively delivered a precise water supply while maintaining
    soil moisture levels near the optimal range for apple trees. By incorporating
    these variables, the proposed irrigation system proficiently optimized the water
    supply for apple trees, resulting in a notable water-saving of nearly 61 % (±2%)
    over a 10-day period. The farmer consciously decided to apply an average of 110
    mm of water, whereas the SPIS determined a more optimal irrigation amount of 51.6
    mm, equivalent to an approximate daily application rate of 5.16 mm/day. This demonstration
    underscores the system''s efficiency and significance in precise irrigation management,
    ensuring the health and optimal growth of plants. Similarly, the power consumption
    in area ‘B’ stands at approximately 620Wh. Nevertheless, by optimizing water usage
    levels using the proposed SPIS-based FL decision and impulse solenoids, a remarkable
    reduction of approximately 46 % in overall power consumption has been achieved.
    6. Conclusion In this paper, a feedback FL control and combined soil-weather approach
    were presented, to foster water conservation and better irrigation scheduling
    and management in the eastern agriculture fields of Morocco. The fuzzy controller,
    developed based on Mamdani fuzzification using trapezoidal and triangular membership
    functions, effectively determined the duration of irrigation for crops. This utilization
    of FL control played a crucial role in maintaining soil moisture levels above
    pre-defined thresholds, exhibiting slight oscillations to prevent excessive run-off,
    thus conserving water and energy resources. To facilitate real-time performance
    monitoring and the creation of a comprehensive database, LoRa protocol has been
    utilised to communicate with a developed IoT platform. This enabled data to be
    collected on key environmental and climatic variables, as well as precise information
    on irrigation duration and soil proprieties. Presently, this is significantly
    contributing to data analysis and enhancing system performance. Implementing the
    system is straightforward, and its economic viability. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Evaluating status, variability and identifying the factors influencing
    groundwater quality is essential to manage and conserve groundwater resources.
    The present study aims to examine groundwater quality for 15 water quality parameters
    from 84 stations in arid and semi-arid districts of Rajasthan, India, using annual
    data from 2000 to 2018. Statistical methods such as descriptive test statistics,
    Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Sen's slope estimation, and Principal component analysis
    (PCA) were used to analyze the hydrochemical parameters. While World Health Organisation
    (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) guidelines were used to assess the
    suitability of groundwater for domestic purposes, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR),
    electrical conductivity (EC), and United States Salinity (USSL) diagrams were
    used for irrigation suitability. Further Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was
    used to explore the effect of climatic (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic
    (net irrigated area (NIA), fertilizer usage, industrialization, and population)
    variables on groundwater quality. The empirical results reveal that in groundwater
    of the study area sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) were the dominating cations,
    while chloride (Cl−) and bicarbonate (HCO3−) were the dominating anions. The groundwater
    was predominantly Na–Cl type. Further, most stations witnessed an increasing trend
    in calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and sulphate and a decreasing
    trend in potassium, fluoride and nitrate. The SAR, EC, and USSL indicate that
    the groundwater in the region is suitable for irrigation if salinity control measures
    are implemented. Chloride, fluoride and sodium concentrations exceeded the prescribed
    guideline limits in most stations, jeopardizing the suitability of water for drinking
    and posing significant health hazards. The GAM analysis revealed that anthropogenic
    variables significantly impact the groundwater quality parameters compared to
    the climatic variables. Accordingly, it is suggested that anthropogenic parameters
    must be addressed while formulating groundwater resource management policies.
    Thus, policies should focus on the stringent enactment of regulations and guidelines
    controlling the excessive use of fertilizers, implementing proper disposal of
    municipal solid and liquid waste, and managing industrial pollutants.

    1. Introduction Ensuring the sustainability of freshwater resources is one of
    the most critical challenges for sustainable development (United Nations Educational
    et al., 2019). Among the available freshwater resources, groundwater has emerged
    as the most significant resource for human survival, agriculture, and industrial
    development, across the globe (Coyte et al., 2019; Jeon et al., 2020). Despite
    this, groundwater is the most fragile resource, often mismanaged and undervalued
    (United Nations Educational et al., 2022). Mismanagement, compounded with the
    fact that groundwater is a shared resource and is susceptible to the problem of
    the ‘tragedy of commons’ (Chinnasamy et al., 2015), has led to its systematic,
    uncontrolled, and unsustainable abstraction (Chaudhary and Satheeshkumar, 2018).
    In addition to the quantity, groundwater quality has deteriorated, rendering it
    unfit for consumption and use (Adimalla, 2020). Being a prerequisite for health
    and well-being, 80 percent of all illnesses and fatalities in the developing world
    are water-related (UN, 2023). Studies have shown that intensive anthropogenic
    activities are exacerbating the contamination of groundwater resources (Ali and
    Ali, 2018; Rahman et al., 2021). Industrialization and increasing population,
    generally accompanied by a degrading environment, adds to the anthropogenic stress
    on groundwater quality (Silva et al., 2017; Wakejo et al., 2022; Rao et al., 2022a,
    Rao et al., 2022b). Reckless and improper disposal of industrial effluents enriched
    in various chemical, organic, inorganic, and biological pollutants leach or percolate
    into the groundwater, significantly impacting the hydrochemistry of groundwater
    (Esmeray and Gökcekli, 2020; Zacchaeus et al., 2020; Abascal et al., 2022). Untreated
    domestic sewage, inadequate sanitation facilities, and open defecation have also
    been reported to impact groundwater quality (Silva et al., 2017; Carrard et al.,
    2019; Rao et al., 2021; Abascal et al., 2022; Wakejo et al., 2022). Worldwide
    studies have indicated that agricultural intensification resulting from the indiscriminate
    and intensive use of fertilizers is responsible for around 70 percent of groundwater
    contamination (Lwimbo et al., 2019). Excessive groundwater abstraction for irrigation
    and irrigation return flow (IRF), a substantial source of groundwater recharge,
    particularly in agriculturally dominant regions, have also been found to significantly
    affects the ion concentration in groundwater (Foster et al., 2018; Merz and Lischeid,
    2019; Rotiroti et al., 2019; Rao et al., 2022a, Rao et al., 2022b). In addition
    to anthropogenic activities, climate change, such as changes in temperature and
    precipitation, affects water quality by altering the leaching of contaminants
    into the groundwater system (Alghamdi et al., 2022), especially in arid and semi-arid
    regions (Gupta and Sharma, 2019; Barbieri et al., 2021; Mahanta et al., 2022;
    Swain et al., 2022). Further, Mahanta et al. (2022) noted that temperature changes
    can affect the pH level of groundwater by influencing chemical and biological
    activities. In recent decades, trend analysis techniques have gained popularity
    in hydro-climatic data analysis. In the scientific literature, parametric and
    non-parametric techniques have been employed to evaluate current trends in hydro-climatic
    series (Bera et al., 2022; Fahim et al., 2022). Because of the presence of skewness,
    outliers, missing values, and the fact that hydrological data is often non-normal,
    non-parametric techniques are more prevalent. Previous research has utilized the
    non-parametric Mann-Kendall method and Sen’s Slope test to assess the water quality
    trend (Bahir et al., 2020; Jeon et al., 2020). Furthermore, multivariate statistical
    techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA),
    and discriminant analysis have been widely used to assess the spatial variations
    in groundwater quality (Kim et al., 2020; Zavareh et al., 2021; Taşan et al.,
    2022; Gugulothu et al., 2022). Moreover, in the literature, to effectively assess
    the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water quality, generalized
    additive models (GAM) have also been employed (Zhang et al., 2021). GAM is the
    non-parametric extension of the generalized linear model (GLM) and is an efficient
    method for analyzing nonlinear relationships (Simpson, 2018). Given the significance
    of groundwater, the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation has
    also been extensively discussed in the literature (Nemčić-Jurec et al., 2019;
    Amrani et al., 2022). Indexes such as the US salinity laboratory diagram (USSL),
    sodium absorption ratio (SAR), and EC are some of the methods used to assess the
    suitability of groundwater for irrigation (Aravinthasamy et al., 2020; Marghade
    et al., 2021). As for the suitability of drinking water, studies have compared
    the physicochemical parameters and concentrations of ions in groundwater to the
    standard limits set by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Bureau of Indian Standards
    (BIS), and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) (Reddy et al., 2019; Kumar
    and Maurya, 2023). These organizations have also identified the adverse health
    effects of ion concentrations exceeding the permissible and acceptable limit;
    studies have used these guidelines to highlight potential health consequences
    (Reddy et al., 2019; Kumar and Maurya, 2023). In the literature, the United State
    Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) assessment method has also been widely used
    to assess potential health hazards (Zhang et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2021). For
    a developing country like India, with most of its states being agrarian (Government
    of India GOI, 2021), anthropogenic activities such as agriculture have become
    a significant source and cause of groundwater pollution (Wakejo et al., 2022;
    Ravindra et al., 2022). Over the past decade in India, particularly within the
    water-scarce regions (mainly the arid and semi-arid regions), where groundwater
    is indispensable for human life (Adimalla and Wu, 2019; Aher and Deshmukh, 2019;
    Hoogesteger, 2022), a growing concern for the health risks associated with the
    ingestion and bioaccumulation of water contaminants have been observed (Adimalla
    et al., 2018; Shukla et al., 2021). According to studies, approximately 66 million
    people in India suffer from skeletal and dental fluorosis as a result of fluoride
    (F−) contamination in groundwater (Tanwer et al., 2023), with the most severely
    impacted regions including states such as Telangana, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh,
    and Rajasthan (Adimalla et al., 2018). Furthermore, as one of the most dangerous
    and widespread groundwater contaminants, nitrate (NO3−) pollution has emerged
    as a pressing issue in one-third of Indian states, notably within the arid and
    semi-arid regions (Pazhuparambil Jayarajan and Kuriachan, 2021; Rahman et al.,
    2021; Tanwer et al., 2023). In India, more than 108.2 million people are exposed
    to nitrate concentrations exceeding the permissible limit (Kom et al., 2022).
    Prolonged exposure to elevated nitrate levels poses severe health risks, such
    as Methemoglobinemia (Blue baby syndrome) in infants, and it increases the vulnerability
    of adults to thyroid dysfunction, hypertension, and stomach cancer (Rahman et
    al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022; Kom et al., 2022). Rajasthan, the largest Indian
    state, is predominately arid and semi-arid, where groundwater provides approximately
    90 percent of drinking water and 70 percent of irrigation water requirements.
    The contamination of groundwater in Rajasthan has been highlighted by the Central
    Ground Water Board CGWB (2021), India, which observed that between 40 and 56 percent
    of groundwater samples in the state’s districts of Barmer, Dausa, Tonk, Jaipur,
    and Jodhpur have electrical conductivity (EC) above the permissible limit, i.e.,
    greater than 3000 μS/cm. In addition, roughly 40 and 31 percent of groundwater
    samples in Barmer and Jaipur exceeded the permissible chloride (Cl−) limit of
    >1000 mg/L. In approximately 67 percent of Tonk’s groundwater samples, the sulphate
    (SO42−) concentration exceeded 400 mg/L (the maximum permissible limit). Further,
    more than 50 percent of the groundwater samples in Barmer and Jodhpur contained
    nitrate (NO3−) concentrations exceeding 45 mg/L. Also, the districts of Tonk,
    Barmer, Ajmer, and Jaipur were found to be afflicted by fluoride (F−) contamination.
    Given the groundwater contamination in the arid (Barmer and Jodhpur) and semi-arid
    (Ajmer, Jaipur, Dausa, and Tonk) districts of Rajasthan, these districts were
    selected for investigation in the present study. Although the issue of groundwater
    contamination is not unique to Rajasthan, it is observed throughout the majority
    of India and worldwide (Esmeray and Gökcekli, 2020; Zacchaeus et al., 2020; Abascal
    et al., 2022; Wakejo et al., 2022). However, particularly in the arid and semi-arid
    regions of Rajasthan that have a huge reliance on groundwater (Coyte et al., 2019),
    the contamination of groundwater will exacerbate the water crisis and pose a severe
    threat to the region’s sustainable development (Velis et al., 2017). Though numerous
    studies have previously been conducted to assess groundwater quality across different
    districts of Rajasthan, particularly regarding F− and NO3− (Chaudhary and Satheeshkumar,
    2018; Tiwari et al., 2020; Aggarwal et al., 2021; Singh and Bhakar, 2021; Choubisa
    et al., 2022; Tanwer et al., 2023). However, particularly for the districts of
    Jaipur and Dausa, studies on water quality and availability are scarce (Tiwari
    et al., 2020; Pandit and Kateja, 2023). In addition, the literature on the effects
    of climate change on water quality is limited (Barbieri et al., 2021). Also, to
    the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive assessment of climatic and anthropogenic
    activities influencing the groundwater quality in the selected districts is sparse,
    although notable exceptions include Coyte et al. (2019). The novelty of the present
    study is that it presents a comprehensive analysis of the hydro-chemistry and
    factors that influence it in the selected districts. The study results can be
    used to formulate appropriate strategies for managing groundwater resources and
    highlighting potential risks associated with using groundwater. Given this, the
    main objectives of this study are. 1) To assess the trends and variability of
    groundwater quality in the arid and semi-arid districts of Rajasthan. 2) To investigate
    the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation in the arid and semi-arid
    districts of Rajasthan. 3) To determine the relative influence of climatic and
    anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality. The remaining sections of this
    study are structured as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the study area. Section
    3 discusses the data source and methodology of the study. Section 4 discusses
    the results. The final Section 5 concludes the study with a summary and conclusions.
    2. Study area Rajasthan, with a total area of 342,239 km2, is India’s largest
    state. Administratively, the state is divided into 33 districts, each of which
    has distinctive socioeconomic characteristics. The area under investigation for
    the current study consists of the arid districts of Barmer and Jodhpur and the
    semi-arid districts of Jaipur, Dausa, Tonk, and Ajmer (see Fig. 1). Download :

    Authors'' construction. Barmer and Jodhpur are located in the western region of
    Rajasthan. Barmer is the third largest district in Rajasthan. The district is
    prone to frequent droughts and occasional cold waves, heat waves, and frost. Jaipur
    forms the east-central part of the state, while Ajmer is located in the central
    part of Rajasthan. Additionally, the districts of Dausa and Tonk are situated
    in the eastern region. According to the CGWB (2020), the districts of Barmer,
    Jodhpur, Jaipur, Ajmer, Dausa, and Tonk experienced an average annual rainfall
    of 355.5 mm, 397.6 mm, 583.6 mm, 560.0 mm, 691.6 mm, and 836.8 mm, respectively,
    during the period of 2010–2018. In addition, the report indicates that all these
    districts are severally stressed, with the stage of groundwater development in
    all of these districts exceeding 100 percent. 3. Methodology 3.1. Data source
    Groundwater quality parameters data from 2000 to 2018 were collected from the
    CGWB (from the India Water Resources Information System (India-WRIS) website).
    To study the hydrochemistry in the arid and semi-arid districts, fifteen water
    quality (Total Alkalinity (TA (mg/L)), Calcium (Ca2+ (mg/L)), Chloride (Cl− (mg/L)),
    Electrical Conductivity (EC (mumhos/cm) at 25 C)), Fluoride (F− (mg/L)), Iron
    (Fe (mg/L)), Total Hardness (TH (mg/L)), Bicarbonate (HCO3− (mg/L)), Carbonate
    (CO32− (mg/L)), Potassium (K+(mg/L)), Magnesium (Mg2+ (mg/L)), Sodium (Na+(mg/L)),
    Nitrate (NO3− (mg/L)), pH and Sulphate (SO42− (mg/L)) parameters from 84 wells/piezometers
    were selected. These 84 wells/piezometers are distributed as follows: 21 in Ajmer,
    13 in Jaipur, 20 in Barmer, 14 in Jodhpur, 12 in Tonk, and 4 in Dausa (see Fig.
    1). In addition, the NASA POWER (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/)
    database was used to collect location-specific data on climatic parameters (precipitation
    and temperature) from 2000 to 2018. Net Irrigated Area (NIA), Population, Fertilizer
    (kg/hectares), and Industrialization were considered anthropogenic variables.
    Following Tregenna (2016), industrialization was defined as the share of manufacturing
    in the gross district product. The statistics on anthropogenic variables from
    2000 to 2018 were obtained from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Rajasthan.
    3.2. Methods 3.2.1. Statistical analysis For the data on groundwater quality,
    descriptive statistics, including median, standard deviation (SD), maximum, and
    minimum, were calculated. In addition, for the groundwater quality and climatic
    variables (temperature and precipitation), the Mann-Kendall (Mann, 1945; Kendall,
    1975) and Sen’s slope estimator (Sen, 1968) were employed to determine the spatiotemporal
    trend within the data set. MK is a non-parametric trend analysis test resilient
    to nonlinearity, nonnormality, and seasonality (Fahim et al., 2022). The significance
    test of MK is based on the following hypothesis: Null hypothesis (H0): There is
    no monotonic trend. Alternative hypothesis (H1): There exists an increasing/decreasing
    trend. H0 is rejected if the series exhibits an increasing/decreasing trend at
    a predetermined significance level (α). Following Gibrilla et al. (2018), α was
    assumed to be 5 percent in this study. Furthermore, Sen’s slope estimator was
    used to obtain the magnitude of the trend (change per unit time) (see Equation
    (1)). (1) where j is between 1 and n, k is between 1 and (n−1). 3.2.2. Evaluation
    of groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation The suitability of groundwater
    for drinking was evaluated by comparing the parameters such as pH, Ca2+, Mg2+,
    Na+, K+, Cl-, F-, SO42−, and NO3− with the guidelines specified by the World Health
    Organization WHO (2011) and Bureau of Indian standards BIS (2012). In the study,
    these guidelines limit have been used to highlight the human health risks. In
    addition, SAR, EC, and USSL diagrams were used to evaluate groundwater quality
    suitability for irrigation. 3.2.3. Principal component analysis (PCA) PCA was
    utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the groundwater quality data. District-wise
    results of PCA analysis of water quality indicators (TA, Ca2+, Cl−, EC, F−, Fe,
    TH, HCO3−, K+, Mg2+, Na+, NO3−, SO42− and pH) are presented in the Supplementary
    file (Table S1). Before the analysis, the data were normalized, and the Bartlett
    sphericity and KMO (Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin) tests were applied to check the data reliability
    and adequacy of the sample (Pandey et al., 2022). The KMO and Bartlett test scores
    for each district indicated that the sample is adequate and suitable for PCA.
    Based on Kaiser’s rule, four principal components with an eigenvalue greater than
    one were selected for Barmer, Ajmer, and Jodhpur, explaining the cumulative variance
    of 81, 90, and 82 percent, respectively. Whereas five principal components were
    selected for the districts of Jaipur, Tonk, and Dausa, explaining the total variance
    of 83.7, 88.2, and 90.5 percent, respectively. Furthermore, varimax rotation was
    used to obtain the component loadings (see Table S1); it is evident that parameters
    have both positive and negative loadings. If the parameter loadings have the same
    sign, they are positively correlated, while if they have opposing signs, they
    are negatively correlated (Zavareh et al., 2021). Based on the absolute value
    of the loadings, the data were divided into principal components (PCs). The PCs
    extracted by PCA concisely depict the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the examined
    region. For GAM analysis, the district-wise extracted PCs were used to examine
    the effect of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water quality. 3.2.4.
    Generalized additive model (GAM) GAM was used to analyze the influence of climatic
    and anthropogenic factors on groundwater quality. Conceptualized by Hastie and
    Tibshirani (1986), GAM is a non-parametric regression model. It is an extended
    version of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Especially for modeling non-linear
    relationships, GAM is a more reliable and flexible technique than a liner-based
    model (Lin et al., 2018). One of the advantages of using GAM is that the nature
    of the relationship between the dependent and independent variable does not need
    to be modeled a priori; instead, the data determine the nature of the relationship
    (Wang et al., 2022). The general formula of GAM is given in Equation (2). (2)
    Where is the intercept of the model, is the expected value of the dependent variable
    Yi, is a continuous function, is the independent/explanatory variable and is the
    smooth function of the independent variables. The smooth function of the independent
    variable can either be thin plate regression splines (TPRS), tensor product, TPRS
    with shrinkage, etc. In this study, TPRS has been used as the smooth function.
    Further, generalized cross-validation (GCV) was used for selecting the smoothing
    parameters. In addition, following Wang et al. (2022), to evaluate the model’s
    goodness-of-fit, deviance explained (DE), residual analysis, AIC (Akaike information
    criterion), and adjusted R-square (R-sq. (adj)) were employed. Further, AIC (Akaike
    information criterion) and adjusted R-square (R-sq. (adj)) were used to determine
    the optimal model. Fig. 2 shows the steps taken to analyze the impact of climatic
    and anthropogenic factors on groundwater quality using GAM. Download : Download

    groundwater hydrochemistry The analysis reveals that the pH of groundwater in
    the examined region remained neutral to slightly alkaline throughout the entire
    period (2000–2018) (see supplementary file Table S2). Further, from 2000 to 2018,
    the median value of EC declined in Ajmer, Barmer, and Jodhpur, which indicates
    a decrease in groundwater contamination (Jeon et al., 2020). While an increase
    in median values in Jaipur, Dausa, and Tonk was evident, indicating an accumulation
    of salts and ion particles in the groundwater in these districts. Also, the median
    value of NO3− in Ajmer, HCO3− in Barmer, Cl−, F−, HCO3− and NO3− in Dausa and
    Tonk, SO42− and NO3− in Jaipur and Jodhpur and SO42− in Tonk have shown an increase
    from 2000 to 2018. As a result of an increase in HCO3− in Barmer, Dausa, and Tonk,
    the median value of TA in these districts has also increased. Additionally, in
    Dausa, the concentration of Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, and Na+ increased from 2000 to 2018.
    From 2000 to 2018, the median concentration of Ca2+ in Jaipur declined, whereas
    the median concentrations of K+, Mg2+, and Na+ increased. Similarly, while the
    median concentrations of Ca2+ and K+ decreased in Tonk from 2000 to 2018, the
    median concentrations of Mg2+ and Na+ increased. In Dausa and Tonk, the TH value,
    which measures dissolved Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Wu et al., 2017), increased from 2000
    to 2018. In addition, from 2000 to 2018, the median concentration of trace element
    Fe increased in Barmer, Jodhpur, and Tonk. During the study period Na+ and K+
    were the dominating cations, and Cl− and HCO3− were the dominating anion (see
    supplementary file Fig. S1). The water type in these districts was primarily Na–Cl
    type. Nonetheless, Ca–HCO3, Ca–Na–HCO3, Ca–Mg–Cl, and Na–HCO3 water types were
    also observed. 4.2. Trend analysis of groundwater quality parameters Trend analysis
    of different quality parameters for 84 observation stations in the examined region
    from 2000 to 2018 is shown in Fig. 3 and the supplementary file (Table S3). As
    evident from the figure, MK and Sen’s tests for the data detected both positive/increasing
    and negative/decreasing trends. Out of 84 stations significant increasing trend
    was evident for TA (42%), EC (35%), TH (40%), pH (19%), Ca2+ (31%), K+(14%), Mg2+
    (35%), Na+(34%), Cl− (32%), HCO3− (40%), SO42− (27%), F− (12%), NO3− (25%) and
    Fe (30%). While significant decreasing trend was evident for TA (18%), EC (20%),
    TH (13%), pH (30%), Ca2+ (8%), K+(36%), Mg2+ (22%), Na+(27%), Cl− (23%), HCO3−
    (25%), SO42− (19%), F− (61%), NO3− (37%) and Fe (24%). The district-wise number
    of stations exhibiting a significant increasing trend is shown in Table 1. Download

    suitability 4.3.1. Suitability for drinking Table 2 shows the Bureau of Indian
    standards BIS (2012) and World Health Organization WHO (2011) guidelines for groundwater
    quality parameters. The year-wise percentage of observation stations that exceed
    the BIS and WHO acceptable and permissible thresholds are given in the Supplementary
    file (Table S4). The analysis shows that from 2000 to 2018, a comparatively higher
    percentage of stations exceeded the guideline limit for Cl− (mg/L), F− (mg/L),
    and Na+ (mg/L). In 2018, 44, 35, and 53 percent of stations exceeded the desirable
    limit of 250 mg/L for Cl−, 1 mg/L for F−, and 200 mg/L for Na+, respectively.
    District-wise, from 2009 to 2018 in Dausa, 100 percent of stations exceeded the
    BIS acceptable limit for F−. Also, during the study period, more than 50 percent
    of stations in Jaipur (excluding the year 2018) and Barmer were found to exceed
    the acceptable limit for F-. Similarly, except for 2018, the Cl− levels exceeded
    the acceptable limit in over 50 percent of the stations in Barmer and Jodhpur.
    In Dausa, the presence of Cl− also posed a concern, as it exceeded the limit in
    more than 50 percent of the stations between 2013 and 2018. Likewise, during 2000–2018,
    Na+ exceeded the acceptable limit in more than 50 percent of stations in Jodhpur
    and Barmer (except the year 2018). The high sodium level is also a matter of concern
    for Jaipur and Dausa, where during 2001–2018, Na+ exceeded the acceptable limit
    for over 50 percent of stations. Also, in Ajmer for 2017 and 2018, Na+ concentration
    was greater than 200 mg/L in 57 percent and 53 percent of stations. In addition,
    approximately 50 and 53 percent of stations in Jodhpur and Jaipur exceeded the
    desirable SO42− limit. Also, in Dausa, from 2014 to 2017, SO42− concentration
    exceeded the desirable limit for 50 percent of the stations. Moreover, in Barmer
    and Jodhpur, most stations exceeded the acceptable NO3− limit, which is cause
    for concern. Table 2. Water quality guideline. Parameter WHO Guideline (2011)

    of Teeth Nitrate (mg/L) 45 Methemoglobinemia Based on this, the suitability of
    groundwater, particularly in Dausa, raises considerable apprehension. Continuous
    consumption of water with high concentrations of these ions increases the vulnerability
    to health problems like fluorosis and bone fluorosis, neurological impairments,
    hypertension, cancer, infertility, heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure
    (Kom et al., 2022). Consumption of higher NO3− increases the risk of cancer and
    can cause hypertension and methemoglobinemia (Kom et al., 2022; Tanwer et al.,
    2023). The non-carcinogenic health effect of high-concentration NO3− (mg/L) consumption
    has become a significant concern (Marghade et al., 2021). 4.3.2. Suitability for
    irrigation The high salinity concentration in irrigation water augments the soil’s
    osmotic pressure and leads to physiological drought that adversely impacts plant
    health (Zaman et al., 2018). Likewise, high Na+ concentration reduces soil permeability
    and can adversely affect crop productivity (Islam et al., 2017). EC is one of
    the most significant and reliable measurements to assess water salinity (Güllü
    and Kavurmacı, 2023). Following Sharma et al. (2017), the EC values were grouped
    into five categories according to Richards (1954) classification to determine
    groundwater suitability. Further, as evident from Table 3, based on BIS, the SAR
    values were classified into four groups to assess the irrigation water quality.
    Table 3. Irrigation water quality guideline. Parameter Water Class EC (μS/cm)
    <250 -Excellent 250–750 - Good 750–2000 -Permissible 2000–3000 -Doubtful >3000
    - Unsuitable SAR <10 - Excellent 10–18 – Good 18–26 – Doubtful >26 - Unsuitable
    Results reveal that from 2000 to 2018 in most stations, the SAR value was less
    than ten, showing the water is excellent for irrigation. Also, during the study
    period in all the districts, the sequence of SAR-based groundwater classification
    was: excellent > good > questionable > unsuitable.1 Based on EC classification,
    in 2018, approximately 5, 29, 18, and 23 percent of stations were under the good,
    permissible, doubtful, and unsuitable category. During the entire study period,
    the sequence of EC-based classification was: unsuitable/permissible > doubtful
    > good > excellent. District-wise, during 2000–2018, most stations in Tonk had
    EC values between 750 and 2000 μS/cm (Permissible), whereas most stations in Jodhpur
    had EC values greater than 3000 μS/cm (Unsuitable). The USSL diagram was used
    to analyze groundwater suitability for irrigation. The plot divides water into
    sixteen classes: four according to EC (C1 = low salinity, C2 = medium salinity,
    C3 = high salinity, C4 = very high salinity) and four according to SAR (S1 = low-sodium
    water, S2 = medium-sodium water, S3 = high-sodium water, and S4 = very high sodium
    water) (Saghebian et al., 2013). Fig. 4 shows the USSL diagram for the year 2018.
    As evident from the figure, most observation station belongs to the C3S2 category,
    i.e., high salinity and medium sodium hazard. Notably, this C3S2 category remained
    predominant throughout the study period (Supplementary Fig. S2). The water in
    this category can be used to irrigate soil with good permeability if salinity
    control measures can be implemented (Aravinthasamy et al., 2020). Download : Download

    increasing trend in temperature between 2000 and 2018. Although, a statistically
    significant (p < 0.05) increasing trend was recorded at approximately 27 percent
    of the stations. In the precipitation data, approximately 68 percent (57 out of
    84) of the observation station witnessed a decreasing trend. Of these 57 stations,
    40 witnessed a significant decreasing trend in precipitation. In eight of the
    observation station, no trend was witnessed, while an increasing trend was evident
    in 19 of the stations. Download : Download high-res image (908KB) Download : Download

    the given period, whereas in Jaipur and Dausa, NIA declined. Like the NIA, the

    4.4.2. Univariate and multivariate GAM construction The results of the correlation
    analysis are shown in the Supplementary File (Table S7). Component-wise, only
    the explanatory variables which were significantly correlated were considered
    for GAM construction. Univariate GAM was constructed to explore the contribution
    and correlation between water quality parameters and climatic and anthropogenic
    variables (see Supplementary File Table S8). The results reveal that in Barmer,
    for PC1, PC2, PC3, and PC4, the GAM model with the population as an explanatory
    variable was the best univariate model. For Jodhpur, for PC1, PC2, and PC3 as
    response variable NIA, fertilizer usage and NIA was the best univariate model,
    respectively. Similarly, in Tonk for PC1, PC2, and PC3 GAM model with NIA, population
    and fertilizer usage has the lowest AIC (and hence was the best fit), respectively.
    For Dausa, PC1, PC2, PC3, and PC5 as response variables, GAM with population,
    industrialization, population, and rainfall as explanatory variables was the best
    fit. For Ajmer, the constructed univariate GAM with PC1 and PC3 as the response
    variable was non-linearly correlated with industrialization (edf > 1). For Jaipur,
    the univariate GAM with industrialization as an explanatory variable had an edf
    > 1 when PC2 and PC3 are the response variable and efd = 1 when PC4 is the response
    variable. For PC1 in Jaipur, the GAM model with the population as an explanatory
    variable was linearly correlated. GAM model with PC5 as response variable had
    edf = 1 with NIA and population. For PC5, GAM with the population as an explanatory
    variable was the best fit. The multivariate GAM results are shown in the Supplementary
    file (Table S9). For response variables with more than one multivariate GAM, the
    best fit was determined based on AIC and R-sq. (adj) values. Accordingly, in Barmer
    for PC3 and PC4, Model1 was the best fit. In Jodhpur, for PC2 Model5, and in Tonk
    for PC1 and PC3, Model2 and Model1, respectively, were the best fit. Likewise,
    in Dausa, Model2 for PC3 and Model3 for PC5 were the best fit. Model fit results
    of the best fit/optimal multivariate GAM models, as shown in the Supplementary
    file (Table S10 and Fig. S3). The results show that the fitting of each optimal
    GAM model is satisfactory. 4.4.3. Correlation of groundwater quality with anthropogenic
    and climatic variables 4.4.3.1. Population and industrialization Rajasthan generates
    the most waste, producing between 3842 and 7662 tonnes of municipal solid waste
    daily (Kumar et al., 2017). As per the statistics during 2018–2019, Rajasthan
    generated 24.18 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste and 5.62 lakh metric tonnes
    of hazardous waste (Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation MOSPI, 2019).
    Further, according to Jain (2014), during 2001–2010, the amount of solid waste
    generated in Jaipur (state capital) increased by approximately 16 percent. Despite
    Jaipur being the state’s capital, there is a lack of proper waste storage and
    collection facilities, and often open dumping is followed (Jain, 2014). Studies
    have shown that deterioration in the water quality, particularly an increase in
    the concentration of NO3− is significantly and positively linked to wastewater
    and solid waste disposal (Silva et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2020; Wakejo et al.,
    2022), which is substantially associated with population and industrialization
    (Zhang et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2020). As evident from Table 4 and Fig. 7, in
    the best fit GAM, population increase was found to be an important factor for
    the rise in pollution of Ca2+ and TH in Barmer, Ca2+, Cl−, NO3−, Mg2+, Na+, and
    SO42− in Tonk, Ca2+ and F− in Dausa and EC, SO42−, Cl− and Na+ in Jaipur. Similarly,
    in the best-fit GAMs of Ajmer, Jaipur, and Dausa, industrialization was identified
    as a significant causal factor. An increase in industrialization was found to
    increase the concentration of Cl−, EC, Mg2+, Na+, SO42−, F− in Ajmer, TA, HCO3−,
    TH, Ca2+, NO3− and F− in Jaipur, and Cl−, TH, Mg2+, TA, and HCO32− in Dausa. Hence,
    the result of the present study is consistent with the previous literature, except
    in the case of Barmer and Dausa, whereby a contradictory result is found. NO3−
    concentration reduction is only achievable if preventive measures are taken (Wakejo
    et al., 2022). In the district of Dausa and Barmer, the decrease in NO3− with
    population growth may be attributable, in part, to the improvement of sanitary
    parameters (see Supplementary Fig. S4). Table 4. Effect of climatic and anthropogenic

    Authors'' construction. 4.4.3.2. Fertilizer and NIA Given that Rajasthan is predominantly
    an agrarian state, the intensive cultivation of crops, particularly within the
    irrigated regions of western Rajasthan, presents an ecological concern owing to
    the excessive application of chemical fertilizers (Bhati et al., 2017). As evident
    from Fig. 6, the usage of fertilizer in Tonk and Jodhpur has witnessed an increase
    from 2000 to 2018, and it was found to be strongly correlated with Mg2+, Na+,
    and SO4 2- in Tonk and NO3− and Fe in Jodhpur. Studies have shown that due to
    the extensive use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture, nitrate, and sulphate
    concentrations have increased significantly (Wang et al., 2019; Singh and Craswell,
    2021). Chemical fertilizer has also been recognized as a source of Na+ and Fe
    concentrations in groundwater (Zhai et al., 2021). Ammonium (NH4+) produced by
    nitrogen fertilizers potentially leads to the release of iron (Fe) in water (Zhai
    et al., 2021). The results also reveal that an increase in NIA increases the concentration
    of TA and HCO3− in Tonk and Barmer and decreases the concentration of Ca2+, Cl−,
    Na+, K+, EC, F−, and pH values in Jodhpur. Irrigation via influencing fertilizers''
    leaching affects groundwater’s ion concentration (Lwimbo et al., 2019). In the
    case of highly mineralized irrigation water, the IRF will lead to a rise in the
    ion concentration of groundwater (Foster et al., 2018), resulting in a deterioration
    of groundwater quality. However, if irrigation water contains a low concentration
    of solutes, an increase in irrigation will dilute the ion concentration (Rotiroti
    et al., 2019). 4.4.3.3. Climatic parameters CGWB (2020) states that approximately
    74 percent of the total annual groundwater recharge is sourced from precipitation,
    making it the major source of groundwater recharge in Rajasthan. Consequently,
    the precipitation patterns substantially influence the hydrogeochemical and hydrodynamic
    processes of the state. Although all the quality parameters of the groundwater
    are influenced by precipitation, in the current study, precipitation was found
    to significantly and negatively affect the concentration of TA and HCO3− in Tonk
    and K+ in Dausa. One possible explanation for this is the subsurface infiltration
    of rainwater, which results in the dissolving and dilution of ions in groundwater
    (Aher and Deshmukh, 2019). In Dausa, the concentration of K+ was also significantly
    influenced by temperature. 5. Conclusion The study attempts to assess the hydrochemical
    characteristics of groundwater, its temporal trend, and suitability for domestic
    and irrigation use using non-parametric MK and Sen’s slope estimator test and
    USSL diagram. Also, it identifies the influence of anthropogenic and climatic
    variables on groundwater quality at 84 stations in arid (Barmer and Jodhpur) and
    semi-arid (Ajmer, Jaipur, Dausa, and Tonk) districts of Rajasthan for the period
    2000 to 2018 using GAM. Important conclusions are summarized below: • Groundwater
    in the examined districts is generally neutral to slightly alkaline. On average,
    Na+ + K+ were the dominating cations, while Cl− and HCO3− were the dominating
    anions. During the study period, the order of water type in the districts was:
    Na–Cl > Ca–Na–HCO3> Na–HCO3> Ca–Mg–Cl> Ca–HCO3. • In general, MK and Sen’s trend
    analysis reveals that cations Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and anions Cl−, HCO3−, and SO42−
    witnessed an increasing trend in a comparatively higher percentage of observation
    stations. In contrast, for cation K+ and anion F− and NO3−, a comparatively higher
    percentage of observation stations witnessed decreasing trend. • While the district-wise
    analysis indicates that the majority of observation stations with an increasing
    trend in EC, Ca2+, K+, Cl−, and SO42− were located in Jaipur, whereas the majority
    of stations with an increasing trend in pH and F− were situated in Barmer and
    Dausa, respectively. Similarly, stations with an increasing trend in Na+ and NO3−
    were primarily located in Jodhpur, while stations with an increasing trend in
    TA, TH, Mg2+, and HCO3− were primarily in Tonk. Moreover, 30 percent of monitoring
    stations, primarily in Barmer, Jodhpur, Tonk, and Ajmer, observed a significant
    increasing trend in Fe. • Based on the Bureau of Indian standards BIS (2012) and
    World Health Organization WHO (2011) guidelines, groundwater in the examined districts
    exceeded the acceptable limit in Cl−, F−, and Na+ at most of the stations. From
    the human health perspective, the suitability of groundwater, particularly in
    Dausa, raises considerable apprehension. Consuming water with such a high concentration
    of these ions can lead to several adverse health effects, including bone and skeletal
    damage, tooth discoloration, high blood pressure, and heart disease. • The irrigation
    indices, such as EC, were found to be between 750 and 2000 (Permissible limit)
    in 29 percent and >3000 (Unsuitable) in 23 percent of the stations in 2018. Furthermore,
    the results show that the SAR values were less than 10 (Excellent) for the majority
    of stations during the period from 2000 to 2018. Moreover, the USSL diagram reveals
    that most observation stations fall into the C3S2 category, indicating that the
    water would be suitable for irrigation if salinity control measures can be implemented.
    • GAM analysis reveals that in the examined districts, compared to the climatic
    variables, various anthropogenic variables significantly influence the groundwater
    quality parameters. From the district-wise analysis, it can be stated that industrialization
    in Ajmer, population and NIA in Barmer, NIA and fertilizer usage in Jodhpur, population
    and industrialization in Jaipur and Dausa, and NIA, population, fertilizer usage
    in Tonk were the key factors in explaining the groundwater quality parameters.
    However, climatic factor such as precipitation was found to have a significant
    influence on TA and HCO3− at Tonk, while both temperature and precipitation significantly
    influence K+ at Dausa, • Thus, the present study suggests that policies should
    focus on implementing proper municipal solid and liquid waste disposal and managing
    industrial pollutants. Also, stringent enactment of regulations and guidelines
    controlling the excessive use of chemical-based fertilizers and encouraging agricultural
    households to shift to organic farming is recommended. Efforts should be made
    to reduce the dependency on groundwater for irrigation, as it may lead to over-exploitation
    and further deterioration of water quality. This, in turn, may impact the suitability
    of groundwater for irrigation and domestic use in the future. In this respect,
    the outreach of existing state policies, such as Indira Gandhi Nahar Pariyojana
    (IGNP), that increase surface water irrigation is strongly recommended. In addition,
    efforts encouraging traditional water harvesting methods such as Khadin, Baori,
    tanka, etc., would aid in lowering irrigation’s reliance on groundwater. Further,
    as groundwater is a significant source of drinking water supply in Rajasthan,
    and to protect human health, rigorous efforts should be made to create general
    awareness with the help of grassroots organizations such as non-governmental organizations
    (NGOs) regarding water disinfection before domestic use. Ethical approval We declare

  description: Intensification of cultivation methods and land-use types, particularly
    in the face of climate change, has steadily weakened the habitat function of rice
    fields for waterbirds. Intermediate egrets (Ardea intermedia) are highly dependent
    on rice field habitats. Here, we examine the effect of a shift from rice monoculture
    to rice–barley double cultivation on the use of rice fields by intermediate egrets
    in South Korea. Rice–barley double cultivation has been increasing steadily in
    the southern region of South Korea due to changes in the rice growth period under
    climate change and maximization of economic benefits. We studied rice fields to
    determine the effect of the rice–barley double cultivation area on the abundance
    of intermediate egrets on the regional scale and their potential distribution
    pattern in response to double cultivation in relation to climate change using
    national-scale climate, altitude and land cover data from 1 May to 23 June 2018.
    Compared to the irrigation practices used for rice monoculture, irrigation was
    stopped for some time in rice–barley double cultivation prior to planting, compromising
    the role of rice fields as a food ground for intermediate egrets. The potential
    abundance of intermediate egrets rapidly decreased by half when the double cultivation
    area increased to >40% of the total rice-field area, and was less than one individual
    if the area increased to >80%. Furthermore, according to climate change projections,
    by 2100, the double cultivation area would account for 75.74% of the predicted
    range of intermediate egret foraging ground. Synthesis and applications. Double
    cultivation areas should be <40% of existing rice fields to minimize the impact
    of the change in cultivation practices. This approach can also convert rice fields
    to other types of land use. Consequently, appropriate conservation and management
    measures may be developed to maintain suitable habitats despite rapidly changing
    cultivation practices resulting from climate change.

    from climate change. 1 INTRODUCTION Land-use change modulates biodiversity patterns
    and ecosystem function, including animal distribution and population dynamics
    and risk of extinction (Butler et al., 2010; Pereira et al., 2012). Land-use change
    affects the habitat diversity of wetland-based waterbirds, thereby altering their
    population size (Galbraith et al., 2002; Grosbois et al., 2008). During the past
    century, natural wetlands have continuously declined globally due to reclamation,
    drainage and development activities (Cheng & Ma, 2023). Meanwhile, land-use changes
    have continued the expansion of human-made or human-managed wetlands (Davidson,
    2014). Although some waterbirds are highly dependent on natural wetlands, artificial
    wetlands, such as rice fields, serve as alternative habitats and provide foraging,
    resting and breeding grounds for various waterbirds, including endangered species
    (Choi & Nam, 2020; Elphick & Oring, 2003). However, over the past few decades,
    the function of paddy fields as alternative habitats for waterbirds has been compromised
    by agricultural intensification, modernization of paddy cultivation methods and
    conversion to other types of land use (Herring et al., 2021; Katayama et al.,
    2015). Such land-use changes are often triggered by climate change and occur on
    both global and local scales, affecting the vulnerability or resilience of populations
    (Gaüzère et al., 2017; Pérez-Méndez et al., 2022). The cultivation methods and/or
    climate changes have influenced land-use change (Ash et al., 2007; Motha, 2007).
    Such changes affect not only present but also future crop production (Macholdt
    & Honermeier, 2016; Nelson et al., 2014). For example, in fields where rice is
    grown, climate change has allowed multiple cropping of a single crop or double
    cropping, such as rotation with other crops, in East Asia (Kawasaki, 2019; Kim
    et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2015). Furthermore, to switch from rice to other crops
    with high economic efficiency that are suitable for the altered cropping environment
    following climate change, rice fields are converted to other types of farmland,
    including farms for facility cultivation (Lobell et al., 2011). The total area
    under rice cultivation in South Korea is 726,745 ha, accounting for approximately
    47% of the total cultivated area. This is the largest single-crop cultivation
    area in the country, distributed from north to south, mainly along the west coast
    (KOSIS, 2022a). Increasing temperatures have shortened the rice cultivation period,
    and although barley has high cold resistance, the temperatures in the northern
    part of the Korean Peninsula have been too low for cultivation. However, with
    increasing temperatures in the central and northern regions, cultivation of barley
    is becoming possible (Kim et al., 2020). South Korea''s rice fields provide important
    habitats for numerous aquatic species (Choi et al., 2021; Nam et al., 2012). Herons
    and egrets, including intermediate egrets (Ardea intermedia), use rice fields
    as stable foraging grounds for feeding offspring during the breeding season, as
    they offer an abundance of food and allow a high food intake rate owing to flooding
    and substrate characteristics (Richardson & Taylor, 2003). For juvenile birds,
    rice fields provide the energy required to migrate to the wintering site (Choi
    et al., 2016; Nam et al., 2012). Therefore, the area under rice cultivation affects
    the size of the breeding population of herons and egrets (Fasola et al., 2022;
    Tourenq et al., 2000). Other herons and egrets, such as great egrets and grey
    herons, move to other habitats like rivers and reservoirs when rice growth in
    fields is dense, while intermediate egrets continue to hunt for food in and around
    rice fields by altering the types of food they acquire rather than using other
    wetlands (Choi et al., 2010). These birds are sensitive to structural changes
    in rice fields (e.g. modernization of waterways), which cause a sharp decline
    in their population (Lane & Fujioka, 1998). Lee et al. (2012) reported that intermediate
    egrets forage mostly in rice fields in South Korea, with over 90% of the foraging
    activity occurring in rice fields compared to various types of wetlands, including
    rivers and reservoirs. Hence, although intermediate egrets are not protected species
    in Korea, rice fields are critical foraging grounds for them (Choi et al., 2016;
    Lee et al., 2012). Here, our aim was to predict the distribution of intermediate
    egrets, which are highly dependent on rice fields, in relation to changes in rice
    cultivation methods, such as double cultivation, due to climate change. We hypothesized
    a negative influence of double cultivation on intermediate egrets, affecting future
    distributions of intermediate egrets by double cultivation patterns according
    to climate change. To examine this, we sought to (1) predict the abundance of
    intermediate egrets with respect to the change in rice cultivation area under
    double cultivation on the regional scale (province level); (2) determine the potential
    double cultivation range and changes in the distribution range of intermediate
    egrets with respect to various climate change scenarios on a national scale; and
    (3) determine the distribution range of intermediate egrets with respect to climate
    change on the national scale based on the relationship between double cultivation
    and intermediate egret occupancy. The results of the present study could provide
    information that could facilitate the formulation of conservation and management
    measures based on the identified effects of agricultural intensification on intermediate
    egrets. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Study area The study was carried out from
    1 May to 23 June 2018 in rice fields at a regional scale (105,271 ha, including
    part of the provinces of Chungcheongnam-do (CN) and Jeollabuk-do (JB)) and national
    scale (10,021,000 ha, including eight provinces: Gyeonggi-do (GG), Gangwon-do
    (GW), Chungcheongbuk-do (CB), CN, Gyeongsangbuk-do (GB), Gyeongsangnam-do (GN),
    JB and Jeollannam-do (JN)) to determine the abundance of intermediate egrets based
    on the double cultivation area and their potential distribution range according
    to climate change (Figure 1). A survey area surrounded by rice fields was randomly
    selected to minimize the influence of the landscape (approximately 80% of the
    area in each plot). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Map of the study
    plots, sites and the Korean Peninsula with provincial abbreviations. (a) Forty
    plots (black rectangle, 1 × 1 km) were surveyed for intermediate egret occurrence
    and the selected environmental factor (double cropping) in the midwest part of
    the Korean Peninsula (regional scale). (b) 6–15 sites (blue circle, 1 × 1 km)
    were randomly selected for each province (GG, GW, CB, CN, GB, GN, JB, JN) to confirm
    the distribution information of the intermediate egret and double cultivation
    regions in the Korean Peninsula (national scale). CB, Chungchungbuk-do; CN, Chungchungnam-do;
    GB, Gyeongsangbuk-do; GG, Gyeonggi-do; GN, Gyeongsangnam-do; GW, Gangwon-do; JB,
    Jeollabuk-do; JN, Jeollannam-do. At the regional scale, 40 plots (1 × 1 km) were
    randomly selected in CN and JB, located in the southwest region of South Korea,
    where rice fields used for rice mono- and double cultivation were distributed
    (Figure 1a). The rice cultivation areas in CN and JB were 133,986 and 113,775 ha,
    respectively, and the double cultivation area was 65 and 10,362 ha respectively
    (KOSIS, 2022a). Surveys were carried out in rice fields in Seocheon-gun and Nonsan-si
    of CN and Iksan-si, Wanju-gun, Gimje-si, Jeongeup-si and Buan-gun of JB, with
    a mixed distribution used for rice monoculture and double cultivation. The distance
    between the plots was set at 5 km to minimize the effect of spatial autocorrelation
    (Amano et al., 2008). The average number of rice fields in a plot was 190.6 ± 11.4
    units (range: 168–209) and the average size of the standardized unit paddies (separated
    by levee and farm road) was 0.46 ± 0.06 ha (range: 0.32–0.68 ha). Fifteen sites
    (1 × 1 km) were randomly selected in seven of the eight provinces, except GW,
    to understand intermediate egret occupancy with respect to the rice–barley double
    cultivation area according to climate change on a national scale. GW mainly comprises
    mountainous areas, with a few areas with rice fields of at least 1 × 1 km; therefore,
    six sites were randomly selected (Figure 1b). During the survey period, irrigation
    in rice monoculture fields in the survey plots began on 9 May. In contrast, barley
    was grown in a dry state in rice fields used for double harvesting. On 17 June,
    rice was planted in flooding rice fields or barley was harvested from rice fields
    used for double cultivation, and the fields were irrigated. In the fields used
    for rice monoculture, irrigation and rice planting began at the beginning of May,
    and in the rice fields used for double cultivation, barley was cultivated immediately
    after rice was harvested in October. The barley cultivated during this period
    was harvested in June of the following year. During barley cultivation, rice fields
    were not irrigated (Figure S1). 2.2 Bird and environmental data Both regional
    and national surveys were conducted on days without rain or strong wind. The distribution
    and population of intermediate egrets were recorded using binoculars (Leica 10 × 40
    BN) or spotting scopes (Leica 25–50 × 82) while travelling on farm roads adjacent
    to the main rice fields. The surveys were conducted between 06:00 and 12:00. On
    the regional scale, two teams (two observers per team) conducted intermediate
    egret surveys once a week from 1 May to 23 June 2018 for 8 weeks, and each plot
    was investigated eight times for 40 plots. For each survey, the 40 fixed plots
    were targeted and the plots were divided into two groups of 20 each and randomly
    assigned to two teams for conducting the survey. The number of intermediate egrets
    that occurred within each plot during a 15-min observation period were recorded.
    While intermediate egrets were surveyed, the percentage of barley cultivation
    area under double cultivation was confirmed in the selected plots by simultaneous
    aerial photography and direct observation. During the same survey period on the
    regional scale, the survey points were randomly selected for each province and
    the distribution status was surveyed by visiting the plots centred on the selected
    points twice to investigate the distribution of intermediate egrets and rice–barley
    double crop areas on the national scale. The two teams alternated visits, visiting
    once each for two visits. The start and end times of the investigation were nearly
    identical for both teams. When the distribution of intermediate egrets and rice–barley
    double cropping area was confirmed, the coordinate values of the corresponding
    points were also confirmed. The field surveys did not require any licences or
    permits. To investigate whether the abundance of intermediate egrets is also influenced
    by distance to breeding colonies (Fasola et al., 2022), the distance to the nearest
    colony of intermediate egrets from the rice field where intermediate egrets were
    observed was determined. The coordinates of intermediate egret colonies, based
    on a nationwide survey of herons conducted by the Ministry of Environment in Korea,
    were extracted and used for analyses (NIBR, 2020). 2.3 Predicted abundance of
    intermediate egrets A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM, Poisson distribution)
    was used to test the effects of the proportion of the rice–barley double cultivation
    area in the plot and the distance of the intermediate egret colonies on the abundance
    of intermediate egrets. Poisson error distribution was used to model the abundance
    of intermediate egrets using dispersed count data. The abundance of intermediate
    egrets in each plot was designated as the response variable, whereas the proportion
    of rice–barley double cultivation area, the distance from the colony to the intermediate
    egrets observed in each plot and their interaction were designated as explanatory
    variables. Although the distance between the plots was set to 5 km to minimize
    the effect of spatial autocorrelation, the study plot was designated as a random
    variable to account for plot differences in unknown factors. The change in abundance
    was predicted using rice fields in each plot, a significant explanatory variable.
    The marginal effect was used to estimate the change (Choi et al., 2022). GLMM
    and marginal effects were performed using the lme4 (Bates et al., 2015) and sjPlot
    packages (Lüdecke, 2016) in R version 4.2.2 (R Development Core Team, 2022). 2.4
    Species distribution modelling Ensemble species distribution modelling (ESDM)
    was performed to predict the distributions of intermediate egret and rice–barley
    double cultivation areas on a national scale. The data used for ESDM included
    climate, altitude and land cover data. Climate data (Bio1-Bio19) represented annual
    trends (e.g. annual precipitation, mean annual temperature), seasonality (e.g.
    annual range of precipitation and temperature) and limiting or extreme environmental
    factors (e.g. temperature of the warmest and coldest months, precipitation during
    dry and wet quarters). Climate data were obtained from WorldClim version 2.1 (http://www.worldclim.org/).
    Altitude data were constructed with a spatial resolution of 1 km, and land cover
    data were constructed with a resolution of 1 km based on data from the ESA WorldCover
    2020 10-m resolution land cover map (http://esa-worldcover.org/en). Correlations
    between data from 19 climate variables and altitude data were identified, and
    data with correlation coefficients <0.8 were finally selected as ESDM climate
    data to minimize multicollinearity between the variables. Finally, altitude, land
    cover, Bio2 (mean diurnal range), Bio4 (temperature seasonality) and Bio12 (annual
    precipitation) were used for intermediate egrets, and altitude, land cover, Bio2,
    Bio12, Bio14 (precipitation of the driest month) and Bio19 (precipitation of the
    coldest quarter) were used for rice–barley double cultivation (Figure S2). The
    following eight models were used for ESDM: generalized linear model, generalized
    additive model, classification tree analysis, multivariate adaptive regression
    splines, random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machines and
    maximum entropy. Each algorithm was run 10 times. Once run, 75% of the randomly
    selected occupancy data were used for training the model and 25% for testing to
    evaluate the accuracy of the model. The explanatory power of the model was verified
    using the area under the curve (AUC) score, Cohen''s kappa coefficient and the
    true skill statistic (TSS). Although many studies have expressed model accuracy
    using AUC, the value is sensitive to model conditions such as sample or background
    size; hence, the omission rate was presented to complement this (Phillips et al.,
    2009). The error rate was calculated as the percentage of missing points that
    were not predicted based on the threshold of the 10% training presence (Jiménez-Valverde
    et al., 2008). The predictive outputs that met an evaluation threshold that maximized
    the sum of sensitivity and specificity were then combined into a single ensemble
    model based on average performance between algorithms. Finally, occupancy was
    predicted when the distribution prediction value exceeded the threshold value.
    ACCESS-ESM1-5 of the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) was used as the climate
    change scenario to identify potential intermediate egret habitat and rice–barley
    double cultivation area distributions. Using this, the current climate (1990–2020)
    and future climates in 2021–2040, 2041–2060, 2061–2080 and 2081–2100 of SSP126,
    SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 were predicted. SSPs represent the most advanced tools
    for assessing global environmental change in the 21st century, and various emission
    scenarios, which are increases in carbon emissions from SSP126 to SSP585, can
    effectively yield future climate projections (Eyring et al., 2016). The raster
    files of the predicted range of intermediate egret habitat distributions and rice–barley
    double cultivation area were overlapped to determine the range of potential independent
    distributions of intermediate egrets and double cultivation areas, as well as
    the overlap range of the two distributions. The SSDM package (Schmitt et al.,
    2017) in R version 4.2.2. was used to run the ESDM model (R Core Team, 2022).
    3 RESULTS During the survey period, the cumulative number of intermediate egrets
    observed on the regional scale was 207, and 0.65 individuals were identified per
    plot (range: 0–8 individuals) in 320 plots (40 plots × 8 surveys). Regarding the
    time of detection, individuals were rarely observed in week 1 (the first week
    of May) before irrigation; however, this number increased rapidly after irrigation
    commenced in week 2 (Figure 2). Subsequently, the bird density (minimum: 0.525
    at week 5, maximum: 0.800 at week 3) of 0.5 to 1.0 per plot was steadily maintained,
    except for a density of 1.1 in week 6 (the first week of June). FIGURE 2 Open

    1st indicates the first week of May. The abundance of intermediate egrets counted
    in 40 plots (1 × 1 km). Each plot was investigated eight times for 40 plots. The
    cultivation area of rice–barley double cultivation had significant effects on
    intermediate egret abundance, while the distance from the colony did not have
    a significant effect on intermediate egret abundance (Table 1). Regarding the
    rice–barley double cultivation area, the predicted abundance of intermediate egrets
    decreased as the double cultivation area increased (estimate = 0.061, SE = 0.005,
    p < 0.001; Figure 3). The predicted abundance in rice monoculture fields (double
    cultivation area = 0%) was 2.709 individuals per plot (CI: 2.532–2.899). When
    the proportion of rice fields used for double harvest was >40%, the abundance
    decreased to <1.585 individuals per plot (CI: 1.528–1.645). This implies that
    the intermediate egret abundance was approximately halved. In rice fields used
    for double cultivation (>80% of the area), the abundance of intermediate egrets
    decreased to less than one individual per plot (CI: 0.880–0.978), being close
    to zero (Figure 3). TABLE 1. Results of the generalized linear mixed model examining

    interval respectively. A total of 111 sites dominated by paddy fields were evaluated
    at a national scale, and 32 and 29 sites were identified for intermediate egrets
    and double cultivation respectively. Intermediate egrets were observed at 32 sites,
    including 11, 8, 8, 2, 2 and 1 sites in CN, GG, JB, GB, CB and GN, respectively,
    concentrated in the central region. Double crop areas were observed at 29 sites,
    mainly in the southern region, with 11, 10 and 8 in JN, GN and JB respectively.
    In general, the predictive power of the potential distribution of intermediate
    egrets and rice–barley double cultivation areas by the ensemble model was evaluated
    as good (intermediate egrets, AUC: 0.797 ± 0.014, kappa: 0.056 ± 0.025, TSS: 0.593 ± 0.028
    and omission rate: 0.222 ± 0036; rice–barley double cultivation, AUC: 0.771 ± 0.010,
    kappa: 0.531 ± 0.017, TSS: 0.541 ± 0.019 and omission rate: 0.207 ± 0.021). Altitude
    and land cover were identified as important factors influencing the potential
    distribution of intermediate egret habitats and double cultivation areas (Tables
    S1 and S2). Intermediate egrets potentially mainly distribute at low altitudes
    (≤200) and on croplands. The current status of the potential distribution of intermediate
    egrets and double cultivation areas revealed that intermediate egrets were distributed
    along the west part of the Korean Peninsula in GG, CB, JB and JN. The double cultivation
    areas were mainly distributed in the southern part of the JB, JN and GN regions
    (Figure 4). Areas with overlapping distributions of intermediate egrets and double
    cultivation areas were found mainly in CN, JB and JN. FIGURE 4 Open in figure

    respectively. The range of potential distribution of intermediate egrets increased
    (0.22% to 24.49%) or decreased (−1.09% to −6.01%) depending on the climate scenario.
    In contrast, the potential distribution range of the rice–barley double cultivation
    areas was characterized by an increase over time regardless of the climate scenario
    (Table 2; Figure 4). The rice–barley double crop distribution range gradually
    increased according to the scenario and period. The overlapping range between
    the distribution of double cultivation and intermediate egrets increased by 75.74%
    from 2021–2040 in SSP126 to 2081–2100 in SSP585 (Table 2). TABLE 2. Predicted

    Intermediate egrets observed in the midwest region of South Korea appeared during
    the irrigation period in rice fields used for rice monoculture and a certain density
    level was maintained (2.709 individuals/plot). However, the presence of rice fields
    used for rice–barley double cultivation rather than monoculture negatively affected
    the abundance of intermediate egrets. Therefore, the distribution range of intermediate
    egrets could shrink if the double cultivation area in the Korean Peninsula expands.
    Furthermore, although there are no quantitative data, the distribution of intermediate
    egrets is limited despite rice fields that serve as foraging habitats in the southern
    region of Korea, which can be attributed to the influence of double cultivation,
    which originated in the southern region (personal observation). Maintenance of
    the abundance of benthic organisms, such as insects and loaches, as potential
    food sources that influence the abundance of intermediate egrets in rice fields,
    is closely related to the maintenance of rice fields under flooding conditions,
    which are similar to natural wetlands (Choi et al., 2016; Stafford et al., 2010).
    The biomass of benthic organisms starts to increase in the preparation period
    for rice cultivation after the flooding of fields (spring), peaks in summer and
    subsequently decreases until harvest (autumn) (González-Solís et al., 1996). In
    rice–barley double cultivation, rice fields are dry when intermediate egrets first
    arrive in South Korea, compromising their role as foraging grounds. Furthermore,
    rice fields are cultivated after rice harvest and until planting. During this
    period, the fields remain dry. However, instead, a circulation-based cultivation
    structure is followed, in which barley is seeded immediately after rice harvest
    (October–November), followed by barley harvest in early summer of the following
    year (mid-June) and rice cultivation (Kim et al., 2012). Consequently, irrigation
    in double-cropped rice fields begins in mid-June, and the flooding of rice fields
    is delayed by more than a month compared to that in fields used for rice monoculture
    (Kim et al., 2013, see Figure S1). Therefore, in double cultivation, the rice
    field does not function as a feeding ground for intermediate egrets in May before
    irrigation (Fasola et al., 2022; Forti et al., 2021). Intermediate egrets raise
    their offspring in May and their food demand increases rapidly (Choi et al., 2010).
    Therefore, rice fields used for double cultivation do not adequately serve as
    foraging grounds for intermediate egrets during their breeding period. The area
    under double cultivation in South Korea is the largest in the southwest provinces,
    JN and JB (KOSIS, 2022b), and the breeding colonies of intermediate egrets are
    concentrated in GG and CN, which are midwest regions (where double cultivation
    is rare) at the national scale (NIBR, 2020). Although various factors influence
    the selection of breeding colony sites by herons and egrets (Kelly et al., 2008),
    the distribution of foraging grounds, such as rice fields around breeding colonies,
    is an important factor influencing this selection (Tourenq et al., 2000). Rice
    cultivation methods (mono- or double cultivation) significantly affect the distribution
    of intermediate egrets, considering their considerable dependence on rice fields.
    This study predicted that the distribution range of intermediate egrets in the
    central and west regions of GG and CN would decrease with time because of the
    effects of climate change are indirect. The decreasing areas were consistent with
    the prediction regarding the expansion of barley cultivation areas based on the
    climate change scenario proposed by Jeon and Cho (2015). Furthermore, with the
    development of improved cold-resistant barley, the cultivation area is gradually
    shifting northward (Kim et al., 2020). The area of barley cultivation in South
    Korea decreased until 2011. Subsequently, it picked up from 2012 due to public
    interest in its nutritional value and use as a substitute for imported feed and
    raw material for various functional products (Kim et al., 2020; KOSIS, 2022b).
    Therefore, the rice–barley double cultivation area in South Korea is expected
    to expand to the northern region over time due to the expansion of the potential
    cultivation area due to climate change and the increase in socioeconomic demand
    (Kim et al., 2020). Eventually, as the rice–barley double cultivation area expands
    from the southwest (JB and JN) to the midwest region (GG and CN), the foraging
    grounds for intermediate egrets might decline. Climate change will have a fatal
    effect on the maintenance of the intermediate egret population, which acquires
    most of its food during the breeding period from rice fields. The composition
    of submerged rice fields that can continuously provide stable food to egrets influences
    the arrival of intermediate egrets to breed. Natural wetlands, which provide habitat
    for 40% of the planet''s fauna and flora, have reduced their area by more than
    50% due to changes in land use over the past century (Wetlands International,
    2021). Although rice fields are artificial wetlands, numerous studies have reported
    that they serve as alternative habitats for various birds, including endangered
    species such as oriental stork, Ciconia boyciana, crested ibis, Nipponia nippon
    and red-crowned crane, Grus japonensis, instead of natural wetlands that have
    been lost (Choi et al., 2021; Fujioka et al., 2010; Katayama et al., 2019). However,
    due to recent socioeconomic changes, rice fields are turning into fallow fields
    or are being converted to farms for other economically viable crops (Osawa et
    al., 2013; Sirami et al., 2008). Due to climatic, environmental and socioeconomic
    factors, reductions in the area under rice cultivation are inevitable which can
    also have implications for the conservation and management of not only intermediate
    egrets but also aquatic biodiversity, including endangered waterbirds using the
    East Asian–Australasian Flyway and other aquatic animals in many rice-producing
    countries. 4.1 Applications Conservation and management plans for egrets can be
    extremely useful when the period of flooding in rice fields is changing due to
    changes in cultivation methods, such as a shift to double cultivation, or in areas
    where land-use types are completely different due to changes in land-use patterns.
    Based on the findings of this study, we propose the following measures for the
    conservation and management of intermediate egrets. First, the shift to rice–barley
    double cultivation or other types of land use should be limited to <40% of the
    existing total rice monoculture area. As the rice–barley double cultivation area
    increased, the abundance of intermediate egrets decreased by nearly half (40%)
    or almost disappeared (>80%). Therefore, land-use strategies should avoid using
    more than 80% of the land for cultivation of rice monocultures to maintain intermediate
    egret populations. Moreover, to achieve effective ecological and socioeconomic
    applications, more than 60% of rice paddy areas should be maintained around intermediate
    egret colonies and land-use changes that affect more than 60% of the area should
    be implemented in a concentrated manner. However, careful observation is necessary
    to determine whether this has a negative impact on fauna other than intermediate
    egrets. Second, the fields used for rice monoculture must be flood fields. The
    field should remain unchanged at least until the beginning of the intermediate
    egret breeding season until the offspring have grown and moved to the wintering
    site. Flooding increases the abundance of food sources and accessibility due to
    suitable water environments and substrate characteristics similar to those of
    natural wetlands. In addition, submerged fields can serve as feeding grounds for
    growing birds until they migrate to wintering sites. This ultimately helps maintain
    the distribution range and population of intermediate egrets (Fasola et al., 1996,
    2010). Finally, lowering the conversion rate of existing rice fields to <40% implies
    that intermediate egrets can continue using >60% of the rice fields flood available
    for food acquisition. Establishing a key management plan for intermediate egrets
    will also help manage populations of other waterbirds. Government effort is also
    required to maintain more than 60% of rice as monoculture fields. Currently, the
    payment system in South Korea provides subsidies for rice production regardless
    of whether it is mono- or double cultivation. However, additional incentives should
    be considered for rice monoculture in the future. As a result of climate change,
    changes in rice cropping methods or cultivated crops and corresponding changes
    in land-use patterns are inevitable; therefore, a balanced policy implementation
    approach is necessary to regulate these changes and preserve intermediate egret
    populations. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Hyung-Kyu Nam conceived the ideas and designed

  description: Co-growing or intercropping means growing two or more crops in the
    same field. The main purpose of intercropping is to obtain more net results from
    an open farm by using resources, and those techniques will not be used to raise
    a single crop. Intercropping-based agriculture makes farming easier to cultivate
    various crops simultaneously. This will be more efficient and time-saving in the
    small portion of land. The possibility of getting yield in two contrasting types
    of crops needs two requirements; proper irrigation and nutrients. An alert system
    for the safety and the physical phenomenon is required, that is why there is a
    need for an autonomous system. The system is capable of irrigating the proper
    amount of water to the different crop variety present in the fields. For this
    consider the other features like climate monitoring and forecasting, smart pest
    management, smart greenhouse, remote crop monitoring, etc. Smart farming helps
    to improve agriculture with techniques to operate, monitor, automate and analyze
    the operations using advanced techniques such as large data, the virtual database
    and internet-based technologies. It is simply a management concept. Smart agriculture,
    in other words, is known as precision agriculture, which works by the coordination
    of many sensors. The increased growth of the global population increases the demand
    for food and with it comes the need for efficient use of natural resources; with
    that said there is also an increase in the usage of sophisticated information
    and communication technologies, thereby resulting in an increasing need for a
    smart climate tracking device. The importance of smart agriculture in daily life
    is increasing exponentially. The plant monitoring system is helpful to water the
    plants and monitor some parameters related to plant growth. This system is widely
    accepted in a few areas such as in tree nurseries and agriculture. The system
    frame contains a potentiometric sensor and physical sensors fixed in the root
    area of plants, and a vibration of frequency sensor is installed in the tank to
    check the water level in the tank. Smart systems have built-in detection, action
    and control capabilities to describe and analyze the situation and make decisions
    based on data available in predictive or adaptive ways, thereby smart actions.
    To execute in most cases, the "smartness" of a system can be attributed to controlling
    the energy efficiency and autonomous operation based on networking capabilities.
    Smart monitoring systems using technologies with internet-connected devices are
    adaptable for monitoring the plants effectively and efficiently. It is also suitable
    for checking the condition of the soil. This can help to get better growth of
    the crops. It may help in controlling the usage of water efficiently. An autonomous
    system (AS) is a set of internet-based connected objects and prefixes that belong
    to a network or group of networks, all managed, controlled and overseen by a single
    entity or organization. The AS uses a common routing policy controlled by the
    entity. This system is capable of monitoring more than two crop varieties at the
    same time and the physical constraints have been accurately defined for efficient
    management of the crop under various conditions. Thus, the requisites of this
    type of agriculture will be given with the data which is a specifically suitable
    parameter for good yield of the specific crop variety, and these will be used
    as the thresholds. The autonomous system will react accordingly to the different
    situations and the system will give a response which is favorable to safeguard
    the specific type of crops. Furthermore, this autonomous system will help the
    different varieties of crops to sustain the situation which otherwise is not suitable
    for that crop variety. Hence, this chapter explores the various techniques and
    methods involved in it and explains how this autonomous system will be capable
    of overcoming these problems which are faced during this type of farming.

  description: The evaluation of irrigation suitability plays a crucial role for the
    socio-economic development of the society, especially in the region of Sundarban.
    For sustainable agricultural practices, groundwater quality must be suitable for
    irrigation; otherwise, it can degrade soil and diminish crop yield. The entropy
    information theory, several irrigational indices, multivariate statistics, GIS,
    and geostatistics are used in this work to evaluate the geographical distribution
    and quality of groundwater in the Indian Sundarban region. In total, 33 groundwater
    samples were collected in 2018 (April and May), and they were evaluated for major
    cations, anions, as well as other parameters like electrical conductivity (EC),
    soluble sodium percentage (SSP), potential salinity (PS), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), Kelly ratio (KR), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), permeability index (PI),
    residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MH), and residual sodium bicarbonate
    (RSBC). The overall trend of the principal cations and anions is in the sequence
    of Na+ ≥ Mg2+ ≥ Ca2+ ≥ K2+ and HCO3− ≥ Cl− ≥ NO3− ≥ SO42− ≥ F−, respectively,
    whereas the spatial variation of %Na, SAR, RSBC, and MH demonstrate very poor
    irrigation water quality, and spatial variation of KR, RSC, SSP, PI, and PS signifies
    that the irrigation water quality is excellent to good. In order to identify the
    specific association and potential source of the dissolved chemical in the groundwater,
    statistical techniques like correlation and principal component analysis were
    also employed. The hydrochemical facies indicates that mixed type makes up the
    bulk (51.51%) of the water samples. Following the Wilcox plot, more than 75% of
    the water samples are good to doubtful; however, by the US salinity hazard map,
    roughly 60.60% of the samples had high salinity (C3-S1 zone). The EWQII reports
    that no samples fall into the very good (no restriction) category, whereas 30.30%,
    30.30%, and 39.40% of the sample wells record good (low restriction), average
    (moderate restriction), and poor (severe restriction) irrigation water quality,
    respectively. Based on this study, the bulk of the groundwater samples taken from
    the study area are unsuitable for cultivation. The findings of this study will
    also help decision-makers develop adequate future plans for irrigation and groundwater
    resource management.

    role for the socio-economic development of the society, especially in the region
    of Sundarban. For sustainable agricultural practices, groundwater quality must
    be suitable for irrigation; otherwise, it can degrade soil and diminish crop yield.
    The entropy information theory, several irrigational indices, multivariate statistics,
    GIS, and geostatistics are used in this work to evaluate the geographical distribution
    and quality of groundwater in the Indian Sundarban region. In total, 33 groundwater

    (India) Article 05 May 2022 Geographic information system-based groundwater quality
    assessment for drinking and irrigation purposes in transboundary aquifers of River
    Ravi, India Article 14 December 2022 Introduction Groundwater is particularly
    crucial for drinking and agricultural functions in an inadequate water resource
    environment (Adimalla et al., 2019; Kiy & Arslan, 2021). Because of the tremendous
    expansion in world population, which has resulted in intensified agricultural
    activity, the necessity for irrigation water is always rising (Barua et al., 2021;
    Thapa et al., 2020). Globally, out of the overall drafted groundwater, about 65%
    is served for drinking, 20% is utilized for irrigation and livestock, and the
    remaining 15% is used for industry and mining (Gugulothu et al., 2022; Saeid et
    al., 2018; Sutradhar & Mondal, 2021). Crop production and yield are severely influenced
    by irrigation. The primary goal of adopting irrigation practices in agriculture
    is to boost crop yield (Foster & Perry, 2010; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2022). Studies
    on groundwater resources are becoming increasingly important for irrigational
    purposes worldwide, which are examined from many perspectives. For example, Kiy
    and Arslan (2021) examined the irrigation water quality in the Black Sea region
    of Turkey’s Corum province using a variety of water quality indices, including
    electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio, permeability index, sodium
    percentage, Langelier saturation index, residual sodium carbonate, magnesium ratio
    (MR), Kelly index (KI), potential salinity (PS), and irrigation water quality
    index (IWQI). Similarly, Rahaman et al. (2014) examined the hydrogeochemical properties
    of groundwater to choose the best irrigation water for Godagari upazila in the
    western part of Bangladesh. In addition to the different aspects of groundwater
    resources that have been researched internationally, the development of work on
    groundwater quality for irrigation in India is also fascinating. In India, a little
    over 89% of groundwater is withdrawn for irrigation, 9% for domestic purposes,
    and 2% for industrial (Margat & van der Gun, 2013). Since 1980, groundwater levels
    in northwestern India have tumbled down from 8 to 16 m below ground level (mbgl),
    while the remainder of the country has dropped from 1 to 8 mbgl (Sekhri, 2013;
    Chidambaram et al., 2022). Subba Rao et al. (2021) claim that as the quality of
    the groundwater declines as a result of both geogenic and non-geogenic activities,
    it will typically no longer be acceptable for anything. India’s east coast, specifically
    the Sundarban region in West Bengal, is crucial. In this area, groundwater is
    a necessary component of a wide range of expanding economic activities (Rani et
    al., 2020). Agriculture is the backbone of Sundarban’s local economy, and the
    majority of the inhabitants rely on a rice-growing system to ensure their livelihood
    security (Rukshana & Mollas, 2021), which was utterly subject to surface water
    or monsoon rainfall before the 1970s. In the 1970s, the Agricultural Revolution
    triggered a rise in the usage of groundwater for irrigation, where year-round
    use of chemical fertilizers and comprehensive groundwater resources increased
    farm production (Suhag, 2016). Intensive irrigation using groundwater could lead
    to both quality and quantity (exploitation) degradation of groundwater resources
    (Foster, 1995). The groundwater is affected by numerous natural factors, such
    as geology and its interplay with groundwater, water flow rate, and duration of
    stay in the aquifer, physicochemical properties of the aquifer’s material, rainfall
    dispersion, and human activity, for instance, landfills, including the utility
    of agro-chemicals (Radstake et al., 1988; Thapa et al., 2017; Zulu et al., 1996).
    Because of toxicity or scarcity, the chemical components of irrigation water can
    directly impact plant development, or indirectly by affecting plant nutrient uptake
    (Ayers & Westcot, 1985; Rahman et al. 2014). As a result, its proper utilization
    in respect of quantity and quality should be ensured (Sarkar & Hassan, 2006; Rahman
    et al., 2014). Thus, knowledge of groundwater quality for irrigational use and
    identifying hydrogeochemical operations are essential for ensuring ecological
    renewability and improvement (Bauder et al., 2004; Pazand et al., 2018). Numerous
    investigations have already been conducted on the hydrochemistry and potential
    of India’s groundwater for irrigation (Aravinthasamy et al., 2021; Barua et al.,
    2021; Hasan & Rai, 2023a, b; Jasmin & Mallikarjuna, 2015; Kamaraj et al., 2021;
    Mukhopadhyay et al., 2022; Ravikumar et al., 2011; Sarkar et al., 2021; Sutradhar
    & Mondal, 2021). Since there has not been a thoroughly investigation in and around
    the Indian Sundarban region to analyze the groundwater quality for irrigational
    use. The Indian Sundarbans are largely found in the coastal tracts of North and
    South 24 Parganas, which comprise a substantial percentage of West Bengal’s coastal
    region and contain a variety of climatic, topographical, and edaphic variables
    (Mitran et al., 2014). The water sources of the coastal Sundarbans reveal the
    complex distribution of fresh water and salty water and the bulk of the water
    resources are saline in nature, which has detrimental consequences on soil and
    plants (Ayers & Westcott, 1985; Burman et al., 2009; Si, 2019). Seawater intrusion,
    evaporation, groundwater interaction with soil created by marine deposition, and
    overutilization of groundwater are the key concerns behind the groundwater quality
    deterioration in this region (Fetter, 1994; Langevin et al., 2007; Todd, 1980).
    Therefore, the present study represents a systematic endeavor to characterize
    groundwater resources for irrigation in the study region. This is achieved by
    integrating entropy information theory, multivariate statistics, geographic information
    systems, and geostatistics to analyze the spatial fluctuations of various irrigation
    quality indices. Furthermore, this research aims to explore the occurrence of
    seawater intrusion using salinity index parameters such as EC, Na%, and SAR. This
    unique approach aims to make a novel contribution by assisting farmers in selecting
    crops based on the level of salinity intensity. Additionally, the study holds
    significant value for policymakers involved in regional development. Therefore,
    the present study aims to achieve the following objectives. (i) Based on information
    entropy theory, estimate whether the research region''s groundwater quality is
    suitable for irrigation. (ii) To apprehend the geochemical properties of the groundwater,
    various indices have been used, such as the soluble sodium percentage (SSP), potential
    salinity (PS), Kelly ratio (KR), Sodium absorption ratio (SAR), permeability index
    (PI), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Magnesium Hazard (MH) and residual sodium
    bicarbonate (RSBC). (iii) To investigate and establish the relationship between
    EWQII (Entropy Water Quality Index for Irrigation) and NDVI (Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index) within the same land area for the purpose of validating the
    sample data. Study area and hydro-geological context The Ganga–Brahmaputra and
    Meghna deltas’ bottom segment is the Indian Sundarban area (Sharma et al., 2010).
    It is surrounded by longitudes 88°10′ to 89°51′ east and latitudes 21°31′ to 22°35′
    north (Fig. 1). It spreads over a 9630 km2 area and from that, swampland and a
    thickheaded mangrove forest cover 4264 km2, while inhabited land covers the remaining
    5366 km2 (Hazra et al., 2002). The Dampier-Hodges line runs through it on the
    north (a visionary boundaries defined in 1831), the Bay of Bengal toward the south,
    the Ichamati-Raimangal rivers toward the east (which also serve as the India-Bangladesh
    borderline), and the Hooghly River to the west (Sahana & Sajjad, 2017; Sahana
    et al., 2021). It is a unique riverine system with 102 islands, 48 of which are
    uninhabited and covered in mangrove forest, and 54 of which are now inhabited.
    The Sundarban area has a tropical climate with a mean annual temperature of 35
    °C, which varies from 20 to 40 °C (winter to summer) depending on the season,
    and with an average annual rainfall of 1667.41–1949.30 mm. Because of its ecological
    services, biological richness, and universal worth, the Indian Sundarban was recently
    assigned as a Ramsar site under the Ramsar Convention in 2020 (Sahana et al.,
    2019). Fig. 1 Study area and sampling points Full size image Identifying the nature
    of hydrological flows and lithological properties that affect groundwater storage
    and recharge requires a thorough grasp of a region’s hydrogeology. The hydrogeological
    structure of the Sundarban region is a complicated and relatively recent origin
    (Bhadra et al., 2020; Gopal & Chauhan, 2006). The deposition of silt, clay, and
    poorly consolidated sand layers carried down by the rivers (Ganga–Brahmaputra)
    that passed through this region is assumed to have formed this shoreline during
    the late Quaternary epoch (Allison et al., 2003).The world’s largest amount of
    sediment is transported to the oceans by the Ganga and the Brahmaputra together
    (Coleman, 1969; Milliman et al., 1995). Lithologically, the Sundarban region is
    categorized into three restricted aquifer zones (Sinha Roy, 2010), disconnected
    hydraulically through 20- to 50-m-thick clay aquitards (Bhadra et al., 2020).
    The upper shallow aquifers occur having a maximum depth of 60 mbgl, which is commonly
    brackish (CGWB, 2006, 2016; Sinha Roy, 2010). The main aquifers are found at a
    depth ranging from 140 to 150 mbgl and are semi-confined to locally unconfined,
    consisting of somewhat salty to saline water. The fresh aquifer, which is found
    between 160 and 400 mbgl and comprised medium to filthy sands with clay and silt
    inter-beds, is considered a deeper aquifer (Halder et al., 2021). The fresh aquifer’s
    hydraulic gradient slopes toward the sea. According to Sinha Roy (2014), the annual
    groundwater flow over shallow and deep aquifers is 11.68 and 18.25 million cubic
    meters (mcm), respectively. Tube wells tapped into fresh deeper aquifers (between
    160 and 300 m bgl) yield roughly 100–120 m3/h for drawdown ranging from 6 to 12
    m, and serve as one of the region’s primary supplies of drinkable water. Materials
    and methods Dataset analysis The hydrochemistry of water is able to examine groundwater
    pollution levels, quality, and geochemical processes (Venkataraman et al., 2015;
    Sivakarun et al., 2020). The parameters for irrigation are determined by the ionic
    composition (cations: Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and anions: Cl-, HCO3−, NO3-, SO42-,
    and F-) of the water since it affects the soil’s characteristics and crop yield
    (Singh et al., 2009). A total of 33 groundwater samples were obtained from the
    Central Groundwater Board (CGWB, 2018) to examine the groundwater resources for
    irrigation. All of the data was taken before to the monsoon season (April and
    May). The groundwater quality factors were determined following the Food and Agricultural
    Organization Standards 1985 (FAO, 1985). Various groundwater quality criteria,
    like the electrical conductivity (EC), potential of hydrogen (pH), total hardness
    (TH), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+),
    potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-),
    and fluoride (F-) were examined. All the criteria are denoted as milligrams per
    liter (mg/L) except EC, which is given in units of μS/cm. The charge balance error
    (CBE) was evaluated using Eq. (1) to estimate the precision of cations (Na+, Ca2+,
    Mg2+, K+) and anions (Cl-, HCO3-, NO3-, SO42-, and F-) measurement in analyzed
    samples. The CBE was found to be within the acceptable range of ± 5 (Deutsch,
    1997; Domenico & Schwartz, 1990). Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics
    for various hydro-chemical parameters. Table 1 Statistically review of the groundwater
    hydro-chemistry Full size table $$\\%CBE= \\frac{(\\sum Cations-\\sum Anions)}{(\\sum
    Cations+\\sum Anions)} \\times 100\\%$$ (1) Methods The suitability of the irrigation
    water has been computed in conjunction with Shannon’s entropy weighted method
    (Shannon, 1948; Hasan & Rai, 2020) and irrigation water quality indices (Kiy &
    Arslan, 2021; Islam et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2019). To generate thematic layers
    from the point data of the hydrochemical parameters, inverse distance weighted
    (IDW) interpolation was used. IDW is a spatial interpolation technique that estimates
    or calculates un-sampled locations from known sampled location points using a
    linear combination function of data points (Rath et al., 2018; Rukhsana & Mollas,
    2021; Hasan et al. 2023). The following parameters were used to determine the
    suitability of the irrigation water: The geochemical facies of the groundwater
    samples were identified using Piper’s diagram. Wilcox (1948) and the USSL diagram
    (1954) were used to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation, while
    Gibbs diagrams are used to identify the main factor in groundwater hydrochemistry.
    To accurately assess how closely associated the various hydrogeochemical parameters
    were, Pearson’s correlation was used, and PCA was used to reduce the data based
    on the geographic similarity between the variables. The methodology is graphically
    represented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Depicts a flow chart explaining the thorough methodology
    used in this paper Full size image Irrigation water quality indices Inferior groundwater
    quality can result in four kinds of issues: salinity, toxicity, water holding
    capacity rate, and multitudinous (Ayers & Westcot, 1985). The irrigation suitability
    of groundwater quality was appraised using salinity hazard (EC) (Wilcox, 1955),
    sodium percentage (Na%) (Wilcox, 1955), soluble sodium percentage (Todd, 1959),
    Kelley’s ratio (Kelly, 1963), sodium absorption ratio (SAR) (USSL, 1954), permeability
    index (PI) (Doneen, 1964), residual sodium carbonate (RSC) (Eaton, 1950), residual
    sodium bicarbonate (RSBC) (Gupta, 1983), potential salinity (Doneen, 1964), and
    magnesium hazard (Raghunath, 1987). The mentioned irrigation parameters are frequently
    utilized in various regions of the globe (Houatmia et al., 2016; Subba Rao, 2018;
    Subba Rao et al., 2021). The subsequent equations have been used to calculate
    them and ionic concentration is measured in milliequivalents per liter (meq/L).
    Salinity hazard was determined from the values of EC. Wilcox (1955) defined classes
    of EC limits, these are low salinity (EC below 250), moderate salinity (EC 250
    to 750), strong salinity (EC 750 to 2250), and extreme salinity (EC above 2250)
    measured in μS/cm. The sodium absorption ratio (SAR) is measured after the following
    equation (Wilcox, 1955): $$SAR=\\frac{{NA}^{+}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{{Ca}^{{2}^{+}}+{Mg}^{{2}^{+}}}}{2}}$$
    (2) The Kelley’s ratio (KR) is computed according to Kelley’s (1940) formula:
    $$KR=\\frac{{Na}^{+}}{{Ca}^{{2}^{+}}+{Mg}^{{2}^{+}}}$$ (3) Residual sodium carbonate
    (RSC) was computed through the formula below (Eaton, 1950): $$RSC=\\left({CO}_{3}^{{2}^{-}}+{HCO}_{3}^{-}\\right)-({Ca}^{{2}^{+}}+{Mg}^{{2}^{+}})$$
    (4) Gupta (1983) defined residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC) as $$RSBC={HCO}_{3}^{-}-{Ca}^{{2}^{+}}$$
    (5) According to Wilcox (1955), sodium percentage (%Na) is expressed as $$\\%NA=\\frac{({Na}^{+}+{K}^{+})}{({Na}^{+}+{{Ca}^{2}}^{+}+{Mg}^{{2}^{+}}+{K}^{+})}\\times
    100$$ (6) Soluble sodium percentage (SSP) was determined through the method proposed
    by Todd (1959) as follows: $$SSP=\\frac{{Na}^{+}}{({Na}^{+}+{{Ca}^{2}}^{+}+{Mg}^{{2}^{+}}+{K}^{+})}\\times
    100$$ (7) The permeability index (PI) was obtained applying the following formula
    (Doneen, 1964): $$PI=\\frac{{Na}^{+}+\\sqrt{{HCO}_{3}^{-}}}{({Ca}^{{2}^{+}}+{Mg}^{{2}^{+}}+{Na}^{+})}\\times
    100$$ (8) The magnesium absorption ratio (MAR), commonly known as the magnesium
    hazard (MH), was measured by the below equation (Raghunath, 1987): $$MH=\\frac{({Mg}^{2+})}{{(Ca}^{{2}^{+}}+{Mg}^{{2}^{+}})}\\times
    100$$ (9) Potential salinity (PS) values were determined by using the following
    equation (Doneen, 1964): $$PS={Cl}^{-}+\\frac{1}{2}{SO}_{4}^{{2}^{-}}$$ (10) Entropy-weighted
    water quality index for irrigation (EWQII) Shannon (1948) invented the idea of
    information entropy. In this study, Shannon’s entropy algorithm (1948) was employed
    in this work to calculate the weighting factor of each parameter owing to its
    user-friendliness, precision, and trustworthiness (Li et al., 2010; Rehman et
    al., 2022; Wu et al., 2011). Based on the notion of probability theory, Shannon
    entropy makes use of the perceived significance of properties for the general
    information provided to the judgment (Hasan & Rai, 2020). As a result, the EWQII
    method is more reliable than the standard. The following stages are used to compute
    the EWQII following Lee and Chang (2018). Step 1: Formation of a substantial data
    array of alternates employing average values (X), $$X=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}{x}_{11}&
    {x}_{12}& \\cdots & {x}_{1n}\\\\ {x}_{21}& {x}_{22}& \\cdots & {x}_{2n }\\\\ \\vdots
    & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ {x}_{m1 }& {x}_{m2}& \\cdots & {x}_{mn}\\end{array}\\right]$$
    (11) Step 2: Enumeration of the standardized matrix of decisions (rij) and information
    entropy (ej) by the following equations: $${r}_{ij}=\\frac{{X}_{ij}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{X}_{ij}}and{e}_{j}=-\\frac{1}{ln(m)}{\\sum
    }_{i=1}^{m}{r}_{ij}ln({r}_{ij})$$ (12) Step3: Determination of relative weight
    (wj) $${w}_{j }=\\frac{1 -{ e}_{j}}{{\\sum }_{j=1}^{n}(1 -{e}_{j})}$$ (13) Step
    4: According to Hasan and Rai (2020), the entropy weighted water quality index
    for irrigation (EWQII) allows expressing using the following equation: $$EWQII={\\sum
    }_{j=1}^{n}{(w}_{j}\\times {q}_{j})={\\sum }_{j=1}^{n}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1-{e}_{j}}{{\\sum
    }_{j=1}^{n}\\left(1-{e}_{j}\\right)}\\right)\\right.\\times \\left(\\frac{{C}_{j}}{{S}_{j}}\\times
    100\\right)\\left.\\begin{array}{c}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\right)$$ (14)
    where Cj is the noticed intensity of chemical parameters; Sj is a quality rating
    scale permitted extremity of irrigation water as defined by FAO guidelines. The
    EWQII has been classified as very good quality (below 25), good quality (between
    25 and 50), average quality (between 50 and 75), and poor quality (above 75) (Singh
    et al., 2019). Analysis of data and statistics Pearson’s correlation coefficient
    is used with OriginPro 23.0 software to identify the correspondence between two
    physio-chemical variables (Islam et al., 2017). Correlation coefficient values
    vary between + 1 and − 1, with perfect correlation defined as a correlation coefficient
    value close to + 1 (Thilagavathi et al., 2017). The principal component analysis
    (PCA) is frequently used to quantify the interaction across all sample data and
    to restrict the data to foundational components while retaining as much information
    as possible (Belkhiri & Narany, 2015). Its purposes are to make data easier to
    analyze and interpret, as well as to deduce the inherent geogenic and anthropogenetic
    factors that influence the quality of groundwater (Islam et al., 2017). The SPSS
    version 21.0 software is used to execute PCA in the current investigation utilizing
    varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization (with eigenvalues > 1). Results Chemical
    composition of ground water The assessment findings of the hydro-chemical characteristics
    of groundwater samples in the research region are listed in Table 1. The measurements
    of pH range from 7.38 to 8.66 (Fig. 3a), with a mean value of 8.08, indicating
    the water samples contain a slightly neutral to alkaline nature. The entire pH
    levels were within the irrigation water thresholds of 6.5–8.5 (FAO, 1985), aside
    from five samples (sample wells 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12), which had a pH value of above
    8.5, exceeding the permissible limit. Fig. 3 Spatial representation of different
    groundwater hydrochemistry: a pH, b EC, c TDS, and d TH, e sodium, f magnesium,
    g calcium, h potassium, i bicarbonate, j chloride, k nitrate, l sulfate, and m
    fluoride Full size image The EC of groundwater fluctuates notably and spans from
    597 to 4046 μS/cm (Fig. 3b), whose average value is 1286.76 μS/cm. Among the 33
    samples, only sample wells 21 have shown an EC concentration above the permissible
    limit of 3000 (FAO, 1985). TDS values varied from 364.81 to 3946.24 mg/L (Fig.
    3c), with an average concentration of 661.74 mg/L. A few numbers of samples (sample
    wells 21 and 28) displayed TDS values crossing the FAO acceptable margin of 2000
    mg/L. The range of TH (as CaCO3) values discovered was 75–395 mg/L (Fig. 3d),
    with a mean of 213.64 and a standard deviation of 85.64 mg/L. The entire sample
    wells of TH value were within the FAO permissible limit of irrigation (FAO, 1985),
    which denotes that the groundwater is portrayed by non-carbonated hardness (Chow,
    1964; Rao et al., 2021). The concentrations of cations in groundwater takes place
    in the order specified: Na+  ≥ Mg2+  ≥ Ca2+  ≥ K2+. The concentrations of sodium
    (Fig. 3e) and magnesium (Fig. 3f) were within the limits of 52.75 to 660.50 and
    4 to 69 mg/L, respectively. Throughout the 33 sample wells, sodium concentrations
    exhibited inside the permissible limit of 900 mg/L, while 9.09% (sample wells
    10, 25, and 26) had high magnesium intensities that exceeded the tolerable limit
    of 60 mg/L (FAO, 1985). The concentrations of calcium (Fig. 3g) and potassium
    (Fig. 3h) vary from 8 to 112 mg/L and 1.90 to 51 mg/L, respectively. All the 33
    sample wells of calcium are considered to be within the allowable ranges of 400
    mg/L (FAO, 1985), whereas almost all the sample wells (except sample wells 5 and
    3) we observed had potassium values that were higher than the permitted limit
    of 2 (FAO, 1985). Bicarbonate is the predominant anion, with subsequent chlorides,
    nitrates, sulfates, and fluoride and their concentrations ranged between, respectively,
    170.80 and 811.30 (Fig. 3i), 21.27 to 999.69 (Fig. 3j), 0 to 24 (Fig. 3k), 0 to
    37.81 (Fig. 3l), and 0.02 to 1.14 (Fig. 3m). All the 33 sample wells showed a
    bicarbonate, chlorides, sulfates, and fluoride concentration within the FAO allowable
    limit of 600 mg/L, 1100 mg/L, 1000 mg/L, and 1.5 mg/L, respectively. As all the
    sample wells except nitrates of these anions concentrations are demonstrated within
    the limits allowed, the study area were having little bit low concern about aforesaid
    anions. Ion exchange Although it is hard to control the dissolution of undesired
    elements in water during subsurface effluent, it is inevitable to understand the
    many modifications in chemical composites that groundwater undergoes in the course
    of its flowing in the subsurface (Johnson, 1979; Sastri, 1994). The exchange of
    ions within the aquifer and its host circumstances throughout the time of stay
    or travel, as postulated by Schoeller, is substantially shown by the chloro-alkaline
    indices CAI-1 and CAI-2 (1965, 1967, and 1977). Equations (15) and (16) are commonly
    used to express the two indices (Li et al., 2012), at which concentrations are
    in meq/L: $$\\mathrm{CAI }1=\\frac{{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}-({\\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+{\\mathrm{K}}^{+})}{{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}}$$
    (15) $$\\mathrm{CAI }2=\\frac{{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}-({\\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+{\\mathrm{K}}^{+})}{({\\mathrm{SO}}_{4}^{{2}^{-}}+{\\mathrm{HCO}}_{3}^{-}+{\\mathrm{CO}}_{3}^{{2}^{-}}+{\\mathrm{NO}}_{3}^{-})}$$
    (16) Positive CAI imply a direct base (cation–anion) exchange mechanism that occurs
    once Na+ and K+ ions within groundwater switched places by Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions
    in aquifer constituents. When the event of an opposite ion exchange, both indices
    become negative as well as the exchange remains indirect, suggesting a chloro-alkaline
    mismatch or imbalance (Chidambaram et al., 2012). Most samples (75.76%) of the
    aquifer were found negative indices (Fig. 4) with an oblique base reaction process,
    that demonstrated substitution of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in water had swapped the Na+ and
    K+ inside the parent rocks. Fig. 4 Box-plot diagram showing variation of CAI-1
    and CAI-2 for the sampled wells Full size image Variation of irrigation water
    quality indices for crop growth appraisal The chemistry of groundwater and how
    it affects the crops and soil determines how well it is suitable for irrigation
    (Richards, 1954; Singh et al., 2015). In this investigation, the Wilcox diagram
    (1948) and the US Salinity Laboratory (USSL) diagram (1954) were used to determine
    the appropriateness of groundwater for irrigation, as well as 10 distinct indices.

    variability maps. Table 2 Categorization of irrigation suitability indices and

    The EC is a marker of the soluble ions within water since it often indicates the
    salt concentration in the water (Bozdağ, 2014). Groundwater with an EC value of
    below 250 μS/cm is considered excellent, between 250 and 750 μS/cm is good, between
    750 and 2250 μS/cm is doubtful, and beyond 2250 μS/cm is designated as unsuitable
    for irrigation, as previously stated (Wilcox, 1955). The current study discovered
    that EC concentrations vary from 597 to 4046 μS/cm (Fig. 3b and Table 2), with
    an average value of 1286.76 μS/cm. In accordance with the spatial variability
    of the EC, Fig. 3b shows that 81.82% and 6.06% of the samples are rated as doubtful
    or dubious and unsuitable, respectively, while only 12.12% of the samples taken
    are regarded as good. None of the groundwater sources, nevertheless, received
    an excellent rating (Table 2). According to Sys et al. (1993), the irrigation
    salinity threshold values for the most widely grown crops in the region are rice
    (4000 μS/cm), pulses (3000 μS/cm), oilseeds (7000 μS/cm), potato (5000 μS/cm),
    red chili (4500 μS/cm), and vegetables (6500 μS/cm). Among the most significant
    indicators of irrigation compatibility for identifying salt or alkali dangers
    is SAR (Bhunia et al., 2018). The soil gets harder and less permeable when sodium
    replaces Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the soil (Kaur et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2018). In the
    research area, the total SAR value varied from 1.36 to 25.47 meq, with an average
    value of 6.26 meq (Table 2). Approximately 84.89% of the samples collected in
    the studied region were considered excellent (SAR =  < 10 meq), 9.09% were good
    (10–18 meq), and the remaining 6.06% fell into the doubtful (18–26 meq) category
    for irrigation (Table 2 and Fig. 5a). In irrigation waters, the optimal KR value
    needs to be no higher than 1 meq (Kelly, 1963). KR has a range of 0.34 meq to
    14.64 meq with an average value of 2.56 meq as well as a standard deviation of
    3.0 meq in the study region (Table 2). Figure 5b shows a KR of 1 meq or less is
    present in around 24.24% of the samples, making them irrigation ready. Approximately
    36.36% of the samples indicate marginally acceptable for irrigation, while the
    remaining 39.39% are unsuitable (Table 2). RSC concentration in the Sundarban
    region ranges from − 5.16 to 13.99 meq, with an average of 2.48 meq (Table 2).
    For residual sodium carbonate, three classifications have been established: good
    (below 5 meq), doubtful (5– 10 meq), and unsuitable (above 10 meq). Only 3.03%
    of samples are judged unsuitable, while 9.09% are deemed doubtful and 87.88% are
    considered good quality for irrigation (Table 2 and Fig. 5c). The water samples
    that were examined for RSBC exhibited values ranging from − 1.21 to 12.90 meq,
    with a mean of 4.92 meq (Table 2). Gupta (1983) divided RSBC values into three
    categories: satisfactory (below 5 meq), marginal (5 to 10 meq), and unsatisfactory
    (above 10 meq). For irrigational purposes, 54.55% of samples are satisfactory,
    42.42% are marginal, and only 3.03% are unsuitable (Table 2 and Fig. 5d). Crop
    production is affected by how the soil and the Na% in water respond to modify
    the permeability and aeration of the soil (Vasanthavigar et al., 2010). As per
    statistical analysis, the value of %Na has a mean value of 61.73 and a range of
    25.95 to 93.62 (Table 2). Water with beneath 20% Na is excellent for irrigation,
    followed by water with 20–40% good, 40–60% permissible, 60–80% dubious or doubtful,
    and water with more than 80% unsafe (Tanvir Rahman et al., 2014; Wilcox, 1955).
    Table 2 indicates that the excellent quality water sample is completely absent,
    while the good quality irrigational water sample is concentrated at only 6.06%.
    In addition, in contrast to the bulk of the samples collected (45.46%) fall through
    into permissible range, 15.15% and 33.33% of the samples taken settle into the
    unsafe and doubtful categories regarding irrigation use, respectively (Fig. 5e).
    The SSP is a crucial measure for grading irrigation water according to soil permeability
    (Singh et al., 2019). Groundwater containing SSP levels less than 60 is considered
    good for irrigation; however, levels greater than 60 are unsuitable for irrigation
    (Todd, 1959). SSP has a mean of 59.82 and a range of 25.23 to 93.41 (Table 2).
    In accordance with SSP’s spatial variation, 51.52% of the samples have been considered
    suitable for irrigation, while 48.48% are not (Table 2 and Fig. 5f). The PI was
    used to calculate the soil’s ability to flow water relying on the proportions
    of HCO3−, Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+ (Chidambaram et al., 2022). When a PI value of 75
    or more is regarded as good, 25 to 75 is considered marginal, and 25 or lower
    is not suited for irrigation (Donnen, 1964). The PI levels varied from 41.09 to
    111.88, with an average value of 84.02 (Table 2). Figure 5g and Table 2 explain
    that the spatial variance of the PI indicates that 69.70% of the samples are deemed
    good, 30.30% as marginal, and none of the test samples were determined to be unsuitable
    in terms of the PI. Groundwater MH values trigger the soil to turn alkaline, which
    reduces agricultural production (Gautam et al., 2015). If the MH value is greater
    than 50%, the water is hazardous and should not be used for irrigation (Raghunath,
    1987). With a mean of 60.53%, the MH values for the examined samples ranged from
    12.95 to 85.85%. Furthermore, only 18.18% of the samples remain suitable for irrigation,
    whereas the remaining samples are unsuitable. (Table 2 and Fig. 5h). PS was utilized
    to estimate the quality of estuary irrigation water in particular (Ahmed et al.,
    2020), with values under 5 are regarded as excellent to good, values within 5
    to 10 considered good to injurious, and values greater than 15 considered injurious
    to unsatisfactory for irrigation (Donnen, 1964). In this investigation, the average
    PS content in water samples was 6.43 meq, with amounts fluctuating from 0.61 to
    28.26 meq (Table 2). In accordance with Table 2 and Fig. 5i, only 12.12% of samples
    are awful or injurious to unsatisfactory in support of irrigation, compared to
    54.55% that are excellent to good and 33.33% that are good to harmful or injurious.
    Wilcox diagram The Wilcox diagram (1955) is a diagramming technique that also
    categorizes the key properties of hydrochemical compounds and displays water appropriateness
    in irrigation with reference to the solubility of salts and its impact on crops
    and soil (Mousazadeh et al., 2018). Irrigation water is divided into five groups
    in Wilcox’s plot: excellent to good, good to permissible or legal, permissible
    to doubtful or dubious, doubtful to unsuitable, and unsuitable. Figure 6a depicts
    the results for 33 samples: 2 (6.06%) samples are excellent to good, 13 (39.39%)
    samples are good to permissible, 12 (36.36%) samples are acceptable to doubtful,
    4 (12.12%) samples are doubtful to unsuitable, and 2 (6.06%) samples are inappropriate
    for irrigational usage. Fig. 6 Measuring the quality of irrigation water a sodium
    percent vs. EC and b sodium hazard vs. salinity hazard (after Wilcox 1955) Full
    size image USSL diagram Plotting the EC and SAR values of water on the USSL graph
    (Fig. 6b) allows for a much more in-depth investigation of groundwater suitability
    for irrigation (Richards, 1954). As stated in the USSL diagram (Fig. 6b), the
    largest of the groundwater sources (60.60%) are within the C3S1 zone, revealing
    a high salinity/low sodium form, implying that the water may be used for plants
    that survive modest concentrations of salt (Balasubramani et al., 2020). On the
    other hand, 6.06% of groundwater sources are labeled as C3S1, signaling a high-salinity/high-sodium
    type, and 15.15% are classified as C3S2, showing a high-salinity/moderate-sodium
    type. Additionally, 6.06% of said samples were classified as C2S1, demonstrating
    that modest salinity tolerance crops may be cultivated and water is possible to
    use when only minor leaching arises. Furthermore, 9.09% and 3.03% of the samples
    were classified as C4S4 and C4S3, indicating a high salinity/very high sodium
    type as well as a very high salinity/high sodium type, correspondingly, necessitating
    special salinity corrective actions (Balasubramani et al., 2020). Irrigation suitability
    assessment based on EWQII The EWQII was employed to estimate groundwater suitability
    for irrigation, and the findings are shown in Table 3, while the categorization
    is shown in Fig. 7. EWQII levels in the Sundarban area differ from 26.59 to 371.38,
    with a mean of 90.49 and a standard deviation of around 76.98 (Table 2). According
    to Singh et al. (2019), the EWQII range is divided into four classes: very good
    (< 25), good (25–50), average (50–75), and poor (> 75) (Table 2). According to
    the EWQII, 30.30%, 30.30%, and 39.40% of the sample wells, respectively, record
    good (low restriction), average (moderate restriction), and poor (severe restriction)
    irrigation water quality, while no samples fall into the very good (no restriction)
    category (Table 2 and Fig. 7). Sample 30 (Rajnagar) has the lowest entropy value
    (excellent quality of water), whereas sample 28 has the highest (poor quality
    of water) (Khanrapara) (Table 3) (Kumar & Augustine, 2021). Table 3 Performance
    of groundwater peculiarity for irrigation using EWQII Full size table Fig. 7 Scatterplot
    displays the sample-based EWQII values and categorization Full size image The
    spatial variance of EWQII demonstrates that the quality of groundwater has been
    disseminated differently across the research region (Fig. 8). The maps of geographical
    allocation reveal a progressive tendency from southwest to northeast, despite
    the absence of very good irrigational water quality in the study location (Fig.
    8). In isolated small patches, good (EWQII: 25–50) irrigational water quality
    is recorded in Taki, Rajapur, Uttarpara, Baghirula, Sarberia, Nalia-Khali, Akratala,
    Natunhat, Bakultala, Raidighi, Malancha, and Rajnagar, while several sampling
    sites like Haroa, Bhebia, Sandaler Bill, Chowmoha, Sandeshkhali, Bayermari, Goiler
    More (Kalidanga), Jalabaria, and Ambikanagar have average (EWQII: 50–75) irrigational
    sources, they are situated in the northeastern and middle portion of the Sundarban
    region. Additionally, the remaining portion of the research region (enormously)
    possesses water of poor quality for irrigation, which could be influenced by anthropogenic
    factors and salt water intrusion and for which results in higher concentrations
    of TDS, Na+, Mg2+, Cl− than that of other pollutant concentrations (Sarkar & Islam,
    2021; Subba Rao, 2018). Fig. 8 Spatial variation of suitability of groundwater
    based on EWQII Full size image Spatial correlation between NDVI and EWQII The
    relationship between groundwater and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index)
    is of significant interest in understanding the influence of groundwater on vegetation
    health (Aldakheel, 2011). Higher groundwater levels or good groundwater quality
    can potentially contribute to increased vegetation growth and higher NDVI values,
    indicating healthier and more vibrant vegetation (Zohary & Hopf, 2000). Attempting
    to delineate the relationship between the EWQII and NDVI of the same land serves
    the purpose of validating sample data and uncovering significant findings. Figure
    9 clearly demonstrates that higher NDVI values are associated with lower EWQII
    or the presence of good groundwater quality, except in waterlogged areas and rivers
    where no definite relationship could be established. Additionally, as depicted
    in Fig. 9, average groundwater quality corresponds to moderate NDVI values, while
    poor groundwater quality corresponds to low NDVI values. Fig. 9 Spatial relationships
    between NDVI and EWQII: a good groundwater quality demonstrates high NDVI value;
    b average groundwater quality demonstrates moderate NDVI value; c poor groundwater
    quality demonstrate low NDVI value Full size image In order to determine the spatial
    correlation between NDVI and EWQII, a total of 300 sample points were extracted
    from both images using ArcGIS software. These sample points were used to investigate
    the spatial relationships between the two variables. The results of the regression
    analysis indicate a generally negative correlation between NDVI and EWQII. This
    is evident from the correlation graph (Fig. 10), where it can be observed that
    as EWQII increases (indicating poorer groundwater quality), the NDVI tends to
    decrease. Fig. 10 The regression line and scatter plots depict the relationship
    between NDVI and EWQII Full size image Discussion Hydrochemical facies Piper diagram
    Piper trilinear diagrams were frequently utilized to understand the hydrogeochemical
    environment of a studied region (Gao et al., 2019; Piper, 1944). A Piper trilinear
    diagram of the Indian Sundarban area was generated using Origin Pro 2023 software,
    which is shown in Fig. 11. There is one diamond and two triangles in this diagram.
    In terms of cations (left triangle), the bulk of the samples are concentrated
    in sections D (sodium and potassium types) and B (no dominant type), while anions
    are largely concentrated in the lower right angled triangle’s regions E (bicarbonate
    types) and G (chloride types) which suggests that carbonate-dominated rocks are
    weathered (Gao et al., 2020). A “diamond field” is a graphical depiction of groundwater’s
    general features. Within that field, circles are used to represent TDS concentration;
    the larger the circumference of the circle, the greater the TDS value (Sutradhar
    & Mondal, 2021). In this field, 12.12% of water samples are distributed in zone
    5 (HCO3−–Ca2+, Mg2+ type), 27.27% of water samples are concentrated in zone 7
    (Cl−–Na+ type), 9.09% of water samples are accounted in zone 8 (HCO3−–Na+ type),
    and the maximum of said water samples (51.51%) circulate in zone 9 (mixed type).
    Fig. 11 Piper trilinear diagram of groundwater samples Full size image Gibbs diagram
    Three variables typically regulate groundwater chemistry: evaporation, rock-water
    co-action, and atmospheric precipitation (Gibbs, 1970). Gibbs diagrams are frequently
    employed to pinpoint the dominant factor in groundwater hydrochemistry (Gao et
    al., 2020). Gibbs diagrams depicting two plots as a function of TDS: ratio 1 (Fig.
    12a) with cations Na+/(Na+ + Ca2+) as well as ratio 2 (Fig. 12b) for anions Cl−/
    (Cl−  + HCO3−). The masses of groundwater sources in the research region are situated
    within the upper middle part, denoting that rock weathering and evaporation are
    the main factors affecting the major ion composition of the groundwater, as illustrated
    in Fig. 12a, b. The Gibbs diagram shows that when TDS rises, sodium and chloride
    dissolve, causing groundwater samples to switch from the rock dominance sector
    to the evaporation sector (Ndoye et al., 2018). Agricultural fertilizers and irrigation
    return flows, which are anthropogenic operations, continue to raise Na+ and Cl−
    and, consequently, TDS, resulting in an effect on evaporation (Ravikumar et al.,
    2011; Zhang et al., 2019). Fig. 12 Gibbs variation plots for groundwater samples
    Full size image Multivariate statistical evaluation Pearson’s correlation In this
    case, Pearson’s correlation has been employed to properly determine how closely
    related the various hydrogeochemical parameters were (Fig. 13). A correlation
    coefficient (r) value below 0.5 indicates a weak correlation, one between 0.5
    and 0.7 shows a moderate correlation, and a value greater than 0.7 indicates a
    strong correlation between two parameters (Shyu et al., 2011). Fig. 13 Pearson
    correlation matrices of irrigational groundwater hydrochemistry Full size image
    Figure 13 displays the significant positive correlations between EC and TDS (0.70),
    Na+ (0.93), Cl− (0.94), Cl− and TDS (0.80), and Na+ (0.80). The significant positive
    association among EC and TDS suggests that no charged less-soluble molecules in
    water could increase to total dissolved solids (Datta & Tyagi, 1996). The notion
    that the chemistry of groundwater is driven forward by the dissolving of evaporates/involvement
    of saline causes is supported by the significant positive interaction between
    Na+ and Cl− ions (Thilagavathi et al., 2017). The remarkable correlation with
    other ions and Cl− implies that secondary salts are being leached and that saline
    sources are contributing (Khan et al., 2020). A modest correlation has been found
    among TDS and Na+ (0.67), K2+ (0.50), Ca2+ and TH (0.62), K2+ (0.59), and Na+
    and HCO3− (0.64). Chemical weathering is indicated by the substantial correlation
    of HCO3− with Na+ (Chidambaram et al., 2008). The pH, Mg2+, HCO3−, and NO3− have
    a negative correlation with the other maximum parameters which reveals the geogenic
    basis (Jayakumar & Siraz, 1997). PCA analysis PCA was carried out in the current
    study using varimax rotation and orthogonal Kaiser Normalization. Kaiser suggested
    limiting the set of factors to those with eigenvalues > 1 (Liu et al., 2003).
    The screeplot (Fig. 14) can also be used to quantify the number of significant
    eigenvalues (Cattell, 1966). After 6 iterations, five factors (Table 4) with eigenvalues ≥ 1
    that accounted for a total variance of 84.41% appeared. Significant principal
    component loadings have been regarded for those whose absolute value was I0.5I
    (bold in Table 4). Fig. 14 Scree plot of the PCA’s eigenvalues Full size image
    Table 4 Principal component eigenvalues with varimax rotation component loading
    Full size table PC1 accounts for approximately 31.23% of overall variation, with
    EC, Na+, Cl−, and TDS having larger positive loadings. The above element perfectly
    illustrates that the saline repository is the source of the Na+ and Cl− throughout
    the research site (Ruiz et al., 1990; Voudouris et al., 1997), while EC and TDS
    suggest the effects of the aquifer’s geological components’ mineralizations (Khanoranga
    & Khalid, 2019). PC2 explains approximately 23.43% of entire variances, indicating
    high loading of Ca2+, HCO3−, and K+. The 3rd PC (PC3) is positively loaded with
    Mg2+ and TH, explaining for 13.46% of total variance. The dissolving of calcite
    through carbonic acid is the natural origin of the ions, as explained by the Ca2+
    and Mg2+ factors (Islam et al., 2017), while the dissolving of carbonate rock
    is the principal source of HCO3− ions in water (Avdullahi et al., 2013). PC4 has
    a total variance of 8.48%, with NO3− and SO42− dominating primarily. The NO3−
    is formed by leaching of NO3−along with percolate water as a result of numerous
    agricultural activities, including the widespread usage chemical fertilizers and
    pesticides in the research areas (Amiri et al., 2014), whereas SO42− is derived
    from saline water (Khan et al., 2020). With a variance of 7.81%, PC5 exhibits
    pH and F− loadings, indicating the acidic medium’s aggressive nature in ion dissolving
    as well as rock weathering containing fluoridated minerals (Hasan & Rai, 2020;
    Khan et al., 2020). Study implications: unveiling the findings and policy Groundwater
    quality greatly affects crop production. Suitable water quality promotes high
    yields, while poor water quality hampers crop growth due to irrigation challenges
    (Mahammad et al., 2022). For instance, salinity hampers salt intake by plants,
    while sodium hazards limit water circulation in plants (Aravinthasamy et al.,
    2020; Sarkar et al., 2021). In the context of the Sundarban region, both the results
    of irrigational indices and the EWQII strongly point toward an inadequacy of groundwater
    resources for irrigation purposes. Sarkar et al. (2021) highlighted the lack of
    groundwater for irrigation, especially near the coastal areas including the Sundarban
    region. Seawater intrusion into shallow aquifers diminishes cropping intensity,
    productivity, and agricultural income, while increasing production costs and food
    insecurity in West Bengal’s coastal region. Furthermore, Sahana et al. (2019)
    have observed an ongoing process of land salinization, which poses a significant
    threat to the communities in the region. Similarly, a similar situation can be
    observed in the eastern part of the Bengal basin, located in Bangladesh. Hossain
    et al. (2018) demonstrated that around 27–28% of farmers in coastal Bangladesh
    suffer severe consequences from the intrusion of salinity on their vegetable and
    cereal crops. Additionally, Das et al. (2015) emphasized the scarcity of fresh
    surface and groundwater, resulting in a decline in agricultural production and
    a major threat to food security for 87% of the local population. Burman et al.
    (2015) also reported cases of farmers experiencing reduced yields of boro rice
    due to the high salinity of irrigation water. Furthermore, Hasan and Rai (2023a,
    b) quantified that the irrigation water quality in the upper northern and middle
    regions exhibits very good groundwater quality for irrigation, while the lower
    southern part of the Lower Ganges basin demonstrates satisfactory good groundwater
    quality for irrigation. The study area is renowned for agriculture, especially
    rice cultivation, requiring significant irrigation, particularly during the lean
    season (Rabi cultivation). Thus, declining groundwater quality adversely affects
    rice production and poses challenges to the socio-economic conditions. Therefore,
    continuous monitoring and analysis are crucial for conserving irrigation water.
    Restricting pesticide and fertilizer use can reduce groundwater pollution, while
    promoting rainwater harvesting replenishes groundwater and reverses deterioration.
    This investigation on the EWQII provides a vital assessment for farmers, regional
    planners, and stakeholders managing water resources and farming practices in the
    Sundarban region. Conclusion The principal chosen occupancy in the Indian Sundarban
    region is agriculture. Crop yield as well as productivity is directly influenced
    by the quality of the groundwater used during irrigation. As a result, groundwater
    quality needs to be constantly inspected. Thus, an effort is made to define groundwater
    resources by using irrigation along with the spatial fluctuation of varying irrigational
    quality indices in the study region by integrating entropy information theory,
    multivariate statistics, geographic information systems, and geo-statistics. It
    is worth noting that the groundwater in the Sundarban region is susceptible to
    salinization, supported by the US salinity hazard map, indicating that approximately
    60.60% of the samples exhibit high salinity levels. According to the EWQI for
    irrigation, 30.30% of samples are of good quality, 30.30% (average) of samples
    require moderate limits before use, and 39.40% (poor) of samples require severe
    restrictions before use in agricultural operations. In addition, seawater intrusion,
    evaporation, sea level rise, and groundwater overexploitation are the key concerns
    behind the widespread worsening in groundwater resources. The study’s analytical
    findings have the potential to provide valuable insights to planners regarding
    the irrigation hazards prevalent in the area, including salinity and permeability
    risks in agriculture. This knowledge can guide the implementation of effective
    policies such as introducing salt-tolerant crops, devising suitable crop calendars,
    and developing efficient freshwater irrigation systems. By adopting these measures,
    crop productivity and sustainability can be significantly enhanced. Furthermore,
    the study’s analytical findings offer valuable insights for planners to understand
    the irrigation hazards present in this area, such as salinity and permeability
    risks in agriculture. This knowledge enables the implementation of effective policies,
    including the introduction of salt-tolerant crops, the establishment of suitable
    crop calendars, and the development of efficient freshwater irrigation systems.
    These measures aim to enhance crop productivity and sustainability. Therefore,
    the study’s results hold great significance for policymakers and local authorities
    who need to take preventive actions against groundwater quality deterioration
    and ensure food security. The results also contribute to the achievement of the
    United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN-SDG) agenda by 2030. Availability

  description: Lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) is a widely grown perennial legume worldwide
    which can provide high biomass and protein yields, biological N fixation, deep
    soil water extraction and a range of ecosystems services relevant to current and
    future agricultural systems. The potential to expand lucerne beyond its current
    cultivated areas in New Zealand, and its potential productivity across the country's
    contrasting climate zones, are currently unknown. To gain such insights, we estimated
    land suitability and spatial distribution of lucerne above-ground biomass across
    New Zealand lands considering contrasting growth conditions (rain-fed or irrigated
    for different soils types) and two simulation methods of different complexity
    (process- and GIS-based approaches). This aimed to assess yield-estimate spatial
    patterns and sensitivity to model selection for a wide range of combinations of
    water supply (i.e. irrigation and soil water storage) across New Zealand climate
    zones. For example, highly suitable areas for lucerne cultivation, were estimated
    in ∼21 thousand km2 when considering the exclusion of steep slopes, poor soil
    drainage and excess annual rainfall. The two crop-yield models were applied in
    response to 30 years of daily historical (1971–2000) weather data downscaled at
    5 km resolution on suitable areas. Simulated average lucerne yields ranged from
    ∼4.5–28 t dry matter/ha per year. Simulations showed a distinct spatial pattern
    of yield decline from north to south, mainly in response to decreasing temperatures.
    Temporally, water limited yields were up to 4-fold more variable than under irrigation,
    depending on the degree of drought stress across different years. Results also
    unveiled systematic spatial patterns of model uncertainty quantified as yield
    sensitivity to model selection. For instance, simulated yields were most sensitive
    to model selection (6–31% of total variability, Ti) within high abiotic-stress
    environments (e.g. low temperature and limited water supply). Overall, soil type
    selection accounted for most of yield variability (58–78% Ti), being particularly
    important in warmer environments with variable seasonal rainfall regimes (e.g.
    northern regions). As expected, water supply (i.e. rain-fed or irrigated systems)
    was relatively more impactful on yield (8–20% Ti) for limited rainfall areas,
    where crops are most drought prone (e.g. east coast and central southern regions).
    Long-term regional scale comparisons of annual lucerne yield, between 30-year
    simulated distributions and point-based observations from the AgYields database,
    helped identify hotspots of yield overestimation. Such insights are useful to
    guide future research on high yield gap areas (e.g. southern colder and drier
    locations) and highlight key areas for model improvement (e.g. representation
    of multiple biotic stresses). Overall, our results provide a first gridded-model
    assessment of lucerne suitability and yield at national scale and quantify the
    share of variability explained by key climatic, management and methodological
    components in spatial analysis studies. These insights can inform future modelling
    efforts and support agricultural planning that considers the expansion of lucerne
    and other perennial legumes.

    content Highlights • Perennial forage legumes are underrepresented in gridded
    modelling assessments. • We apply gridded modelling to assess potential to expand
    lucerne in New Zealand. • A north to south yield decline gradient was found with
    contrasting model approaches. • Process- and a GIS-based model diverged mostly
    under multiple/high stress locations. • These results can inform future model

    crops and legumes have been identified as key strategies to improve environmental
    sustainability of future agricultural systems (Cusworth et al., 2021, Sheaffer
    and Seguin, 2003, Stagnari et al., 2017). Globally, lucerne (Medicago sativa L.)
    is the most broadly cultivated perennial legume, with an estimated area of around
    30 million ha (Monfreda et al., 2008, Moot et al., 2012). Its presence spans contrasting
    climate zones and agricultural production systems of different intensity of production
    (Michaud et al., 1988, Moot et al., 2012). The crop is mainly used to support
    livestock production but novel uses, such as for bioenergy and protein extraction,
    have recently been explored (Bouton, 2012, Filippa et al., 2020). The competitiveness
    of lucerne as a forage is explained by its adaptive capacity to low water and
    N input conditions, being a deep-rooted perennial legume with the ability to produce
    high biomass and protein yields through symbiotic nitrogen fixation (Issah et
    al., 2020). The lucerne taproot system allows access to soil water in deep soil
    profile which confers a competitive advantage over other shallow-rooted herbage
    species in drought prone environments with soils that enable high water storage
    (Brown et al., 2003). This adaptive capacity is particularly important in regions
    with limited water availability. This is a constraint of global relevance to current,
    and increasingly for future, agricultural production due to climate change (Tait
    et al., 2016), particularly where irrigation is not economically or environmentally
    viable (Rosa et al., 2018). In New Zealand, lucerne competitiveness under limited
    water supply was the key motivation for an area expansion during the middle of
    the 20th century, peaking at 220,000 ha in 1976 (Purves and Wynn-Williams, 1989).
    After that, lucerne areas declined to ∼84,000 in the late 80’s. Causes of decline
    included poor defoliation management, biotic stress pressures and, similar to
    other legumes in Europe (Cusworth et al., 2021), the intensification and specialisation
    of competing production systems through the use of high N fertiliser and irrigation-water
    (Dunbier et al., 1982). More recently, the potential to further expand lucerne
    areas in New Zealand has been revisited given the availability of improved management
    and modern cultivars (Moot et al., 2003), which may explain the slight increase
    of 10,000 ha since 2012 to reach ∼50,000 ha in 2017 (Agricultural Production Census.,
    2017). The potential to expand lucerne areas in New Zealand, and its productive
    potential in different regions, is currently unclear. This knowledge is particularly
    important when considering New Zealand’s variable climate (Teixeira et al., 2017)
    and soil characteristics (Webb, 2003) because, despite the ability to assess water
    deeper in the soil profile, lucerne yields are sensitive to lack of water availability
    and drastically decline when soil moisture drops below critical thresholds in
    the root zone (Moot et al., 2012). As highlighted by a number of previous studies,
    it is therefore important to assess yield estimates for both potential (YP) and
    water-limited (YW) conditions (van Ittersum et al., 2013). For forage crops like
    lucerne, the YP represents above-ground biomass yield at unconstrained conditions
    determined by local solar radiation interception and regulated by temperature
    profiles, considering best agronomic management practices (i.e. non-limiting nutrient
    and water supply, biotic stress control and defoliation regimes). For YW, the
    same conditions are assumed but without considering additional water supply from
    irrigation. The assessment of both YP and Yw are important because rain-fed systems
    are the most vulnerable to environmental changes, both under current climate (Asseng
    and Pannell, 2013, Eigenbrode et al., 2018) and considering future projections
    of climate change (Elliott et al., 2014) for New Zealand. Such understanding is
    critical to inform yield potentials which are a key component of agricultural
    assessments of yield-gaps and climate impact and adaptation of cropping systems
    across regions and timeframes (Jáuregui et al., 2022, van Ittersum et al., 2013).
    For such assessments, it is not feasible to solely rely on observational datasets
    because of the paucity of spatially-explicit yield information across the multitude
    of possible weather, management and soil combinations. In this regard, crop yield
    models can expand our current understanding by quantitatively simulating both
    YP and YW in response to gridded data on climates and soils to represent spatial
    and temporal variability (Rosenzweig et al., 2013, van Ittersum et al., 2013).
    Nevertheless, models are always imperfect representations of reality and the choice
    of model complexity (e.g. model structure and parameterisation) is an important
    component contributing to total uncertainty (Tao et al., 2018) and potential biases
    of simulated results (Saltelli, 2019). In contrast to gridded model simulations
    for major agricultural crops (Müller et al., 2017), to the best of our knowledge,
    lucerne YP and YW assessments have not yet been performed with different models
    at national scale to understand spatial and temporal yield variability patterns
    and key uncertainty sources for yield-estimates in this crop. In this study, we
    selected two lucerne yield models of contrasting complexity, previously developed
    and calibrated for New Zealand conditions. The intent was to quantitatively assess
    potential spatial patterns of model divergence (i.e. model uncertainty) when simulating
    lucerne above-ground yields across contrasting climate zones. Specifically, we
    used a GIS-based temperature-driven growth model (TGM; Moot et al., 2021b) and
    a process-based lucerne prototype model (APSIM Next-Gen lucerne; Yang et al.,
    2023, Yang et al., 2021) from the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM;
    Holzworth et al., 2014) framework. The GIS-based model is aimed for yield estimation
    at a field scale by lucerne growers and farm-consultants to budget feed supply,
    with minimal demand on input parameters. In contrast, the prototype APSIM-NextGen
    lucerne is a research tool under development to help understand underlying yield
    forming processes, through a detailed representation of the crop physiology, soil
    characteristics, management choices and their interactions with multiple environmental
    factors. The objectives of this study are therefore to (i) estimate potentially
    suitable areas for lucerne growth across New Zealand regions (ii) quantify spatial
    and temporal patterns of YP and YW variability within suitable areas and (iii)
    explore sensitivity of results to model selection and a range of growth conditions
    from interacting factors (climate, soil and management). These insights are expected
    to inform impact assessments that explore potential expansion of lucerne and other
    perennial legumes within agricultural regions through the use of gridded modelling
    approaches. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Climate datasets Regional climate simulations
    were performed from 1971 to 2000 using the ERA-40 dataset which is bias-corrected
    and downscaled at ∼5 km resolution by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
    Research (NIWA) across New Zealand (Sood, 2014, Tait et al., 2016). The climate
    dataset (Fig. 1) included air temperature (°C, maximum and minimum), total solar
    radiation (MJ/m2) and rainfall (mm). Evapotranspiration (ET) was estimated using
    the Priestley-Taylor approach in which vapour deficit and convection terms are
    accounted for by an empirical constant (α) to simplify the FAO Penman-Monteith
    equation (Allen et al., 1998). In our study, α was assumed as 1.37 for TGM estimates,
    as this value gave nearly identical daily ET estimates by APSIM (R2 = 0.99) that
    dynamically estimates α and ET. Download : Download high-res image (419KB) Download

    model testing (irrigated and rain-fed) with area harvested per region (Agricultural
    Production Census, 2017). 2.2. Description of soil types Three generic soil descriptions
    representing a wide range of possible differences in profile available water (PAW)
    content for New Zealand soils were set up for the simulations. These were a PAW
    of 75, 300 or 525 mm over a whole profile of 2000 mm depth assumed to have no
    significant impediment to root growth. The value for PAW is the only soil parameter
    needed for TGM; its water balance calculations were set to start with full soil
    water storage on 1-July (mid-winter) every year. For APSIM, a more detailed characterisation
    of soil properties for each horizon across the profile is needed (Cichota et al.,
    2021). The required parameters for each soil type were defined based on data from
    representative soils of similar PAW found in the NZ National soils Database (Wilde,
    2003), and complemented by pedo-transfer functions (Cichota et al., 2013). These
    soils represent a very stony coarse textured soil, excessively well-drained and
    with very low PAW (75 mm); a well-drained, with a medium loamy texture and medium
    PAW (300 mm); and a medium- to fine-textured soil, moderately-drained and with
    very high PAW (525 mm). The parameters defined for each soil horizon are illustrated
    for the PAW 300 mm soil (Table 1) and for all soils in the Supplementary Material.
    The values for the two parameters controlling soil evaporation rate (U and ConA)
    were set to 8.0 and 4.0 for summer and 4.0 and 1.5 for winter, respectively. These
    were adapted from typical approaches used for this model (Foley and Fainges, 2014,
    Ritchie and Crum, 1989). The curve number for runoff calculations was set to 60
    for all soils. In all simulations, the soil was initialised with water content
    at field capacity, 2000 kg/ha of fresh organic matter (roots and crop residues),
    and 57.5 kg N/ha of mineral nitrogen. Table 1. Soil parameterisation for a generic
    loamy texture soil with medium PAW (300 mm over the profile) used in APSIM simulations:

    upper limit; SAT is water content at saturation; Ks is the saturated hydraulic
    conductivity, swCon is the drainage coefficient, OC is organic carbon content;
    FBiom and FInert are the microbial and the inert fractions of soil organic matter.

    Non-climatic lucerne suitability assessment As a first step in the analysis, without
    considering temperature constraints later accounted for within TGM and APSIM,
    land suitability for lucerne was estimated based on terrain steepness, soil drainage
    class and annual rainfall regimes using the GAIA (Geospatial Assessment of suitability-Indexes
    for Agricultural systems) framework (Thomas et al., 2022). The GAIA framework
    is used as an interface to heuristically assimilate expert knowledge on land classification
    into four suitability classes (Unsuitable, Marginally-suitable, Suitable and Highly-suitable).
    The framework uses georeferenced climate and soil datasets as input to draw maps
    of crop suitability based on heuristic criteria following the approach by Kidd
    et al. (2015). In brief, the identification and parametrisation of suitability
    criteria metrics is developed iteratively through a sequence of expert interviews
    to scrutinise maps in GAIA user interface. Empirical knowledge is assimilated
    during the analysis of resulting national suitability maps from previous iterations
    and translated into metadata (Supplementary Material). For simplicity, only three
    criteria were used in this study (i) soil drainage class (poor- to well-drained),
    (ii) terrain slope (degree) and (iii) annual rainfall (mm). The parameters for
    each criterion was obtained during three iterations, first from published literature
    and then through two reviews with New Zealand experts on lucerne agronomy. Specifically,
    all grid-cells classified as “unsuitable” for any of the three criteria were excluded
    from the analysis. These included soil classes with “poor or very poor” drainage
    characteristics based on the LENZ dataset (www.lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/48085-lenz-soil-drainage/).
    For terrain slope, we used zonal statistics at 25 m resolution to create a GIS
    layer with the percentage of slopes > 15 degrees within each 5 km VCSN grid cell
    to be excluded (Deng et al., 2014). The rationale is that steep areas are unsuitable
    for cultivation due to the difficulty and costs for mechanised operations. Therefore,
    only grid-cells with > 50% of the area with slopes < 15 degrees were classified
    “suitable” for lucerne. For the third criteria, a 30-year mean annual rainfall
    GIS layer was created and grid-cells where annual rainfall is > 1700 mm were excluded
    (Alemayehu et al., 2020, Kim et al., 2018). The rationale is that too wet conditions
    increase the risk of biotic stresses (e.g. root rot with Pythium spp.) that compromise
    stand survival and economic viability of lucerne (Berg et al., 2017, Samac et
    al., 2016). Finally, areas with waterbodies were also excluded (e.g. 24 larger
    lakes). 2.4. Lucerne yield simulations We used two already existing lucerne yield
    models with a contrasting degree of complexity to account for model uncertainty,
    potentially an important component of total uncertainty in gridded assessments
    (Tao et al., 2018). These were the temperature-driven lucerne growth model (TGM;
    Moot et al., 2021) and the lucerne model prototype from the process-based Agricultural
    Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM; Holzworth et al., 2014) framework. Following
    specifications previously suggested for the estimation of potential yield (YP)
    and water-limited (YW) yield (van Ittersum et al., 2013), both models use daily
    time steps and were originally calibrated under New Zealand conditions. The complexity
    in model structure and parameterisation is greater for APSIM, as it considers
    different underlying crop physiology processes that influence yield formation
    (e.g. canopy expansion and carbon assimilation and biomass partitioning among
    plant organs) in response to environmental drivers and soil conditions (Fig. 2).
    In contrast, TGM empirically represents aggregated effects of temperature and
    water supply on crop growth rates, which are seasonally adjusted to account for
    differences in carbon partitioning between storage organs (taproots and crowns)
    and above-ground shoot biomass (Moot et al., 2021). This is a critical physiological
    aspect to be considered when modelling seasonal lucerne productivity (Moot et
    al., 2015, Teixeira et al., 2009, Teixeira et al., 2008). Details are given for
    both models in the next sections. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download

    structural complexity differences between APSIM and TGM through selected components
    required to simulate lucerne yields such as potential evapotranspiration (PET),
    radiation use efficiency (RUE) and intercepted solar radiation (Ri). TT-SWC is
    the parameter representing the soil moisture threshold of 20 mm required to restart
    daily thermal-time accumulation after summer moisture deficits. Soil Water parameters
    include drained upper limit (DUL) and lower-limit (LL) for each soil layer. 2.4.1.
    Process-based model: The APSIM-NextGen Lucerne prototype The process-based biophysical
    simulations were performed with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator
    framework (APSIM; Holzworth et al., 2014). In brief, APSIM simulates processes
    for plants (e.g. growth and development) and soil (e.g. carbon, water and nitrogen
    balances) at daily time steps driven by weather and soil parameters with management
    related inputs. We represented the lucerne cultivar ‘Kaituna’, a FD5 semi-dormant
    genotype extensively assessed and previously calibrated for APSIM under New Zealand
    conditions (Moot et al., 2015, Ta et al., 2020, Teixeira et al., 2009). The current
    prototype model is under development within the Plant Modelling Framework (Brown
    et al., 2014) which is part of the Next Generation APSIM model, APSIM-NextGen
    (Holzworth et al., 2018). The model parameterisation and testing performance across
    multiple location and lucerne genotypes is available at github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX/tree/master/Prototypes/Lucerne.
    In brief, the prototype version selected (version 2021.10.8.6835) estimated shoot
    yield components of lucerne with similar accuracy for leaves (R2 = 0.62 and NSE
    = 0.47, n = 631) and stem (R2 =0.67 and NSE=0.66, n = 618) fractions at the time
    of model application. For model application, APSIM requires a detailed description
    of agronomic management which for lucerne in this study implies setting the dates
    of individual harvests and irrigation events. Both management events were set
    to occur automatically in response to plant and soil indicators assuming best
    practice decision making under optimal conditions. This does not account for real
    world complexity where the timing of events is subject to climatic and operational
    uncertainty. Specifically, the crop was set to be harvested when reaching 3 t
    DM/ha recommended for grazing (Moot et al., 2016) or at the flowering stage (stage
    6.0), if the target yield was not achieved, to mimic a harvest prior to the decay
    in nutritive value at advanced phenology (Fick and Onstad, 1988). This implied
    a greater number of harvests per year in grid-cells and years with favourable
    weather conditions for crop growth and development. Similarly, for non-limited
    water supply (i.e. YP), irrigation was applied as per crop demand in response
    to environmental conditions. This resulted in a different number of irrigation
    events and amounts depending on soil characteristics, precipitation patterns and
    seasonal evapotranspiration. The initial soil conditions were reset annually on
    1-July (mid-winter) to default water, carbon and nitrogen amounts (Table 1) to
    ensure that the main drivers of yield variability were annual weather conditions
    and regional climate, following methodological considerations from Teixeira et
    al. (2018). Spatial APSIM-NextGen simulations at 5 km resolution were performed
    using the ATLAS (Assessment Tool for Landscape Agricultural Systems) framework
    (Teixeira et al., 2020). 2.4.2. The GIS-based model: the Temperature-driven Growth
    Model (TGM) The empirical GIS-based yield modelling approach developed for New
    Zealand conditions uses only maximum and minimum daily temperatures as input for
    YP estimates (Moot et al., 2021). The model is used to estimate potential lucerne
    above-ground biomass yield (Eq. (1)) by multiplying daily thermal-time accumulations
    and seasonal standardised growth rates (kg DM/°Cd). For increasing photoperiods
    from mid-winter to mid-summer (1 July to 31 December in New Zealand), the growth
    rate is assumed to be 9.68 kg DM/°Cd from 181° to 1500°Cd, whereas in a decreasing
    photoperiod, it declines to 5.40 kg DM/ha/°Cd to account for increased partitioning
    to roots in autumn. (1) Where y is the accumulated lucerne yield through an agricultural
    year starting on 1-July. The seasonal growth rates are for increasing (r1) and
    decreasing (r2) photoperiods, respectively; tti is daily thermal-time accumulation.
    Under water-constrained conditions, a soil water availability adjustment is applied
    to restrict thermal-time accumulation in periods of water stress, reducing yields
    from their potentials. Evapotranspiration (ET) using the Priestley-Taylor method,
    consistent with APSIM-NextGen calculations, is subtracted daily from available
    soil water storage plus precipitation inputs. Multiple values of maximum soil
    water storage capacity were considered to represent contrasting soil types (75,
    300 and 525 mm PAW). If available soil storage is totally exhausted (i.e. drought
    situation), the model stops accumulating thermal-time for yield calculation. Crop
    growth only recommences once rainfall has increased soil water storage to greater
    than 20 mm, when the model again restarts thermal-time accumulation for yield
    calculation. The soil water storage calculation is represented in the function
    below (Eq. (2)). (2) Where SWCi is the soil water content on day i. Full soil
    water storage capacity is assumed every year on 1-July. PCP is daily precipitation
    and ET is daily evapotranspiration, both in mm/day. The thermal-time calculation
    was averaged from 8 estimations during the day (i.e. every 3 h) using a sinusoidal
    approach (Jones et al., 1986) and cardinal temperatures for average temperature
    input (0, 1, 15, 30, 40oC). The resultant thermal-time daily estimates (0, 0,
    10, 25, 0oCd) are consistent with those used in APSIM-NextGen methods. A schematic
    representation of key components in APSIM and TGM, simplified for comparative
    purposes, is shown in Fig. 2. In brief, both models rely on identical thermal-time
    and potential evapotranspiration calculations, but these drive growth and water
    demand rates through different algorithm implementation complexities. In APSIM,
    growth rates are a product of intercepted light and radiation use efficiency which
    is then retained in shoots depending on biomass demands by below-ground organs.
    In contrast, TGM adjusts temperature-driven growth rate parameters seasonally
    to account for differential allocation of biomass to perennial organs (Fig. 2).
    2.5. Regional model comparison and sensitivity analysis 2.5.1. Observed data A
    regional comparison between “simulated” 30-year yield distributions and “observed”
    yield data from the AgYields National Database (Moot et al., 2021a) was performed
    using grid-cell scale datapoints. In brief, the AgYields database is a systematic
    compilation of geo-referenced yield data for multiple crop species, including
    lucerne, from published experimental datasets. The AgYields lucerne dataset provided
    121 data points (99 for rain-fed and 22 for irrigated crops) of annual above-ground
    biomass yield (t dry matter /ha per year), available within 17 different grid-cells
    across five New Zealand regions. We applied existing models to assess the degree
    of overlap between (i) simulated 30-year distributions within a 5 km grid-cell
    by both models and (ii) all observed datapoints in the same grid-cell from AgYields.
    The aim was to evaluate spatial patterns of model divergence (i.e. model uncertainty)
    in relation to long-term published datasets for a given location. It is important
    to note that this analysis was not aiming to further test model accuracy, as this
    was not technically possible due to contrasting nature and spatio-temporal scales
    of simulated and observed datasets. Specifically, simulations used interpolated
    long-term ERA-40 weather reanalysis (1971–2000) at a 5 km grid-cell scale as model
    input. In contrast, observed AgYields datasets represent real-world yield data
    in response to local weather during specific years. These contrasts therefore
    allowed only comparison of long-term distributions at grid-cell and regional scales
    with the intent of identifying systematic patterns of divergence. In addition,
    other growth conditions that influence observed yields such as soil characteristics
    and lucerne defoliation management were not associated with AgYields data, and
    therefore could not enable a formal set up of model simulations for further accuracy
    assessment. Nevertheless, both models have been formally tested using point-scale
    observed datasets (Moot et al., 2021b, Yang et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2022, Yang
    et al., 2021), so our analysis using AgYields data solely aimed to provide insights
    on the magnitude of distribution divergences among model outputs and in relation
    to reported yields across regions. For that, only data-points from unconstrained
    growth conditions, apart from water-limited when evaluating YW, were selected.
    For each available data-point coordinate, 30-year simulation distributions from
    the respective VCSN grid-cell were considered for comparison. When coordinates
    were not provided in publications, these were assumed from arable land identified
    near the reported trial locations. The selected test dataset gave median yields
    (and 25th to 75th percentiles) of 14 t DM/ha (11–17 t DM/ha) for rain-fed and
    18 t DM/ha (15–19 t DM/ha) for irrigated crops. 2.5.2. Sensitivity analysis A
    variance-based sensitivity analysis procedure (Pianosi et al., 2016, Santner et
    al., 2003, Welch et al., 1992) was applied to quantify the share of total variability
    in yield estimates attributable to each input factor (model selection, soil type
    and water supply management). Briefly, the variation in 30-year median yield estimates
    for each grid-cell was attributed to each main factor using ANOVA decompositions
    by quantifying variances for each factor and interactions. The normality of yield
    data distributions, as a requirement for ANOVA, was found in around 99% of the
    ∼3600 grid-cells that showed a median p-value greater than α = 0.05 quantified
    through a Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro and Wilk, 1965) across individual model/water-supply/soil
    combinations. The sums of squares for each main factor, plus its interaction components,
    were normalised by the total sums of squares and presented as percentages per
    grid-cell. The greater the normalised value, the higher is the sensitivity of
    lucerne yields variable to a given factor. Statistical analyses were performed
    using the statistical software R (R Core Team, 2020). Multi-year simulation results
    are graphically presented through box-and-whisker plots. The upper and lower box
    edges represent the 25th and 75th quartiles while the whiskers (vertical lines
    outside the boxes) represent the 5th and 95th percentiles. Maps were produced
    with QGIS software (QGIS Geographic Information System, 2022). 3. Results 3.1.

    in which AgYields data is available for comparison with long-term simulations.
    Values show the percentage of total observed data-points captured within the 1st
    to 99th percentile of 30-year simulations, considering three possible soil water
    holding capacity for each model. Triangles represent data-points originally used
    in model development (calibration), while circles represent data-points which
    were not previously used in model development for the process- (Yang et al., 2021)
    and GIS-based (Moot et al., 2021b) models . The comparison with AgYields data
    showed a systematic variation in model agreement depending on climatic regions.
    For example, 30-year yield simulations were closer to published data in Canterbury
    (70–98% overlap) where both models were mostly developed and tested (i.e. triangles
    representing calibration-data in Fig. 3). In other regions, where most the data-points
    were independent from previous development/calibration studies (circles in Fig.
    3), there was less agreement between simulated yield distributions and AgYields
    data-points. Differences were particularly larger for Southland (15–35% overlap),
    followed by Waikato (40–80%), Manawatu-Wanganui (79%) and Bay of Plenty (83–92%).
    Otago showed underestimation with 74% overlap by both models but also overestimation
    by APSIM. Across all regions, median yields were slightly lower for TGM than APSIM,
    from 1% to 12%, depending on location. 3.2. Spatial patterns of suitability and
    yield estimates across New Zealand The overlaying of slope, rainfall and soil
    drainage GIS layers gave ∼21 thousand km2 of highly suitable land for lucerne
    cultivation (Fig. 4), without consideration of other limitations such as low temperature
    or economic yields which were accounted for by TGM and APSIM in the subsequent

    precipitation > 1700 mm) for selection of grid-cells. Both models estimated similar
    spatial patterns of yield distribution across the land classified as suitable
    for lucerne growth (Fig. 5). With irrigated conditions and ample soil water storage
    (525 mm PAW soil), YP values > 25 t DM/ha were estimated for the northern areas
    of the country while lowest values were found to be < 10 t DM/ha in the southern
    regions. Model divergence was minimal for irrigated conditions. Download : Download

    (APSIM and TGM) under two contrasting water supply conditions (rain-fed with 75 mm
    soil and irrigated with 525 mm of potentially available water, PAW) across New
    Zealand. For rain-fed conditions, YW estimates illustrated for the lowest water
    holding capacity soil (75 mm PAW) in Fig. 5, also showed a north-south decline
    with both models identifying similar spatial patterns and hotspots of low yields.
    Nevertheless, models diverged the most under these conditions, particularly for
    the coldest and driest regions (e.g. central southern areas). This was further
    highlighted by the sensitivity analysis (Fig. 6) that shows model selection being
    relatively more important in the southern (22%) than northern (10%) regions, with
    the two most southern locations showing model selection explaining ∼30% of total
    variability. In these locations, yields are limited by simultaneous abiotic stresses
    from both low temperatures and limited water supply. In contrast, yield sensitivity
    to soil type was overall the highest share of total variability (65% on average),
    particularly in the warmer northern regions (∼70–78%) where temperature and rainfall
    amounts are relatively less limiting to lucerne growth than in the South Island
    (∼55–69%). As expected, the relative sensitivity of yield to water supply was
    highest in predominantly water-limited environments (e.g. east coast regions of
    both islands) with an overall average of ∼15% of total variability in both islands.

    4.1. Spatial patterns of lucerne suitability and yield across New Zealand Advancing
    approaches to quantify spatial variability in lucerne yields is critical given
    the global significance of the crop (Moot et al., 2012) and the benefits of assessing
    expansion potential of perennial legumes to diversify agricultural systems into
    more sustainable crop mixes (Asbjornsen et al., 2014). For New Zealand, our preliminary
    estimates of suitable areas for lucerne growth offer an initial indication of
    potentials but cannot accurately capture economically and environmentally viable
    areas to cultivate the crop within each region. For example, although we accounted
    for terrain steepness with a single parameter threshold (Brejea et al., 2021),
    individual growers might find it important to restrict operations to even flatter
    lands while others, who rely on grazing operations, might make use of steeper
    terrain. Similarly, risk of yield losses due to biotic-stress was only accounted
    for by assuming high rainfall and poor-drainage soils, as proxies for high risk
    of pest damage (Close et al., 2015). In the future, these and other aspects can
    be more mechanistically introduced into models depending on specific research
    questions and the balance between gains in accuracy and potential biases from
    additional model complexity (Saltelli, 2019). Similarly, other commonly used criteria
    to assess land suitability for lucerne, such as soil chemical and physical (e.g.
    salinity, drainage, pH) characteristics (Alemayehu et al., 2020, Deng et al.,
    2014, Kim et al., 2018), were outside of the scope of this study but can be implemented
    depending on localised data availability and research objectives. In addition
    to suitability, our study provided a first quantification of spatial variability
    in lucerne yields at a wide landscape-scale using both process- and GIS-based
    models. The responses of lucerne yield to temperature and rainfall gradients found
    across New Zealand with these two models agree with patterns estimated in a recent
    assessment in Canada using the lucerne EPIC model (Wang et al., 2021). Absolute
    yield estimates were however higher in New Zealand than Canada, particularly in
    the warmer climate zones of the country likelly due to the longer growth cycle
    length. Expanding the understanding of drivers of spatial variability previously
    observed for lucerne crops at field (Kayad et al., 2016), regional (Brejea et
    al., 2021) and national scales (Wang et al., 2021), our results highlighted a
    north-south pattern of decline in potential lucerne yields (YP) across the country,
    which was consistently captured by both models that converged the most under non-limited
    water conditions. This is similar to the pattern observed in other irrigated cropping
    systems in New Zealand, such as silage maize, in which temperature gradients become
    the main driver of spatial yield variability across the country (Teixeira et al.,
    2017). Optimum temperatures for different lucerne physiological processes are
    ∼20 oC (Pearson and Hunt, 1972) which is above the current gradient observed in
    the oceanic temperate climates of New Zealand. The yield reductions estimated
    for colder southern regions occur primarily due to the sensitivity of canopy expansion
    and photosynthesis to sub-optimal temperatures, by limiting both plant development
    (e.g. main-stem node appearance and branching) and growth (e.g. carbon assimilation)
    rates (Brown et al., 2006, Teixeira et al., 2007). This is captured by a decline
    in both radiation interception (Ri) and radiation use efficiency (RUE) considered
    in the process-based model (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the GIS-based model “bundled”
    representation of such processes into a single parameter set (i.e. seasonal growth
    rates per thermal-time unit) was also sufficient to capture similar yield spatial
    patterns of non-stressed crops. This was illustrated by a relatively small model
    divergence between models for YP ( ± 7%). Implicit here is the empirical climate-specific
    estimation of aggregated parameters in the GIS-based model, that assimilates the
    inherent relationship between temperature and incoming radiation within a given
    environment (Bristow and Campbell, 1984). In contrast, although the overall north
    to south yield decline with lower temperatures was still captured by both models
    for rain-fed conditions (YW), the extent and intensity of water-stress hotspots
    identified by each model differed. This was particularly important at low yields
    in the east- and central-southern regions of New Zealand, where average rainfall
    is less than 600 mm/year. Such increase in model divergence under extreme summer-dry
    conditions is expected due to the additional complexity required for calculations
    of daily water supply and demand, and the translation of these into yield decline
    magnitude. Although both models rely on a similar method to calculate water demand
    (i.e. Pristley-Taylor evapotranspiration), yield decline is an emergent property
    of interacting canopy and photosynthesis responses in the process-based model,
    while for the GIS-based the accumulation of thermal-time (i.e. the main driver
    of growth) is stopped and restarted based on empirical soil moisture thresholds.
    As a consequence, uncertainty due to model selection was particularly high in
    locations where abiotic stresses interact, such as the central South Island because
    dry and cold conditions occur simultaneously. Therefore, the representation of
    lucerne responses to multiple interacting yield-constraining conditions is suggested
    as a critical area for future model improvement targeting spatial applications.
    Such insights and considerations may help address the limited representativeness
    of perennial legumes in current gridded agricultural climate-impact studies, still
    largely dominated by cereal crop commodities (Müller et al., 2019, White et al.,
    2011). The regional divergences found between models, and between simulations
    and observations (Fig. 3), can be attributed to different sources of biases that
    occurr simultaneously. These are likely a combination of imperfections in model
    structure/parameterisation and also on how agronomic and experiential aspects
    (e.g. measurement method, stand density/age, defoliation regime, biotic and abiotic
    stresses), that largely influence yield observations, are known and represented
    in model configurations. Both sources of biases are discussed in the following
    section. 4.2. Scope, implications, and limitations of this study The land suitability
    “potential” estimates for lucerne (Fig. 4) in our study are likely to represent
    an upper limit which overestimates “actual” viable land for lucerne cultivation
    across the country. This is because we considered biophysical drivers, without
    accounting for additional socio-economic limiting factors (e.g. competition with
    other agricultural or non-agricultural land uses; absence of infrastructure/markets
    and exclusion of environmentally/culturally protected areas). At the other extreme,
    this study across New Zealand climate zones also cannot capture the much wider
    range of environmental conditions where lucerne is reported to grow. For instance,
    the crop is cultivated from cold to semi-arid conditions where genotypes with
    different phenotypical traits (e.g. degree of fall dormancy) are locally adapted
    (Annicchiarico et al., 2011, Djaman et al., 2020). Depending on the environment,
    specific physiological processes, not necessarily accounted for in the models
    here considered, may become more critical for estimation accuracy. For instance,
    in the harsh winter conditions of Canada it is critical to correctly simulate
    crown-level temperatures under snow cover to capture differences in stand survival
    (Jing et al., 2020). This is not required or accounted for in the models applied
    in this study. Such considerations, and other more sophisticated filtering logic
    (e.g. considering different weights for specific suitability factors), could be
    explored in future analysis depending on climatic conditions and research questions
    of interest. A key implication of our findings is that greater confidence on yield
    simulations is expected for YP than YW; and also when comparing relative yield
    differences (e.g. across locations and years) instead of absolute yield values.
    This is illustrated by the better agreement for YP both with the AgYields irrigated
    data-points (Fig. 3) and between models (Fig. 5). However, by definition, YP calculations
    assume optimal growth conditions, which are not commonly achieved in the field
    even under best agronomic practices. Even under fully watered conditions other
    yield-constraining factors, such as biotic stress damage facilitated by to frequently
    wet soils, might reduce stand longevity and lucerne productivity by affecting
    self-thinning patterns across years (Teixeira et al., 2007). In contrast, for
    water limited conditions there was a larger model divergence which may be caused
    by the difficulty to realistically represent edapho-climatic and management conditions,
    particularly defoliation regimes for lucerne, at fine resolutions (i.e. field
    scale at daily time-steps) a key source of uncertainty in crop model simulations
    (Wang et al., 2021). This aspect is further illustrated by the comparison with
    the AgYields database, which highlighted a yield overestimation response of both
    models in cooler and drier regions (e.g. central South Island). Our analysis was
    able to unveil spatial yield divergence patterns but it cannot isolate the underlaying
    causes of disagreement neither between models, nor in relation to observed yields
    to identify the fittest model for different situations. This is because the yield
    overestimation in southern regions can be an indication of regional yield-gaps
    and/or be caused by systematic biases in model structure or parameterisation that
    mainly emerge at high abiotic stress environments. The disentangling of possible
    disagreement drivers requires further investigation. As highlighted in Section
    2.4.1 although it was not possible to formally further test the models, given
    contrasting spatial resolution and climate data between simulated and observed
    datasets, the use of already existing model formulations allowed the identification
    of systematic patterns of disagreement between models and with observed data,
    that can be explored at greater depth in the future by focusing on hotspots where
    multiple stresses coincide such as central South Island. Finally, it is important
    to note that the historical reanalysis of climate data does not capture shifts
    in land suitability neither due to biophysical and socio-economic drivers of land
    use (Costa et al., 2019; Puy et al., 2020) nor due to already occurring climate
    change. In particular, observed warming and changes to rainfall patterns (amounts
    and frequency) in recent years (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021), and projected for
    the future (Meinshausen et al., 2011), are likely to influence spatiotemporal
    distribution of land suitability and yield for lucerne across New Zealand. The
    disentanglement of such uncertainties and potential biases require further investigation,
    particularly through the collection of data tailored for model testing and improvement
    purposes across more extreme climate conditions (Kersebaum et al., 2015, Rosenzweig
    et al., 2013). These can also be investigated in the future through an expansion
    of the current modelling approaches by considering gridded climate change projections
    that account for uncertainty in emission scenarios and climate projections downscaled
    for New Zealand (Tait et al., 2016, Teixeira et al., 2021). 5. Conclusions Our
    analysis shows a consistent north-to-south declining spatial pattern of lucerne
    yields across New Zealand. These were driven in large part by temperature gradients
    that influence crop growth and development rates and were captured by two models
    with different complexity, particularly for higher yields under unconstrained
    growth conditions. In contrast, there was greater model divergence, and model
    overestimation of reported regional data, for low yields under high stress conditions
    due to low temperature (e.g. southern regions) and limited water supply (e.g.
    rain-fed conditions with low water holding capacity soils). This highlights a
    need to focus research efforts to develop and test lucerne models under conditions
    where multiple stresses interact. This first spatial assessment of lucerne yields
    can serve as the foundation for future regional and national yield gap analyses
    and inform similar approaches considering other agricultural systems with perennial
    legumes. CRediT authorship contribution statement Edmar Teixeira was responsible

    (0, 1, 3, and 5 tractor wheel passes), on cumulative infiltration behavior in
    a clay soil under a randomized complete design with three replications. Double-ring
    infiltration experiments were conducted to collect infiltration data. The research
    was conducted in three different stages. The first stage was performed through
    a field test to obtain infiltration data, the second stage involved using a Kostiakov
    empirical equation (Z = q × tb) for cumulative infiltration to acquire the fitting
    parameters of “q” and “b”, and in the last stage, we predicted the fitting parameters
    of “q” and “b” based on soil mean weight diameter, tillage depth, and four soil

    The Kostiakov model, with an average coefficient of determination of 0.939, had
    a good fitting effect on the cumulative water infiltration depth process of the
    investigated soil. The average, lowest, and maximum values of the “q” parameter
    were 2.7073, 2.2724, and 3.1277 mm/minb, respectively, while for the “b” parameter,
    they were 0.5523, 0.5424, and 0.5647, respectively. Furthermore, the evaluation
    of several regression data mining approaches determined that the KStar (K*) data
    mining approach, with a root mean square error of 0.0228 mm/minb, a mean absolute
    error of 0.0179 mm/minb, and a correlation coefficient of 0.997, was the most
    accurate method for fitting parameter “q” using the testing dataset. The most
    accurate method for fitting the parameter “b” estimation was determined to be
    the Multilayer Perceptron method, with a root mean square error of 0.0026, a mean
    absolute error of 0.0013, and a correlation coefficient of 0.962, using the testing
    dataset. Therefore, this research, which consisted of in situ field observation
    experiments and infiltration modeling of the infiltration process in a clay soil,
    provides an essential theoretical basis for improving models of the rate of cumulative

    The evaluation and modeling of the water infiltration rate into the soil are important
    to all aspects of water resources management and the design of irrigation systems
    for agricultural purposes. However, research focused on experimental studies of
    infiltration rates in clay soils under different tillage practices remains minimal.
    Therefore, an empirical prediction model for cumulative water infiltration needs
    to be created to estimate water depth under different tillage practices. Thus,
    the present research investigated the impacts of different tillage practices,
    including plow type (three tillage systems: moldboard, disk, and rotary plows),
    tillage depth (100 and 200 mm) and four soil compactions levels (0, 1, 3, and
    5 tractor wheel passes), on cumulative infiltration behavior in a clay soil under
    a randomized complete design with three replications. Double-ring infiltration
    experiments were conducted to collect infiltration data. The research was conducted
    in three different stages. The first stage was performed through a field test
    to obtain infiltration data, the second stage involved using a Kostiakov empirical
    equation (Z = q × tb) for cumulative infiltration to acquire the fitting parameters
    of “q” and “b”, and in the last stage, we predicted the fitting parameters of
    “q” and “b” based on soil mean weight diameter, tillage depth, and four soil compaction
    levels by applying regression data mining approaches in Weka 3.8 software. The
    results show that the effects of relevant factors on the cumulative water infiltration
    depth of the soil could be statistically significant (p < 0.05). The Kostiakov
    model, with an average coefficient of determination of 0.939, had a good fitting
    effect on the cumulative water infiltration depth process of the investigated
    soil. The average, lowest, and maximum values of the “q” parameter were 2.7073,
    2.2724, and 3.1277 mm/minb, respectively, while for the “b” parameter, they were
    0.5523, 0.5424, and 0.5647, respectively. Furthermore, the evaluation of several
    regression data mining approaches determined that the KStar (K*) data mining approach,
    with a root mean square error of 0.0228 mm/minb, a mean absolute error of 0.0179
    mm/minb, and a correlation coefficient of 0.997, was the most accurate method
    for fitting parameter “q” using the testing dataset. The most accurate method
    for fitting the parameter “b” estimation was determined to be the Multilayer Perceptron
    method, with a root mean square error of 0.0026, a mean absolute error of 0.0013,
    and a correlation coefficient of 0.962, using the testing dataset. Therefore,
    this research, which consisted of in situ field observation experiments and infiltration
    modeling of the infiltration process in a clay soil, provides an essential theoretical
    basis for improving models of the rate of cumulative infiltration. Moreover, the
    proposed methodology could be employed for simulation of the fitting parameters
    “q” and “b” for soil water cumulative infiltration processes, not only for irrigation
    management purposes under regular crop production conditions, but also for the
    selection of the most suitable tillage practices to modify the soil during the
    agriculture season to conserve water and prevent yield declines. The results support
    the understanding of the infiltration processes in a clay soil and demonstrate
    that tillage practices could reduce the water infiltration rate into the soil.

    1. Introduction The infiltration process, which is crucial for designing irrigation
    and drainage systems, evaluating groundwater recharge and contamination, managing
    floods and droughts, etc., is frequently influenced by a number of variables,
    with soil use, soil cover, and soil physical characteristics being the main ones
    [1]. Hydrologists and water managers face a major challenge because of the considerable
    spatial variability that these factors cause in the infiltration process. Therefore,
    the soil infiltration water characteristics under various tillage practices for
    soil preparation for crop output must be defined. These characteristics are crucial
    for the construction of irrigation systems [2]. Due to the impact of soil use
    variation on the spatial changeability of infiltration parameters, numerous trials
    and theoretical investigations have been performed that aim to understand the
    links between infiltration processes and various agricultural management practices,
    in particular tillage operations [3] as they alter soil structure by creating
    macrospores that significantly affect the water infiltration rate into soil [4,5,6,7].
    The most serious environmental challenge resulting from modern agriculture is
    thought to be soil compaction. Wheeled farm equipment handles the majority of
    the typical tasks involved in conventional agriculture. The weight of the tractor
    and the attached machinery compacts the soil during these activities [5]. Numerous
    research papers have examined the impacts of soil management procedures like soil
    compaction and tillage on the characteristics of water infiltration into soil
    [3,8]. Soil compaction reduces pore space, creating a dense soil with poor internal
    drainage and decreased aeration, which increases soil strength and impedes root
    development in particular [5]. Furthermore, increasing tillage depth from 150
    to 450 mm showed increases in cumulative infiltration, indicating that tillage
    depth has an observable impact on the water cumulative infiltration in a soil
    [7]. The rate of water infiltration into the soil also rises as tillage depth
    increases [9]. Furthermore, the effects of diverse soil use and agricultural management
    procedures on the water infiltration into the soil have been examined, showing
    the substantial influence of soil use modification [10]. The effectiveness of
    irrigation methods and water use efficiency is directly impacted by estimations
    of the infiltration characteristics of the soil. The most suitable approach for
    calculating experimental infiltration models parameters can change in the same
    soil owing to the difficulty in determining parameters without in situ experiments
    [11,12]. To determine water infiltration into the soil, a number of empirical
    models have been developed. The water infiltration into the soil can be given
    as a function of infiltration time and other empirical constants. Kostiakov, modified
    Kostiakov, and Horton [13] are the empirical models most commonly used in infiltration
    data analysis. However, due to its variability within the field, predicting water
    infiltration into the soil is a major challenge. A suitable empirical model is
    required to establish the model’s parameters created on the properties of a limited
    soil [14]. Thus, an innovative model needs to be developed to make better decisions
    and allow irrigation engineers to study the different impacts of tillage practices
    on accumulated water depth in the field. Additionally, determining the amount
    of infiltration is essential for estimating the extra water required for irrigation
    and determining whether water is available for crop development [15]. Additionally,
    the water infiltration rate into soil is a crucial measure of irrigation and drainage
    effectiveness, improved plant water accessibility, increased yields, decreased
    erosion, and water wastage [16]. As a result, irrigation researchers have given
    the study of the infiltration process much focus [17,18]. Equally, numerous approaches
    have been developed to identify model parameters for various soil situations [14].
    For instance, the water cumulative infiltration (Z, mm) and infiltration time
    values (t) were subjected to a nonlinear regression examination ( Z=q× t b ) to
    identify parameters “q” and “b” in the Kostiakov model [14]. According to convention,
    the parameter of “b” is higher than zero but less than one [19], “b” indicates
    the constancy of the soil’s structure, and “q” is a measure of the soil’s initial
    rate of water infiltration and soil structural conditions [20]. Additionally,
    Elmarazky et al. [21] established a model with R2 values of 0.902 and 0.765 to
    obtain the “k” and “u” parameters, respectively, of the Kostiakov equation (I=k×
    t u ) for infiltration rate (I) in units of mm/h, employing the multiple linear
    regression (MLR) method. In their model, the soil mean weight diameter, the number
    of tractor wheel passes on the surface of the plowed soil, and the tillage depth
    were used as inputs. Hossne García et al. [22] conducted field experiments to
    study the effects of wetness, soil depth, and compaction on infiltration rate
    (mm/h) and employed the Kostiakov equation (I=k× t u ) for infiltration rate (I)
    in units of mm/h to acquire the Kostiakov fitting parameters “k” and “u”. They
    then employed the MLR method to model these two fitting parameters. Al-Sulaiman
    et al. [23] employed MLR to formulate the Kostiakov parameters “q” and “b” for
    water cumulative infiltration of the Kostiakov model. In their MLR model, the
    water electric conductivity, soil texture index, initial soil bulk density, soil
    sodium adsorption ratio, initial soil moisture content, soil electric conductivity,
    water sodium adsorption ratio, and organic matter percentage in the soil were
    used as inputs. Although some prior research on cumulative infiltration modeling
    using data mining algorithms has been conducted [24,25], no research has focused
    on developing models for infiltration model parameters, despite the fact that
    these parameters are crucial for appraising the performance behavior of soil water
    infiltration models [26]. Artificial neural networks have been used (ANN) to predict
    water infiltration [13,24,25,27,28]. Some researchers applied machine-learning
    tools to predict infiltration rates [24,25,28,29,30,31,32,33]. Others employed
    the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to model soil water infiltration
    [24,28,34]. In order to estimate the amount of infiltrated water in the furrow
    irrigation method, Sayari et al. [35] proposed five common artificial intelligence
    models, including ANN, ANFIS, MLR, Group Method of Data Handling, and Support
    Vector Regression. Data for evaluating these artificial intelligence models were
    collected from field tests and the available literature. The advance time at the
    end of the furrow, inflow rate, furrow length, cross-sectional area of inflow,
    and infiltration opportunity time were used as the input factors in the simulation.
    Evaluation and modeling of water infiltration rate into the soil are important
    to all aspects of water resources management and the design of irrigation systems
    for agricultural purposes. On the other hand, research focused on experimental
    studies of infiltration rates in clay soils under different tillage practices
    remains minimal. Therefore, this research was conducted in three stages. The goal
    of the first stage was to conduct an experimental study investigating the impacts
    of the number of tractor wheel passes on clay soil in three tillage systems (moldboard,
    chisel, and rotary plows) under two tillage depths on the cumulative infiltration
    depth. Additionally, in the second stage of the research, the infiltration parameters
    of the clay soil were determined and assessed using Kostiakov’s cumulative infiltration
    model ( Z=q× t b ). In addition, the aim of the third stage of the research was
    to test the efficacy of several data mining approaches for predicting the parameters
    of “q” and “b”, utilizing experimental field data for a clay soil. Accurate “q”
    and “b” predictions are crucial and would undoubtedly assist irrigation engineers
    to design irrigation and drainage systems, etc. The eight regression algorithms
    (M5Rules, Additive Regression, KStar (K*), SMOreg, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
    Linear Regression (LR), and Gaussian Processes) within the Waikato Environment
    for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) 3.8 software were employed to predict the parameters
    “q” and “b”. 2. Materials and Methods The present research investigated the impacts
    of different tillage practices, including plow type (three tillage systems, moldboard,
    disk, and rotary plows), tillage depth (100 and 200 mm), and four soil compactions
    levels (0, 1, 3, and 5 of tractor wheel passes) on cumulative infiltration behavior
    in a clay soil under a randomized complete design with three replications. Double-ring
    infiltration experiments were conducted to collect infiltration data. The research
    consisted of three different stages. The first stage was a field test to obtain
    infiltration data, the second involved the application of the Kostiakov empirical
    equation ( Z=q× t b ) for cumulative infiltration to acquire the fitting parameters
    of “q” and “b”, where Z is cumulative infiltration (mm), and t is infiltration
    time. The last stage involved prediction of the fitting parameters of “q” and
    “b” based on soil mean weight diameter, tillage depth, and four soil compactions
    levels by applying regression data mining approaches in Weka 3.8 software. The
    procedures employed have been reported previously in [21,22]. However, the details
    of the procedures in this research are discussed below. 2.1. Procedures of the
    First Stage of the Research (the Experimental Work) The infiltration experiments
    were located at the Rice Mechanization Center’s Research Farm in Meet El Deeba,
    Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt (longitude: 30°51′17.6″ E and latitude: 31°06′59.3″ N),
    and the soil water infiltration trials were carried out in a clay field. Four
    soil samples were collected from a nearby location and used to analyze the characteristics
    of the soil. The average percentage sand, silt, and clay contents at the experimental
    site for two soil depths can be seen in Figure 1. The soil bulk density was observed
    at two soil depths (0–150 mm and 150–300 mm), with values of 1.12 and 1.21 g/cm3,
    respectively. The experiments were conducted on an area of 0.405 ha. Water was
    applied to the test area, and it was then permitted to dry out until the soil
    moisture content was between 15% and 19% db. Figure 1. Average percentage of silt,
    clay, and sand content at the experimental location for two soil depths. In this
    research, various tillage practices were investigated. Three distinct tillage
    methods—moldboard, chisel, and rotary plows—were used for soil tillage. These
    were applied in order to obtain various levels of soil aggregation as indicated
    by the mean weight diameter (MWD) of the soil. Furthermore, two tillage depths
    were applied during soil tillage. The tractor wheels passed on the plowed soil
    surface to apply four levels of compaction (soil compaction level-0, soil compaction
    level-1, soil compaction level-3, and soil compaction level-5). The specifications
    of the tillage implement used in the experiments are provided by Elmarazky et
    al. [21]. However, the three treatments were established statistically in a randomized
    complete design with three replications. The levels of soil compaction were applied
    by driving an agricultural tractor with mass of 4840 kg (without any implement
    behind it) over the plowed soil surface with a forward speed of 4.5 km/h. Two
    tillage depths were applied in the range of 100–200 mm. The plots in the experimental
    site had an area of 30 m × 2.5 m. To avoid overlapping among treated plots, a
    1 m spacing between the treated plots was retained as a buffer. Five kg soil samples
    were collected along three arbitrarily chosen transects of each plot at different
    tillage depths, after both the tillage and traffic treatments. After air-drying
    of the samples, they were sieved with standard sieves to determine the defined
    size distribution of soil aggregates [36]. The product of the aggregate diameters
    in each sieve size and the proportionate weight of soil aggregate in that sieve
    size were added to define the soil mean weight diameter (MWD) [37] as follows:
    MWD= ∑ n i=1 X i × W i (1) where Xi is the average diameter of the aggregate class
    (mm), n is number of sieves, and Wi is the proportion of each aggregate class
    in relation to the total aggregate weight. 2.2. Double-Ring Infiltration Experiments
    Infiltration rates were observed using a cylindrical infiltrometer. The cylindrical
    infiltrometer (double-ring infiltrometer) had two rings with a length of 450 mm
    and the inner diameter was 300 mm for each ring. The two rings were inserted into
    the soil to a depth of around 70 mm using a rubber hammer with a weight which
    hit a wooden board attached to ring wall consistently without disturbing the soil
    surface. The two rings were filled with water to an equivalent depth, and the
    opening reading of the water level was observed. The experimental water used to
    measure the soil water infiltration rate was similar to that used for irrigating
    purposes in the site. A fixed 200 mm head of water was kept in each loop and the
    infiltration measurements were noted and documented for five minutes. Readings
    were made at regular time intervals for 3 h (180 min). The soil water infiltration
    rate was then calculated from the collected infiltration data and infiltration
    time to obtain the rate of infiltration in units of mm/h, and then the water cumulative
    infiltration depth (Z, mm) was calculated. 2.3. Determination of Kostiakov Equation
    Fitting Parameters for Cumulative Infiltration (the Second Stage of the Research)
    In most water infiltration experiments, the most generally employed empirical
    model is the Kostiakov model, which has a few simple calculations [17]. Kostiakov
    [38] presented his model early for determining the water cumulative infiltration
    depth as follows: Z= q×t b (2) where Z is the water cumulative infiltration depth
    (mm) at time interval t (minutes) and “q” is fitting constant called the soil
    infiltration coefficient (mm/minb), and “b” is the experimental fitting constant
    called the infiltration index constant (dimensionless). However, “q” and “b” are
    fitting parameters that are site-specific and depend on soil conditions such as
    soil bulk density, soil texture, soil moisture content, and other soil properties
    [39]. As the Kostiakov infiltration equation is empirical, no physical implications
    are involved in its related fitting parameters [40]. Using logarithmic transformation
    [41] and field experimental data, the Kostiakov equation’s linearized pattern
    was employed. Using this traditional method, which is called a graphical method,
    the fitting parameters of “q” and “b” in the Kostiakov model (Equation (2)) were
    determined by fitting a regression line to a plot curve of ln (Z) against ln (t).
    The intercept of the best-fit regression line on the ordinate axis then signifies
    the value of ln (q) and its slope is equivalent to “b” [26], where “q” and “b”
    are the Kostiakov model parameters such that “q” is greater than 0, while ”b”
    is greater than 0 and less than 1 [19]. In the present research, 42 observations
    for “q” and “b” were determined from the field experiment infiltration data with
    a high coefficient of determination (R2 was greater than 0.938). Figure 2 shows
    the steps in the research methodology for obtaining the fitting parameters “q”
    and “b”. Figure 2. Steps of the research methodology used to obtain the parameters
    “q” and “b” (adopted from [42]). 2.4. Statistical Analysis The effects of various
    tillage implements, levels of soil compaction, and tillage depth on MWD and fitting
    parameters “q” and “b” were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) table in
    three ways, for a randomized complete design with three replicates using SAS [43].
    Mean values were compared using the least significant differences (LSD) at a significance
    level of 0.05. 2.5. Procedures of the Third Stage of the Research (Data Mining
    Algorithms) This research employs the open source tool Weka 3.8, software written
    in Java (3.6.14 version) [44], to develop different computational models, which
    apply diverse regression techniques. Weka 3.8 software [45] is a fit-maintained
    computational method that includes a set of well-organized regression or classification
    algorithms that produce good outcomes in several fields. In this research, the
    regression tools inside Weka 3.8 software were utilized to predict the Kostiakov
    model parameters for cumulative infiltration, “q” and “b” (Equation (2)). The
    inputs included: MWD, ranging from 9.2 to 80.2 mm; the amount of tractor wheel
    traffic on the plowed soil surface (dimensionless) with 0, 1, 3, and 5 passes;
    and the tillage depth, ranging from 97 to 204 mm. The outputs were “q” and “b”.
    Weka provides ready-to-use tools in a range of machine learning procedures suitable
    for solving numerous data mining tasks. To achieve our goal, we relied on the
    field results for “q” and “b”. Weka has a simple and free-to-use graphical window
    to compare the outcomes of the different regression algorithms [46]. In the learning
    stage, a regression equation is created from the learning cases nominated by Weka.
    Table 1 provides short explanations of each of the regression algorithms used,
    for different classes, as initially defined by Weka [47]. Figure 3 depicts a flowchart
    for modeling “q” and “b” using the Weka software. WEKA was directed to select
    66% of the data as the training dataset (28 points) and the remaining data were
    used for testing purposes (14 points). Figure 3. Flowchart for modeling of “q”
    and “b” in Equation (2) using Weka software. Table 1. Descriptions of Weka regression
    algorithms. The MLR method is employed to examine the linear relationship between
    one dependent factor and two or more independent factors [51]. However, this method
    in Weka is called linear regression (LR). In this research, the Kostiakov model
    parameters for water cumulative infiltration, “q” and “b”, as shown in Equation
    (2), were modeled using MLR based on MWD, tillage depth, and the number of tractor
    wheel passes on the plowed soil surface as inputs. MLR was completed using Weka
    software to obtain the regression constants ( ∝ 0 , ∝ 1 , ∝ 2 , and ∝ 3 ) in Equation
    (3) with the following relation: q or b= ∝ 0 + ∝ 1 × MWD+ ∝ 2 × NTT+ ∝ 3 × TD
    (3) where MWD is the soil weight mean diameter, NTT is the number of tractor wheel
    passes on the plowed soil surface (dimensionless) with 0, 1, 3, and 5 passes,
    and TD is the tillage depth. Weka implements ridge regression and utilizes the
    standard least-squares linear regression method to obtain regression constants
    [52]. However, ridge regression is employed to solve difficulties that are not
    well displayed, which is significant when they have a poor chance of being resolved
    by a stable algorithm [53]. During the application of Weka regression algorithms,
    no attribute selection measure is required to accomplish the linear regression.
    Furthermore, in Weka, an artificial neural network called Multilayer Perceptron
    (MLP) is utilized. MLP is one of the most well-known data-driven technologies
    and is stimulated by the operations of the nervous system and brain [54]. It is
    based on a feed-forward ANN. It consists of one input layer, one or more hidden
    layers, and one output layer. However, each layer is composed of several neurons
    and the likely connection between these layers denotes the link between the nodes.
    The input layer, which contains neurons equivalent to the total number of the
    input parameters, allocates the data displayed on the network and does not assist
    in the processing operation. This layer tracks one or more hidden layers that
    support data processing. The output layer is the final layer, which provides the
    final output. When the input layer is exposed to the value of inputs passing through
    the link between the neurons, these values are multiplied by the equivalent weight
    and aggregated to obtain the net output (Zj) of the unit as follows: Z j =∑ W
    ij × y i (4) where Wij is the weight of the link from unit i to j, yi is the input
    value at the input layer, and Zj is the output obtained by the transfer function
    to yield an output for unit j. Haykin [54] has provided a detailed discussion
    about ANN. In the current research, a three-layer feed-forward ANN based on the
    back propagation algorithm was employed, which is the default in Weka 3.8 software.
    2.6. Statistical Criteria for Evaluation of Regression Data Mining Algorithms
    A model trained on a training set can be assessed using multiple statistical approaches
    comparing the predictions with the real values in the testing dataset. The root
    mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are some of these statistical
    criteria. Since it measures how closely the data match the fits regression line,
    the correlation coefficient or coefficient of determination (R2) is also used
    to compare the predictions with the real values in the testing dataset. In addition,
    R2 is a statistical procedure that identifies the proportion of a component’s
    variability that can be caused or explained by its relationship to another factor.
    The chosen metrics are the most well-known and widely applied success metrics
    [55]. The statistical criteria are computed as follows: RMSE= ∑ N i=1 ( P i −
    O i ) 2 N − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (5) MAE= ∑ N i=1 |( P i − O i )| N (6) In
    Equation (5), Pi and Oi are the predicted and calculated “q” or “b” values, respectively,
    and N is the total number of readings. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Data Analysis
    of the First Stage of the Research (the Experimental Work) for Soil Mean Weight
    Diameter Water infiltrates rapidly into granular soils but very slowly into massive
    and compact soils, suggesting that tillage practices can alter the soil structure
    and thereby alter the infiltration rate [56]. Moreover, soil with large particle
    sizes has a high infiltration rate [57,58]. Figure 4 shows how the typical MWD
    varied for rotary, moldboard, and chisel plows under different treatments. It
    was observed that MWD in the moldboard plow plots was in the range of 34.5 mm
    to 80.2 mm, and in the chisel plow plots, it was in the range of 19.6 mm to 45.7
    mm, while it was in the range of 9.2 mm to 21.5 mm for the rotary plow plots.
    A summary of the ANOVA analysis demonstrating the effects of tillage implements,
    number of wheel passes and tillage depth and their interactions on mean weight
    diameter is shown in Table 2. The tillage implements, soil compaction level (number
    of wheel traffic passes) and tillage depth had significant effects (p < 0.05)
    on MWD. The average MWD for the moldboard plow treatment had the greatest value
    at 57.86 mm, while the average MWD for the chisel and rotary plot treatments had
    lower values of 32.98 mm and 15.50 mm, respectively (Table 3). Compared with other
    plowing implements, the moldboard plow created larger clods; thus, it had a greater
    MWD value than the other tillage implements. However, moldboard plowing can destroy
    the pore permanency and aggregate constancy, causing remains mobilization, erosion,
    and surface strengthening [59]. Similarly, Khadr [60] showed that a significant
    effect on MWD was seen when using tillage implements. Their MWD values in a clay
    soil were 71.98, 44.49 and 23.97 mm for moldboard, chisel, and disk harrow plows,
    respectively. In addition, the MWD values were higher under a tillage system consisting
    of a moldboard plow plus disk plow than under a chisel plow plus disk plow system
    [61]. However, Çarman [62] claimed that a moldboard plow created a higher MWD
    than a rotary tiller plow, heavy globe disk plow, and stubble cultivator plow.
    Furthermore, a moldboard plow yielded the highest MWD (34.78 and 10.05 mm), whereas
    a chisel plow yielded the lowest MWD (17.16 and 6.08 mm) when the plowing process
    was conducting on a loam soil at different plowing speed and the tillage depth
    was 200 mm [63]. Carter [64] observed that chisel plow aggregates were larger
    than moldboard plow aggregates. Figure 4. Variation in average soil MWD under
    investigated tillage practices treatments for rotary, chisel, and moldboard plows
    (D1 represents a tillage depth of 100 mm and D2 represents a tillage depth of
    200 mm). Table 2. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) table of the MWD (TI indicates
    tillage implement, NTT indicates the number of tractor wheel traffic passes on
    the plowed soil surface, and TD indicates the tillage depth). Table 3. Mean values
    and least significance difference (LSD) for the MWD as impacted by tillage implement,
    soil compaction level, and tillage depth (Means significantly different if they
    are followed by a distinct letter). Tillage depth significantly affected the soil
    aggregate mean weight diameter values. As seen in Table 3, tillage depth increased,
    and MWD decreased. Naseer et al. [65] reported that an increase in tillage depth
    from 100 mm to 200 mm, increased MWD by 9.01% after plowing by primary tillage
    implements. Similarly, increasing tillage depth from 100 to 150 and to 200 mm
    produced significant increases in MWD of 7.37% and 7.86%, respectively, after
    plowing with a chisel plow in a silty clay loam soil. In addition, increasing
    the tillage depth led to increased values of MWD [66]. Additionally, the maximum
    MWD was observed at tillage depths of 200–300 mm and the minimum at tillage depths
    of 100–200 mm [67]. As the compaction level increased, the MWD values decreased.
    With no compaction (soil compaction level-0), the MWD was 47.84 mm; for one pass
    of wheel traffic (soil compaction level-1), the MWD was 40.67 mm; for three passes
    (soil compaction level-3), the MWD was 30.52 mm; and for five passes (soil compaction
    level-5), the MWD was 22.76 mm (Table 3). These findings are in agreement with
    those of Ramezani et al. [67], who observed that the control treatment had the
    highest MWD and eight-wheel tractor traffic had the lowest MWD for loam, sandy
    and sandy loam soils. Higher traffic levels of agricultural machinery may lead
    to the creation of smaller aggregates, particularly under dry soil conditions
    [68]. Furthermore, after a single-pass tillage operation with a rotavator plow
    in a sandy loam soil, it was found to be 4.9 mm, and it was 14.54 mm for a moldboard
    plow [69]. 3.2. Data Analysis of the Second Stage of the Research (Water Cumulative
    Infiltration Depths) The observed cumulative infiltration depths versus time for
    the moldboard, chisel and rotary plows are presented in Figure 5, Figure 6 and
    Figure 7, respectively, under tillage practices with two tillage depths and under
    different soil compaction levels. Observing Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7, it
    is clear that the cumulative infiltration generally increases with increasing
    infiltration time, and it can be expressed as a power function. Figure 8, Figure
    9 and Figure 10 present the impact of tillage depth on final cumulative infiltration
    after 180 min at altered levels of wheel traffic for moldboard, chisel, and rotary
    plows as average values, respectively. It is noticeable that the water cumulative
    infiltration depth varied between 46.0 and 54.0 mm after 180 min for the moldboard
    plow. It varied between 37.9 and 48.0 mm after 180 min for the chisel plow, while
    for the rotary plow, the cumulative infiltration depth varied between 36.4 and
    44.5 mm after 180 min. Water infiltration into the soil is claimed to be directly
    affected by soil tillage methods [70], and the moldboard plow plot in this research
    had the ability to take in water at a faster rate than the chisel and rotary plowed
    plots. This could also be due to the porous nature of the moldboard plow plots
    and because the soil is coarser than in plots plowed by other tillage implements.
    The MWD in the moldboard plow plot ranged from 34.5 mm to 80.2 mm; for the chisel
    plow it ranged from 19.6 mm to 45.7 mm; and for the rotary plow, it ranged from
    9.2 mm to 21.5 mm. Generally, primary tillage tends to yield a rough surface finish
    [71,72]. Plowing processes conducted at different tilling depths and wheel-traffic
    compaction alter the pore structure of the clay soil [73], and these modifications
    affect solutes, water movement, and root growth. In a study conducted by Al-Ghazal
    [74], it was discovered that the chisel plow, followed by the moldboard plow and
    the rotavator, had the highest mean infiltration rate of soil at the highest rate
    of compaction (5 passes of the tractor). The additional soil disturbance caused
    by the chisel plow as compared to moldboard and rotavator plows may be the cause
    of the higher soil infiltration rate. Figure 5. Field measurements of cumulative
    infiltration depths for moldboard plow tillage with two tillage depths and under
    different soil compaction levels. Figure 6. Field measurements of cumulative infiltration
    depths for chisel plow tillage with two tillage depths and under different soil

    Kostiakov Fitting Parameters Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6 show the raw data of
    fitting parameters “q” and “b” in Equation (2) as affected by the number of tractor
    wheel passes on the plowed soil surface and the tillage depth for the moldboard,
    chisel, and rotary plows, respectively. Both the estimated Kostiakov fitting parameters,
    “q” and “b”, obtained by the best fit of measured data differed significantly
    among the tillage implements (Table 7). Similar results were observed by Mbagwu
    [75], who reported that the predicted model parameters, “q” and “b”, of the Kostiakov
    model obtained by the best fit of measured data differed significantly among treatments
    that included tilled-unmulched, tilled-mulched, untilled-unmulched, untilled-mulched,
    and continuous pasture. Also, differences cause by wheel traffic were detected
    in “q” (Table 7). Conversely, there were no significant differences for tillage
    depth and wheel traffic in “b” and “q” (Table 7). Table 8 presents the mean fitting
    parameters (Equation (2) as affected by tillage implement, number of wheel traffic
    passes (soil compaction level), and tillage depth and their interactions. Table

    parameters “q” and “b” in Equation (2) as affected by the number of tractor wheel
    passes on the plowed soil surface and the tillage depth for the rotary plow. Table
    7. Source of variation, degrees of freedom (DF) and probability (p-values) from
    ANOVA table for e fitting parameters “q” and “b” in Equation (2). Table 8. Mean
    fitting parameters (Equation (2)), as affected by tillage implements, number of
    wheel passes (soil compaction level) and tillage depths, and least significance
    difference (LSD) (Means are significantly different if they are followed by a
    distinct letter). In this research, the average, maximum and minimum values of
    “q” were 2.7073, 3.1277, and 2.2724 mm/minb, respectively for a clay soil, and
    these values were 0.5523, 0.5647, and 0.5424 (dimensionless), respectively, for
    the “b” parameter for the same clay soil. In another study in a plowed clay, soil
    “q” was 3.38 mm/minb and “b” was 0.53 (dimensionless) [26]. The infiltration parameters
    “q” and “b” varied strongly with respect to soil texture [76]. Thus, the Kostiakov
    model for predicting the water cumulative infiltration (Z, mm) for a clay soil
    for the present research was as follows: Z=2.7073× t 0.5523 (Average R 2 was0.939)
    (7) With an average R2 value of 0.939, only slight variations were reported between
    the measured and predicted Z. The test results indicate that the cumulative infiltration
    predicted using Equation (8) is reasonably accurate and can be used to estimate
    cumulative infiltration over a reasonable time for irrigation in a clay soil.
    There is a good agreement between the measured and estimated cumulative infiltration
    under all treatments. In previous research [11], the Kostiakov, Philips, and Horton
    infiltration models were evaluated and the Kostiakov model was identified as the
    better alternative for evaluating the infiltration rate. Additionally, the Kostiakov
    model was considered the most appropriate for the prediction of water infiltration
    rate into the soil compared with the Horton and Philip models [77]. Fok [78] derived
    the Kostiakov equation parameters and fitting them to a physically based infiltration
    equation, derived five different sets of values for “q” and “b”, depending on
    initial moisture content, time, and hydraulic conductivity. The power constant
    “b” has more physical sense than the other Kostiakov equation fitting parameters,
    as its scale depends on the relationships and interactions of several infiltration
    reduction or increasing factors [78]. According to Dixon [79], large “q” values
    are related to micro-rough and macro-porous soil surfaces, or to situations with
    a moderately large gravitational impact on infiltration. On the other hand, small
    “q” values are linked to smooth, micro-porous surfaces where capillarity is the
    major force driving infiltration. The constant “b” is just an infiltration curve
    fitting coefficient. For the empirical infiltration models, it is commonly implicit
    that, while infiltration is defined as a function of time, the residual parameters
    are calibration constants signifying the situations under which the test was directed,
    including the initial soil moisture content and any other factors that may induce
    differences in infiltration [80]. 3.4. Data Analysis of the Third Stage of the
    Research (Data Mining Algorithms) Recently, there have been improved research
    efforts offering alternate approaches for precisely predicting the quantity of
    soil water infiltration using altered types of models based on data mining models.
    Some benefits of these kinds of models are reported by Panahi et al. [31] as follows:
    strong estimation performance, strength in handling missing data, easy and stable
    to expand, and the ability to handle large quantities of data of diverse measures.
    The ability of the investigated regression algorithms is reliant upon the default
    parameters employed by Weka, and the values of the default parameters for the
    investigated regression algorithms are listed in Table 9. The time taken to build
    models for “q” and “b” is illustrated in Table 10. The least time is required
    with the KStar (K*) method. In this research, the input variables were the mean
    weight diameter, tillage depth and soil compaction level. Various performance
    measures were used to check the accuracy of the model. The values of “q” and “b”
    can be computed and compared with actual values of “q” and “b” using the proposed
    regression models. Table 9. Default WEKA information for investigated models.
    Table 10. Time taken (s) to build model in seconds for fitting parameters of “q”
    and “b”. The MLP (4-3-1) with three nodes in the hidden layer was formed by Weka.
    The MLP was trained for 500 epochs with a learning rate of 0.3 and a momentum
    of 0.2, the Weka defaults. The number of epochs determines how long the MLP will
    run, while the learning rate and momentum state how in tune the weights are [47].
    The Weka linear regression model outcome for “q” was calculated by Equation (8),
    with an R2 of 0.947, and for “b”, the Weka linear regression model result was
    calculated by Equation (9), with an R2 of 0.786. q=2.2696+0.00785×MWD−0.0171×NTT+0.0141×TD
    (8) b=0.5317+0.0004×MWD+0.0034×NTT−0.0002×TD (9) where “q” is in mm/mimb, “b”
    is dimensionless, MWD is in mm, NTT is soil compaction at 0, 1, 3 and 5 traffic
    levels, and TD is tillage depth in cm. Table 11 provides the statistical data
    of the evaluation criteria between the observed and predicted values of the fitting
    parameters in Equation (2) of “q” and “b” with the investigated regression algorithms.
    An evaluation of all the regression algorithms was completed to identify the most
    efficient regression algorithm. Using the testing dataset, the performance of
    KStar (K*) was better than the other regression algorithms, with the following
    performance evaluation criteria for “q” estimation: correlation coefficient =
    0.997, MAE = 0.0179 mm/minb, and RMSE = 0.0228 mm/minb. For “b” estimation, the
    performance of the MLP was better than the other regression algorithms, with performance
    evaluation criteria as follows: correlation coefficient = 0.962, MAE = 0.0013
    dimensionless, and RMSE = 0.0026 dimensionless. Table 11. The statistical data
    of evaluation criteria between actual and predicted values of the fitting parameters
    of “q” and “b” in Equation (2) using different regression algorithms using testing
    dataset. Figure 11 and Figure 12 provide bar graphs for the average values of
    the parameters of “q” and “b” using the investigated regression algorithms compared
    with actual values in the testing dataset. The average actual for “b” was 0.5576
    dimensionless in the testing dataset (14 points) and the closed average for the
    KStar (K*) method was 0.5573 dimensionless. The average actual value for “q” was
    2.8297 mm/minb in testing dataset (14 points), and the closed average for the
    K Star (K*) method was 2.8234 mm/minb. Figure 11. Bar graph for the average values
    of the parameter “q” using the investigated regression algorithms compared with
    actual values in testing dataset. Figure 12. Bar graph for the average values
    of the parameter “b” using the investigated regression algorithms compared with
    observed values in testing dataset. KStar (K*) was the best-performing regression
    algorithm for predicting the expected values of the parameters “q” and “b” in
    the used dataset within the studied range. In this case, the K* outcomes were
    the best for the present dataset, and it is important to note that it is tested
    here as a regression algorithm and its parameters were left as default in Weka
    3.8 software. Furthermore, the KStar algorithm is better than the other prediction
    regression algorithms, namely, Linear Regression, RBFNetwork, Decision Stump Simple,
    and Linear Regression in Weka for disorganized data [80]. For prediction of organic
    matter quantity and clay content in a soil, the Lazy KStar algorithm was shown
    to have more satisfactory performance when mining the data, with higher determination
    coefficients and smaller errors [81]. In prediction of rainfall based on metrological
    data, the KStar algorithm had the maximum correlation coefficient of 0.8901, and
    the minimum RMSE compared with other algorithms in Weka, including MLP, Bagging,
    IBk, Additive Regression, Decision Table, Random SubSpace, M5Rules, REPTre, M5P
    tree, Regression by Discretization, and User Classifier [82]. The efficiency of
    the deep learning of convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, using three
    metaheuristic procedures for infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration prediction
    was evaluated. The results revealed that CNN had very good performance for both
    infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration and prediction [31]. The Kostiakov
    model, and ANN approach in Weka appeared to be good tools for predicting the infiltration
    rate of a soil, and time and soil moisture content were the most critical parameters
    in measurement of the infiltration rate of a soil [83]. In addition, the fitting
    accuracy of the data mining model is affected by agricultural practices or soil
    structure, organic matter content, porosity, and other factors [84]. Therefore,
    this research on the infiltration processes in a clay soil, performed by in situ
    field observation experiments and fitting a model of infiltration parameters,
    provides an essential theoretical basis for irrigation management purposes under
    regular crop production conditions. The research also assists with the selection
    of the best seedbed preparation method, tillage depth and soil compactions levels
    generated by tractor passes, enabling the modification of tillage practices during
    the season to conserve water and to prevent yield declines. 4. Conclusions To
    properly plan and manage irrigation systems, cumulative infiltration must be accurately
    determined. Although infiltration readings frequently only provide point information,
    they are indispensable for parameter and model validation. This research aimed
    to investigate in a field experiment the influence on cumulative infiltration
    of different tillage practices, which were characterized by conducting tillage
    on a clay soil using three tillage implements (moldboard, chisel, and rotary plows)
    under two tillage depths and under four levels of soil compaction created by tractor
    wheel traffic. The analyses indicated that the cumulative infiltration empirical
    model parameters “q” and “b” of the Kostiakov equation ( Z=q× t b ) depend on
    the experimental conditions. The logarithmic transformation (graphical method)
    performance in describing soil infiltration characteristics (Z=2.7073× t 0.5523
    ) under different tillage practices was tested, resulting in an R2 value of 0.939,
    and found to be highly acceptable. Defining the precise infiltration features
    leads to correct management and design of an irrigation system, as governed by
    the accurate behavior of model parameters. Thus, in this research, regression
    algorithms in the Weka software, namely, M5Rules, Additive Regression, KStar (K*),
    SMOreg, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Linear Regression (LR), and Gaussian Processes,
    were used to predict the Kostiakov model parameters of “q” and “b” for the cumulative
    infiltration equation using field infiltration data. The inputs were as follows:
    mean weight diameter of the clay soil, which depending on different treatments,
    ranged from 9.2 to 80.2 mm; the level of tractor wheel traffic on the plowed soil
    surface (dimensionless) with 0, 1, 3, and 5 passes; and the tillage depth, ranging
    from 97 to 204 mm. The outputs were “q” and “b”. The obtained results indicated
    that the KStar (K*) model was the most effective regression algorithm for predicting
    “q” with a correlation coefficient of 0.997 for the given clay soil texture, while
    for parameter “b” for the same clay soil texture, the MLP regression algorithm
    with a correlation coefficient of 0.962 was the most effective method. Finally,
    we encourage repeating the same procedure in order to answer related problems.
    This research is not without limitations. Using only the data based on a clay
    soil is one limitation, although its reliability is high. The second limitation
    relates to the graphical method for determination of “q” and “b” fitting parameters,
    as many other methods could have been used, for example, the volume-balance method.
    The third limitation relates to the non-use of other relevant data mining algorithms
    that are not offered in Weka software, which should be addressed in coming research
    on this subject. This research contributes to research in the irrigation field
    on new computational methods applied to the soil infiltration process. It should
    encourage the irrigation and soil research community to share their datasets and
    improve the prediction models. The results also indicate that the regression algorithms
    can be suitable for the estimation of fitting parameters of cumulative infiltration
    depth from the accessible data. The fitting parameters generated by the investigated
    regression algorithms can be used to simulate the cumulative infiltration depth
    in the investigated soil texture. Moreover, the water infiltration rate into the
    soil can be used as a tool for the purposes of designing irrigation systems, the
    characterization of different tillage practices, and providing a localized management
    of this variable. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.A.-S., R.S.A.-O.,

  description: 'The processed discharges from Tangier Automotive City’s (TAC) Chrafate
    Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) contaminate the Jouamaa Hakama groundwater and
    the Ouljat Echatt river. We aimed to study the unknown interactions between surface
    water (SW) and groundwater (GW). A total of nine Jouamaa Hakama GW samples and
    eleven Ouljat Echatt SW samples were taken and analyzed in 2021 and 2022 to determine
    16 physical and chemical parameters (pH, temperature (T), electrical conductivity
    (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total hardness (TH), turbidity (TURB), and total
    dissolved solids (TDS), cations: Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, anions: Cl−, CO32−, HCO3−,
    NO3−, and SO42−). For exploitation of the data, we used a methodology based on
    hydrochemical modeling (HM), principal component analysis (PCA), Water Quality
    Index (WQI), Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI), inverse distance weighted
    interpolation (IDW) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and regression
    analysis (RA). We studied the interaction of the surface water of the river (contaminated
    by discharges from the WWTP) with the shallow groundwater on a strip of 100 m
    on either side of the river to understand the transverse and longitudinal dispersion
    of this pollution The investigations indicated that the major ions found in GW
    and SW were characterized in a different order in the anion list order Cl− > CO32−
    > NO3− > HCO3− > SO42− and Cl− > SO42− > CO32− > NO3− > HCO3−, respectively, while
    the concentrations of cations showed the same order for both: Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+
    > K+. As a result, GW showed in the Piper diagram the type of sodium chloride
    to magnesium carbonate, while SW belongs to the sodium chloride to magnesium sulfate
    type. The WQI showed that the river waters are all unsuitable for use (WQI > 100),
    while the GW is of poor quality (WQI > 76). Moreover, the results of the GW–SW
    interaction along the river revealed a significant relationship (R2 = 0.85), which
    means that strong circulation and the infiltration of contaminated SW into shallow
    GW occur in this area. The approaches followed have been proven effective in evaluating
    water quality for human and animal uses. These results can help decision-makers
    in the region take suitable management measures to mitigate this environmental
    problem.'

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The processed discharges from Tangier Automotive
    City’s (TAC) Chrafate Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) contaminate the Jouamaa
    Hakama groundwater and the Ouljat Echatt river. We aimed to study the unknown
    interactions between surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW). A total of nine
    Jouamaa Hakama GW samples and eleven Ouljat Echatt SW samples were taken and analyzed
    in 2021 and 2022 to determine 16 physical and chemical parameters (pH, temperature
    (T), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total hardness (TH),
    turbidity (TURB), and total dissolved solids (TDS), cations: Na+, K+, Mg2+ and
    Ca2+, anions: Cl−, CO32−, HCO3−, NO3−, and SO42−). For exploitation of the data,
    we used a methodology based on hydrochemical modeling (HM), principal component
    analysis (PCA), Water Quality Index (WQI), Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI),
    inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW) using Geographic Information Systems
    (GIS), and regression analysis (RA). We studied the interaction of the surface
    water of the river (contaminated by discharges from the WWTP) with the shallow
    groundwater on a strip of 100 m on either side of the river to understand the
    transverse and longitudinal dispersion of this pollution The investigations indicated
    that the major ions found in GW and SW were characterized in a different order
    in the anion list order Cl− > CO32− > NO3− > HCO3− > SO42− and Cl− > SO42− > CO32−
    > NO3− > HCO3−, respectively, while the concentrations of cations showed the same
    order for both: Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+. As a result, GW showed in the Piper diagram
    the type of sodium chloride to magnesium carbonate, while SW belongs to the sodium
    chloride to magnesium sulfate type. The WQI showed that the river waters are all
    unsuitable for use (WQI > 100), while the GW is of poor quality (WQI > 76). Moreover,
    the results of the GW–SW interaction along the river revealed a significant relationship
    (R2 = 0.85), which means that strong circulation and the infiltration of contaminated
    SW into shallow GW occur in this area. The approaches followed have been proven
    effective in evaluating water quality for human and animal uses. These results
    can help decision-makers in the region take suitable management measures to mitigate
    this environmental problem. Keywords: North of Morocco; GW–SW interaction; hydro-geochemistry

    stress caused by climate changes have added to pollution of water by various anthropogenic
    activities, leading to the degradation of ecosystems and biodiversity essential
    for human needs [1,2,3]. Freshwater is a limited and fragile asset, threatened
    by growing consumption and multiple forms of pollution. It is also an essential
    non-renewable natural resource that must be preserved [3]. Most surface water
    (SW), such as rivers, are connected to groundwater (GW) [4,5]. Indeed, the dynamics
    of exchanges and river–aquifer interactions include the infiltration of solutes
    from river waters which leads to the reconstitution and recharge of GW through
    these SW masses, thus producing variations in the quality of GW [6]. Additionally,
    urban growth leads to large municipal landfills and wastewater contamination of
    nearby waterways, especially GW and SW. This leads to questions about the nature
    of these water resources, as GW contamination persists for a long time due to
    the slow movement of water [7]. This is why it is important to ensure that the
    quality of freshwater is secure for use by humans [8]. Morocco, like all the other
    countries in the world, is affected by climate change and freshwater pollution.
    Thus, ongoing management is required to safeguard water resources. It is critical
    to conduct quality monitoring of GW and SW used for consumption in order to safeguard
    their quality [9]. Therefore, physicochemical [10,11], hydrochemical [12], and
    bacteriological [13] factors can be used to evaluate the freshwater quality. However,
    analysis of GW and SW quality parameters are costly and time-consuming. To improve
    freshwater quality, it is very important to interpret different variations in
    freshwater quality [14] and to locate hidden sources of contamination [15,16,17].
    For that purpose, to characterize the quality of SW, several researchers have
    used pertinent methods and techniques, such as WQI, which is regarded as one of
    the most efficient techniques for assessing water quality [18,19,20]. Moreover,
    fuzzy logic [21,22], machine learning [23,24], and the projection pursuit approach
    [11,25,26] have been used to forecast dam water quality [23], river water quality,
    and GW quality [11,25,26], and neural networks have been utilized to analyze water
    quality [27,28]. Multivariate statistical approaches can be used to assess large
    freshwater quality datasets with a minimum loss of information [29,30], which
    is valuable for quickly characterization of the contamination [31,32]. Some researchers
    [33,34,35,36] have combined GIS techniques with multivariate statistical approaches
    to define freshwater quality; others have combined statistical techniques, GIS,
    and WQI. Many scientists have investigated the properties of water hydrochemistry
    and the main mechanisms of regulation of freshwater hydrochemistry [37,38,39,40].
    The use of the Piper diagram helps to determine the chemical parameters of GW
    [41] and SW [12]. Some researchers used PCA to complement diagrams such as Wilcox,
    Riverside, Stiff, Schöeller Berkaloff, Piper, and Durov plots [42,43,44,45]. Therefore,
    the integration of hydrochemical, PCA, and GIS techniques [46] or the integration
    of hydrochemical, WQI, and PCA techniques could help to study the origin, evolution,
    and interaction processes [47,48,49]. GW and SW are interconnected in a river
    basin [5], where they mix with longitudinal and transverse flows [50]. These GW–SW
    interactions result in high biogeochemical activity, chemical transformations,
    and GW contamination if the SW is polluted [51,52,53]. Understanding the interactions
    between SW and GW is of paramount importance for the monitoring and control of
    water resources and the protection of ecosystems [54]. For that, several methods
    were developed to study GW–SW interaction patterns [55,56,57]. As a result, the
    combination of different approaches is recommended and highlighted in recent studies
    [58,59], with the aim to protect water resources and understand the parameters
    and processes influencing the GW–SW interaction [60,61]. In Morocco, several studies
    have been carried out on seawater intrusion in GW [62,63,64,65,66], while other
    studies have been carried out on assessment of GW quality and recharge mechanisms
    [67], and prediction of the WQI for the GW with multi-layer perceptron approaches
    [68]. However, few studies have been carried out on GW–SW interaction models [69].
    As a result, the goals of this work were to combine hydrochemical, WQI, IWQI,
    PCA, and GIS-based (IDW) interpolation to describe the geographical interaction
    of SW and GW hydrochemistry and to uncover spatial patterns. In our work, the
    GW and SW quality was assessed on water samples from wells and rivers in the study
    area and on 16 parameters from 20 sampling sites in order to evaluate spatial
    variations in GW and SW. This study seeks to assist water authorities and managers
    in establishing priorities, making informed decisions to improve the quality of
    GW and SW. This research is an exploratory study, the first in the area, in which
    we have tried to investigate the interaction of the surface water of the river
    contaminated by discharges from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with the
    shallow groundwater on a strip of 100 m on either side of the river to understand
    the transverse and longitudinal dispersion of this pollution. The Ouljat Echatt
    river is a concern for decision-makers, and implementing this study is considered
    an innovation for the management of water quality in the region. We can also apply
    it to other regions with similar conditions for maintaining the principles of
    sustainable development. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area Tangier-Tetouan-Al
    Hoceima is in northwest of Morocco. It is one of the twelve regions of the Kingdom
    of Morocco. Its capital is Tangier-Assilah. The region covers an area of 17,262
    km2, representing 2.43% of the national territory. The Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima
    region retains its place among the leading growth regions, marking a growth rate
    higher than the national average [70]. Far from the city of Tangier, about 17
    km on the national road number 2, is the study site. It includes the Ouljat Echatt
    river which passes next to the municipality of Hakama, as well as GW on either
    side of the river downhill of the WWTP discharges [10,11,22]. This WWTP treats
    effluents rejected by the industrial zone of Tangier Automotive City (Figure 1
    and Figure 2). Figure 1. The situation of the study zone and the surveyed station.
    Figure 2. Sampling sites of water points in the watershed. 2.2. Climate The climate
    in the north of Morocco is of subhumid Mediterranean type; the winter is humid
    and mild, and the summer is dry and hot [11]. Average rainfall in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al
    Hoceima region is around 700 mm; the wettest year was 1963 with a height of 1248
    mm, while the driest year was 1973 with only 412 mm. Moreover, the importance
    of occult precipitation, such as fog, mist, dew which softens the climate outside
    the wet season, should be noted. 2.3. Geology and Hydrogeology The research region
    belongs to the geological section of the Rif domain, with flysch nappes in the
    exterior Rif, which is depicted in this region by the Tangier unit. This is the
    flysch nappe substratum. The research area comprises flysch outcrops, extensive
    outcrops of the predominantly clayey Tangier unit, which is part of the external
    Rif, and some mainly alluvial quaternary formation strategies to alleviate this
    environmental issue [71]. 2.4. Sampling, Laboratory Analysis and Analytical Method
    During the years 2021 and 2022, sampling was carried out in the research region
    (Figure 1 and Figure 2). There were nine GW samples and eleven SW samples collected,
    as well as 16 physical and chemical parameters assessed. The samples were identified
    using technical sampling sheets (date, time of sampling, number, and Lambert coordinates).
    Table 1 presents the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites. Table 1. Geographic
    coordinates of river and wells samples. The stations for sampling were chosen
    with little variation. While the sample was collected in temperatures ranging
    from 0 to 4 degrees Celsius were used for transportation and storage [72]. Temperature,
    pH, DO, Turb, and EC analysis were measured in situ to prevent any modification
    of the sample parameters. Table 2 presents parameters measured for each sample
    and the used analytical methods [73]. Table 2. List of the in situ and laboratory
    analysis. For the study of the GW–SW interaction, we exploited the data and adopted
    a methodology based on hydrochemical modeling, PCA, WQI, irrigation indices, GIS-based
    Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation, and regression analysis. Figure 3 shows
    the distances between the wells and the river boundary. Figure 3. Schematic section
    showing the distances between the wells and the river boundary. 2.5. Water Quality
    Index (WQI) Studies have used freshwater quality evaluation techniques [19,76],
    and the WQI is a simple and efficient method [12,17,22,77,78,79]. The WQI explains
    water quality using a number of indices that reflect water quality for users and
    consumers [80]. The WQI can be used for GW (GWQI) [22] or for SW (SWQI) [12].
    When developing a WQI, the importance of different parameters affecting water
    quality depends on the intended water use [81]. The WQI has the advantage of minimizing
    the number of water parameters used in an assessment and providing a single value.
    This value is a simplified and logical expression that expresses the average quality
    of water at a specific time based on the analytical values of physico-chemical
    parameters. In this study, the estimates of the GWQI and SWQI were based on the
    suitability of the samples for consumption and other household uses. The WQI calculations
    involved the following steps. First, the sixteen analyzed parameters were weighted
    (wi) according to their importance in drinking water quality assessments. The
    parameters were weighted between 1 and 4 according to their importance in drinking
    water assessments, such as knowledge of the hydrological framework of the study
    area, while taking into account macronutrients [82]. The arithmetic weighted index
    (WQI) was used to calculate the results in this paper. This approach assigns weight
    to chemical characteristics based on subjective criteria [83]. The WQI was calculated
    in five phases, as stated below [84]: The relative weights (Wi) for each of the
    parameters were estimated (Equation (1)). Wi= wi ∑ n k=0 wi (1) The quality score
    was determined (Equation (2)): Qi= Ci Si ×100 (2) The Qi was calculated according
    to Equation (3): Qi= (CpH−8.5) (6.5−8.5) (3) “SI” was calculated following Equation
    (4). SI=Wi×Qi (4) The WQI was calculated with Equation (5): WQI= ∑ n k=1 Wi×Qi=
    ∑ n 1 SI (5) According to the calculated GWQI and SWQI value [85], the GW and
    SW quality is shown in Table 3. Table 3. The WQI categories [86]. 2.6. Water for
    Irrigation Use (IWQI) Water quality is thus an important element in the sustainable
    use of water for irrigation, particularly in cases where salinity development
    is expected to be a problem in an irrigated agricultural area. The hydrochemical
    characteristics of the main GW and SW variables are used in this evaluation to
    determine the suitability for irrigation [87]. The next paragraph provides a number
    of calculations that may assist in establishing the suitability of irrigation
    water. Equation (6) was used to calculate the sodium adsorption rate SAR [87],
    which is defined as the salt risk associated with calcium and magnesium concentrations
    [88]. SAR= Na + Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ 2 − − − − − − − − − √ (6) RSC=[( HCO 3 − + CO 3
    − )−( Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ )] (7) Na%= ( Na + + K + )∗100 ( Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ + Na + + K
    + ) (8) MH= ( Mg 2+ ∗100) ( Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ ) (9) PI= ( Na + + HCO 3 − − − − − −
    − − √ )∗100 ( Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ + Na + ) (10) KI= Na + Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ (11) PS= Cl −
    + 1 2 SO 4 2− (12) RSBC= HCO 3 − − Ca 2+ (13) Equation (7) was used to calculate
    the RSC, which plays an important part of irrigation water. In addition, there
    is another approach, which is widely used to understand the effects of excess
    calcium and magnesium on soil [89]. The risk of magnesium (MH) (Equation (9)),
    and the percentage of sodium (%Na) (Equation (8)), are important parameters that
    can be used to evaluate the quality of GW and its appropriateness for irrigation
    purposes. A well-known classification was developed by Wilcox [90], which has
    been documented and used in the literature for a long time. The GW and SW were
    classified into five classes of Equations (8) and (9) [91]. PI is an index for
    the permeability of water in soil (Equation (10)) [92]. Sodium, when compared
    to Ca2+ and Mg2+, KI > 1 indicates an excess of salt, whereas a KI < 2 indicates
    a shortfall in water (Equation (11)) [88]. Salinity potential (PS) (Equation (12))
    refers to the quantity of salt that builds up in the soil, which is constantly
    dissolved in irrigation water, increasing salinity as determined by the formula
    below [88]. Since most natural waters do not have substantial levels of carbonate
    ions and bicarbonate ions do not precipitate magnesium ions, the alkalinity hazard
    was measured by an indicator known as residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC) and calculated
    using (Equation (13), Table 4) [89]. Table 4. Calculating irrigation quality parameters
    and classification of water. 2.7. Multivariate Statistical Analysis (MSA) and
    the Geological Information System (GIS) Our work examined 16 physical-chemical
    parameters from 9 wells and 11 source sites from the Ouljat Echatt river, including:
    pH, T, EC, DO, TH, TURB, TDS, cations: K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and anions: Cl−, HCO3−,
    CO32−, NO3−, SO42−, which are used for PCA [99]. We used the program Arc GIS 10.6.1
    for data input, analysis, and mapping. This method originated in mining and geological
    engineering based on locations weighted only by distance [100,101]. The value
    obtained from the known location was used to estimate the value of a variable
    at some new locations. The IDW approach was implemented using ArcGIS 10.6’s Spatial
    Analyst Extension. The experimental results from the laboratory study of water
    samples collected from well sites and along the river were combined into an Excel
    file, which was then translated into a shapefile. The overage of the data found
    from the measured sites for each parameter was applied in the numerical calculation
    of each interpolated cell, and the river network was used for the mask. On the
    output raster, the cells corresponding to the Ouljat Echatt watershed region became
    the values of the first input raster. Water quality classifications were based
    on the geographic distribution of pollutants, with a map legend based on each
    parameter’s data range. IDW interpolation is a technique that is largely used
    in the mapping of variables. It is an exact and convex interpolation method that
    fits only the continuous model of spatial variation. This method is based on locations
    weighted only by distance. The value obtained from the known location was used
    to estimate the value of a variable at some new locations. 3. Results and Discussion
    3.1. Hydrochemical Data Correlation Understanding freshwater hydrochemical characteristics
    is crucial for the preservation of the water resources in this work, and the chemical
    elements of freshwaters are considered valuable information on the suitability
    of various uses. We sought to assess the quality of GW–SW based on the distribution
    of cations and anions in GW–SW downstream of treated wastewater discharges from
    the TAC industrial zone. The hydrochemical characteristics of the GW of the Jouamaa
    Hakama site and Ouljat Echatt River water showed variable hydrochemical characteristics.
    The pH of GW values was between 7.79 and 6.91, while the waters of the Ouljat
    Echatt River had a pH between 7.31 and 6.9. The average pH of GW was 7.38, which
    is higher than that of SW (pH = 7.10). The EC values of the GW were between 806
    μS/cm and 1337 μS/cm, with a mean value of 1768 μS/cm, while SW values were between
    878 μS/cm and 1205 μS/cm with an average of 1089.36 μS/cm. EC values of surface
    and groundwater were higher than the WHO limit of 1000 μS/cm in some samples.
    The TSD values of GW were between 515.84 mg/L and 1131.52 mg/L with an average
    of 855.68 mg/L, while SW values were between 561.92 mg/L and 771.2 mg/L with an
    average of 697.19 mg/L (Table 4). The Cl− values of GW and river water averaged
    around 205.1 and 153.5 mg/L, respectively. GW and river water NO3− values averaged
    around 26 and 28.9 mg/L, respectively. GW and river water SO42− values averaged
    around 82.3 and 71.8 mg/L, respectively (Table 5). Table 5. The physicochemical
    measurement results of 20 sampling river. GW HCO3− concentration values were between
    7.6 and 30.5 mg/L with an average of 13.6, while the concentration at SW were
    between 7.6 and 15.3 with an average of 8.3. GW CO32− values were between 26.3
    and 93.8 with an average of 62.1 while SW values were between 37.5 and 78.8 with
    an average of 64.1 (Table 5 and Table 6). GW Ca2+ values were between 16 and 80
    with an average of 50.2 mg/L while SW values were between 32 and 52 with an average
    of 41.8 mg/L. GW Mg2+ values were between 24 and 50.4 with an average of 36.3
    mg/L while SW values were between 10.8 and 21.6 with an average of 16.3 mg/L.
    The GW Na+ values were between 55.5 and 135.5 with the average of 100.2 mg/L while
    the SW values were between 71.2 and 135.5 and the average was 112.4 mg/L. GW K+
    values were between 0.4 and 5.1 and with a mean of 2.3 mg/L while SW values were
    between 7.5 and 12.5 and with a mean of 10.1 mg/L (Table 5 and Table 6). The orders
    of major cations and anions in GW were Cl− > CO32− > NO3− > HCO3− > SO42− for
    anions and Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ for cations. At the same time, the orders in
    the water of the Ouljat Echatt River were Cl− > SO42− > CO32− > NO3− > HCO3− for
    anions and Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ for cations. Table 6. The physicochemical measurement
    results of 20 sampling wells. 3.2. Hydrochemical Modeling 3.2.1. Hydrochemical
    Facies Using Piper Diagram Piper’s diagram helped to understand the geochemical
    evolution of GW sample and SW and its relationship with dissolved ions [102].
    To better interpret the chemical composition of the GW sample [103,104,105,106]
    and the SW [12,107,108], anions were plotted on the right triangle while cations
    were plotted on the left [109]. The geochemical evolution of water in general
    (and GW in particular) can be assessed by determining chemical facies using Piper’s
    trilinear diagram (1944) [110]. In the present study, Piper trilinear diagrams
    were plotted using scientific software called “Diagrammes”. Figure 4 shows that
    all samples fall in zone D (sodium-potassium cation facies type) with no magnesium
    or calcium types found on the cation side and zone G (chloride facies type) with
    no bicarbonate and sulfate types found on the anions side. Thus, the chemical
    composition of GW samples in the study area is dominated by strong acids (Cl−)
    and alkalis (Na+, K+). According to the diamond diagram, all the samples were
    found in zone I (chloride, calcium sulfate, and magnesium) and II (sodium and
    potassium chloride). Essentially, the majority of the samples were characterized
    by the dominance of (Na+, K+), Cl−, and SO42−, and the Piper diagram revealed
    two types of water. As a result, the GW present facies of the sodium chloride
    to magnesium carbonate type, while SW are of the sodium chloride to magnesium
    sulfate type. Figure 4. Chemical facies of GW–SW of the study area (Piper diagram).
    Piper’s diagram suggests that 77.77% of the GW samples (7 GW samples) belong to
    Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl−-SO42− (field I), demonstrating the dominance of alkaline earths
    over alkali (Ca2+ + Mg2+ > Na+ + K+) and strong acidic anions over weak acidic
    anions (i.e., Cl− + SO42− > HCO3−), while all SW samples belong to Na+, K+, Cl−
    or Na+ and SO42− which are plotted in File II, while 13 samples fell in zone D,
    indicating the dominance of sodium types (11 SW and P3, P6 in GW samples) [111].
    3.2.2. Water Samples Schöeller Berkaloff Diagram and Schöeller Berkaloff Diagram
    for Average Parameters The chemical composition of the GW from the Jouamaa Hakama
    site and the SW from the Ouljat Echatt river sampled has been represented on the
    Schöeller Berkaloff diagram [105,112] (Figure 5). The Schöeller Berkaloff diagram
    for the mean of the parameters reveals that the GW and SW parameters have the
    same pace and that the parameters progress proportionally in the same direction,
    except for Mg2+ which progresses inversely proportional between GW and SW [113].
    The average anion concentrations (SO42−, Cl−, and HCO3−) have been plotted on
    the right side of the figure while the average cation concentrations (Ca2+, Mg2+,
    Na+, and K+) were plotted on the left side of the Figure 5. The Schöeller Berkaloff
    diagram reveals that the Ca2+ concentrations exceeded the concentrations of the
    other cations while the Cl− concentrations exceeded the concentrations of the
    other anions. The major ions in relative abundance are in the order Ca2+ > Mg2+
    > Na+ > K+ for cations and Cl− > HCO3− > SO42− for anions. Figure 5. Water samples
    Schöeller Berkaloff diagram for river (a) and wells (b). 3.3. Groundwater Quality
    Index (GWQI) and Surface Water Quality Index (SWQI) The assessment of SW/GW quality
    was provided using the WQI, which presents a comprehensive picture of the water
    quality [114], because it categorizes water based on pollution levels into four
    groups [115]. Figure 6 shows that the WQI ranged from 55.60 to 208.22, indicating
    that the overall water quality of the river samples represented a value greater
    than 100 (unsuitable quality) (Table 7). Figure 6. Spatial distribution of WQI.

    samples in R1, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R9, R10 and, R11 fell into the unsuitable quality
    category, the same was observed for P6. The highest value of 208.22 was recorded
    in the sample (R2), falling in class 4, which represents very poor water quality
    and requires special attention before use due to high levels of Na+, K+, and CO32−.
    The WQI indicated that 88.89% of the GW samples were poor for drinking (Figure
    6). Compared to previous studies of WQI, we discovered similar results for surface
    water with new study in the north of Morocco [12], which reported that the WQI
    values of the Oued Laou River ranged between 9.01 and 149.27, indicating that
    the overall water quality of the studied river was graded from excellent to very
    poor. while in Tumkur Taluk, Karnataka State, India [116], the results indicated
    that the WQI of GW for these samples ranged from 89.21 to 660.56. 3.4. Irrigation
    Groundwater Water Quality (IGWQI) and Irrigation Water Quality of Surface Water
    (ISWQI) The EC values indicated by salinity damage are essential to evaluating
    the irrigation water [90]. Based on SAR values for the study area, most of the
    samples fell in the high or very high salinity (EC) category, and thus, most of
    the GW and SW can be classified as “doubtful” for irrigation, ranging from values
    of 750 to 2250 μS/cm. This is consistent with Richards’ value, which indicated
    a doubtful water quality for irrigation according to the EC value (Table 8). Table
    8. Water quality parameters for irrigation in study area water samples. SAR is
    used to categorize SW and GW into four groups: “Excellent” (SAR < 10); “Good”
    (10 < SAR <18); “Suspicious” (18 < SAR < 26); and “Unsuitable” (SAR > 26). Water
    sample SAR varied from 2.08 to 6.59 (Table 8). As a result, according to a USSL
    diagram, the categorization of irrigation water quality is in the form of EC against
    SAR values. EC is used as the salinity risk index and SAR gives the sodium risk
    for irrigation water. According to the Richards classification [93], the plot
    revealed that about 100% of the SW and GW samples fell into the C3-S1 category,
    which shows that the SW in the investigated area had a medium salinity and low
    sodium content (Figure 7). The SW in the study area was within a low salinity
    field (<2250 μS/cm), thus the water is highly appropriate for irrigation and the
    SAR class (S1). These findings are in alignment with the Wilcox diagram in Figure
    8. Figure 7. Riverside diagram for GW and river water. Figure 8. Wilcox diagram
    for GW and river water. According to Table 8, the Na% in irrigation water samples
    ranged from 28.89% to 66%, with an average of 52.50%. As a result, the Wilcox
    plot for percent of sodium and total concentration displayed in Figure 8 indicates
    that 50% of the water samples (7 GW and 3 SW samples) were in good condition,
    while 50% were “eligible” with excessive content (2 GW and 8 SW samples). The
    magnesium hazard (MH) parameter was proposed by Paliwal et al. [98]. The MH values
    varied from 31.03 to 71.43%, but only 33.33% of the water samples had a value
    of less than 50 for well samples. Fully 100% of SW was considered suitable for
    irrigation. However, 66.77% of GW had a MH greater than 50. Sodium calculated
    against Ca2+ and Mg2+ was considered by the Kelley index (KI) [96]. Kelly’s ratio
    (KI > 1) indicates an excess level of sodium in water that is unsuitable for irrigation,
    while KI less than 1 is suitable for irrigation uses. According to Kelly’s ratio,
    the samples varied from 0.39 to 1.84 meq/L, which means the majority of samples
    were non-permissible (65%), and just 35% were suitable for irrigation purposes.
    The GW in six samples and one sample of SW (R5) was deemed adequate for irrigation
    [117]. The PI, developed by Doneen et al. [95], can better reflect the effects
    of irrigation, (Table 8). It spanned from 35.04% to 68.40%. Nearly 100% of the
    samples (SW and GW) fell under the Class II category, indicating that the water
    was moderately too good for irrigation purposes. From the results, the RSC values
    ranged from −4.70 to −0.40 meq/L (Table 8). These values are lower than 1.25 meq/L,
    which corresponds to the “safe/good” category according to the classification.
    The residual sodium bicarbonate index (RSBC) is used to determine the risk of
    alkalinity and was proposed by Gupta et al. who classified RSBC into two categories
    and found that RSBC values above 10.0 meq/L affected plant growth in several ways,
    while RSBC values below 5 meq/L were considered satisfactory [97]. In this study,
    the findings indicate that RSBC values varied from −3.63 to −0.68 meq/L (Table
    7), indicating that all samples had RSBC values well below the acceptable level
    and could be safely used for irrigation. One of the classifications used to assess
    the suitability of water for irrigation is potential salinity (PS), which is the
    concentration of Cl− added to half the concentration of SO42−. Among the samples
    examined, the potential salinity varied between 4.27 meq/L and 11.12 meq/L (Table
    8). This indicates that 11.11% of the wells (P1) and 45.45% of the surface waters
    (R5, R8, R9, R10, and R11) are classified as “good” while 54.55% and 88.89% of
    the surface and well samples are classified as “unsuitable” for irrigation (Table
    8) [95]. 3.5. Multivariate Statistical Analysis 3.5.1. Statistical Analysis (PCA)
    Table 9 explains 83.58% of the data’s overall variance. The F1–F2 combination
    represents more than 64.91% of the data (Figure 9). The first component (F1) represented
    41.73% of the total variation, with significant positive loadings of EC, TDS,
    Ca2+, Mg2+, and TH and moderate loadings of pH and HCO3−. This component indicates
    that EC in SW is influenced by the amounts of TDS, Ca2+, and Mg2+. This component’s
    substantial Ca2+ loading may explain why Ca2+ predominates in SW samples over
    Mg2+. This component is generally associated with anthropogenic contamination.
    The presence of Mg2+ ions in the research area suggests that they were formed
    as a result of interactions between the dolomitic limestone and water. Figure
    9. Parameters correlation of GW–SW quality based on PCA. Table 9. Correlation
    between the physical and chemical parameters. The presence of CO32− and HCO3−
    in this component suggests that SW alkalinity is related to bicarbonate ions,
    which is the result of a natural disintegration process of the calcareous sedimentary
    rocks and anthropogenic. The HCO3− has a moderate loading on the F1 factor, indicating
    that it was formed through weathering, carbonate dissolution, and bacterial decomposition
    of organic pollution, among other processes [12]. Stations R4, R5, R8, R9, R10,
    R11, P6, P7, P8, and P9 also had the greatest impact on the F1 score. With moderate
    positive loadings of T, CO32−, K+, SO42−, and TURB, the second component (F2)
    explains 23.179% of the overall variance, although SO42− is primarily derived
    from soluble inorganic nitrogen and inorganic salts. Additionally, this important
    T value is due to the depth of the wells. Stations P1, P2, P3, R3, R6, and R7
    had the greatest influence on the F2 score. F3 accounts for 11.041% of total variability
    and is distinguished by significant positive Na+ and Cl− loading. The presence
    of Na+ in this component suggests that the primary ions at the research site regulate
    surface water mineralization. This is what we noticed in station P4, which accounted
    for the majority of factor F3. The fourth component (F4) indicates that NO3− with
    a moderate load caused 7.628% of the total variance, which is mostly associated
    with the use of fertilizers and wastewater, while the significant positive loading
    of DO for this component could indicate a fluctuation of nitrates in surface waters.
    Stations R1, R2, and P5 accounted for the majority of F4 scores. The positive
    charge for factors 1 and 2 is more important than for 3 and 4. This indicates
    that they are the result of rock–water interaction in the GW–SW interaction and
    that anthropogenic activities can have a considerable impact. 3.5.2. Pearson’s
    Coefficient of Correlation (r) Based on the analysis of the Pearson correlation
    matrix in Table 9, the significant correlation coefficient between EC and TDS
    suggests that water conductivity depends on TDS, while EC and TDS had positive
    correlations with Ca2+, Mg2+, pH, Cl−, HCO3−, CO32−, TH, and SO42− which gives
    information about salinity and mineralization of GW and SW [118,119]. A moderate
    correlation (r > 0.5) was observed between Ca2+ and Mg2+, indicating that water
    TH is defined as the combined concentration of calcium and magnesium ions in water
    samples. SW was high in Na+, NO3−, Cl− and SO42−. pH is moderately correlated
    with EC, TDS, TH, HCO3−, NO3−, and Cl− (but negatively correlated with K+ (r =
    −0.450), indicating that pH affects the release or dissolution of K+, Na+, NO3−,
    and Cl− in solution. There was also a significant positive correlation (r = 0.703)
    between Ca2+ and (HCO3− and CO32−), indicating the geogenic origin of GW contamination.
    Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between Ca2+ and SO42−, indicating
    that common sources are the primary source of GW pollution, especially in our
    area which is close to industrial activities. There was a strong positive correlation
    among Mg2+, Ca2+, and TH; on the other hand, a negative correlation was observed
    between Mg2+ and K+. This implies that these cations possibly originate from the
    same source. In addition, a strong correlation was observed between Na+ and SO42−.
    The association of HCO3− and Mg2+, as well as an additional source of CO32− most
    likely resulting from the dissolution of calcite. It is thought that dolomite
    enriches GW with Mg2+, HCO3−, and CO32−. The authors of [120,121] discovered comparable
    results regarding the correlation between SO42− and K+. The pH showed a positive
    and significant correlation with Ca2+ (r = 0.509), Mg2+ (r = 0.498), and HCO3−
    (r = 0.529). These correlation results indicated mixed sources of either geogenic
    or anthropogenic origin. 3.6. Distribution of the Main Ion Concentrations according
    to the Distance from the River The interaction between SW and GW samples was compared
    using linear regression of the samples from the wells and the river two by two
    along the segment of the river downstream of the WWTP, which gave a significant
    coefficient of determination, R2 = 85.6%. (Figure 10). Logarithmic regression
    was also established based on the observation of hydrochemical parameters to investigate
    the interactions between SW and GW by comparing the concentration of each parameter
    moving away from the riverbed towards the wells in a band of 100 m on either side
    of the river, which showed different R2 values ranging from 50% to 83% along the
    river (Figure 11). Figure 10. Spatial variations of major ion concentrations in
    river water. Figure 11. Plots of major ion concentrations in groundwater vs. distance
    from river. According to the logarithmic regression analysis, we can conclude
    that the wells near the river showed higher R2 values (P6–P8) than those at a
    big distance (P3, P4). The IDW expressed as a transverse and longitudinal gradient
    and the higher logarithmic regression coefficients (R2 > 0.70) of Mg2+, K+, NO3−,
    and HCO3− indicate that SW and GW interact, which enables us to deduce clear information
    about the types of variables that impact the interaction (the distance between
    the river and well). 3.7. Interpretation for GW–SW Interactions with Hydrochemical
    Data According to Figure 12, the hydrochemical parameters are positively correlated
    with a strong significance (R2 = 0.85), which explains the interaction between
    the GW of the Jouamaa Hakama site and the SW of the Ouljat Echatt River. In addition,
    interpolation (IDW) of the different parameters analyzed in this study shows a
    cross-gradient (transverse gradient) between GW and SW (Figure 13), which explains
    the GW–SW connection along the 100 m strip on both sides of the river downstream
    WWTP discharges. We can note that the intensity and significant concentrations
    of the parameters are high in the wells that are near the river (Figure 11). Figure
    12. (a) Ionic concentrations average in the GW and SW. (b) Correlation between
    Ionic concentrations average in GW and SW. Figure 13. Spatial distribution map
    of GW and SW for cations and anions. The similarity in the concentration of the
    majority of freshwater hydrochemical parameters in the river basin demonstrated
    the hydrological connectivity between GW and SW on the strip at a distance of
    100 m left and right of the river. According to WQI, the GW in the GW–SW connection
    band was evaluated as having poor to very poor qualities in all wells. We report
    that the well number 6 closest to the river is of unsuitable quality for consumption.
    Additionally, the WQI of the different sampling points of the river is all of
    unsuitable quality. 4. Conclusions Water stress, pollution by various anthropogenic
    activities, and climate change are current issues. These changes affect the quality
    of the water, which has negative effects on human health and the environment.
    In Morocco, a large number of people use the inland water for drinking and other
    purposes in both urban and rural areas. For that reason, this study aims to assess
    and identify the interaction between SW and GW to assess the sources of surface
    water pollution from the downstream discharges from the WWTP treated effluents
    from the TAC industrial zone in northern Morocco and determine the interference
    of polluted SW with shallow aquifer waters. This situation will require control
    and permanent monitoring because it is a major hydric resource management problem.
    Freshwater hydrochemistry was examined to identify interactions between the Ouljat
    Echatt River SW and GW of the Jouamaa Hakama site. Spatial analysis of hydrochemical
    data of well water (9 well water samples) and Ouljat Echatt river water (11 SW
    samples) was done using hydrochemical methods, WQI and IWQI, multivariate statistics,
    and GIS-based Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation. A total of 16 physicochemical
    parameters were analyzed, and an assessment of the surface water adequacy of irrigation
    was carried out. This study examined freshwater hydrochemistry to identify interactions
    between the Ouljat Echatt River SW and GW of the Jouamaa Hakama site. The work
    was carried out downstream of the discharges from the WWTP treated effluents from
    the TAC industrial zone in northern Morocco. Spatial analysis of hydrochemical
    data of well water (nine well water samples) and Ouljat Echatt river water (eleven
    SW samples) was undertaken using a methodology based on hydrochemical modeling
    (HM) and PCA, WQI, irrigation indices, GIS-based Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation,
    and regression analysis. The results indicated that the major ions found in GW
    and SW were characterized in a different order in the anion list order Cl− > CO32−
    > NO3− > HCO3− > SO42− and Cl− > SO42− > CO32− > NO3− > HCO3−, respectively, while
    the concentrations of cations showed the same order for both: Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+
    > K+. As a result, GW showed in the Piper diagram as the sodium chloride to magnesium
    carbonate type, while SW belonged to the sodium chloride to magnesium sulfate
    type. According to the WQI calculated, the total well samples were rated as poor
    and very poor. In addition, the calculated SWQI was rated as unsuitable for the
    total river samples. The hydrochemical and statistical results suggest that there
    is an interaction between SW and GW along the river segment downstream from the
    industrial area. We report that well number 6, near the river, is unsafe for human
    consumption. Furthermore, the WQI of the river’s many sample stations is all of
    poor quality. Based on the results of hydrochemical parameters, we found a positive
    correlation with a strong significance (R2 = 0.85) that explains the interaction
    between the GW of the Jouamaa Hakama site and the SW of the Ouljat Echatt River.
    In addition, interpolation (IDW) of the different parameters analyzed in this
    study shows a transverse gradient between GW and SW, which explains the GW–SW
    connection along the 100 m strip on both sides of the river. We can also remark
    that the intensity and significant concentrations of the parameters are high in
    the wells that are near the river. According to the logarithmic regression analysis,
    we can conclude that the wells near the river showed higher R2 values (P6–P8)
    than those at a big distance (P3, P4). The IDW expressed as a transverse and longitudinal
    gradient and the higher logarithmic regression coefficients (R2 > 0.70) of Mg2+,
    K+, NO3−, and HCO3− indicate that SW and GW interact, which enables us to deduce
    clear information about the types of variables that impact the interaction (the
    distance between the river and well). Through these results, the use of emerging
    techniques and mathematical models makes it possible to characterize the quality
    of land waters and shows the importance of an approach combining hydrochemical
    data interpreted by multivariate statistics and GIS techniques for the assessment
    of GW–SW interaction in downstream treated discharges from the TAC industrial
    zone in northern Morocco. Accordingly, policymakers and water managers in Morocco
    can use the results derived from a new coupled framework to achieve sustainable
    GW and SW management, prevent anthropogenic activities nationwide, and consolidate
    bases of sustainable development. This technique is intended to provide an accurate
    representation of the interaction between SW and GW; this is why it is highly
    recommended that it be applied to other studies with similar areas to monitor
    the state of water resources in Morocco. Other investigations, such as heavy metal
    analysis and bacteriological analysis, are required to fully understand the interaction
    of GW and SW as well as the influence of surface water on groundwater, which can
    be confirmed by repeat sampling. If no measures are taken to limit river degradation,
    the pollution will eventually be diffused into the underground waters beyond the
    100 m band studied. Basically, to prevent the contamination of groundwater by
    polluted surface water, it is necessary to use the process of bioremediation,
    which involves using plants to extract the contamination from surface water in
    the rhizosphere by using their roots. Additionally, digging wells farther from
    the river at a distance greater than 100 m can another solution, as well as using
    chlorine for water treatment and biological filters such as reeds. Author Contributions

  description: Burgeoning population growth and subsequent demand for freshwater,
    besides competition among irrigation, domestic, and industrial sectors, coupled

    It was observed that runoff is the prime factor in determining the location of
    RWH structures compared to other parameters. It was revealed that 75.54 km2 (13%
    of the total area) was very highly suited for the construction of RWH structures,
    while 114.56 km2 (19%) was highly suitable. A total of 43.77 km2 (7%) of land
    was determined to be unsuitable for the construction of any type of RWH structure.

    Furthermore, Boolean logic was used to target a particular type of RWH structure.
    The study indicated that a total of 25 farm ponds, 14 check dams, and 16 percolation
    ponds can be constructed at identified locations in the watershed. Water resource

    2022 Introduction Exponential population growth over the last several decades
    has resulted in a massive increase in the world’s water demand. Water shortages
    and water quality challenges are threatening global food security. In the last
    two decades, the average annual per capita availability of global freshwater has
    decreased by nearly 20% (FAO 2003). Rapid population expansion, economic development,
    and climate change have the potential to cause serious water shortages in large
    parts of Asia (Chen et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2022). Several countries around the
    world, including India, would be most affected, with a possible GDP (gross domestic
    product) decline of up to 6% or more (World Bank 2016). By the year 2025, India
    will be in a water stress zone, and by the year 2050, it will be in a water scarcity
    zone (Ibrahim-Bathis and Ahmed 2016). Over-use of groundwater, low water table
    levels, and poor water quality will exacerbate this problem further (Singh and
    Singh 2002; World Bank 2016). Rainfall distribution in India is not uniform. About
    80% of total annual rainfall is received within four monsoon months from June
    to September (Kumar et al. 2010; Panda and Sahu 2019; Ossandón et al. 2022). Arid
    and semi-arid climatic regions in general and the Rajasthan state of India in
    particular are constantly affected by water scarcity for various purposes because
    of uneven rainfall occurrences due to uncertain monsoon patterns. Rajasthan receives
    low and variable rainfall and is thereby highly prone to recurring droughts (Dhorde
    and Patel 2016; Chahal et al. 2021). Unpredictable rainfall patterns may cause
    major soil moisture shortages in agriculture, leading to concerns about food security
    (Riaz et al. 2020). Therefore, sustainable water resource management in the agriculture
    sector is vital for the socio-economic development of the country (Ramakrishnan
    et al. 2009; Riaz et al. 2020). In order to mitigate the adverse effects of incessant
    droughts, rainwater harvesting (RWH) as well as its efficient utilization is a
    time-tested mechanism which should be practiced on a large scale depending on
    its suitability. Plant production can be increased significantly in drought-prone
    areas by collecting the rainfall and resulting runoff using water harvesting structures
    (Samra et al. 2002; Yazar et al. 2014; Gaaloul et al. 2021). This runoff captured
    by rainwater harvesting structures (RWHS) will be used during critical growth
    stages and prolonged dry spells of crops as supplemental irrigation. Storage of
    surface runoff may be accomplished by the construction of suitable RWHS, i.e.,
    ex situ or through appropriate adjustments in land management practices for in
    situ soil moisture conservation activities (Ramakrishnan et al. 2009; Jha et al.
    2014). Moreover, RWHS not only reduce excessive runoff and floods in the downstream
    catchment but also improves soil moisture in the crop root zone for plant growth
    (Ammar et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018). Identifying potential RWHS locations is a
    critical first step in increasing water availability and land productivity in
    semi-arid environments (Rodriguez and Mokrova 2020; Doulabian et al. 2021). However,
    selecting proper sites for various RWHS on a regional or watershed scale is extremely
    difficult because of the non-availability of land topology, slope, soil texture,
    and biophysical, socio-economic, and hydro-meteorological data (Mbilinyi et al.
    2007). The identification of suitable sites and their design are the two key factors
    behind the success of RWH systems (Al-Adamat et al. 2010). Field survey is the
    widely used approach for locating suitable sites for RWHS in small areas, but
    the selection of appropriate sites in larger areas is a great challenge (Ammar
    et al. 2016; Sethi et al. 2020; Doulabian et al. 2021). Also, it requires detailed
    survey and point data with spatial and temporal variation, which is a time-consuming
    and costly task. In recent years, geospatial technologies such as RS and GIS are
    being recognized as effective tools for demarcating RWH potential zones and identifying
    sites for RWHS (Chowdary et al. 2013; Jha et al. 2014; Mahmoud and Tang 2015;
    Kumar and Jhariya 2017; Singh et al. 2017; Singhai et al. 2019). The type of RWH
    structure and its exact location is decided based upon the soil texture, slope,
    and land cover/land use characteristics besides the requirement of other factors
    like water and land rights, as well as other socio-economic factors. Kahinda et
    al. (2008) developed a RWH suitability model for in situ and ex situ RWHS by taking
    physical, ecological, and socio-economic factors into account. The model was validated
    by locating sites for in situ and ex situ RWHS in South Africa. Javed and Wani
    (2009) demarcated the Kakund watershed located in eastern Rajasthan into various
    groundwater potential zones using geospatial techniques. The watershed is drained
    by the Kakund River, a tributary of the Gambhir River. Groundwater potential is
    found to be very good in only 10.99% of the area, moderate in 35.41%, poor in
    49.04%, and very poor in the remaining 4.57% of the area. Ziadat et al. (2012)
    developed a participatory GIS and field survey approach to assess the feasibility
    of several RWH measures. RWH measures increased water productivity by four times
    and decreased soil erosion by five times, compared to farms without RWH measures.
    The study illustrated how a participative GIS approach might assist in locating
    RWH measures in a timely manner. Dhakate et al. (2013) carried out integrated
    hydrological, geophysical, and groundwater modelling studies at the Raja Ramanna
    Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Campus, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India,
    to identify potential areas for RWH structures for groundwater augmentation. Ten
    check dams, two contour bunds, and one earthen bund were suggested on existing
    stream courses and valley fills, respectively. Mahmoud and Tang (2015) identified
    potential areas for RWH in the UK by developing site suitability maps using GIS
    and RS-assisted decision support system (DSS). The developed DSS combined various
    thematic maps including slope, rainfall surplus, soil texture, land use/land cover,
    and curve number. Tiwari et al. (2018) developed a GIS-based algorithm for locating
    potential sites for RWHS using thematic maps of surface elevation, land use/land
    cover, soil texture, drainage, and surface depression data. Locations in natural
    topological depressions were chosen to reduce the cost of the RWHS. Adham et al.
    (2018) incorporated various biophysical parameters using a suitability model developed
    using Model Builder built-in macro of ArcGIS to identify potential dam locations.
    The parameters considered were slope, soil texture, runoff depth, land use, and
    stream order. Mugo and Odera (2019) conceptualized an approach to select potential
    sites for RWHS using geospatial techniques in Kiambu County, Kenya. The contour
    bunds, contour ridges, bench terraces, percolation tanks, and check dams were
    targeted in the study region. The western highlands of Kenya were recommended
    to be unsuitable for any kind of rainwater harvesting structure. Site suitability
    analysis is critical for accurately determining the location and type of rainwater
    harvesting measures at the watershed scale (Al-Shamiri and Ziadat 2012; Ammar
    et al. 2016). Unfortunately, the arid and semi-arid regions are devoid of desired
    data to target the RWHS, and the creation of primary data is often costly and
    time-consuming (Al-Shamiri 2012; Mallick et al. 2019). GIS and RS can address
    the challenges of missing data required for the selection of potential sites for
    RWH, especially in arid and semi-arid regions (Adham et al. 2018; Al-Ghobari and
    Dewidar 2021). Ammar et al. (2016) suggested that multi-criteria decision analysis
    combined with the GIS tool can be the best alternative for locating appropriate
    sites for water harvesting in data-scarce regions. AHP is the most effective decision-making
    technique for locating potential sites for RWH using the GIS platform (Wu et al.
    2018). The likelihood that bias in the weights will be reduced by pairwise comparison
    makes AHP a more effective MCA technique (Tsiko and Haile 2011; Ammar et al. 2016).
    AHP-based multi-criteria decision analysis and GIS techniques have been used in
    different studies (Chowdhury et al. 2010; Jha et al. 2014; Krois and Schulte 2014;
    Akter and Ahmed 2015; Mahmoud et al. 2016). Haile and Suryabhagavan (2018) used
    AHP and fuzzy extent analysis to develop a RWH site suitability model to identify
    possible RWH zones in the Arsi Zone of Central Ethiopia. Toosi et al. (2020) developed
    a GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis for identifying suitable RWH locations
    by combining socio-economic factors in the Mashhad Plain Basin located in northeast
    Iran. Alwan et al.(2020) used a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation technique
    to identify the potential RWH locations in Maysan province, Iraq. Matomela et
    al. (2020) identified potential locations for RWHS using integrated AHP, RS, and
    GIS approaches. They considered both biophysical and socio-economic factors for
    locating RWHS. The study identified 11 locations for check dams and 3 locations
    for percolation tanks. Chowdhury and Paul (2021) identified suitable sites for
    RWHS using fuzzy AHP and geospatial techniques. The fuzzy gamma operator was used
    to incorporate these parameters in order to identify the best RWH locations. They
    considered seven criteria including slope, stream order, soil type, precipitation,
    evaporation, roadways, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
    Ezzeldin et al. (2022) evaluated the biophysical and socio-economic features of
    the study area to establish the best strategy for implementing RWHS. The potential
    site for locating RWHS is optimized using a weighted linear combination, Boolean
    analysis, and the depression depth technique. In order to create a sustainable
    RWH plan, the study’s findings were tied to sustainable development goals. However,
    very few researchers have attempted an integrated multi-criteria decision analysis
    and Boolean logic approach along with geospatial tools using high-resolution satellite
    data for targeting and designing RWHS. It has been found that the area under study
    experiences water scarcity for domestic and irrigation use, especially during
    dry seasons. This problem is only expected to worsen in the near future as a result
    of climate change if suitable rainwater harvesting techniques are not implemented
    soon. Water availability is a perennial issue in the Gambhir watershed, which
    receives a reasonable amount of rainfall and could be harvested in RWH structures
    to help not only in storing and recharging groundwater but also in halting resource
    degradation and providing supplemental irrigation. Detailed examination of long-term
    water level data for the last 10 years (2005–2014) shows that the groundwater
    level of Hindaun tehsil, which lies in the Gambhir watershed, was decreasing by
    14 cm/year (CGWB 2017), which is much higher than the average depletion rate (4.0 ± 1.0
    cm/year) of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi (Rodell et al. 2009), which
    are the states where the groundwater draft is highest in the country. A review
    of the literature ascertained the use of geospatial tools to choose suitable RWH
    zones to tackle the water scarcity problems arising due to climate change. A hybrid,
    time-saving, and cost-effective methodology comprising AHP and Boolean logic with
    high-resolution satellite data and a GIS-based weighted linear combination (WLC)
    method is used in this study to locate a potential location for constructing RWH
    structures in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan. The accuracy of site selection
    was further improved by using depression layer extracted from digital elevation
    model (DEM) and flow accumulation layer to select only those sites which are in
    depression and where the flow accumulation is more. Keeping in view of the above
    facts, the present study was undertaken in the Gambhir watershed, Rajasthan, India,
    to delineate suitable zones for RWH, to identify and delineate suitable areas
    and locations for different types of RWHS, besides targeting different water conservation
    structures in the watershed. Materials and methods Study area The present study
    was carried out in an ungauged Gambhir watershed located in Rajasthan, India.
    It is situated in the eastern Rajasthan districts of Karauli and Bharatpur, in
    the foothills of the Aravallis. The study area encompasses the latitude of 26°
    36′ 0.8″ N to 26° 57′ 35″ N and the longitude of 77° 0′ 2″ E to 77° 16′ 54″ E.
    The location map of the study areas is shown in Fig. 1. The study area drains
    into Gambhir River also known as Utangan River. The Gambhir River, one of the
    tributaries of Yamuna River, originates in the hills near Karauli village in the
    Sawai Madhopur district. The Gambhir watershed has an area of 602.24 km2 and is
    situated at 196 to 394 m above mean sea level. Summer temperatures vary between
    25 to 45 °C, whereas winter temperatures range from 5 to 23 °C. Annual potential
    evapotranspiration was estimated to be 1502.6 mm (CGWB 2017). Rainfall in this
    area is inconsistent in nature which varies with space as well as time resulting
    in significant water shortages, particularly during the post-monsoon season. The
    mean annual rainfall was 658 mm with a minimum of 359 mm in 2015 and a maximum
    of 842 mm in 2016 during a period of 11 years (2007–2017). About 91% of the total
    rainfall occurs in 4 months between June and September while the remaining 8 months
    receive only 9% of the total rainfall. Due to this reason, there is an acute shortage
    of water in the non-monsoon months (October–May). The water scarcity problem in
    the study area is further aggravated due to the low water holding capacity and
    high hydraulic conductivity (K) of the soils. Therefore, the mustard crop, which
    requires very less water and is tolerant to salinity, is widely grown in the area
    during the rabi (November–April) cropping season. The area under vegetables and
    other rabi crops is also very limited due to water scarcity. Most of the area
    relies on rainfall and groundwater pumping for irrigation. Farmers with a tube
    well facility cultivate cash crops while the farmers in rainfed areas practice
    a single cropping system. The kharif cropping season (June to September) in the
    experimental watershed is predominantly rainfed with occasional rainfall excesses
    that may be conserved in the specially designed and constructed RWHS with seepage
    prevention techniques. Dry periods are typical in the state, and the state has
    experienced drought and famine conditions on several occasions. Drought strikes
    the state four out of every 5 years, making it the state with the greatest frequency
    of drought in the nation (Hooda 2017; Singh et al. 2021). The entire watershed
    faces the problem of drinking water from March to June every year. Fig. 1 Location

    of the methodology used to find a suitable location and type of RWHS is presented
    in Fig. 2. ALOS (Advanced Land Observation Satellite) of JAXA (Japan Aerospace
    Exploration Agency) digital elevation model (DEM) with 30 m resolution was acquired
    from (https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/index_e.htm) and was analyzed to delineate
    the watershed using Arc-SWAT module. The DEM of the study region and the delineated
    Gambhir watershed are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 2 Flowchart for site suitability of
    RWHS Full size image Fig. 3 Digital elevation model (DEM) of the Gambhir watershed
    Full size image The daily rainfall data for the period 2007–2017 was obtained
    from the Water Resources Department in Jaipur, Rajasthan (https://water.rajasthan.gov.in).
    The soil map of the study watershed was generated using data from the FAO’s Harmonized
    World Soil Database v1.2. High-resolution (10 m) Sentinal-2A satellite data was
    used for the categorization of LULCs (Carrasco et al. 2019; Mitri et al. 2020;
    Zhang et al. 2019; Segarra et al. 2020). Selection of criteria of targeting RWHS
    According to FAO (2003), climate, hydrology, topography, agronomy, soil texture,
    and socio-economics are the six primary factors for choosing RWH locations. In
    the present study, we considered five criteria namely slope, runoff, drainage
    density, LULC, and soil texture based on literature review and availability of
    data. For Rajasthan state in India, the five criteria have been selected using
    the guidelines of the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD 1995),
    FAO (2003), and literature review Mbilinyi et al. (2007), Isioye et al. (2012),
    Kadam et al. (2012), and Krois and Schulte (2014) to identify suitable sites for
    rainwater harvesting. Preparation of different thematic maps Land use/land cover
    map Land use/land cover is one of the most important thematic inputs in any study
    as it provides the present status of land utilization and its pattern. The land
    use/land cover map was prepared using satellite images acquired by the Sentinal-2A
    satellite on January 10, 2019, with a spatial resolution of 10 m. Two satellite
    images covering the study watershed were downloaded from the website (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).
    The software ERDAS Imagine 15 was used to perform radiometric correction, layer
    stacking, and mosaicking on the raw data of Sentinel images (Misra et al. 2020).
    The visual appearance of the satellite imagery was improved using the spatial
    enhancement module of the ERDAS™ Imagine (Hussain et al. 2022). Image processing
    operations, which include atmospheric correction, layer stacking, mosaicking,
    and sub-setting the scene to the delineated base map of the Gambhir watershed,
    were performed in ERDAS™ Imagine software using respective modules. Signature
    files for each class were created for training the areas, and supervised image
    classification was accomplished using the maximum likelihood algorithm. Soil map
    The soil map of the globe was acquired in digital format at a scale of 1:5,000,000
    from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) website (http://www.fao.org).
    The soil map of the Gambhir watershed was clipped from the data obtained from
    Harmonized World Soil Database, FAO using ArcGIS. The dataset provided information
    on various soil attributes such as the proportion of sand, silt, and clay in distinct
    soil layers, as well as soil depth, hydrologic soil group, and so on. Runoff map
    The NRCS-CN method incorporates all of the components that affect the runoff and
    merges them into a single curve number (CN) parameter (Ponce and Hawkins 1996).
    Runoff depth is computed by using the following equation (Eqs. 1 and 2): $$Q=\\frac{{\\left[P-{I}_{a}\\right]}^{2}}{\\left(P-Ia+S\\right)},\\;for\\;P>{I}_{a}$$
    (1) $$Q=0,\\;for\\;P\\le {I}_{a}$$ (2) where P is the total precipitation (mm),
    Ia is the initial abstraction (dimensionless), S is the potential maximum retention
    (mm), and Q is the direct surface runoff (mm). The short-term losses, such as
    interception, surface storage, and first infiltration, are accounted for by the
    initial abstraction. For practical applications, the present NRCS-CN technique
    assumes Ia to be equal to 0.2. The watershed’s retention capacity (S) may be estimated
    using a dimensionless parameter curve number: $$Q=\\frac{{\\left[P-0.2S\\right]}^{2}}{P+0.8S}$$
    (3) The CN value for each land use class can be taken from standard reference
    tables. Its theoretical value spans from 0 to 100. However, its practical range
    is between 40 and 90 (Mishra et al. 2003). Slope map Slope is an essential factor
    to consider when deciding on sites for the construction of RWHS. The slope of
    the terrain influences runoff, recharge, and surface water movement (Naseef and
    Thomas 2016; Ibrahim et al. 2019). The slope has a significant impact on the creation
    of runoff by affecting the rate of overflow and consequently the rate of infiltration
    of water. The slope map was generated after the DEM was geo-referenced and converted
    to the projected coordinate system. The slope map was categorized into five groups:
    (a) nearly level (0 to 3%), (b) gentle (3 to 5%), (c) moderately gentle (5 to
    10%), (d) steep (10 to 15%), and (e) very steep (> 15%). The slope map has been
    classified into various groups based on the suitability of the slope class for
    a particular type of RWHS as well as to perform AHP analysis and have a deep understanding
    of which slope class is more influential compared to others in determining sites
    for RWHS. Furthermore, various structures are created according to slope classes
    as per the standard practices. Stream order map Stream order is a mechanism for
    categorizing and distinguishing stream types based on the number of tributaries
    they have. The DEM was used to generate a stream order map using Spatial Analyst
    Tool in ArcGIS. For stream ordering, Strahler’s stream ordering approach was used.
    The Stream order map was utilized to find suitable locations for RWHS. Drainage
    density map Drainage density is the ratio of the total length of streams of all
    orders to the total area of the drainage basin (Horton 1932). Following the creation
    of the drainage network, the drainage density map was generated using the line
    density function of Spatial Analyst Tools in ArcGIS. Multi-criteria decision analysis
    (MCDA) using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) The analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
    (Saaty 1980) is an efficient method for resolving complex decision-making problems
    and would aid the decision-maker in establishing priorities and selecting the
    optimal choice. Using mathematical and expert knowledge, the AHP technique provides
    a systematic framework for organizing and analyzing complex decisions. By reducing
    complicated judgments through pairwise comparisons and then assessing the outcomes,
    the AHP assists in determining both the subjective and objective characteristics
    of a decision (Dweiri et al. 2016). Due to the fact that the comparisons are done
    on the basis of subjective or personal perception, some degree of discrepancy
    is inevitable. To assure consistency of perceptions, the AHP method incorporates
    a valuable tool for assessing the consistency of the decision-maker’s judgments
    by determining the consistency ratio and eliminating decision-making bias. The
    consistency ratio measures the degree of consistency among the pairwise comparisons
    of various criteria which is considered one of the most significant advantages
    of the AHP (Harker 1987; Alphonce 1997; Kurttila et al. 2000; Benitez et al. 2012;
    Emrouznejad and Ho 2017; Kubler et al. 2018). The AHP combines and transforms
    input in the form of geographical data into decision output. Using Saaty’s scale,
    qualitative data on various themes and attributes is translated into quantitative
    data by building a pairwise comparison matrix (Vaidya and Kumar 2006; Chowdary
    et al. 2013; Hosseinijou et al. 2014). The judgment values are assigned on a scale
    of 1 to 9 (Table 1). The basic procedure consists of setting up the goal, considering
    and analyzing the factors or criteria that affect the final decision, and assigning
    judgment to different criteria using Saaty’s scale. To check the consistency of
    assigned weights, the consistency ratio (CR) as suggested by Saaty (1980) was
    computed using Eqs. 4 and 5: $$CR=\\frac{CI}{RCI}$$ (4) where Table 1 Scale for
    pairwise comparison (Saaty, 2008) Full size table CI : consistency index. RCI
    : random consistency index. The consistency index (CI) is given by the equation:
    $$CI=\\frac{\\lambda max-n}{n-1}$$ (5) where λmax is the principal eigenvalue
    and n is the number of criteria. The random index is an estimate of the average
    value of the consistency index produced from a sufficiently large number of randomly
    generated matrices of size n (Table 2). To assure consistency in decision-making,
    the calculated value of CR should be less than 0.10; otherwise, the given weights
    should be re-evaluated. If CR is less than 0.10, the judgments are consistent
    which can be considered suitable for AHP analysis (Saaty 1980). Table 2 The values
    of RCI for different orders of matrix Full size table Procedure of AHP analysis
    The detailed procedure for computing the weights of criteria is presented below:
    A pairwise comparison matrix is given as: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\text{C}}_{11}&
    {\\text{C}}_{12}& {\\text{C}}_{13}\\\\ {\\text{C}}_{21}& {\\text{C}}_{22}& {\\text{C}}_{23}\\\\
    {\\text{C}}_{31}& {\\text{C}}_{32}& {\\text{C}}_{33}\\end{array}\\right]$$ The
    sum of the values of each column of the pairwise comparison matrix is given as:
    $${SC}_{\\mathrm{ij}}={\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{C}_{\\mathrm{ij}}$$ A normalized comparison
    matrix is calculated by dividing each entry in a column by its column total as;
    $${X}_{\\mathrm{ij}}=\\frac{{C}_{\\mathrm{ij}}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{C}_{\\mathrm{ij}}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\text{X}}_{11}&
    {\\text{X}}_{12}& {\\text{X}}_{13}\\\\ {\\text{X}}_{21}& {\\text{X}}_{22}& {\\text{X}}_{23}\\\\
    {\\text{X}}_{31}& {\\text{X}}_{32}& {\\text{X}}_{33}\\end{array}\\right]$$ where
    Cij = \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\text{C}}_{11}& {\\text{C}}_{12}& {\\text{C}}_{13}\\\\
    {\\text{C}}_{21}& {\\text{C}}_{22}& {\\text{C}}_{23}\\\\ {\\text{C}}_{31}& {\\text{C}}_{32}&
    {\\text{C}}_{33}\\end{array}\\right]\\) The sum of each row is computed, and dividing
    it by the number of criteria gives criteria weights as below: $${W}_{\\mathrm{ij}}=\\frac{{\\sum
    }_{i=1}^{n}{X}_{\\mathrm{ij}}}{n}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\mathrm{W}}_{11}\\\\
    {\\mathrm{W}}_{12}\\\\ {\\mathrm{W}}_{13}\\end{array}\\right]$$ Multiplying the
    criteria weights obtained with the original pairwise comparison matrix gives the
    weighted sum value. $$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\mathrm{C}}_{{1}1}& {\\mathrm{C}}_{12}&
    {\\mathrm{C}}_{1{3}}\\\\ {\\text{C}}_{21}& {\\text{C}}_{22}& {\\text{C}}_{23}\\\\
    {\\text{C}}_{31}& {\\text{C}}_{32}& {\\text{C}}_{33}\\end{array}\\right]\\text{*}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\text{W}}_{11}\\\\
    {\\text{W}}_{21}\\\\ {\\text{W}}_{31}\\end{array}\\right]\\text{=}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\text{Cv}}_{11}\\\\
    {\\text{Cv}}_{21}\\\\ {\\text{Cv}}_{31}\\end{array}\\right]$$ The consistency
    vector is obtained by dividing the weighted sum value with the corresponding criteria
    weight as: $$\\begin{array}{c}{\\mathrm{Cv}}_{11}=\\frac{1}{{\\mathrm{W}}_{11}}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\mathrm{C}}_{11}{\\mathrm{W}}_{11}+&
    {\\mathrm{C}}_{12}{\\mathrm{W}}_{21}& {\\mathrm{C}}_{13}\\end{array}{\\mathrm{W}}_{31}\\right]\\\\
    {\\mathrm{Cv}}_{21}=\\frac{1}{{\\mathrm{W}}_{21}}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\mathrm{C}}_{21}{\\mathrm{W}}_{11}+&
    {\\mathrm{C}}_{22}{\\mathrm{W}}_{21}& {\\mathrm{C}}_{23}\\end{array}{\\mathrm{W}}_{31}\\right]\\\\
    {\\mathrm{Cv}}_{31}=\\frac{1}{{\\mathrm{W}}_{31}}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\mathrm{C}}_{31}{\\mathrm{W}}_{11}+&
    {\\mathrm{C}}_{32}{\\mathrm{W}}_{21}& {\\mathrm{C}}_{33}\\end{array}{\\mathrm{W}}_{31}\\right]\\end{array}$$
    By averaging the values of the consistency vector, the value of λmax is obtained
    as: $$\\lambda ={\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{Cv}_{\\mathrm{ij}}$$ The consistency index
    is the sum of all consistency vectors. The value of the random consistency index
    can be selected from Table 2 based on the number of criteria. Finally, the consistency
    ratio is calculated. If the consistency ratio < 0.10, then judgments are consistent
    and there is no biasness in decision-making. If it is more than 0.10, then the
    procedure can be repeated by re-evaluating the weights assigned in the pairwise
    comparison matrix to check the consistency. The main aim of the present study
    was to identify the most suitable site for RWHS. Five parameters such as surface
    runoff, land use/land cover, soil, slope, and drainage density were considered
    in the AHP analysis. Firstly, ranks were given to the sub-criteria and then main
    criteria using Saaty’s scale from 1 to 9 to form a pairwise comparison matrix,
    and subsequently weights were finalized. These weights were used in weighted overlay
    analysis to generate suitable rainwater harvesting zones. Rainwater harvesting
    potential index (RWHPI) for identification of potential RWH zones Thematic maps
    of land use/land cover, runoff, slope, soil texture, and drainage density were
    used for the generation of the RWH potential zone map. Each thematic layer was
    reclassified based on the weights assigned to the sub-criteria of each of the
    main criteria. These thematic layers were overlaid using weighted overlay operation
    in an ArcGIS environment based on weights of each of the main criteria using the
    weighted linear combination (WLC) method which gives a RWHPI. The weight of each
    criterion obtained by AHP analysis was multiplied by the reclassified map to yield
    the rainwater harvesting potential zone map using the following expression (Eq.
    6): $$\\mathrm{RWHPI}=\\left(\\mathrm{Runoff\\;map}*\\mathrm{Rfw}\\right)+\\left(\\mathrm{LULC*Lw}\\right)+\\left(\\mathrm{Slope\\;map}*\\mathrm{Sw}\\right)+\\left(\\mathrm{Soil\\;Texture}*\\mathrm{STw}\\right)+\\left(\\mathrm{Drainage\\;density\\;map}*\\mathrm{Ddw}\\right)$$
    (6) where w: = the weight of each criterion Boolean logic approach in ArcGIS environment
    Based on experts’ opinions, three types of RWHS, i.e., farm ponds, percolation
    tanks, and check dams, were suggested for the Gambhir watershed. These structures
    keep check on soil erosion by reducing runoff, promoting growth of vegetation,
    minimizing evaporation, and enhancing groundwater recharge. Besides the overall
    suitability map for RWHS, site suitability analysis for three different types
    of RWHS was also carried out using the Boolean logic approach in the ArcGIS environment.
    Thematic layers were overlaid in the GIS environment based on a set of logical
    criteria for identifying suitable sites. Suitability criteria for these structures
    were adopted from literature (FAO 2003; Ramakrishnan et al. 2009; Chowdhury et
    al. 2009; Agarwal et al. 2013; Kadam et al. 2012; Krois and Schulte 2014; Rais
    and Javed 2014; Jha et al. 2014; Ammar et al. 2016; Toosi et al. 2020) and it
    is presented in Table 3. Table 3 Criteria used for identification of suitable
    zones/site for RWHS Full size table Results and discussion Land use/land cover
    map The land use of the Gambhir watershed was classified into five different classes
    viz. (i) agriculture; (ii) scrub land; (iii) open forest; (iv) built-up area;
    and (v) water body. The spatial map of the Gambhir watershed depicting different
    LULC classes and their areal distribution is given in Fig. 4a. The land use classes
    were verified by ground truthing. Some of the classes verified during the field
    visit are present in Fig. 4b. Most of the land in the watershed was used for agricultural
    purposes which were about 350.41 km2. Water bodies covered a total area of about
    4.73 km2 (1%). Scrub land occupies an area of 167.25 km2 (28%). The bulk of the
    area covered by scrubland was located in the southern half of the watershed. In
    the northern and southern portions of the Gambhir watershed, forests were the
    dominant vegetation which covered a total area of 45.23 km2. The built-up area
    was estimated to be around 34.64 km2. The forest area in the watershed was not
    dense, and the vegetation on scrub land was sparse owing to a low survival rate
    in the absence of enough moisture. This was due to the fact that the area covered
    by water bodies accounted for merely 1% of the overall watershed area. During
    the post-monsoon season, the majority of the water bodies remained dry for a significant
    portion of the year. Furthermore, since the LULC map was based on satellite data
    taken on 10 January, which corresponds to a cloud-free period, the region beneath
    water bodies was not pronounced. Fig. 4 a Spatial map of the Gambhir watershed
    depicting different LULC classes and their areal distribution. b Land use/land
    cover classes in the Gambhir watershed Full size image Soil map Soils with fine
    and medium-grained textures are often preferred over coarse-textured soils for
    RWH because of their greater retention of nutrients and water (White 2005; Kumar
    and Jhariya 2017) Loam and clay loam types of soil were found to be the major
    soil textural classes in the Gambhir watershed (Fig. 5). Loamy soil was the dominating
    soil class covering 79.34% portion with an area of 477.86 km2 of the total area
    in northern and central portions of the Gambhir watershed. Clay loam soil was
    found in the southern part of the Gambhir watershed occupying an area of 124.40
    km2 (20.66%) (Table 4). The laboratory analysis of collected soil samples from
    the different locations in the watershed confirmed the soil types as given by
    the FAO harmonized world soil database with minor abrasions. Fig. 5 Soil types
    and their areal distribution in the Gambhir watershed Full size image Table 4
    Properties of soil classes in the Gambhir watershed Full size table Slope map
    Slope is a critical characteristic that impacts runoff since the flow of surface
    water is dependent on the watershed’s slope. The slope (in %) of the Gambhir watershed
    varies from 0 to 84%. The slope map can be classified into five classes: (a) nearly
    level (0 to 3%), (b) gentle slope (3 to 5%), (c) moderately gentle slope (5 to
    10%), (d) steep (10 to 15%), and (e) very steep (> 15%). Generally, rainwater
    harvesting structures are not suitable for slopes more than 5% because of uneven
    runoff distribution and large amount of earthwork required (Critchley et al. 2013).
    Ponds are appropriate for small flat areas with slopes of less than 5%, percolation
    tanks and Nala bunds are appropriate for moderate slopes of 5–10%, check dams
    are appropriate for slopes of less than 15%, and terracing is appropriate for
    higher slopes of 5–30% (Ramakrishnan et al. 2009; Krois and Schulte 2014; Behera
    et al. 2019). Slope classes 0–3% and 3–5% cover an area of about 455.30 km2 and
    66.76 km2 respectively. The “moderately gentle” and “steep” slopes occupy an area
    of 66.76 km2 and 13.56 km2 respectively. The area under the “very steep” class
    was found to be 20.09 km2. Most of the area lies under nearly level class whereas
    the “very steep” class occupies only 3.34% of the total area which was unsuitable
    for locating RWHS (Fig. 6). As per the slope conditions of the watershed, almost
    a large area was suitable for construction of RWHS especially the farm ponds that
    are highly required for storing water for irrigation purposes. However, some percolation
    structures would help in faster augmentation of the groundwater due to artificial
    groundwater recharge so that the drawdown in the tube wells remains in permissible
    limits while pumping. Efforts should be made by the watershed beneficiaries to
    collect as much water as possible by the creation of different types of structures
    wherever feasible so that all the water should be conserved in the watershed that
    will make its resources sustainable. Fig. 6 Slope map of the Gambhir watershed
    and its areal distribution Full size image Runoff potential map The runoff potential
    map as depicted in Fig. 7 shows the spatial variability of runoff depth over the
    Gambhir watershed and its areal distribution. The runoff depth varied from 136
    to 321 mm. Most of the eastern part had higher runoff potential as this region
    received more rainfall compared to others. Portions of high runoff potential throughout
    the area were built-up areas where infiltration was lower showing more runoff
    depth. Approximately, 109.61 km2 of the total area has the highest runoff potential
    (284–321 mm) whereas 28.11 km2 area has the lowest runoff potential. Most of the
    lower runoff potential areas were located in the western part of the Gambhir watershed.
    Medium runoff potential (210–247 mm) region covers an area of 96.44 km2. Fig.
    7 Spatially distributed runoff map of the Gambhir watershed and its areal distribution
    Full size image Stream order map The stream order map of the Gambhir watershed
    is presented in Fig. 8. The lower the number of the stream order, the greater
    the infiltration and permeability, and vice versa. Higher stream order means that
    more tributaries are draining, which increases the potential of harvesting more
    water (Adham et al. 2018; Hashim and Sayl 2021). The trunk order of the Gambhir
    watershed was found to be five with a stream length of 33.89 km. Approximately
    49.38% of the total drainage network consists of first-order streams. The second-
    and third-order streams cover drainage lengths of 134.16 (26.69%) and 68.64 (13.66%)
    respectively. The second- and third-order streams are important from the point
    of view of RWH. The fifth-order stream covers more length (6.74%) than the fourth-order
    stream (3.44%). The length-wise distribution of stream orders is given in Table
    5. The number of streams of orders 1 to 5 was 183, 31, 11, 3, and 1. Fig. 8 Stream
    order map of the Gambhir watershed Full size image Table 5 Length-wise distribution
    of stream orders Full size table Drainage density map Higher drainage density
    results in more runoff, which, in turn, results in less water penetration into
    the ground. Thus, the generated runoff can be harvested by constructing a proper
    RWH structure (Rajasekhar et al. 2020; Aghalooand Chiu 2020). The drainage density
    of the Gambhir watershed varied from 0 to 2.74 km/km2 (Fig. 9) with a mean density
    of 0.82 km/ km2. Drainage density can be grouped into five classes: (a) very low
    (0–0.5 km/km2), (b) low (0.5–1 km/km2), (c) moderate (1–1.5 km/km2), (d) high
    (1.5 to 2 km/km2), and (e) very high (2–2.7 km/km2). The drainage density of the
    very low to low category was dominant in the Gambhir watershed covering an area
    of about 376.97 km2 whereas the drainage density of the very high category occupied
    a small portion of 6.46 km2 of the Gambhir watershed. Moderate and high drainage
    density classes occupied about 157.32 km2 (26.12%) and 61.38 km2 (10.19%) respectively.
    High drainage density is indicative of either high rainfall resulting in bisected
    watersheds or a highly erodible soil base which results in severely eroded land
    mass. As the soil of the present watershed belongs to the loam and clay loam,
    the second fact holds good due to which one can conclude that the watershed has
    high erosion potential as well. Fig. 9 Drainage density map of the Gambhir watershed
    and its areal distribution Full size image Use of AHP for determining criteria
    weights All parameters are not equally significant in determining a suitable site
    for RWHS (Ahmad and Verma 2018; Haile et al. 2019). This, however, is dependent
    on the type of RWH structure to be constructed. Thus, the most significant criteria
    for creating one kind of RWHS may be the least relevant criteria for another type
    of RWHS. In Saaty’s scale, a score of one indicates that both criteria are equally
    important, while a score of nine indicates that one criterion is hugely preferred
    over the other criteria. As a result, different weights have to be assigned to
    each of the criteria. Based on expert judgment, the AHP was used to give weights
    to each of the criteria. The overall site suitability map was developed by taking
    five factors into account. Priority was determined by comparing two criteria at
    the same time using Saaty’s scale. The pairwise comparison matrix and normalized
    pairwise comparison matrix for feature classes of each criterion are presented
    in Appendix I. The normalized weights for each feature class were determined and
    are presented in Table 6. For each of these matrices, the consistency ratio was
    less than 0.1, giving confirmation that the resulting criteria weights were consistent.

    site suitability map For preparing the overall site suitability map, five main
    criteria namely LULC, soil, slope, runoff, and drainage density were considered
    based on data availability. Thematic layers of these criteria were reclassified
    by giving weights as computed previously. The pairwise comparison matrix and normalized
    pairwise comparison matrix of these criteria are shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.
    The weights after checking the consistency are shown in Fig. 10. It was found
    that the runoff has more influence in locating the site for RWHS followed by slope
    and LULC, while drainage density had a lesser effect on deciding the site for
    RWHS. Table 7 Pairwise comparison matrix for main criteria Full size table Table

    size image The five criteria layers were overlaid using a weighted linear combination
    assigning the obtained weights as shown in Fig. 10. The resulting map is shown
    in Fig. 11. The map has been divided into five sub-classes namely, (i) very highly
    suitable, (ii) highly suitable, (iii) moderately suitable, (iv) least suitable,
    and (v) not suitable. The areal distribution of these classes is shown in Fig.
    12. It was found that about 75.54 km2 area was very highly suitable whereas 109.18
    km2 area was least suitable for the construction of RWHS. The moderately suitable
    class covers most of the area (259.21 km2) in the watershed. About 43.77 km2 area
    was not suitable at all for constructing any type of RWHS. Fig. 11 Overall site

    of suitability classes Full size image Site suitability analysis for RWHS using
    Boolean logic Boolean logic was used to prepare site suitability maps for a particular
    type of RWHS. The criteria for selecting a particular type of RWH structure were
    adopted as mentioned in Table 3. Various thematic maps were prepared using Boolean
    logic which gives a value of 1 to those sub-criteria that are suitable for a particular
    type of structure leaving other sub-criteria as zero. These maps were then overlaid
    using a raster calculator which results in a map that gives suitable zones for
    a particular type of RWH structure. Site suitability for farm ponds Thematic layers
    of the slope, HSG, runoff, and LULC were prepared using Boolean logic based on
    the criteria shown in Table 3. These layers were added using a raster calculator.
    The resulting map was classified into two classes as highly suitable zones and
    not suitable zones (Fig. 13). About 333.35 km2 (55%) area in the Gambhir watershed
    was found to be highly suitable for the construction of farm ponds while the remaining
    268.91 km2 (45%) area was not suitable for farm pond construction. Farm ponds
    were built on the lower elevations of agricultural fields to collect and store
    rainfall runoff (Kumar and Jhariya., 2017). It was found that most of the suitable
    area lies in the central part of the Gambhir watershed. The farm ponds if constructed
    would be able to collect a vast amount of runoff and thus result in a storage
    structure for irrigating the crops. If it is possible to give at least one life-saving
    irrigation to the mustard crop at the time of the vegetative critical crop growth
    stage, then the performance of Brassica sp. will drastically improve upon and
    so the economic status of the farming and landless category of farmers. The criteria
    for farm ponds were being satisfied mainly in the agricultural lands which require
    water for irrigation. If there will be stored water in the ponds and irrigation
    could be assured, farmers will be able to grow more remunerative crops by providing
    irrigation else more area can be commanded under less water-requiring crops. Fig.

    Site suitability for percolation ponds Thematic layers of the criteria shown in
    Table 3 were prepared using Boolean logic. These layers were added to get the
    site suitability map for percolation ponds as shown in Fig. 14. The resulting
    map was classified into three classes viz. (i) highly suitable, (ii) moderately
    suitable, and (iii) not suitable. About 308.53 km2 area (51%) was found to be
    in a highly suitable category whereas 85.34 km2 area (14%) was found to be unsuitable
    for the construction of percolation ponds. The moderately suitable class covers
    208.40 km2 area (35%). Fig. 14 Site suitability map for percolation ponds Full
    size image Site suitability for check dams The same criteria as mentioned in Table
    3 were used to prepare a site suitability map. The required thematic layers prepared
    using Boolean logic were added to get the final suitability map. Check dams are
    constructed on stream orders of 3–4 preferably near agricultural lands. A total
    number of 15 check dams were proposed for construction as shown in Fig. 15. Fig.
    15 Site suitability map for check dams Full size image Detailed analysis for selected
    micro-watershed MW-36 The probable locations of farm ponds and percolation ponds
    were determined based on the site suitability map and pre-decided stream order
    criteria. Because of the time limitations, we have selected a micro-watershed
    number-36 (MW-36) (Fig. 16) for detailed analysis and design of the assigned RWHS.
    The sites for proposed structures as identified by the AHP analysis were verified
    during the field visit. The ground truthing was further augmented by zooming in
    the features on the ground. Hence, the most appropriate locations of selected
    micro-watersheds are shown in Fig. 17. However, the final decision would be made
    by taking into consideration the socio-economic and political aspects of the proposed
    location. The location of the proposed structures is presented in Fig. 18. Fig.

    image Conclusions The present study was conducted in a semi-arid watershed of
    Rajasthan to locate potential sites for the construction of RWHS. The majority
    of the Indian watersheds are ungauged with several parameters and not available
    unlike developed nations hence the developed methodology has high relevance for
    data-deficient regions. Based on data availability, the study considered five
    factors viz. land use/land cover, soil, slope, runoff, and drainage density augmented
    with stream order criteria for determining the potential site for RWHS. AHP was
    used to assign weights to different criteria based on their relative influence
    on final site selection. Based on the findings of this study, the following conclusions
    can be made. The runoff depth over the Gambhir watershed was found to vary from
    136 to 321 mm. It was observed that 75.54 km2 (13% of the total area) was very
    highly suited for the construction of RWHS, while 114.56 km2 (19%) was found to
    be highly suitable. A total of 43.77 km2 (7%) of land was deemed unsuitable for
    the construction of any sort of RWHS. The study indicated that a total number
    of 25 farm ponds, 13 check dams, and 16 percolation ponds can be constructed in
    the experimental watershed to harvest the channel flows for future use at the
    identified sites. Separate maps were generated for each type of RWHS, depicting
    suitable zones and locations based on its suitability criterion. The accuracy
    of selection was further augmented by extracting depressions from DEM and overlying
    it on the site suitability map in addition to the flow accumulation layer, to
    select only those locations which are in depression and where the flow accumulation
    is more. The study has resulted in the development of a hybrid methodology using
    a well-known MCDA technique AHP, Boolean logic, and geospatial tools for site
    identification of RWHS. Despite the scarcity of data, this study demonstrated
    a time-saving and cost-effective technique for identifying suitable locations
    for RWH. Nonetheless, the study revealed that AHP in combination with other techniques
    like Boolean logic, RS, and GIS can further improve the accuracy of procedures
    pertaining to the sizing and siting of different types of RWHS. The methodology
    developed in this research may be employed successfully for watershed planning
    and design to bring water security and resource sustainability to the Gambhir
    watershed and other similar regions. Data availability The datasets used and/or

  description: Drought poses a serious threat to agricultural production and food
    security in the context of global climate change. Few studies have explored the
    response mechanism and lag time of agricultural drought to meteorological drought
    from the perspective of cultivated land types. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal
    evolution patterns and hysteresis relationship of meteorological and agricultural
    droughts in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. Here,
    the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index products
    and surface temperature products were selected to calculate the Temperature Vegetation
    Dryness Index (TVDI) from 2010 to 2015. Furthermore, we obtained the Standardized
    Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Palmer Drought Severity
    Index (PDSI) for the same period. Based on these indices, we analyzed the correlation
    and the hysteresis relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought
    in rainfed and irrigated arable land. The results showed that, (1) compared with
    SPEI, the high spatial resolution PDSI data were deemed more suitable for the
    subsequent accurate and scientific analysis of the relationship between meteorological
    and agricultural droughts. (2) When meteorological drought occurs, irrigated arable
    land is the first to experience agricultural drought, and then alleviates when
    the drought is most severe in rainfed arable land, indicating that irrigated arable
    land is more sensitive to drought events when exposed to the same degree of drought
    risk. However, rainfed arable land is actually more susceptible to agricultural
    drought due to the intervention of irrigation measures. (3) According to the cross-wavelet
    transform analysis, agricultural droughts significantly lag behind meteorological
    droughts by about 33 days during the development process of drought events. (4)
    The spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient between the PDSI and TVDI
    shows that the area with negative correlations of rainfed croplands and the area
    with positive correlations of irrigated croplands account for 77.55% and 68.04%
    of cropland areas, respectively. This study clarifies and distinguishes the details
    of the meteorological-to-agricultural drought relationship in rainfed and irrigated
    arable land, noting that an accurate lag time can provide useful guidance for
    drought monitoring management and irrigation project planning in the middle and
    lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

    Abstract 1. Introduction Drought is a phenomenon that occurs when a region breaks
    the balance of precipitation and evapotranspiration over a long period, resulting
    in the loss of soil moisture and crops or the reduction of surface runoff [1].
    The frequency and intensity of droughts show an increasing trend due to the long
    duration and wide range of influence [2,3,4]. Drought has caused immeasurable
    effects on the ecological environment and agricultural production, thus seriously
    restricting the sustainable development of society [5,6,7,8]. A drought is generally
    defined by the international meteorological community as a “prolonged precipitation
    deficit or significant precipitation shortage” and can be divided into four categories:
    meteorological drought, agricultural drought, hydrological drought, and socioeconomic
    drought, according to the impact type and scope [9,10,11,12,13]. These four types
    of droughts are interrelated, and the meteorological drought, as the source and
    basis of the other three droughts, refers to the unbalanced state of water gain
    and loss caused by the mismatch between evaporation and precipitation [12,13,14,15,16,17].
    Agricultural drought is a condition that the soil water content cannot meet the
    needs of plant growth, resulting in a plant water shortage [18]. Although the
    mechanisms of meteorological and agricultural droughts are different, they have
    a certain response relationship between them [12,13,14,16,19]. Therefore, various
    types of drought monitoring methods and indices have been proposed to describe
    the changing characteristics or degree of drought development quantitatively.
    Meteorological drought monitoring and remote sensing drought monitoring are two
    common methods of drought monitoring [20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Traditional meteorological
    drought monitoring usually selects suitable drought indicators to determine the
    time and extent of droughts based on the data obtained from meteorological stations,
    agricultural stations, hydrological stations, and other stations, such as the
    standardized precipitation index (SPI) [27,28], the precipitation anomaly percentage
    (Pa) [29], the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) [30],
    the precipitation Z-index [28], and the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) [31,32,33].
    However, the occurrence and spatiotemporal characteristics of drought are complex,
    and when coupled with scattered ground stations and poor representative observation
    data, it makes it difficult to monitor large-scale droughts quickly and accurately
    [34,35,36,37]. Among them, due to the clear physical meaning and the comprehensive
    consideration of precipitation and temperature, PDSI is especially suitable for
    monitoring meteorological drought on a longer time scale and has been widely used
    in China [38,39,40,41]. In addition, as a significant parameter for early drought
    prediction and monitoring, the drought index can qualitatively determine the development
    process of drought over a certain period. Therefore, remote sensing technology
    can be used to calculate ground object parameters such as soil moisture, land
    surface temperature, crop growth status, and vegetation coverage ratio [42,43].
    By establishing a remote sensing drought index model, we can evaluate and monitor
    the evolution of drought on large spatiotemporal scales [44,45]. Common remote
    sensing drought indices include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    [46], Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) [47], Vegetation Health Index (VHI) [48,49],
    Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) [50], (Modified) Perpendicular Drought
    Index (MPDI/PDI) [51,52,53,54,55], Temperature Condition Index (TCI) [56], Drought
    Severity Index (SDI) [57], Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) [58], Water Deficit
    Index (WDI) [59], Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) [60,61,62], the Vegetation
    Supply Water Index (VSWI) [63], etc. Each index has a different focus. Most researchers
    have shown that the combination of NDVI and Land Surface Temperature (LST) can
    reveal information about drought conditions. Due to the accurate estimation of
    surface soil moisture, the TVDI has become one of the most important parameters
    for remote sensing agricultural drought monitoring [36,64,65,66,67]. For example,
    Shashikant et al. [68] calculated the TVDI based on Landsat 8 and classified the
    severity of agricultural drought in Malaysia. In order to improve the accuracy
    of soil moisture inversion by the TVDI, Wang et al. [69] assessed the effects
    of the TVDI calculated by different vegetation indices in drought monitoring in
    Northeast China. Agricultural drought is affected by meteorological drought directly,
    which occurs later than meteorological drought, and there is usually a hysteresis
    relationship between them. Assessing meteorological drought is simply based on
    the available global precipitation data and climatic parameters. However, the
    development of agricultural drought is relatively complex, and causes serious
    agricultural economic losses every year, threatening food security and sustainable
    agricultural development. There may be uncertainties between meteorology and agricultural
    droughts due to various meteorological or climate factors, such as different climate
    regions, drought indices, or climate models. Seidenfaden et al. [70] estimated
    and compared several drought indices, and explored the linkage between the drought
    and changing climate to evaluate the potential impact of uncertainties from climate
    model choices on the indices. Kuśmierek-Tomaszewska et al. [71] found the relationship
    between meteorological and agricultural drought indicators is significant, which
    can allow for the determination of crop water deficits from the indicators to
    guide irrigation needs in the study area. Behrang Manesh et al. [72] investigated
    the relationship between meteorological and agricultural droughts in different
    climates of Iran during the growing season based on the correlation analysis between
    SPEI and VHI. Furthermore, global scholars have conducted extensive research exploring
    the response of agricultural drought to meteorological drought [73,74]. Tian et
    al. [75] constructed the Comprehensive Agricultural Drought Index (CADI) based
    on the hysteresis effect of soil moisture on meteorological factors and compared
    it with various other indices to evaluate and verify the degree of drought. Hu
    et al. [76] calculated the time-lag relationships among meteorological, agricultural,
    and hydrological droughts using the grey relational analysis method and the SWAT
    model. However, most research has focused on the formation and spread of drought
    in the whole region. For example, Li et al. [77] only calculated the propagation
    time of meteorological droughts to agricultural droughts in typical rain-fed agricultural
    areas of the Loess Plateau in China but ignored irrigated arable land. Alahacoon
    et al. [78] also only monitored long-term drought in the entire region of Sri
    Lanka to assess the impact on the country’s economy. Few researches have explored
    the response mechanism and hysteresis relationship of agricultural drought to
    meteorological drought based on arable land types and compared the differences
    between rainfed and irrigated arable land [16,79]. In the context of the increasing
    global warming; therefore, studying the evolution discipline, formation, and transmission
    mechanism of meteorological drought to agricultural drought have important reference
    value for promoting the development of the regional economy. In addition, this
    study distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated cultivated land, which can provide
    new ideas and directions for related drought researchers. Agricultural production
    occupies an important position in the development of the national economy. The
    middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, one of the most significant grain-producing
    areas in China [80,81,82,83], are threatened by drought frequently due to the
    extreme climate, irrigation, and topography in recent years [82]. In particular,
    about 56.96 million people and 58,120 square kilometers of crops were affected
    by the extreme drought events due to the high temperatures and the abnormally
    low precipitation in the summer of 2013, with a direct economic loss of CNY 36.64
    billion [82]. Therefore, investigating the transmission mechanism and lag time
    between meteorological and agricultural droughts can provide an alternative method
    for studying the evolutionary characteristics of agricultural drought. This study
    mainly analyzes the temporal and spatial evolution pattern and hysteresis relationship
    between meteorological drought and agricultural drought. The key research objectives
    are as follows: (1) identify the drought events and analyze the applicability
    and feasibility of the PDSI in monitoring meteorological drought, (2) analyze
    the potential of the PDSI and TVDI to monitor meteorological and agricultural
    droughts in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, (3) describe the
    impact degree of meteorological droughts to agricultural droughts in rainfed and
    irrigated land, respectively, and (4) analyze the lag relationship of rainfed
    and irrigated land between meteorological droughts and agricultural droughts according
    to the cross-wavelet transform and Pearson’s correlation analysis method. This
    study focuses on different types of arable land, which has a certain reference
    value for promoting economic development in the middle and lower reaches of the
    Yangtze River. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The middle and lower reaches
    of the Yangtze River occupy the area north of the Nanling, south of the Qinling
    mountains–HuaiHe River line, and east of the Wu Mountains (105°E–123°E, 25°–34°N).
    The region is in the subtropical monsoon climate zone, with an altitude of 5–100
    m, flat terrain, and plenty of rivers and lakes. It has sufficient precipitation,
    about 1000–1400 mm per year, though it is unevenly distributed, resulting in frequent
    droughts and floods [84]. The annual average temperature of the area is 14–18
    °C. As one of the three major plains in China, the middle and lower reaches of
    the Yangtze River is a significant grain base and a production base for important
    economic crops such as oil, hemp, and cotton, making it a major agricultural area
    and the most economically developed zone in China [80,81,82,83,85]. Based on the
    two high temperature and severe drought events in southern China during the spring
    and summer of 2011 and 2013 summer, the important provinces involved in the disaster
    were selected, including Chongqing, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and
    Zhejiang. According to the United States Geological Survey’s 1-km Global Food
    Security Support Analysis Data (GFSAD) [86,87,88,89], Northern Anhui, Northern
    Hubei, Central Chongqing, Western Guizhou, and the southeastern coastal areas
    of Zhejiang are primarily irrigated agriculture, while Hunan, Jiangxi, and Southern
    Hubei are dominated by rainfed agriculture. The geographical location, elevation,
    and distribution of agricultural land categories in the study area are illustrated
    in Figure 1. Figure 1. The cropland types and elevation of the middle and lower
    reaches of the Yangtze River in China. (a) Location of the study area in China.
    (b) Digital elevation model map of the study area. (c) Irrigated and rainfed croplands
    map of the study area. 2.2. Data The remote sensing data selected is the Moderate-resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data in this paper, sourced from the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), including the NDVI product
    MOD13Q1 and the land surface temperature (LST) product MOD11A2, with the spatial
    resolutions of 250 m × 250 m and 1 km × 1 km, respectively. The meteorological
    drought index selected and compared in this article are the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) [30,90,91] and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) [31,32,33],
    which are respectively derived from the global SPEI database and the TerraClimate
    database [92]. The SPEI database provides long-term and reliable information about
    global drought conditions with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution and a monthly temporal
    resolution. It can provide SPEI data on different timescales from 1 to 48 months.
    The PDSI estimates soil moisture supply and demand based on precipitation and
    temperature and is used to study the temporal and spatial characteristics of drought
    to monitor large-scale droughts. Both SPEI and PDSI are widely used in meteorological
    drought monitoring. SPEI with multi-scale features can help us demonstrate the
    accuracy of drought events. However, the lower spatial resolution of SPEI data
    (50 km) may lead to large uncertainties for further analysis. For the middle and
    lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China, the PDSI is mainly chosen for subsequent
    research and analysis due to its higher spatial resolution. Other auxiliary data
    include basic geographic data, such as administrative divisions and digital elevation
    models. According to the drought events that occurred in 2011 and 2013 recorded
    in the historical disaster database of the National Disaster Reduction Center
    of the Ministry of Emergency Management, the data from 2010 to 2015 were selected.
    Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and the study area vector files,
    the MOD11A2 and MOD13Q1 data for the whole year of 2010–2015 were obtained. The
    MOD11A2 data were resampled to a 250 m spatial resolution before downloading based
    on GEE. To monitor and determine the accuracy of drought events, this study downloaded
    the SPEI data on four different time scales and analyzed the sensitivity of the
    SPEI data on different timescales to drought events. High spatial resolution PDSI
    data were downloaded as the main meteorological drought index data in this research.
    All PDSI data were resampled from 4 km to 250 m spatial resolution by using the
    “Nearest” method in the Resample module based on ArcGIS 10.8 software. The Global
    Food Security Support Analysis Data Crop Mask Global 1-km dataset (GFSAD1KCM),
    which can distinguish between rainfed croplands and irrigated croplands, was superimposed
    to investigate the comprehensive response of different agricultural regions to
    meteorological and agricultural droughts. Details of the remote sensing data and
    auxiliary data are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Details of the remote sensing datasets
    and auxiliary datasets. 2.3. Methods 2.3.1. Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) The standardized precipitation
    evapotranspiration index (SPEI), which was first proposed in 2010, is used to
    characterize the state of dry and wet climates [30]. Based on the monthly surplus
    and deficit of moisture, the index can comprehensively consider the effects of
    precipitation, evaporation, and transpiration to reasonably evaluate drought on
    multiple timescales. As a dry–wet index according to the potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) and precipitation (P), the SPEI has been widely used in drought studies
    worldwide. The calculation process of the SPEI is given by: First, the cumulative
    series of precipitation Pi and potential evapotranspiration PETi at different
    timescales are established: 𝐷 𝑘 𝑛 = ∑ 𝑘−1 𝑖=0 [ 2(𝑖+1) 𝑘(𝑘+1) ( 𝑃 𝑛−𝑖 − 𝑃𝐸𝑇 𝑛−𝑖
    )],𝑛≥𝑘, (1) where i and k are the month and timescale (months), and n is the number
    of calculations. The PET is calculated following the Thornthwaite method, Penman
    method, etc. Then, the log-logistic probability density function is utilized to
    fit the established water deficit series D, representing the difference between
    P and PET, and the cumulative probability for a given timescale can be calculated
    by the distribution function: 𝐹(𝑥)= [1+ ( 𝛼 𝑥−𝛾 ) 𝛽 ] −1 , (2) where 𝛼 , 𝛽 , and
    𝛾 are scale, shape, and origin parameters, respectively, which can be gained from
    the Linear moment method. Finally, the SPEI is obtained by transforming the fitted
    water deficit series to a standard normal distribution: 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐼=𝑊− 𝐶 0 + 𝐶 1 𝑊+ 𝐶
    2 𝑊 2 1+ 𝑑 1 𝑊+ 𝑑 2 𝑊 2 + 𝑑 3 𝑊 3 ,𝑊= −2ln(𝑃) − − − − − − − √ , (3) When 𝑃≤0.5
    , 𝑃=1−𝐹(𝑥) . When 𝑃>0.5 , 𝑃=1−𝑃 and the sign of the SPEI is reversed. The other
    constants in the formula are: 𝐶 0 =2.515517, 𝐶 1 =0.802853, 𝐶 2 =0.010328, 𝑑 1
    =1.432788, 𝑑 2 =0.189269 , and 𝑑 3 =0.001308 . The principle of PDSI is the water
    balance equation, that is, in the case of “climatically appropriate for existing
    conditions”, the precipitation ( P ̂ ) is equal to the sum of evapotranspiration
    ( ET ̂ ), runoff ( RO ̂ ), and soil moisture exchange. The soil moisture exchange
    includes the soil moisture recharge ( R ̂ ) and the soil moisture loss ( L ̂ ).
    The calculation process of the PDSI is given by: 𝑃 ̂ = 𝐸𝑇 ̂ + 𝑅 ̂ + 𝑅𝑂 ̂ − 𝐿 ̂
    , (4) 𝑑=𝑃− 𝑃 ̂ (5) 𝑍= 𝐾 𝑗 ·𝑑 (6) 𝑃𝐷𝑆𝐼 𝑖 =𝑎· 𝑃𝐷𝑆𝐼 𝑖−1 +𝑏· 𝑍 𝑖 (7) where 𝑃 ̂ is
    the monthly precipitation amount under the climatically appropriate for existing
    conditions; d is the water deficiency, P is the actual precipitation amount, Z
    is the water deficit index, and Kj is the climate correction coefficient for month
    j of the year. The 𝑎=0.897 and 𝑏=1/3 are the empirical coefficients. As a dry–wet
    index according to temperature and precipitation, the PDSI has been widely used
    in drought studies worldwide. The SPEI and PDSI values are classified as shown
    in Table 2 for distinguishing the drought categories [31,93]. The overall flow
    chart of this research is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. The flow chart of the methodology.

    and PDSI. 2.3.2. Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) The Temperature Vegetation
    Drought Index (TVDI), which was proposed based on the simplified NDVI-LST two-dimensional
    feature space in 2002 [50], is utilized to estimate the land surface soil moisture
    and monitor drought: 𝑇𝑉𝐷𝐼= (𝐿𝑆𝑇−𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛) 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛 , (8) 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛=𝑎+𝑏×𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼, (9)
    𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥=𝑐+𝑑×𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼, (10) Here, NDVI is the Normalized Vegetation Index, which can
    reflect the physiological state of vegetation. Its calculation formula is as follows:
    𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼= 𝐵 𝑁𝐼𝑅 − 𝐵 𝑅 𝐵 𝑁𝐼𝑅 + 𝐵 𝑅 , (11) where 𝐵 𝑁𝐼𝑅 and 𝐵 𝑅 are the reflectivities
    in the near-infrared band and the red band, respectively. The land surface temperature
    (LST) is a parameter that reflects the water shortage and soil moisture conditions
    during the vegetation growth period. The definition of TVDI is shown in Figure
    3, according to the NDVI and LST two-dimensional spatial scatter plot. For each
    NDVI pixel value of a single image in the region, extracting the minimum and maximum
    values of the land surface temperature corresponding to each NDVI pixel ( 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛
    , 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 ), respectively. All 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 values were linearly fitted separately
    to obtain the wet edge and dry edge Equations (9) and (10) in the feature space,
    where a and c are the intercepts of the wet and dry edges, respectively, and b
    and d are the slopes of the wet and dry edges, respectively. Figure 3. Definition
    of the Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) and the geometric meaning of
    a given pixel P. Red and green circles: The maximum and minimum values (LSTmin,
    LSTmax) of LST corresponding to each NDVI pixel. Red and green lines: Dry edge
    and wet edge obtained from linear fitting according to all LSTmax and LSTmin.
    In Figure 3, the TVDI value of the pixel point P is expressed as the ratio of
    X and Y, where X represents the difference between the observed surface temperature
    of the point P and the minimum temperature expressed in Equation (9), and Y represents
    the difference between the maximum temperature expressed in Equation (10) and
    the minimum temperature at point P in this area. Therefore, the TVDI can be defined
    as: 𝑇𝑉𝐷𝐼= 𝐿𝑆𝑇−(𝑎+𝑏×𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼) (𝑐+𝑑×𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼)−(𝑎+𝑏×𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼) , (12) The TVDI values are negatively
    correlated with soil moisture, ranging from 0 to 1. When TVDI = 1, the pixels
    are on the dry edge, with the lowest soil moisture and a high degree of drought.
    When TVDI = 0, the pixels are located on the wet edge, and the soil is less affected
    by drought. The classification of TVDI values is shown in Table 3, according to
    the common division rules of TVDI values for MODIS data [10,94]. In addition,
    the influence of clouds needs to be considered in the TVDI calculation process.
    Here, this study mainly focuses on the arable land area, which accounts for about
    50% of the total study area. Meanwhile, we deleted all cloud contamination pixels
    to calculate TVDI, and used the inverse distance weighted interpolation method
    to fill the area, which greatly reduced the influence of clouds on the research
    results. Table 3. Different levels of the Temperature Vegetation Drought Index.
    2.3.3. Cross-Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Coherence A Cross-Wavelet Transform
    (XWT) and Wavelet Coherence (WTC) can combine time and frequency to analyze two
    time series datasets [74,95]. For two discrete time sequences 𝑥 𝑛 and 𝑦 𝑛 , the
    XWT is defined as 𝑊 𝑋𝑌 = 𝑊 𝑋 𝑊 𝑌* , where * indicates their complex conjugate.
    The cross-wavelet power is defined as | 𝑊 𝑋𝑌 |, and the complex argument arg (
    𝑊 𝑋𝑌 ) represents the local relative phases of 𝑋 𝑛 and 𝑌 𝑛 at the time–frequency
    domain. 𝑃 𝑋 𝑘 and 𝑃 𝑌 𝑘 represent the cross-wavelet power and background power
    spectrum of the two time sequences, respectively. The theoretical formula is as
    follows: 𝐷( | 𝑊 𝑋 𝑛 (𝑠) 𝑊 𝑌* 𝑛 (𝑠)| 𝜎 𝑋 𝜎 𝑌 <𝑃)= 𝑍 𝑣 (𝑝) 𝑣 𝑃 𝑋 𝑘 𝑃 𝑌 𝑘 − − − −
    − √ , (13) where 𝑍 𝑣 (𝑝) is the confidence level associated with the probability
    𝑝 of the probability distribution function, which can be defined by the square
    root of two 𝜒 2 distributions. The phase angle of the cross-wavelet is defined
    as: 𝛼=𝑎𝑟𝑔(𝑋,𝑌)=𝑎𝑟𝑔[ ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑐𝑜𝑠( 𝛼 𝑖 ), ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑠𝑖𝑛( 𝛼 𝑖 )]. (14) Wavelet coherence
    is used to evaluate the degree of coherence of the cross-wavelet transform in
    the time–frequency space. It can be defined as the square of the absolute value
    of the smoothed cross-wavelet spectrum, normalized by the smoothed wavelet power:
    𝑅 2 𝑛 (𝑠)= |𝑆( 𝑠 −1 𝑊 𝑋𝑌 𝑛 (𝑠))| 2 𝑆( 𝑠 −1 | 𝑊 𝑋 𝑛 (𝑠)| 2 )⋅𝑆( 𝑠 −1 | 𝑊 𝑌 𝑛 (𝑠)|
    2 ) , (15) where S is a smoothing operator: 𝑆(𝑊)= 𝑆 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 ( 𝑆 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 ( 𝑊 𝑛 (𝑠))),
    (16) and 𝑆 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 and 𝑆 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 represent the smoothing along the wavelet scale axis
    and time axis, respectively. Their calculation method is as follows for the Morlet
    wavelet: 𝑆 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 (𝑊)| 𝑛 = ( 𝑊 𝑛 (𝑠)× 𝑐 2 Π(0.6𝑠))| 𝑛 , (17) 𝑆 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 (𝑊)| 𝑠 = (
    𝑊 𝑛 (𝑠)× 𝑐 − 𝑡 2 2 𝑠 2 1 )      𝑠 , (18) within which 𝑐 1 and 𝑐 2 are the
    determined normalization coefficients, and Π is the rectangle function. 2.3.4.
    Correlation Coefficient and Correlation Analysis A correlation analysis is a simple
    statistical method for measuring the strength of the relationship between two
    variables and calculating their association. One of the most relevant statistical
    concepts is the correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient is a unit of
    measurement that indicates the correlation intensity in the process of correlation
    analysis of variables. It is usually represented by the symbol r, having values
    between −1 and 1. The closer its absolute value is to 1, the stronger the correlation
    between the two variables and vice versa. Pearson’s correlation analysis can be
    used to examine the correlation between meteorological and agricultural drought
    indices [96,97]. For this study, the correlation coefficient between PDSI and
    TVDI in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River can be calculated from
    two perspectives: (1) To explore the spatial correlation of the two indicators
    based on the pixel scale in 2010–2015, the formula for calculating the correlation
    coefficient is as follows: 𝑅 𝑥𝑦 = ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 [( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 − )( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 − )] ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 (
    𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 − ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − √ ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 − ) 2 − − − − − − − − − −
    √ , (19) where 𝑅 𝑥𝑦 represents the correlation coefficient between variables 𝑥
    and 𝑦 , and 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝑦 𝑖 are the PDSI and TVDI values of the ith year, respectively.
    𝑥 − and 𝑦 − represent the six-year average of the PDSI and TVDI, respectively.
    (2) For a pair of single-phase images, the correlation coefficients between them
    can be calculated by the following formula: 𝑅 𝑖𝑗 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑘=1 [( 𝑍 𝑖𝑘 − 𝜇 𝑖 )( 𝑍
    𝑗𝑘 − 𝜇 𝑗 )] ∑ 𝑁 𝑘=1 ( 𝑍 𝑖𝑘 − 𝜇 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ ∑ 𝑁 𝑘=1 ( 𝑍
    𝑗𝑘 − 𝜇 𝑗 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (20) where i and j represent the PDSI
    and TVDI single-band images with N pixels, respectively. 𝑍 𝑖𝑘 and 𝑍 𝑗𝑘 are the
    values of their kth pixel, and 𝜇 𝑖 and 𝜇 𝑗 are the average values of the whole
    image pixels, respectively. The lag time between meteorological and agricultural
    drought can be obtained by calculating and comparing the correlation coefficients
    of the two indicators on different dates. 3. Results 3.1. Meteorological Drought
    Event Identification The SPEI has multi-timescale features. Figure 4 shows the
    interannual variations of the mean SPEI on the monthly (SPEI-1), quarterly (SPEI-3),
    semi-annual (SPEI-6), and one-year (SPEI-12) timescales in the middle and lower
    reaches of the Yangtze River from 1960 to 2015. Obviously, the SPEI frequently
    changes on short timescales and tends to stabilize as the timescale becomes longer.
    SPEI-1 shows the dry–wet state on a monthly timescale, with frequent changes and
    large amplitudes. SPEI-3 reflects the dry–wet changes in different seasons and
    is better than SPEI-1 in analyzing the annual drought conditions. However, compared
    with SPEI-3, on the two timescales of SPEI-6 and SPEI-12, the dry and wet changes
    in the study area are more obvious and gradually stabilize, which is suitable
    for drought monitoring over a decade. By analyzing the SPEI changes of the four
    timescales, the minimum SPEI values appeared in 2011 and 2013. Especially in SPEI-6
    and SPEI-12, the drought situation around 2011 was particularly severe relative
    to recent decades. Therefore, based on the long-term SPEI monitoring in the middle
    and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, extreme drought events occurred in 2011
    and 2013 on every time scale, further emphasizing the important research value.
    However, compared with the SPEI (about 50 km), the PDSI (4 km) with the higher
    spatial resolution is more suitable for subsequent accurate and scientific analysis
    of the relationship between meteorological drought and agricultural drought based
    on the spatial region and pixel scale. The PDSI data from 2010 to 2015 were obtained
    as the meteorological drought index in this research. Figure 4. The interannual
    variations of the mean value of the SPEI on different timescales. (a) SPEI-1,
    (b) SPEI-3, (c) SPEI-6, and (d) SPEI-12. 3.2. Spatiotemporal Distribution Characteristics
    of Drought Based on the PDSI and TVDI The response of the land surface to droughts
    is affected by various factors, the most important of which is the land surface
    moisture content. Rain-fed arable land and irrigated arable land are two significant
    types of agricultural land, respectively. The soil moisture of rain-fed arable
    land entirely depends on natural precipitation to meet the water needs of crops
    completely. However, artificial irrigation projects and measures are used to supplement
    the water for crops due to factors such as insufficient precipitation and high
    temperatures throughout the year. Therefore, the two situations need to be discussed
    separately in the subsequent analysis. 3.2.1. Spatiotemporal Distribution Characteristics
    of the PDSI According to the monthly average PDSI value in the middle and lower
    reaches of the Yangtze River from 2010 to 2015, the average PDSI value in 2011
    was the lowest at −3.34, followed by −1.61 in 2013, and the highest in 2015 was
    0.94 (Figure 5). From March to December in 2011, the PDSI values were all lower
    than −2; this was especially the case from April to December, wherein the values
    were generally lower than the annual average, indicating that continuous meteorological
    droughts occurred in spring and summer in the study area. The drought situation
    in 2013 was also prominent, and the PDSI values from April to December mostly
    showed moderate to severe drought. Compared with 2011, the middle and lower reaches
    of the Yangtze River mainly experienced meteorological drought during the summer
    of 2013. Figure 5. The monthly-averaged PDSI values of the middle and lower reaches
    of the Yangtze River in China from 2010 to 2015. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the
    monthly and 3-month spatial distribution of PDSI in the middle and lower reaches
    of the Yangtze River in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Obviously, the meteorological
    drought in 2011 was more severe than in 2013. From January 2011, moderate to severe
    drought gradually developed in Northern Chongqing, northern Hubei, northern Anhui,
    and most of Guizhou and steadily spread to the south and east. The severe to extreme
    drought extended to almost the entire middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
    River from April to May. In summer, the drought tended to subside slightly. From
    June to September, the severe to extreme drought was serious except for Anhui,
    Zhejiang, and some parts of Jiangxi. It was not until November that the meteorological
    drought in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River was significantly
    relieved. Figure 6. Monthly spatial distributions of the PDSI in the middle and
    lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China in 2011 and 2013. Figure 7. Spatial
    distributions of 3-month averages of the PDSI in the middle and lower reaches
    of the Yangtze River in China in 2011 and 2013. Figure 7 shows the difference
    more clearly in meteorological drought between the two years. Unlike the continuous
    drought in the spring and summer of 2011, the meteorological drought in 2013 mainly
    occurred in the summer. In spring, small areas in Guizhou and Hubei first experienced
    meteorological drought. The moderate to severe meteorological drought was observed
    in Southern Guizhou, most of Hubei, and Northern Chongqing in June 2013. With
    the rapid development of drought from July to August, severe to extreme meteorological
    drought occurred in most areas of Guizhou and Hubei and spread to Zhejiang and
    Jiangxi in September and October. The PDSI continued to show severe meteorological
    drought in the northwest part of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
    until the end of 2013. Figure 8 shows the spatial distribution of the annual average
    of the PDSI in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from 2010 to
    2015. The meteorological drought was the most severe in 2011. Followed by 2013
    and 2012, mainly concentrated in Guizhou and Hubei. Compared with the milder drought
    in 2014, 2010 showed a spatial pattern of wet in the east and dry in the west.
    In 2015, there was almost no drought. Figure 8. Spatial distributions of annual
    averages of the PDSI in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China
    from 2010 to 2015. 3.2.2. Spatiotemporal Distribution Characteristics of TVDI
    Using the two-dimensional feature space of the LST and NDVI, the dry edge and
    wet edge were fitted to obtain the TVDI from 2010 to 2015, which was used as the
    agricultural drought index in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
    The TVDI of rain-fed (TVDI-rain) and irrigated arable land (TVDI-irr) were extracted
    separately (Figure 9). According to Figure 9, the minimum monthly average of TVDI-rain
    appeared in 2010 and 2015, indicating that compared with other years, the droughts
    in 2010 and 2015 were the lightest. Furthermore, the annual average value of TVDI-rain
    in 2011 was the highest at 0.699, followed by 0.689 in 2013, and the minimum value
    was 0.641 in 2015, indicating that the rain-fed arable land in the study area
    had the most severe drought in 2011 and 2013, which was consistent with the results
    indicated by the SPEI. Compared with TVDI-rain, the average TVDI-irr in each year
    from 2010–2015 is smaller than TVDI-rain, which proves that due to the existence
    of irrigation measures, the drought condition of irrigated arable land is weaker
    than that of rainfed arable land. In particular, the TVDI-irr values frequently
    fluctuated in 2011 and 2013, indicating that, as the meteorological drought intensified
    and precipitation decreased, the frequency and intensity of irrigation measures
    also increased. Therefore, the monthly and 3-month spatial distributions of TVDI-rain
    and TVDI-irr in 2011 and 2013 are shown in Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12,
    and the images in January and December without crop growth are removed. Figure

    in January and December were removed. (a) The TVDI of rain-fed arable land (TVDI-rain).
    (b) The TVDI of irrigated arable land (TVDI-irr). Obviously, the meteorological
    drought developed rapidly and gradually caused the occurrence of agricultural
    drought due to the severe lack of precipitation and the high temperatures in the
    middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the spring and summer of 2011
    and the summer of 2013. From the end of February to the beginning of March in
    2011, large-scale rain-fed crops during the planting period were in a state of
    moderate to severe water shortage in Guizhou, Chongqing, Hubei, and Anhui. In
    late March, most of the TVDI-rain values were above 0.57, and some areas reached
    0.86, showing extreme drought. In April and May, the drought was relieved, in
    a relative sense, but western Guizhou and Chongqing were still severely dry. Compared
    with the rain-fed arable land, the irrigated arable land suffered much less drought.
    From June to August in summer, as the temperature gradually increased, severe
    to extreme drought conditions spread from the west to most of Hunan and Jiangxi,
    Central Zhejiang, and Southern Anhui. It was not until the harvest period, from
    the end of October to November, that the drought in the middle and lower reaches
    of the Yangtze River tended to disappear. Unlike the continuous drought in the
    spring and summer of 2011, the drought event in the middle and lower reaches of
    the Yangtze River in 2013 lasted for a relatively short time. From February to
    June, the overall dry and wet conditions in the study area were stable, and severe
    drought only occurred in parts of Guizhou and Hunan in early April. In mid-to-late
    June, large-scale irrigated arable land was first affected by drought in Northern
    Anhui and Northeastern Hubei, with the TVDI reaching above 0.76 and even 0.8 in
    some areas, showing extreme drought. While the drought in rainfed arable land
    was dominant in Southern Hubei, drought in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang did not
    occur until mid-July. Especially in mid-August, severe or extreme drought occurred
    in most areas of Guizhou and Hunan. However, the drought of irrigated arable land
    decreased at this time, indicating that although irrigated arable land is more
    sensitive to drought events, artificial irrigation can alleviate the impact of
    drought and establish a non-drought condition. From mid-August to early September,
    the drought was relieved, and the range of extreme drought was reduced due to
    the precipitation brought by the southwest monsoon and typhoon “Utor”. From mid-September
    to October, however, the drought began to intensify and expand in parts of Hunan,
    Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, while the drought in the middle and lower reaches of the
    Yangtze River continued until mid-to-late October and tended to end. According
    to Figure 12a, compared with 2013, the agricultural drought of rain-fed arable
    land in 2011 was more severe in spring and milder in summer. However, for irrigated
    arable land, the degree of agricultural droughts was similar in the spring and
    summer of 2011 but significantly different in 2013 (Figure 12b). The results are
    consistent with the change in meteorological drought, proving the propagation
    effect from meteorological droughts to agricultural droughts. Affected by meteorology
    and precipitation, the response results of rain-fed arable land were consistent
    in different periods. However, irrigated arable land is more sensitive to severe
    meteorological drought. Figure 13 shows the spatial distribution of annual average
    of the TVDI from 2010 to 2015. Compared with irrigated arable land, the agricultural
    drought degree of rainfed arable land has more obvious differences between different
    years. On the one hand, irrigation can significantly alleviate the stress of drought
    on crops and maintain a more stable dry and wet environment. On the other hand,
    the drought situation of rain-fed arable land is inconsistently affected by natural
    precipitation. Figure 13. Spatial distribution of annual average of the TVDI in
    the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China from 2010 to 2015.

    3.3. Correlation Analysis and the Lag Relationship between the PDSI and TVDI 3.3.1.
    Spatial Distribution of Correlation Coefficients from 2010 to 2015 Based on Equation
    (19), the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient between the PDSI
    and TVDI based on pixel scale in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
    from 2010 to 2015 is shown in Figure 14. According to the statistical analysis,
    the spatial correlation between PDSI-rain and TVDI-rain showed an overall negative
    correlation. Among them, the area with a coefficient less than 0 is 414,144 square
    kilometers, accounting for 77.55% of the total area of rainfed arable land. The
    spatial correlation coefficients of PDSI-irr and TVDI-irr were positively correlated
    as a whole, and the area of the positive correlation region was 62,861.81 square
    kilometers, accounting for 68.04% of the total area of irrigated cultivated land.
    Figure 14. Spatial patterns of the correlation coefficient between the PDSI and
    TVDI based on annual averages in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
    from 2010 to 2015. Passed the significance test, with p < 0.05. (a) The PDSI and
    TVDI of rain-fed arable land. (b) The PDSI and TVDI of irrigated arable land.
    Negative correlation coefficients represent opposite trends of the PDSI and TVDI,
    indicating that agricultural drought strongly responds to the temporal and spatial
    changes in meteorology. Based on Figure 14a, the negative correlation between
    the two indices for 77.55% of rain-fed arable land proves that agricultural drought
    also occurs with the emergence of meteorological drought. On the contrary, the
    positive correlation between the two indices for 68.04% of irrigated arable land
    represents that the PDSI and TVDI have similar trends, indicating that agricultural
    drought did not occur or occurred later with the appearance of the meteorological
    drought. However, the existence of some unavoidable interference factors may affect
    the accuracy of the correlation coefficient in Figure 14, such as weaker meteorological
    droughts in other years except 2011 and 2013, and for temporal continuity, the
    months without vegetation growth in the study area are considered, etc. The annual
    correlation curves between the PDSI and TVDI of rain-fed arable land and irrigated
    arable land in Figure 15 are more illustrative and representative, further clarifying
    the relationship between them. Obviously, the meteorological droughts of rain-fed
    arable land were negatively correlated with agricultural droughts in 2010–2015,
    and the correlation was most significant in 2011 and 2013. In other years, the
    relationship between the PDSI and TVDI was relatively weak. However, for irrigated
    arable land, similar to Figure 14b, the PDSI and TVDI showed different degrees
    of positive correlation in 2010–2015, indicating crops were less threatened by
    drought and grew better due to the influence of artificial irrigation measures,
    especially in 2010 and 2015. Figure 15. Correlation curves between the PDSI and
    TVDI of rain-fed arable land and irrigated arable land based on month averages

    Analysis The cross-wavelet transform and wavelet coherence were used to deduce
    the relationship between the PDSI and TVDI in the middle and lower reaches of
    the Yangtze River (Figure 16 and Figure 17). The WTC can reflect the correlation
    between the PDSI and TVDI in the time–frequency domain, and XWT can analyze the
    lag relationship between the PDSI and TVDI data. Figure 16. The cross-wavelet
    transform (XWT) between the PDSI and TVDI time series in the middle and lower
    reaches of the Yangtze River from 2010 to 2015. The abscissa and ordinate represent
    the year and period (month), respectively, and the color bar on the right is the
    wavelet energy. The arrows indicate the relative phase relationship. (a) The XWT

    respectively, and the color bar on the right is the wavelet energy. The arrows

    In Figure 16 and Figure 17, the thick contour represents significance at the 95%
    confidence level against red noise, and the lighter black line is the cone of
    influence (COI) used to remove the edge effects. The wavelet energy is represented
    by the color bar on the right. The arrows indicate the relative phase relationship.
    When the PDSI and TVDI are in phase, the phase angle is 0° and the arrow points
    to the right, indicating that the two indicators are positively correlated. When
    PDSI and TVDI are in antiphase, the phase angle is 180° and the arrow points to
    the left, showing that the two indicators are negatively correlated. Generally,
    there is a lag relationship between meteorological droughts and agricultural droughts.
    In the cross-wavelet transform diagram, the lag time can be calculated according
    to the angle pointed by the arrow. The specific calculation method of converting
    the phase-angle to time lag can be implemented by using MATLAB software [95].
    This method has been validated and widely used in the research of the lag relationship
    of different time series [73,75,98,99]. In general, compared with the irrigated
    arable land, the PDSI and TVDI were more strongly correlated in rainfed arable
    land, showing a large-scale negative correlation, especially on a 12-month timescale.
    By calculating the average phase angle in the XWT, the rain-fed arable land was
    −132.2°, indicating that agricultural drought occurs with an average lag of 33
    days. However, irrigated cultivated land showed a large-scale positive correlation,
    and the lag time could not be determined due to the influence of irrigation measures.
    3.3.3. The Correlation Coefficients between the PDSI and TVDI with Different Lag
    Times in 2011 and 2013 To further explore the lagged relationship between meteorological
    drought and agricultural drought, a correlation analysis was performed on the
    PDSI and TVDI for rain-fed and irrigated arable lands according to Equation (20).
    Based on the crop growth period and drought events in the middle and lower reaches
    of the Yangtze River in 2011 and 2013, the correlation coefficients between the
    PDSI and TVDI with different lag times were calculated (Table 4), where the lag
    times were determined according to the temporal resolution of the PDSI (one month)
    and TVDI (16 days). Table 4. The correlation coefficients between the PDSI and
    TVDI. For rain-fed arable land in 2011 and 2013, the correlation between the PDSI
    and TVDI without lag time was relatively high during the planting and germination
    of vegetation from March to April in the spring, indicating that crop growth,
    water demand, and the dry–wet state are greatly affected by meteorological drought.
    In the peak season of crop development, from May to September, the PDSI was more
    strongly correlated with the TVDI. However, in 2011, the correlation coefficients
    between the PDSI and TVDI lagged by 15 days in May, June, and September and were
    −0.41, −0.13, and −0.53, respectively. This indicates that agricultural drought
    occurred 15 days later than meteorological drought in these three months, while
    the correlation coefficient with a lag of 30 days was −0.36 and −0.51 in July
    and August 2011. Similarly, the crop drought in May–September 2013 lagged behind
    the meteorological drought by about 15 days (May, June, and September) to 30 days
    (July and August). In October, because of the low vegetation coverage of cultivated
    land caused by the autumn harvest, the correlation between the PDSI and TVDI decreased.
    Similar to rain-fed arable land, there was a strong correlation between the PDSI
    and TVDI of irrigated arable land without a lag time in March–May in 2011 and
    2013. However, the correlation in May was obviously weaker than that of rainfed
    arable land, with a correlation coefficient of −0.20 and −0.08, indicating that
    the vegetation germination and heading stage were not significantly affected by
    meteorological drought due to the existence of artificial irrigation measures.
    From June to October, the PDSI had a strong positive correlation with the TVDI,
    which was completely opposite to rainfed arable land. This was especially the
    case in August when the correlation coefficient reached a maximum of 0.35 and
    0.30. In general, the results showed that, although an extreme meteorological
    drought occurred, the vegetation did not experience severe agricultural drought.
    On the contrary, the physiological characteristics and growth of crops were robust
    and consummate, proving that artificial irrigation measures and projects that
    supported the irrigation of cultivated land reduced or even prevented the development
    and occurrence of agricultural drought. 4. Discussion Based on the severe drought
    events in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the spring and
    summer of 2011 and the summer of 2013, the meteorological drought index, PDSI,
    and the agricultural drought index, TVDI, in 2010–2015 were calculated in this
    study. By using the methods of cross-wavelet change, wavelet coherence, and Pearson’s
    correlation analysis, the spatiotemporal evolution patterns, correlation, and
    hysteresis from meteorological to agricultural droughts were analyzed and discussed
    for rainfed arable land and irrigated arable land. Such an analysis can support
    the identification and classification of drought events and guide regional agricultural
    activities and production. 4.1. The Influence of Artificial Irrigation Measures
    on Agricultural Drought There is a significant response relationship between meteorological
    drought and agricultural drought. However, for irrigated croplands, even if severe
    meteorological drought occurs, artificial irrigation measures can alleviate and
    prevent the occurrence of agricultural drought. In this case, there may be a nonlinear
    relationship between meteorological drought and agricultural drought compared
    to rainfed arable land. Cao [79] and Zhou et al. [100] demonstrated the different
    responses of rainfed croplands and irrigated croplands to meteorological drought
    and the importance of irrigation measures. However, few studies have distinguished
    among them for comparative analysis. The drought-stressed area shown by the PDSI
    illustrates that climate change may cause soil moisture deficits, and some researchers
    have also proved that meteorological drought indicators play an important role
    in monitoring and indicating drought in irrigated arable land [101,102,103], but
    it does not consider the realities of agricultural production processes. The TVDI
    can describe the actual agricultural drought conditions due to the combination
    of the LST and NDVI. Therefore, we should fully consider the differences between
    rainfed and irrigated arable land types when exploring the relationship between
    meteorological and agricultural drought, especially in the critical stage of crop
    growth. The results in Section 3.3 serve to demonstrate further the significance
    of this study in distinguishing between the two types of croplands. 4.2. The Significance
    of Hysteresis Analysis of Agricultural Drought The propagation time of meteorological
    drought to agricultural drought can be understood as the lag time of agricultural
    drought to meteorological drought. Thus, this study discussed the hysteresis relationship
    between meteorological drought and agricultural drought by combining cross-wavelet
    change and Pearson’s correlation analysis. The maximum correlation coefficient
    method based on Pearson’s correlation analysis can judge the spread of drought,
    but most studies concentrated on the propagation process of meteorological drought
    to hydrological drought [104,105,106]. In fact, the spread of meteorological drought
    to agricultural drought is more complex [12], and accurate monitoring of the lag
    time is also particularly important. In Section 3.3.3, the time with the largest
    correlation coefficient was taken as the lag time of agricultural drought. The
    results showed that the lag of rain-fed cultivated land is prominent, while the
    lag relationship of irrigated cultivated land is not obvious. The main reason
    for the lag relationship is that the intervention of artificial irrigation measures
    prevented the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought. Zhou
    et al. [100] also found that the propagation time from meteorological drought
    to agricultural drought was shorter under drier conditions than in the case of
    wetter conditions, which was confirmed by the results of this paper, and further
    clarifies the significance of analyzing the hysteresis based on rain-irrigated
    cultivated land. 4.3. The Limitations of this Study There are some limitations
    and deficiencies in this research: (1) Only a single agricultural drought index
    TVDI and a single meteorological drought index, the PDSI, were selected in this
    research, and there was no comparative analysis between different indices. In
    addition, the PDSI is more commonly used for drought analysis on large time scales.
    Decades of PDSI and TVDI data can be supplemented for subsequent long-term drought
    studies. Furthermore, various remote sensing or meteorological drought indices
    can be used to compare and analyze the actual conditions of different drought
    types or regions. There are differences in the drought monitoring effect of special
    indicators. Despite that drought classification levels are only used to analyze
    the overall development of drought, the uncertainty caused by the classification
    still needs to be considered seriously. In fact, few researchers have investigated
    the applicability of existing drought indices under different drought regimes
    in different regions. Therefore, further research needs to combine multiple drought
    indices to improve the accuracy of drought monitoring. (2) There was a lack of
    comprehensive consideration for the sensitivity of different vegetation species
    to the TVDI and PDSI due to the differences in the growth periods of crops. Therefore,
    the study area can be further subdivided according to the crop planting range.
    When combined with the index monitoring results, the analysis of both the drought
    conditions and their causes can be more accurately portrayed. (3) The representativeness
    of the classification base map of rainfed and irrigated cultivated land has not
    been verified, and the quality of the base map will greatly affect the accuracy
    of various indicators in subsequent research. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully
    select the arable land classification maps. The comparison of various datasets
    and the accurate distribution information of irrigated arable cropland become
    the primary objective of the next research paper. 5. Conclusions With an increasing
    global warming trend, monitoring drought disasters has become particularly scientific
    and persistent. This is especially the case for agricultural droughts, which seriously
    threaten agricultural production and food security. Therefore, monitoring and
    predicting agricultural drought events represent a significant and lasting subject.
    As a large-scale data source, satellite remote sensing data provide strong support
    for identifying and analyzing drought disasters. The proposal of multiple drought
    indices can make it easier to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of drought
    scientifically. The PDSI and TVDI were selected as the meteorological and agricultural
    drought indices for the study, and the major conclusions are as follows: (1) According
    to the SPEI monitoring on different time scales in the middle and lower reaches
    of the Yangtze River for several decades, extreme drought events occurred in 2011
    and 2013. Meanwhile, in order to improve the accuracy, high-resolution PDSI data
    is more appropriate for meteorological drought monitoring and meets the needs
    of this study. Moreover, the monitoring results show that severe to extreme meteorological
    drought occurred in different spatial ranges in the middle and lower reaches of
    the Yangtze River in the spring and summer of 2011 and the summer of 2013, which
    is consistent with the records of drought events, indicating the feasibility of
    using the PDSI for multi-year meteorological drought monitoring. (2) In the summer
    of 2011, the rain-fed arable land of the study area featured prominent agricultural
    drought, and severe to extreme droughts gradually spread from the west to most
    of Hunan and Jiangxi, Central Zhejiang, and Southern Anhui. In addition, large
    areas of irrigated arable land experienced drought first in mid-to-late June of
    2013, such as Northern Anhui and Northeastern Hubei. One month later, the rain-fed
    arable land, mainly in Southern Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, suffered
    from agricultural drought. Compared with rainfed land, drought has a greater impact
    on irrigated land, indicating that irrigated lands are more sensitive to drought.
    However, artificial irrigation measures and projects have a certain ability to
    control droughts, which can alleviate the growth-related stress of drought on
    vegetation. Due to the high drought sensitivity of irrigated land, therefore,
    it is necessary for water conservancy and agricultural departments to accurately
    predict and judge the agricultural drought that may be caused by meteorological
    drought and ensure the timeliness and accuracy of irrigation measures to protect
    food security. The effect of irrigation in preventing and mitigating drought is
    beneficial for disaster management decision-making and can be instructive for
    developing and implementing disaster reduction schemes. (3) There is a certain
    lag relationship between the occurrence of meteorological droughts and agricultural
    droughts. The average lag time from meteorological to agricultural droughts in
    the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from 2010 to 2015 was 33 days.
    For rain-fed arable land, compared with meteorological drought, the occurrence
    of agricultural drought was delayed by 0–30 days during the entire growth period
    of vegetation. This is especially the case in the key season of vegetation growth
    from May to September, when there is a one-month lag between agricultural drought
    and meteorological drought. On the contrary, the SPEI and TVDI of irrigated arable
    land were positively correlated from June to October, further indicating that
    irrigated arable land was not threatened by drought due to the existence of irrigation
    measures and projects. Therefore, under the stress of meteorological drought,
    timely drought prevention measures, especially the water supplement for irrigated
    arable land crops, can ensure food security and improve the sustainability of
    local water resource management. For rainfed arable land, it can also provide
    policymakers with a scientific basis for drought mitigation strategies, such as
    increasing and expanding irrigation measures. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: The present study focused on evaluating the groundwater hydrogeochemical
    of shallow aquifers in the semi-arid areas of northern Ethiopia, using geospatial
    modelling and multivariate statistical techniques. Physico-chemical parameters,
    including pH, major ions, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), total hardness (TH), pollution index (PI) and other parameters, from 22
    samples have been used to assess water quality, sources of various ions, water
    types and factors controlling groundwater chemistry. Results showed that the spatial
    distribution of major ions, EC, TDS, TH and PI values in these samples significantly
    differ from one location to another due to geological variations and anthropogenic
    activities of the area. The quality of most groundwater is generally unfit for
    drinking due to their PI, EC, TH, calcium, potassium, total iron and bicarbonate
    (HCO3−) values that found to be above the permissible limits of WHO and Ethiopian
    standards. The parameters like sodium percentage, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR),
    residual sodium bicarbonate, permeability index, magnesium hazard and Kelly’s
    ratio revealed good quality of groundwater for irrigation utilization, whereas
    EC of irrigation water (ECiw), combined effects of ECiw − SAR and bicarbonate
    hazard values indicated that majority of groundwater are not suitable for irrigation
    use. Piper trilinear diagram classified majority of samples under temporary hardness
    with Ca–Mg–HCO3 type. Further, Gibbs diagram reveals that water–rock interaction
    is the major hydrogeochemical processes governing the water chemistry of the study
    area. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a constant water quality checking
    program and improvement of tangible management practices for sustainable utilization
    of groundwater resources.

    Introduction Over 70% of the planet’s total freshwater is positioned in the sub-surface;
    however unregulated and unrestrained withdrawal of this groundwater resource can
    lead changes in aquifer system (Kallioras et al. 2013). As is the case all over
    Tigray, satisfying the demands of agriculture, industry and a growing population
    has exerted pressure upon groundwater resource in Ethiopia (Kawo and Karuppannan
    2018). Considering the societal and ecological importance and usage of groundwater
    resource has a lot to do with its quality and chemistry (Idowu et al. 2017). In
    addition to the anthropogenic effects, groundwater stored in aquifer is also affected
    by geological structure, geochemical processes such as rock-water interaction
    within the aquifer system and constituents of precipitation which percolates into
    the aquifer (Salifu et al. 2017; Dişli 2018). Groundwater quality affects supply
    of drinkable fresh water which is directly linked with human health. Agriculture
    is vital to Ethiopia’s prosperity because about 85% of the greater than 100 million
    populations with a growth rate of 2.6% are engaged in it. Although agricultural
    production in Ethiopia has significantly increased food security, it has also
    damaged water resources. Hence, to manage and sustain water resources efficiently
    and forecast the change in groundwater chemistry, it is necessary to understand
    the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater and its development under
    natural water flow procedures. The groundwater chemistry depends on a number of
    factors such as variations in nature of geochemical reactions, inputs from sources
    other than water–rock interaction, general geology, rate and amount of groundwater
    flow and solubility of salts (Amiri et al. 2015; Gan et al. 2018). Evaluating
    groundwater characteristics using hydrogeochemical methods were reported in different
    parts of the world, for instance, by Li et al. (2014) in northwest China, Tesoriero
    et al. (2004) in the south eastern United States, Möller et al. (2007) in the
    lower Jordan valley and in the Dead Sea area and Wen et al. (2008) in north-western
    China are some of the groundwater studies reported by applying hydrogeochemical
    methods. The increasing exploitation and unsustainable intensification of production
    to support population growth by using mixed agriculture frequently can accelerate
    deterioration in groundwater quality in the northern parts of Ethiopia, particularly
    in Tigray. To minimize future food insecurity in the country, sustainable quantity
    and quality of groundwater become a vital to attain the radical increase in agricultural
    growth and to avoid the expected deterioration of groundwater quality due to extensive
    abstraction for various uses. Gergera watershed, parts of Tigray region in eastern
    zone, is intensively inhabited and overgrazed, leading to increase agricultural
    area. The semi-aridity and agricultural economic dependency are the main cause
    for the high demand for water which is gradually achieved by groundwater over-abstraction.
    For this continual decline of groundwater reservoir as well as deterioration of
    water quality of the watershed, it is necessary to monitor the groundwater chemistry
    in order to maintain the groundwater resources and agricultural development in
    this watershed. So far, the hydrochemistry, geochemical interactions and the suitability
    of the groundwater for drinking and agricultural purposes have not been studied
    in great detail in the watershed. Hence, the purposes of the present study are:
    (1) to determine the physico-chemical and geospatial distributions of groundwater
    parameters, (2) to evaluate the groundwater suitability for drinking and agricultural
    uses by applying various indices and (3) to evaluate hydrogeochemistry and geochemical
    interaction processes controlling groundwater hydrochemistry. The results of the
    study will be useful for sustainable management of groundwater resources according
    to the water chemistry and enable planners and policy makers to develop a strategy
    to solve problems in the region as well as similar problems in elsewhere. Materials
    and methods Study area description The study was held at Gergera watershed (900
    ha), located in the Eastern Zone of Tigray Regional State, in Atsbi Wenberta,
    Northern part of Ethiopia, at about 65 km northeast of Mekelle. Geographically,
    the study area is situated between 39°30'' and 39°45''E and 13°30''–13°45''N.
    The area is located within the Tigray plateau of the northern highlands and lowlands
    physiographic unit of the country (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Location of the study area:
    a Ethiopia, b Tigray indicating Atsbi Wemberta district, c Atsbi Wemberta indicating
    Gergera watershed in sub-district, and d Gergera watershed indicating geological
    classification, as well as intermittent streams and water sampling points Full
    size image The Tigray highlands lying in the northern part of the country are
    generally known for their rugged topography, mountainous landscapes which govern
    the variations in regional geomorphology, water quality, ecological zoning system
    soil classifications, extent and quality of plant and as well as animal life.
    The district of the study area lies within the sub-tropical agro-climatic zone
    and its altitude ranges from 1500 to 2800 m (m) above sea level. The mean annual
    rainfall of the study area is 574.141 mm. Rainfall is a major factor controlling
    the surface and subsurface hydrology of the area. The amount of annual rainfall
    affects the type of vegetation cover and stream and spring discharge and volume
    of the groundwater. The highest value of the mean annual minimum temperature is
    8.5 °C and the lowest value of the mean annual minimum temperature is 6.3 °C,
    whereas the highest and lowest values of mean annual maximum temperatures are
    31.45 and 30.15 °C, respectively. The mean annual air temperature of the watershed
    is 19.7 °C, and the yearly average maximum and minimum temperature is 22.0 °C
    (in June) and 17.0 °C (in December), respectively. The annual variation of temperature
    is thus 5 °C. Agriculture is principal occupation of the people and is backbone
    of Ethiopia’s economy. Rain-fed farmlands, irrigated farmlands, grasslands, bare
    lands with scattered trees and bushes, and built-up areas were identified as major
    land use types in the study area (Hailu and Teka 2020). During rainy season, crops
    such as wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (Zea mays),
    beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and peas (Pisum sativum) are mainly cultivated in both
    rain-fed and irrigated farm lands. However, the major crops grown during the irrigation
    season are vegetables such as potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum),
    onion (Allium cepa), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), hot pepper (Capsicum frutescens)
    and cabbage (Brassica oleracea). The lower catchment is the only area where cultivation
    in the dry season is possible twice a year using irrigation (water from hand-dug
    wells) but with low yield gain. To maximize agricultural yield, local farmers
    use fertilizers such as urea and di-ammonium phosphates. These can contribute
    towards the raise of saline content via salinization processes directly or indirectly.
    Traditional flooding irrigation is a main irrigation type in the study area, causing
    in the loss of nutrients in soils and high nutrients in drainage groundwater.
    Farmland drainage with high nutrients may percolate into shallow aquifer, affecting
    the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater (Li et al. 2016). In the district (Atsbi
    Wenberta) there are about 136,139 populations of these 122,769 (90.18%) are rural
    population and 13,370 (9.81) that of urban populations (Census 2017). Livestock
    rearing is another important activity in the catchment and includes cattle, goat,
    sheep, donkey and bees. Bees and sheep are the main animal husbandry to support
    the crop production. Geologically the area is characterized by Adigrat Sandstone,
    metavolcanics, Enticho Sandstone and alluvial sediments. It has small depressed
    area that extends from South East to North-West bordered by two adjacent highlands
    (Fig. 1). The maximum peak is found in the southern part of the study area outcropped
    with the Adigrat Sandstone and the lowest part is found at the central part of
    the main drainage line at which the fine grained soil was deposited. The wells
    are located on the unconsolidated alluvial sediments of the area. The unconsolidated
    alluvial sediments are highly productive aquifers of the study area while the
    consolidated rocks are none productive aquifers. That is why most groundwater
    samples are situated in the plain alluvial deposits of the watershed (Fig. 1).
    Groundwater sampling and physico-chemical analysis To investigate the water chemistry,
    twenty-two groundwater samples were collected from boreholes (with 30 − 54 m water
    level depth), open hand-dug (with 5 − 10 m water level depth) wells and contact
    springs during December 2017. After 10 − 20 min of pumping, water samples were
    collected in small cleaned polyethylene bottles and the parameters like EC, O2,
    pH and temperature were measured in situ at the time of sample collection. After
    collecting the groundwater samples, the polyethylene bottles were labeled correctly
    for identification and packed in chiller box and transported to the laboratory
    for analysis. The location, coordinates and elevation of the sampling position
    of the groundwater samples of each site were collected using Garmin handheld GPS
    receiver (± 5 m or better accuracy). The groundwater samples were stored at 4
    °C refrigerator chiller until their laboratory analysis. Water samples were analyzed
    in the Geochemistry Analytical Laboratory of Earth Sciences department at Mekelle
    University. Filtered and acidified water samples (< 0.45 μm) were analyzed for
    cations using ICP-90 system. Anions were analyzed from unfiltered water samples
    using an ion chromatography method. Before cations and anions analyses, the samples
    were again pre-checked and tested for EC, pH, and temperature in the laboratory
    to cross check the data. Iron and manganese were analyzed with an atomic absorption
    spectrophotometer separately. The HCO3− of the groundwater was calculated as sum
    of conservative cations minus sum of conservative anions in the analyzed sample
    parameters considering the pH ranges (6.8 to 8.2) in the study area and the carbonic
    acid dissociation stage in the bicarbonate stage as explained by Walton WC (1970).
    The important anion is HCO3− rather than the CO32− in all groundwater samples,
    bcause all CO32− are gone at pH less than or equal to 8.3. All the pH values are
    also greater than 3.82. Therefore, consideration for the concentration of H+ is
    not important in the ions balance calculation as it is very low. The concentration
    of OH− ions in solution is about 7 in the orders of magnitude lower compared to
    the H+ ions. This is also insignificant to consider in the ionic balance. After
    physiochemical analysis, the accuracy of the analysis results was checked through
    charge balance using Eq. (1) as Gidey (2018) reported. And the analysis results
    were accurate and can be used for the study as the maximum relative error of the
    results is within the acceptable error limit (± 5%). The total permanent hardness
    of groundwater, which is basically the concentration of calcium and magnesium
    ions expressed as equivalent of calcium carbonate (Kaur et al. 2017) was also
    calculated as the molar mass of CaCO3, Ca2+ and Mg2+ are 100.1, 40.1 and 24.3
    g mol−1 respectively. The ratios of molar masses of (CaCO3 /Ca2+) is 2.5 and (CaCO3
    /Mg2+) is 4.1. Therefore, the total permanent water hardness expressed as equivalent
    of CaCO3 was calculated using Eq. (2). In addition to the total hardness, the
    total dissolved solids (TDS) are also the main parameters which are used to assess
    the water quality for drinking purposes (Davis and Dewiest 1967). The overall
    quality of water can be described using Pollution Index (PI). PI is a method of
    rating that tells us the combined influence of each parameter. PI has value starting
    from 0 to 5 or above, reflecting the relative importance of individual quality
    parameter and divided by the recommended standard (Si) for the maximum plus the
    minimum values and the summation divided by two as shown by Eq. (3) (Amiri et
    al. 2015). Where Ci represents values of the water quality parameter obtained
    from the laboratory analysis and Si represents values of the water quality parameter
    obtained from recommended standards of WHO (2004) for drinking water. The groundwater
    status can be classified as none polluted for PI less than one. However, it can
    be classified as slightly polluted, moderately polluted, strongly polluted and
    seriously polluted for PI value ranges 1–2, 2−3, 3−5 and > 5, respectively (Amiri
    et al. 2015). The various groundwater chemistry parameters were calculated and
    categorized to determine the suitability of irrigation groundwater quality based
    on recommendations for sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) (Richards 1954), sodium percentage
    (%Na) & combined effects of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECiw)
    with Na% and SAR (Wilcox 1955), Kelly’s Ratio (KR) (Nassem et al. 2010), Permeability
    Index (KI), Magnesium Hazard indices (MH), Residual sodium bicarbonate (RSB) (Ghalib
    2017) and Bicarbonate (HCO3−) hazard (WHO 2004) for irrigation water as given
    in Eqs. (4–8) bellow when all values of parameter are expressed in meq/L. $$\\%

    analysis were transformed into ArcGIS 10.4 platform and raster datasets were used
    to produce each thematic map using inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW)
    method to show the spatial distributions of EC, TDS, TH, PI and major ions. Geospatial
    distribution analysis tools like inverse distance weighted (IDW) method of interpolation
    is vital to produce raster surface (Idowu et al. 2017; Gidey 2018). Furthermore,
    to determine the functional sources of ions and the factors that governing the
    trends in the hydrochemistry of the watershed, multivariate statistical analysis
    such as correlation chemical analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were
    performed for the water samples. Results and discussion Physico-chemical and geospatial
    distribution analyses The summary of the analytical results and univariate statistical
    measures of parameter such as minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation is
    presented in Table 1. Table 1 The statistical summary of the physico-chemical
    parameters of Gergera groundwater samples collected from the study area Full size
    table Based on the water chemistry analysis results, the major cation in the studied
    groundwater is Ca2+, followed by Mg2+ and Na+. HCO3− is the dominant anion, followed
    by SO42− and Cl−. The pH of groundwater samples analyzed in the watershed ranges
    from 6.8 to 8.5, which elaborates a trend from weakly acidic to alkaline chemical
    reaction within the groundwater system. There is no samples fall above the Compulsory
    Ethiopia Standard CES (2013) recommended permissible limits for pH. There is a
    high variation in electrical conductivity (EC) of groundwater in the watershed
    ranging from 421 µS cm−1 in the close the eastern upper slopes of Gergera mountains
    i.e. the upper part of the watershed to 1143 µS cm−1 in the western aquifer of
    the watershed i.e. the lower section of the watershed, with a mean of 672 µS cm−1.
    EC was found to be much higher than the permissible limits as prescribed by the
    WHO standard. Lowest EC is located in the recharge areas originating from spring
    at the contact point of basement and Adigrat Sandstone, while individual elevated
    EC values should have variable origins, such as intensive agricultural practices,
    the shallow depth of water table well and subsequent high evaporation, and geological
    conditions acquiring high concentration of the dissolved minerals. Hence, Of the
    22 samples analysed, 100% have EC values above the WHO maximum permissible limit
    of 400 µS/cm. Spatial distribution map of the EC is indicated in Fig. 2a. Generally,
    EC values increase from recharge areas in eastern towards discharge areas in west
    of the watershed. Fig. 2 Spatial distribution for drinking water quality classification
    based on weighted overlay model for: a EC, b total hardness (TH), c TDS and d
    pollution index (PI) Full size image The total dissolved solids (TDS) in the groundwater
    ranges from 294.7  to  732 mg L−1 with a mean of 430 mg/L. 13.6% of the sampled
    water was found to be much higher than the desirable limits (500 mg/L) as prescribed
    by the WHO (2004) standard, while 86.4% fall within the desirable limits. However,
    there was no TDS value that found to be much higher than the maximum permissible
    limits (1500 mg/L) as prescribed by this WHO standard. The lowest and highest
    TDS were recorded in the same location where the lowest and highest EC values
    were recorded. Hence, the possible sources for the higher TDS in the watershed
    may include dissolved solids from natural sources and agricultural runoff. The
    geospatial analysis for TDS suggests that the concentration of TDS increases towards
    the alluvial plain of the watershed (Fig. 2c.). Among the physico-chemical parameters
    studied, total iron, potassium and calcium were found to be much higher than the
    maximum limits as prescribed by the CES (2013) standards. The total hardness (TH)
    of the watershed varies from 119.30 to 287.30 mg/L, with a mean of 183 mg/L. Of
    the 22 samples analyzed, the TH classification (Kaur et al. 2017) (Table 2), most
    groundwater fall within the hard (41%) and very hard (54.5%) class and as such
    cannot be categorized as drinkable. Table 2 Classification of groundwater samples
    of the study area on the basis of TH and TDS Full size table The highest value
    of 287.30 mg/L was recorded at the downstream section of the watershed, due to
    the highest value 45 mg/L of Mg2+ in the groundwater. Whilst the lowest value
    of 119.30 mg/L recorded at the location of upperpart due to the lowest concentration
    13.2 mg/L of Mg2+. The spatial distribution analysis for TH explained that the
    TH increased from the eastern part (upperpart) toward the western part (downward)
    of the watershed (Fig. 2b). Calcium is the dominant cation in the study area and
    is largely responsible for the hardness of water. Similar result for calcium dominancy
    was found in the southern part of the region by Gidey (2018). Ca2+ in the study
    area varies from 45.1 to 108 mg/L, with a mean of 83 mg/L. 73% of the 22 groundwater
    samples analysed showed Ca2+ values exceeding their maximum permissible limit
    of 75 mg/L (CES 2013) while the 27% fall within the permissible limit of the CES.
    The high Ca2+ and Mg2+ values confirm the high total hardness recorded and finally
    makes the water none potable (unfit for drinking). This hardness of water may
    be caused due to the calcareous property of soil in the study area. Magnesium
    (Mg2+) is the dominant ion next to calcium ion in the study area. It varies from
    13.20 to 45 mg/L, with a mean of 23.70 mg/L. None of the samples showed magnesium
    value exceeding their maximum permissible limit of 150 mg/L (CES 2013; WHO 2004).
    Mg2+ typically arises in reduced amount than Ca2+ in groundwater due to the fact
    that the dissolution of Mg2+ rich rocks is slow process. Sodium ion (Na+) and
    potassium ion (K+) concentrations varies from 11.50 to 39.7 and 0.00 to 3.30 mg/L,
    with a mean of 20.10 and 1.20 mg/L respectively. Na+ does not have any prescribed
    limits for drinking water but the high levels of Na+ in drinking water makes it
    salty in nature (Kaur et al. 2017). Five water samples have K+ values above the
    CES maximum permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L. The total iron (Fe2+) concentrations
    in the study area ranges from 0.31 to 0.60 mg/L, with a mean of 0.39 mg/L indicating
    that all samples were found to exceed the maximum permissible limit of Fe2+ for
    drinking water (0.3 mg/L by CES). Excessive Fe2+ may give water a metallic flavour
    and affect how food and beverages taste. As iron is the second most plentiful
    metallic element in the Earth’s crust (Davison 1993), iron in groundwater might
    originate from a diversity of mineral sources; and numerous sources of iron might
    be exist in a single groundwater aquifer system. Oxidation–reduction reactions,
    organic matter content, and the metabolic activity of bacteria can influence the
    concentration of iron in the groundwater (Davison 1993). The highest Fe2+ concentration
    of 0.60 mg/L occurs at the geology of Adigrat sandstone aquifer in the watershed.
    The existence of Adigrat and Enticho sandstones in the study area are assumed
    to be the main sources for the distribution of total iron concentrations. Among
    the anions concentrations, bicarbonate (HCO3−) represents the first dominant anion,
    ranging from 222 to 463 mg/L, with a mean of 324.4 mg/L, followed by SO42− and
    Cl−. The lowest HCO3− value of 222 mg/L located at the point of contact spring,
    while the highest value of 463 mg/L located at the downstream of the watershed.
    The possible source for the presence of high HCO3− in groundwater is the soil,
    by dissociation of carbonic acid (H2CO3) produced by the reaction of water with
    CO2. The decay of organic matter from intensive agricultural activities in the
    study area can contribute to the enrichment of CO2 in the soil. Further, high
    HCO3− values could have derived from CO2 in the atmosphere and by dissolution
    of carbonate (dolomite) rocks in the study area. The results of this study are
    similar to the results reported by Salifu et al. (2017) for the middle voltaian
    aquifers of the Gushegu district of the northern region of Ghana. From the pH
    ranges (6.8 − 8.2) in the study area and the carbonic acid dissociation stage
    in the bicarbonate stage, the important anion is HCO3− rather than the CO32− in
    all groundwater samples, bcause all CO32− are gone at pH less than or equal to
    8.3 (Walton 1970). All the pH values are also greater than 3.82. Therefore, consideration
    for the concentration of H+ is not important in the ions balance calculation as
    it is very low. The concentration of OH− ions in solution is about 7 in the orders
    of magnitude lower compared to the H+ ions. This is also insignificant to consider
    in the ionic balance. Hence, the HCO3− ion was expressed in terms of the differences
    between sum of conservative cations and sum of conservative anions. Generally,
    out of the 22 samples analysed, 82% fall within the recommended allowable limit
    of 380 mg/L HCO3− in water (WHO 2004), while the remaining 18% fall above the
    recommended allowable limit. Sulphate ions (SO42−) concentration in the watershed
    varies from 7.92 to 92.40 mg/L, with a mean of 35.10 mg/L. The lowest and highest
    SO42− values are recorded at the downstream and upper stream of the watershed,
    respectively. It is in the same location where the highest HCO3− value was recorded.
    With respect to the WHO (2004) recommended allowable limit for sulphate in groundwater
    (200 mg/L), the waters could be safe to be drinkable. Chloride (Cl−) concentrating
    in the watershed ranges from 16.50 to 46.40 mg/L, with a mean of 27.20 mg/L. The
    lowest and highest Cl− values are recorded at the contact spring (located at the
    upper part) and at the downstream of the watershed, respectively. The water sample
    point at the downstream happens to be the same location where the highest SO42−
    value was recorded. None of the samples showed the Chloride concentration above
    the permissible limit of 250 mg/L by CES (2013). Nitrate in groundwater generally
    originates from nitrate sources on the land surface, in the soil zone, or from
    the applications of nitrogen contained fertilizers (commonly urea, nitrate or
    ammonium compounds) that are used in agricultural practices (Salifu et al. 2017).
    Nitrate concentration in the studied watershed ranges from 0.15 to 43.60 mg/L,
    with a mean of 10.30 mg/L, falling within the CES and WHO guideline limits of
    50 and 45 mg/L, respectively. The fluoride content in the groundwater of the study
    area ranges from 0.00 to 0.80 mg/L, with mean and standard deviation of 0.37 and
    0.16 mg/L, respectively. The fluoride concentrations in the groundwater are below
    the CES and WHO maximum permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L, which otherwise contributes
    to tooth caries. In general, the relative abundance of major cations and anions
    of the groundwater samples in the study area from the highest to the lowest was
    Ca2+  > Mg2+  > Na+  > K+ & HCO3−  > SO42−  > Cl−  > NO3− respectively. The concentration
    of NH4+, NO2−, Li+ and PO42− in the groundwater varied from 0  to  0.5, 0 to 0.8,
    0.00  to  0.01 and 0 to 0.06, with mean values of 0.06, 0.04, 0.003 and 0.004
    mg/L, respectively. All analysed water samples of the studied area have insignificant
    concentrations of manganese and strontium. Therefore, we did not include the concentrations
    of manganese and strontium in our statistical summary results. The dissolved oxygen
    (O2) and temperature (°C) of the groundwater also varied from 0.11 to 8.1 and
    19 to 24 with mean value of 3.4 mg/L and 21 °C, respectively. This reflects generally
    more anoxic conditions rather than oxic and therefore favors more reduction to
    oxidation. The spatial distribution map of major cations and anions, except K+
    and NO3−, in Gergera watershed showed that the major cations and anions concentration
    distribution increased from the eastern part (upperpart) toward the western part
    (downward) of the watershed (Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that the sources of major
    cations and anions in groundwater are rock weathering and anthropogenic pollution
    sources including runoff and drainage from irrigable agricultural practices in
    the study area. Fig. 3 Spatial distribution for major cations classification based
    on weighted overlay model Full size image Fig. 4 Spatial distribution for major
    anions classification based on weighted overlay model Full size image The spatial
    distribution map of K+ in the watershed showed that the K+ concentration increased
    from the downward toward the upperpart of the watershed (Fig. 3d), especially
    around the deep drilled aquifer materials, indicating that the important source
    of K+ in groundwater is dissolution of potassium-bearing minerals such as sylvite
    (KCl), Jarosite-K, potash contained fertilizers and as well as due to use of runoff
    water for irrigation. Potassium is generally more easily fixed on clay minerals
    in the rock matrix. Hence it is the least abundant among the major cations. The
    spatial distribution map of NO3− showed that its concentration distribution increased
    from all directions concentrating towards the central part of the watershed, especially
    around the highly extracted wells, were high concentrations of NO3− distribution
    (Fig. 4d). This indicates that the main sources of NO3− could be derived from
    return flow during water fetch, infiltration of local sewage, animal excrement,
    runoff and drainage from irrigable agricultural lands as also described in Salifu
    et al. (2017) and Kasper et al. (2019). Pollution index (PI) The groundwater quality
    was assessed using pollution index (PI) and the results revealed that 55% of the
    water samples showed PI above 1 indicating that most groundwater in the study
    area are slightly polluted while 45% of the water samples were none polluted (Table
    2). The spatial distribution of PI for overall quality of water result using rating
    the combined influence of each parameter method is classified based on weighted
    overlay model. The final spatial distribution analysis of PI method result showed
    that PI severity increased toward the downstream of the watershed (Fig. 2d). The
    increased levels of PI towards the downstream might be due to the presence of
    natural and human influence directing towards the downstream by the present effects
    of leaching and runoff in the watershed. This finding is in line with Amir et
    al. (2015) who suggested that the groundwater quality becomes significantly worsened
    towards the downstream of the area following the groundwater flow paths. Multivariate
    statistical analysis of groundwater chemical To understand the natural and anthropogenic
    influences on groundwater as well as to facilitate solution for such problems,
    multivariate statistical techniques play a great role in our ecosystem (Selvakumar
    et al. 2017; Dişli and Gülyüz 2020). Correlation analysis and principal component
    analysis (PCA) have been widely used as unbiased approaches in the study of groundwater
    quality data for obtaining meaningful information (Ravikumar and Somashekar 2010).
    Correlation analysis The correlation analysis is a method to evaluate the relationships
    between physico-chemical properties of groundwater which can reveal the major
    hydrochemical evolution processes within an aquifer and can also be used to deduce
    the sources of ions and the origin of the groundwater (Jothivenkatachalam et al.
    2010; Wu et al. 2013). The strong or moderate positive relations are pointers
    of the importance of the parameters in the groundwater hydrochemistry of the study
    area and their trend to follow similar propensity (Gidey 2018). The correlation
    matrices test for 14 water quality parameters of 22 groundwater samples were calculated
    using PAST software and the values of the correlation coefficient are given in
    Table 3. Table 3 Pearson correlation coefficients for 14 hydrogeochemical parameters
    of groundwater samples of Gergera watershed Full size table EC and TDS have a
    high correlation (r = 1) to each other suggesting an absolute straight linear
    association. Table 3 shows that Mg2+, Br−, Na+, Cl−, HCO3−, and SO42− are strongly
    correlated with TDS with the r value of 0.91, 0.89, 0.83, 0.70, 0.67 and 0.6,
    respectively, which indicate that these ions are the most effective in the mineralization
    and salinization of the groundwater of the watershed. Their concentrations also
    mostly influenced from the sources of geological and chemicals used in agriculture
    and domestic discharges that increase towards the downstream of the watershed
    due to the effect by runoff. Br− concentration is closely correlated with Cl−
    suggesting that both Br− and Cl− have a common source (salt). There is an increase
    in Br−/Cl− ratio along the downstream due to the dissolution of halite from one
    or more sources. In addition to this, there is also a predictable correlation
    between Br− and EC indicating more than one main source of salts contributes to
    the noticed conductivity. There is a gradual increase in Br− levels as distance
    from the upper watershed increase following the direction of groundwater streamlines.
    This is caused by the dissolution, runoff and leaching of ions out of soil. The
    increase in concentration follows the same pattern for the other ions too. The
    moderate correlation between Na+ and Cl− (r = 0.53) indicates that the major sources
    of these elements were influenced by marine deposits and dissolution of halite
    during groundwater flow. The concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ have a strong positive
    correlation with TH (r = 0.78 and 0.94, respectively), which is emphasize as hardness
    is mainly measure of Ca2+ and Mg2+. The strong correlation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ with
    TH indicates that Ca2+ and Mg2+ control the alkalinity character of the groundwater.
    TH is also strongly correlated with HCO3− (r = 0.92) and moderately correlated
    with SO42− (r = 0.51), suggesting that TH is basically a temporary hardness. There
    is a weak correlation of Ca2+ with SO42− (r = 0.25) but a strong correlation of
    Na+ with Mg2+ (r = 0.69), implying that the dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite
    alone may not be expected as a main sources of Ca2+ and SO42−. Other reactions
    involving Ca2+, such as dolomite or calcite dissolution/precipitation and ions
    exchange, may well account for the correlation with SO42−. For example, HCO3−
    has a similar and strong correlation with both Ca2+ (r = 0.82) and Mg2+ (r = 0.81),
    so the dissolution of dolomite can be assumed as a main source of Ca2+, Mg2+ and
    HCO3−. K+, NO3−, F− and pH did not show any correlation with almost all parameters.
    Hence, the main parameters controlling the groundwater hydrogeochemistry are TDS,
    EC, TH, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, HCO3−, SO42− Cl− and Br− whilst changes in K+, NO3−,
    F− and pH have minimal influences in the hydrogeochemistry of the study area.
    Principal component and factor analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) is
    a method for pattern recognition that attempts to describe the alteration of a
    large set of inter-correlated variable (Ravikumar and Somashekar 2017). PCA extracts
    associations and enables to reduce the number of dataset into components that
    describe a portion of the total variance between groundwater’s chemical parameter.
    An eigenvalue provides a measure of the significance factor, where the uppermost
    eigenvalue resembles the greatest important. Eigenvalues > 1 are considered significance.
    Table 4 presents the PCA results comprising the loadings, Eigenvalues, percentage
    of total and cumulative variance for chemical parameter on five significant principal
    components (PCs). Table 4 Factor loadings for 15 hydrochemical parameters of groundwater
    Full size table Based on the criteria of Cattell and Jaspers (1967), five principal
    components (PCs) with Eigenvalues > 1 were taken. The five factors (PCs) explain
    89.5% of the total variance of the groundwater dataset, are responsible for governing
    geochemistry of groundwater in the study area. The scree plot indicated in Fig.
    5 is also the method of identifying a number of useful PCs, in which, a sharp
    decline in sizes of Eigenvalues where results in an alteration in the slope of
    the plot from steep to shallow could be detected. Fig. 5 PCA scree plot of the
    Eigenvalues for the dataset of groundwater samples Full size image The clarified
    variance is mostly associated to the chemical parameters loadings are categorized
    as ‘strong’ (> 0.70), ‘moderate’ (0.70–0.50) and ‘weak (0.50–0.30) (Liu et al.
    2003). PC1, which explained 48.4% of the total variance, had strong and moderate
    positive loadings particularly with Mg2+, TH, TDS, EC, Br−, Cl−, HCO3−, Na+, SO2−
    and Ca2+ respectively. Those parameters contribute a significant factor loading
    could possibly control the groundwater chemistry. High positive loading of Mg2+,
    TH, TDS, EC, Br−, Cl−, HCO3−, Na+ and moderate loading values for Ca2+ and SO2−
    demonstrate incidence of rock weathering and anthropogenic activities such as
    irrigation, fertilizer application, waste disposal, excrements from human and
    livestock, and groundwater abstraction. Hence, PC1 strongly supported for the
    ideas that described in correlation analysis. The PC2 explains 12.6% of the total
    variance and has high loadings of pH (positive), Ca2+ (negative) and NO3− (negative)
    and are shown on this factor, suggesting that anthropogenic activities (example,
    Ca2+ from use of fertilizers) may have impact on the groundwater chemistry. The
    sources of NO3− could be derived from infiltration of local sewage, animal excrement,
    runoff and drainage from irrigable agricultural lands. PC3 explains for 10.6%
    of the variability and is highly (negative) and moderately (positive) correlated
    with F− and Fe respectively. Unlike the concentrations and ratio for Cl− and Br−
    which are related to inputs, the concentrations of F− and Fe2+ together with PC3
    result suggest that the principal contribution is by water-acidic rock interaction.
    PC4 explains for 9.6% of the variability and is highly correlated with Fe and
    other parameters have been low negative and positive values of loadings. From
    PC4 loading factor results and geology of the study area, we can infer that the
    presence of high iron concentrations in groundwater with low sulphate levels may
    reflect siderite (FeCO3) and Melanterite (FeSO4:7H2O) dissolutions in the aquifer
    system (Chou et al. 2002). PC5 explains 8.3% of the total variance and has high
    positive factor loading for potassium and moderate negative loading factor for
    SO42−. This can be attributed by weathering of potash silicate minerals, potash
    fertilizers, drainage and dissolution of secondary salts in the soil together
    with the agricultural wastes in the watershed. The dissolution of reactive minerals
    such as Sylvite (KCl) could play a great role to increase the concentration of
    K+ in the groundwater. Water quality classification for irrigation purpose The
    chemistry of groundwater is an important consideration in any evaluation of its
    suitability for irrigation as the groundwater is being used for irrigation in
    Tigray region. The important water chemistry parameters to understand the quality
    of water for irrigation purpose include salinity of irrigation water (ECiw), Sodium
    absorption ratio (SAR), sodium percentage (%Na), bicarbonate (HCO3−) hazard, residual
    sodium bicarbonate (RSC), Kelly’s ratio (KR), permeability index (KI) and magnesium
    hazard (MH) as described in the methodology section. Total dissolved solids and
    ECiw Integrated quality management of these water quality parameters with soil
    can prompt maximum crop yield (Gidey 2018). Based on total dissolved solids (TDS)
    classification, groundwater samples fall in none saline category (Table 2). Considering
    the salinity of irrigation water (ECiw) for salinity classification, it was found
    that water samples were categorized under none (63.6%) and slight to moderate
    (36.4%) salinity degree of restriction classes (Table 5). Therefore, ECiw values
    indicate presence of two types of groundwater: 1) groundwater that is not hazardous
    and needs no restriction on use, and 2) groundwater that needs slight to moderate
    degree of restriction on use. Table 5 Water quality and its potential irrigation
    problems Full size table The first type groundwater can be used for irrigation
    for almost all crops and for almost all kinds of soils. Very small salinity level
    might grow which might need slight supervision; however it is allowable under
    usual irrigation performs except in soils of very low permeability. To attain
    an optimum yield of agriculture using the second category, constant water quality
    checking program and improvement of management practices such as selection of
    crop and management alternatives are essential. Sodium absorption ratio (SAR)
    SAR is an important parameter to evaluate the suitability of water for irrigation
    purposes, because sodium concentration can decrease the soil penetrability and
    soil structure (Todd 2005). The SAR values of groundwater varied between 0.76
    and 2.86 meq/L with an average value of 1.54 meq/L. The classification of water
    samples from the study area with respect to SAR (Richards 1954), all the samples
    were under the excellent category (< 10 meq/L). Therefore, the SAR values revealed
    that the water is suitable for irrigation. Combined effect of SAR with ECiw The
    classification of water samples using the combined effect of sodium absorption
    ratio with salinity of irrigation water (SAR-ECiw) (Wilcox 1955) indicated that
    36.4% of water samples have no hazards of sodicity will arise if the groundwater
    from these wells is considered for use. While the remaining (63.6%) of the samples
    suggest that the water from these wells need slight to moderate degree of restriction
    on use (Table 5). If appropriate managements are not implemented, those groundwater
    which have slight to moderate restriction on use currently can attain severe restriction
    on use and sodium toxicity for future surface irrigation will happened. The irrigation
    water with HCO3− in high pH irrigation water can worsen the soil Na+ hazard by
    causing Ca2+ and Mg2+ to precipitate, thereby becoming unavailable to counteract
    the negative effect of Na+. Sodium percentage (%Na) and ECiw-%Na Sodium percentage
    is an essential parameter for evaluating sodium hazard and is, therefore, widely
    used for assessing the suitability of water quality for irrigation usage (Wilcox
    1955). The presence of sodium may react with soil, thereby reducing its permeability.
    The %Na of groundwater ranged from 8.74 to 23.93 with mean value of 13%. The results
    based %Na (Wilcox 1955), showed that (except one sample, %Na = 23.93, classed
    as good), all of the samples were found to be excellent category (%Na < 20) for
    irrigation. However, classification of groundwater samples based on combined effects
    electrical conductivity of irrigation water or salinity and percent sodium (ECiw-%Na)
    (Wilcox 1955), showed that 86.4 and 13.6% of the samples found under excellent
    to good and good to permissible categories respectively. The existence of excess
    of sodium causes some of the water samples to be in the good-to-permissible ranges
    and may affects air and water circulation in the soil during wet situation (Ghalib
    2017). This result is similar with previous results of Gidey (2018) who reported
    the salinity hazard results raged from good to permissible water classes for irrigation
    in surrounding the Mekelle city. Residual sodium bicarbonate (RSB) The irrigation
    water classification on the basis of RSB was calculated for each groundwater by
    equation given by Ghalib (2017). The calculated RSB of the groundwater ranged
    from − 2.8 to − 0.26, with an average value of − 1.18 meq/L. Based on RSB values,
    all groundwater samples analysed were obtained to be satisfactory (< 5 meq/L)
    (Table 5), indicating that every groundwater is safe for irrigation purposes.
    Bicarbonate (HCO3 −) hazard Bicarbonate is another alternative measure of the
    Na+ content in relative with magnesium and calcium. Bicarbonate ion (HCO3−) combined
    with Ca2+ or Mg2+ may precipitate as CaCO3 or MgCO3 when the soil solution concentrates
    in drying circumstances. In these circumstances, the concentration of Ca2+ and
    Mg2+ could decrease relating to Na+ causing that the SAR value to be bigger, leading
    the soil to be more alkaline with high pH value. The bicarbonate of the groundwater
    ranged from 222 to 463 mg/L with an average value of 324.4 mg/L (Table 2). According
    to HCO3− values, all groundwater samples suggest that the water from these wells
    need slight to moderate degree of restriction on use (Table 5). This study is
    similar to that of Kawo and Karuppannan (2018) who reported HCO3− as a dominant
    anion of groundwater in Modjo River Basin found at the central part of Ethiopia.
    Permeability index (KI) According to KI indices, the groundwater can be divided
    into excellent, good and unsuitable with values > 75, 25 − 75 and < 25% permeability,
    respectively (Doneen 1962). Hence, the water quality based on KI showed that all
    the samples fall in the good quality category ranging from 39.14 to 56.10%, indicating
    that the waters are suitable for irrigation purpose. Magnesium hazard (MH) The
    magnesium hazard value is the excess of Mg2+ over Ca2+ and Mg2. Generally, Ca2+
    and Mg2+ sustain a state of equilibrium in groundwater. However, an excess of
    magnesium present in water disturbs the soil quality, resulting in poor crop yield
    returns. This was assessed by calculating MH and the result for all groundwater
    samples fall in the ranges of 23.8 to 49.8% which are less than 50%, indicating
    that all the waters are suitable for irrigation purposes (Table 5). Kelly’s ratio
    (KR) KR is one of the important ratios in the assessment of water quality for
    irrigation purpose (Nassem et al. 2010). A KR of more than one indicates an excess
    of sodium in waters. Therefore, water with the KR less than one is suitable for
    irrigation, while those with a ratio more than three are unsuitable for agricultural
    purpose due to alkali hazards. KR of groundwater of the study area varies from
    0.10 to 0.31 (with mean = 0.14) that make all the waters to be in the category
    of suitable for irrigation purposes (Table 5). Generally, the water with potential
    problems on use for irrigation concentrates in the western part of the study area.
    Water types in the study area In this study, major cations and anions (Ca2+, Mg2+,
    Na+, K+, HCO3−, SO42− and Cl−) were plotted in a Piper diagram (Piper 1944) to
    understand the major hydrochemical facies (Fig. 6) using AquaChem v 3.7 Software.
    Fig. 6 Piper diagram showing distribution and classification of water types based
    on major ions Full size image The results of groundwater hydrochemical analysis
    revealed that majority of the samples belong to Ca–Mg–HCO3 type while the other
    samples belong to Ca–HCO3 and Ca–Mg–Na–HCO3 type. Based on Walton (1970) method
    of hydrochemical facies classification, the groundwater samples belonged to temporary
    hard water. This reflected by more than 50% of the total dissolved constituent
    load in meq/L which is contributed by combined Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3−. Therefore,
    recharging characteristics were observed in almost all samples falling in Ca–Mg–HCO3
    type; and such waters could considered as dominated in Precambrian aquifer or
    in unconsolidated deposits containing abundant carbonate minerals. Recharging
    waters are formed when water infiltrates into the ground from the surface, it
    carries dissolved carbonate in the form of HCO3− and the geochemically mobile
    Ca2+ (Ravikumar and Somashekar 2017). On the basis of this diagram (Fig. 6), it
    is clear that in all the waters, alkaline earths (Ca2+  + Mg2+) are higher than
    alkali element (Na+  + K+) either due to the preferential release of Ca2+ and
    Mg2+ from mineral weathering of exposed bedrock or probably reverse cation exchange
    reactions of Ca2+  + Mg2+ into solution and following adsorption of sodium onto
    aquifer materials. Factors controlling groundwater chemistry Chemistry of groundwater
    is mainly controlled by the interaction of groundwater with aquifer minerals.
    The role of rock-water interaction and anthropogenic effects on groundwater can
    be investigated by diverse hydrogeochemical processes (Kaur et al. 2017). To obtain
    a highlight into hydrogeochemical processes, Gibbs (1970) has suggested scatter
    plot method, by using TDS versus Na+/(Ca2+  + Na +) for cations and Cl−/(Cl−  + HCO3−)
    for anions, illustrating three significant natural mechanism controlling major
    ion chemistry of the groundwater including the rainfall dominance, water–rock
    interaction dominance, evaporation and precipitation dominance. It was found that
    all of the water samples collected from shallow and deep wells falls in rock dominance.
    This revealed the importance of water–rock interactions as the primary sources
    of dissolved ions controlling the chemical composition of these waters (Kaur et
    al. 2017). This study is similar to that of Li et al (2016) who reported chemical
    weathering of minerals as main factor controlling the evolution of groundwater
    chemistry in and around Hua Country (China) (Fig 7). Fig. 7 Gibbs plot for mechanism
    controlling groundwater chemistry; a Gibbs cations ratio and b Gibbs anions ratio
    Full size image Conclusions Groundwater in the eastern part of Tigray region (Ethiopia)
    is mainly slightly alkaline freshwater. The abundance of major cations is in the
    order Ca2+  > Mg2+  > Na+  > K+ and that for anions is HCO3−  > SO42−  > Cl−  > NO3−,
    which makes the majority of the water samples fall in the class of Ca–Mg–HCO3
    water type. The interpretation of other physico-chemical parameters of groundwater
    in the study area suggest that they are generally not potable (contaminated) due
    to their excessive EC, Fe2+, TH, PI, Ca2+ and HCO3− values. The total iron concentration
    and salinity levels of all water samples found to be beyond maximum permissible
    limits as prescribed by WHO and CES standards for drinking water. Calcium contents
    in majority of water samples, as well as potassium and bicarbonate contents in
    some water samples, were also found to be above maximum permissible limits as
    prescribed by both standards for drinking water. Based on the pollution index
    (PI) results, the majority (77.3%) of water samples were found to be slightly
    polluted. Water samples from majority of the sites were classified as very hard
    which reveals its unsuitability for drinking purpose. Groundwater in almost all
    locations have been found to contain < 0.6 mg/L of fluoride thus making those
    areas susceptible to dental caries, especially in child. Spatial distribution
    of EC, TH, TDS, PI and major ions display large variations and mostly increased
    in north-western and western part of the study area. The Pearson correlation analysis
    results demonstrate that Mg2+, Ca2+, Br−, Na+, Cl−, HCO3−, and SO42− are strongly
    correlated with TH, EC, and TDS, which indicate that these ions are the most effective
    in the mineralization and salinization of the groundwater in the study area. PCA
    analysis established that water chemistry parameters under PC1 and PC2 (viz.,
    48.4 and 12.6% of entire variance) having strong loading was largely considered
    to control the groundwater chemistry in the study area. According to Gibbs (1970)
    plot, all groundwater samples fall in rock dominance zone demonstrating that the
    decomposition of rock plays an important role in controlling the overall chemistry
    of groundwater. Regarding the classification of irrigation water according to
    SAR, %Na, KR, and MH values, all the water samples analysed were found to be suitable
    for irrigation purposes. According to KI and RSB values, all the water samples
    are good and satisfactory for irrigation purposes, respectively. However, analysis
    of the values of ECiw, integrated with SAR (ECiw-SAR values 0 − 3) & ECiw-%Na,
    and HCO3− revealed that most samples are not suitable for irrigation purposes
    which need from slight to moderate degree of restriction on use for irrigation.
    Hence, most groundwater samples have marginal salinity level which requires a
    care in selection of crop and management alternatives to achieve a full yield
    potential. From this study, it is concluded that groundwater in the study district
    is chemically unfit for drinking and irrigation uses, which needs affirmative
    solutions such as continuous (at least once per season) water quality monitoring
    program and a comprehensive hydrochemical study is recommended for future sustainable
    use of groundwater resources not only in the study district, but in the whole
    area of Ethiopia. References Amiri V, Sohrabi N, Dadgar MA (2015) Evaluation of

  description: China's rapid population growth has inevitably led to a need for cropland
    expansion to meet food security challenges. In arid regions such an expansion
    is restricted by limited water resources, and an increase in productivity per
    cropland area must be achieved while still limiting water use. However, the response
    of agroecosystem Water Use Efficiency (WUEa.e.) to alterations in cropland use
    in Northwest China's Hexi Corridor has not been documented in any great detail.
    This has limited our understanding of the region's water-carbon interactions and,
    in particular, how effective cropland management and efficient water utilization
    protocols might be applied there. The response of the region's WUEa.e. to different
    potential shifts in cropland was evaluated by drawing on growing season (2003–2020),
    Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and actual evapotranspiration (ETcact) data.
    Over this period net cropland area increased, with 12.3 % of total cropland transferred
    in, but only 2.5 % of cropland transferred out. The trend in growing season WUEa.e.
    was greatest in cropland regions transferred in (p < 0.05), and lowest in the
    cropland transferred out, indicating irrigation and field management in cropland
    could ensure that WUEa.e. could be maintained at a higher level. Among the different
    cropland transformation types, the impact of cropland change on WUEa.e. was essentially
    determined by shifting correlations between GPP and ETcact. This correlation was
    weakened when the water supply increased, heightening the negative impact of ETcact
    on WUEa.e., while weakening the positive impact of GPP on WUEa.e.. There was a
    tradeoff point for the level of irrigation between improving WUEa.e. and crop
    yield. Suitable water-saving irrigation is crucial to maintaining a relatively
    high level of WUEa.e., yet not decreasing crop yield. Water-saving irrigation
    in the Shiyang River basin was deemed to have limited potential, whereas in the
    Shule River and Heihe River basins there remains some potential for such irrigation.
    The present study's results can potentially inform agricultural water and land
    management in the region, and provide the basis for efficient water resources
    utilization.

    ProductivityActual EvapotranspirationHexi Corridor 1. Introduction Global climate
    change and rapid population growth have exposed human society to a serious food
    supply challenge (Feng et al., 2019, Tong et al., 2016). To cope with food insecurity
    issues, there is greater pressure to increase cropland productivity and expand
    cropland area to fulfill growing food demands (Ai et al., 2020). From 2003–2019,
    global cropland area increased by 9.0 % (Potapov et al., 2022), while in China
    it increased by 2.5 % from 2001 to 2015 (Lan et al., 2021). These expansions have
    been limited by a dearth of water resources available under current agricultural
    practices (Yu et al., 2020), as well as urbanization and industrialization (Zhao
    et al., 2019). Therefore, productivity per unit cropland area must be enhanced,
    and with as little additional water inputs as possible. Defined as the ratio of
    gross primary production (GPP) to actual evapotranspiration ( ) at the ecosystem
    scale (Himanshu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2022a), water use efficiency (WUE)
    is a critical parameter in evaluating crop production and water resource consumption
    (Kumar Jha et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2018). However, the response of agroecosystem
    Water Use Efficiency ( ) to agricultural land use changes has been only sparsely
    documented to date, limiting our understanding of water-carbon interactions and
    the application of effective cropland management and efficient water resource
    utilization in agricultural areas under the current period of climate change.
    Field observations, satellite remote sensing and multi process-based models have
    allowed the investigation of WUE at different scales and in different ecosystems
    (Brümmer et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2019a, Zhu et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2015).
    At the field/site scale, investigators have employed eddy covariance (EC) observations
    to investigate the relationship between WUE and crop stomatal conductance and
    leaf water potential (Jarvis and McNaughton, 1986, Montaldo and Oren, 2016). Such
    experiments have allowed for the identification of: (i) the particular environmental
    factors controlling variations in WUE in different ecosystems (Wu et al., 2019,
    Xiao et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2015), as well as (ii) the responses of to different
    irrigation methods and scheduling (Kumar Jha et al., 2019, Mpanga and Idowu, 2021),
    drought (Bai et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2019a), and levels of soil moisture (Liu
    et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2018). At regional scales, researchers have used multi-process
    models and the forcing of remote-sensing-based data [e.g., Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS)] to:
    (i) investigate temporal and spatial variations in WUE (Sun et al., 2018, Sun
    et al., 2016, Zou et al., 2020); (ii) assess the contribution of climate change
    and human activities to variations in WUE (Guo et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020,
    Yang et al., 2022a); (iii) evaluate regional responses of WUE to land surface
    changes (Cai et al., 2015, Cao et al., 2020, Zheng et al., 2019), climate change
    (Hao et al., 2019, Hou et al., 2022), and variations in the water-energy balance
    (Fang et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2019a, Zhao et al., 2021), and (iv) forecast WUE
    under future climate change scenarios (Ma et al., 2019b, Zhu et al., 2011). There
    are numerous studies on the mechanisms involved in WUE’s temporal and spatial
    variation, driving forces and attribution in different land covers or ecosystems;
    however, the impact of Land Use/Cover Change (LUCC) on variation in WUE has seldom
    been identified, especially in the context of cropland change. Cropland change
    is a type of LUCC directly related to irrigation and agricultural management (Hu
    et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021). By investigating the variation in for global
    croplands from 2000 to 2014 using MODIS data, but not considering cropland changes,
    Ai et al. (2020) found the in irrigated croplands to be lower than that of rain-fed
    croplands. Liu et al. (2021) found that agricultural productivity and water resource
    consumption increased with cropland expansion in Asia from 2001 to 2018 compared
    to the original ecosystems. Studying the response of to cropland change is crucial
    for irrigation water management and associated agricultural practices, especially
    in water limited regions. With a climate controlled by the prevailing westerly
    winds and monsoon, China’s Hexi Corridor is a typical arid region, consisting
    of a string of human made agricultural oases (Yang et al., 2020). In this region
    annual precipitation is below 200 mm yr−1 and cropland irrigation relies heavily
    on streamflow from the northern portion of the Qilian Mountains (Feng et al.,
    2019). While sufficient light, heat and land resources allow this area to be an
    important grain production region (Wang et al., 2021), threats imposed upon the
    region’s water resources by current changes in climate, have led to drought issues,
    thereby restricting grain production and economic development (Niu et al., 2018).
    The region’s agroecosystems are very fragile, limiting crop productivity and sustainable
    development. In analyzing the response of to agricultural water management in
    a constantly cropped area of the Hexi Corridor’s Shiyang River basin (Tian et
    al., 2020), the changes in cropland and the response of were not considered. Given
    its significant potential for carbon sequestration in an arid region, this agroecosystem
    is one of the world’s key terrestrial ecosystems (Zhou et al., 2021). Improving
    the carbon sequestration capacity of arid agricultural ecosystems under the conditions
    of water shortages, and understanding the influence of cropland changes on water-carbon
    interactions and its underlying mechanisms, are crucial to increasing ecosystem
    water-use efficiency and developing a rational artificial regulation of the structure
    and functions of arid agroecosystems. To solve these issues and achieve more appropriate
    policy decisions for agricultural water and land management in the Hexi Corridor
    under climate change, further investigations into and its response to cropland
    change are called for. Therefore, the objectives in this study were to: i. investigate
    the cropland changes in the Hexi Corridor by using multi land use datasets and
    remote sensing images; ii. evaluate spatiotemporal variation of and its response
    to different types of cropland changes by employing GPP and drawn from GLASS datasets;
    and iii. explore the impact of GPP, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    (NDVI) on , and discuss the potential application of conclusions to agricultural
    water and land resources management for sustainable development. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area Located in northwest China (lat. 37°17′−42°48′ N,
    long. 93°23′−104°12′ E), the Hexi Corridor consists of a string of human-made
    agricultural oases situated along a narrow passage between the northeast edge
    of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and the Badain Jaran and Tengger deserts (Fig.
    1). The Hexi Corridor is an important grain production region in China, given
    the availability of light, heat and land resources, and is a typical arid region
    with precipitation below 200 mm yr−1 and potential evaporation above 2000 mm yr−1.
    These processes are alternately controlled by the prevailing westerly winds and
    China’s southeast monsoon (Yang et al., 2020). The oases of the Hexi Corridor
    are fed by runoff arising from ice and snow melt in the Qilian Mountains (Feng
    et al., 2019). The oases occupy 10 % of the Hexi Corridor, support 85 % of the
    region’s population and contribute to more than 90 % of the region’s Gross Domestic
    Product (GDP) (Feng et al., 2015). Due to the mismatch between the large water
    demand and limited supply, groundwater has been extracted to supplement water
    resources and irrigate croplands. Over-exploitation of groundwater has led to
    a drawdown of the water table and the destruction of the region’s ecohydrological
    system, resulting in serious ecological degradation in the Hexi Corridor oases
    (Feng et al., 2015). Studying cropland changes and their consequences to is therefore
    crucial to regulation of the structure and functions in this arid agroecosystem
    and in developing more appropriate policies for agricultural water and land management
    in the Hexi Corridor under climate change. Download : Download high-res image

    and subregions and the distribution of cropland in 2000. The base map is drawn
    using a remote sensing image from MODIS. 2.2. Data collection Due to the patchy
    distribution of cropland in the Hexi Corridor, it is necessary to use high spatial
    resolution data to capture the responses of NDVI, GPP, and relative to cropland
    change. The spatial resolution of most datasets in large scale studies is relatively
    low at 0.05° (around 5 km), which is not suitable for a cropland change response
    study. We searched for datasets that covered the period 2000–2020 with the highest
    spatial resolution possible and we found that the NDVI, , and GPP datasets were
    all higher than or equal to 1 km. Land use datasets at 5-year intervals from 2000
    to 2020 at a spatial resolution of 1 km were drawn from the Resource and Environmental
    Sciences and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (RESDC) (https://www.resdc.cn).
    These datasets, based on Landsat images and generated by human visual interpretation,
    served to investigate the change in cropland use from 2000 to 2020. Twenty-five
    land use categories, with classification accuracies exceeding 90 % were distinguished
    (Li et al., 2022). Land use types in the Hexi Corridor were simplified into eight
    major categories: Woodland, Cropland, Water, High cover grassland (coverage above
    50 %), Medium cover grassland (coverage between 20 % and 50 %), Low cover grassland
    (coverage between 5 % and 20 %), Built up and Unused land. The 2000–2020 NDVI
    datasets were drawn from the MOD13A2 V6 product using the Google Earth Engine
    (GEE). This dataset is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
    (NOAA-AVHRR) and derived NDVI at a spatial resolution of 1 km and a time span
    of 16 days. We extracted the growing season NDVI by averaging semi-monthly NDVI
    values from April to October. The datasets (2003 to present) were collected from
    the product of Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), at a spatial
    resolution of 1 km (https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/). The SSEBop products were
    based on the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) model with a new parameterization
    for operational application (Senay et al., 2013). The SSEBop model calculated
    using MODIS and Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data and predefined boundary
    conditions that are unique to each pixel for the “hot” and “cold” reference conditions.
    The SSEBop model has been shown to be a reliable and robust method for large scale
    estimation (Li and He, 2020, Xu et al., 2019b). Compared to eddy covariance data,
    the SSEBop data can explain 86 % of observed variability in the contiguous United
    States, and performs best for cropland (Chen et al., 2016). Given its high spatial
    resolution, this dataset was selected for use in this study. The growing season
    was calculated by summing the monthly data from April to October. The 2000–2020 GPP
    data were drawn from Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products at a spatial
    resolution of 500 m (http://www.glass.umd.edu/). Originating from the EC-LUE model
    (Eddy Covariance - Light Use Efficiency), the algorithm generating these data
    integrated the impacts of atmospheric CO2 concentration, radiation components
    and atmospheric water vapor pressure (Yuan et al., 2010). This dataset’s strong
    performance has been validated widely throughout North America, Europe and East
    Asia, indicating that it could accurately reproduce spatial and temporal variability
    across various ecosystems (Yang et al., 2022a, Yuan et al., 2019). We extracted
    the growing season GPP data by summing the monthly GPP data from April to October.
    Considering the temporal resolutions of the different dataset sources, we selected
    2003–2020 NDVI, and GPP data, and interpolated data to a resolution of 1 km using
    the nearest neighbor resampling method (Hatami and Nazemi, 2022). 2.3. Statistical
    methods Correlation analysis and trend detection methods widely used in the fields
    of hydrology and ecology were the main statistical methods employed. Pearson’s
    correlation coefficient (−1.0 ≤ r ≤ 1.0) served to detect the correlation between
    two variables, where r > 0 indicates a positive correlation exists between the
    two variables, while r < 0 indicates an inverse relationship (Li et al., 2022).
    The Sen’s slope method was adopted to investigate the temporal variation of NDVI,
    GPP, and in this study (Yang et al., 2017). A 2-tailed hypothesis with p ≤ 0.05
    indicated a significant test for Pearson’s correlation and Sen’s slope methods.
    More details regarding these two methods were provided by Sen (1968), Yang et
    al. (2017), and Hou et al. (2022). 2.4. Attribution of WUEa.e. variation For cropland,

    in agricultural land use The distribution of land use/cover types in the Hexi
    Corridor at 5 year intervals from 2000 to 2020 are illustrated in Fig. 2(a-e).
    In 2000, the two major land use types were Unused land (sandy land and bare land)
    and Low-cover grasslands, accounting for 67.0 % and 14.3 % of the Hexi Corridor’s
    total expanse, respectively. This indicated an arid and fragile environment. Cropland
    was mainly distributed in the oases situated at elevations below 2400 m. In 2000,
    cropland occupied 6.1 % of the total expanse of the Hexi Corridor, whereas in
    2020 this proportion had risen to 7.0 %. About 90.0 % of croplands were irrigated
    either from streamflow arising in the Qilian Mountains or local ground water.
    The remaining 10.0 % of cropland was rain-fed and was largely distributed in the
    foothills of Qilian Mountains in the Shiyang River basin. Woodlands and High-
    and Medium-cover grasslands were mainly distributed in the Qilian Mountains, and
    a small proportion serving as farm shelterbelts were distributed along ridges
    adjoining croplands. Over the past 20 years, the areas of Cropland, Water and
    Built-up land increased by 14.3 %, 23.1 %, and 57.6 %, respectively. The other
    five land use/cover types remained within ± 2.0 %, with the expanse of Woodlands,
    Low-cover grasslands and Unused lands decreasing, while High- and Medium-cover
    grasslands increased. Download : Download high-res image (360KB) Download : Download

    to 2020 at 5-year intervals (a - e), as well as the distribution of cropland changes
    from 2000 to 2020 (f). The net changes in cropland represented the combination
    of cropland transferred in and out. The distribution of cropland transformations
    within the Hexi Corridor during 2000–2020 are illustrated in Fig. 2f. It should
    be noted that there were about 150 km² of cropland which went through several
    rounds of changes (first transferred out then transferred in, and vice versa)
    between 2000 and 2020. In order to avoid unnecessary error, we removed these croplands
    and only counted the cropland with consistent change during 2000–2020. An area
    of 12,387 km² of cropland remained constant ( ), representing roughly 90.0 % of
    total cropland in the Hexi Corridor (Table 1). The area of cropland that shifted
    to other land uses was only 326 km², accounting for roughly 2.5 % of total cropland
    in 2000. These mainly shifted ‘out’ ( ) to Low-cover grassland and Unused land,
    especially when the Grains for Green Project was implemented. Over the same period,
    some 1588 km² of land, mostly from Low-cover grasslands and Unused lands, were
    shifted into cropland ( , i.e., transferred in), accounting for 12.3 % of total
    cropland in 2000. The greater portion of cropland transformations, both in and
    out, occurred on the edges of oases, whereas little cropland within the oases
    shifted to other land uses, largely due to infrastructure and efforts to produce
    artificial green lands. Table 1. Areas of different cropland transformation types

    patterns differed significantly across the Hexi Corridor’s three river basins
    (Fig. 3). Over the 20 years, the area of cropland in all three river basins increased,
    i.e., the area of was larger than that of . Among the three river basins, the
    net increase in cropland area in the Shule River basin was 406 km², accounting
    for 25.4 % of total cropland in the basin in 2020, and least in the Shiyang River
    basin with 221 km², only accounting for 3.5 % of total cropland in its basin.
    The largest net increase in cropland occurred in the Heihe River basin with a
    net transferred area of 635 km² from 2000 to 2020, which accounted for 11.0 %
    of total cropland in Heihe River basin in 2020. Download : Download high-res image

    GPP to cropland change Cropland transformations lead to shifts in vegetation,
    irrigation and management, which result in changes in NDVI, and GPP. The distributions
    of mean growing season NDVI, and GPP in the Hexi Corridor present a spatial heterogeneity
    of cropland transformations in the different river basins (Fig. 4). The range
    of the mean growing season NDVI in the Hexi Corridor’s cropland areas varied between
    0 and 0.64, with high values mainly occurring in areas. The mean growing season
    NDVI for areas in the Shule, Heihe and Shiyang River basins were 0.30 ± 0.09,
    0.34 ± 0.09 and 0.32 ± 0.09, while for they were 0.23 ± 0.08, 0.25 ± 0.10, and
    0.24 ± 0.09, respectively. For all three river basins, the mean growing season
    NDVI for and areas were less than that in areas, and the mean NDVI in areas was
    smaller than that for  areas. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    the standard deviation of the corresponding parameters calculated for the specified
    region. The mean overall growing season varied from 50 to 747 mm, exhibiting significant
    spatial heterogeneity in the cropland areas of the Hexi Corridor, during 2003–2020
    (Fig. 4b). The mean overall growing season in the areas of the Shule, Heihe and
    Shiyang River basins were 398.68 ± 167.93 mm, 395.72 ± 160.32 mm and 375.47 ± 149.34 mm,
    whereas for  areas they were 265.49 ± 158.96 mm, 273.01 ± 165.95 mm, and 284.56 ± 132.96 mm,
    and for  were 355.15 ± 192.36 mm, 372.54 ± 153.25 mm, and 267.01 ± 129.40 mm,
    respectively. Similar to NDVI, and for all three river basins, the growing season
    in regions was higher than that in or areas. Moreover, the growing season for
    areas was larger than that for areas, except for the Shiyang River basin. Between
    2003 and 2020, the mean overall growing season GPP varied from 0 to 900 g C m−2
    in the Hexi Corridor croplands, with a spatial heterogeneity similar to that of
    NDVI (Fig. 4c). The growing season GPP for the areas in the Shule, Heihe and Shiyang
    River basins were 306.92 ± 120.42, 481.08 ± 179.99 and 439.46 ± 175.73 g C m−2,
    while for areas they were 208.96 ± 116.65, 296.9 ± 185.41 and 259.72 ± 180.58 g C m−2,
    and for areas: 231.36 ± 143.78, 435.08 ± 159.40, and 439.92 ± 200.35 g C m−2,
    respectively. Among the three cropland transformation types and for all the three
    river basins, the growing season GPP was lowest for areas and highest in the areas.
    From the time series of mean growing season NDVI, and GPP for the three river
    basins in 2003 and 2020 (Fig. 5), we can see the mean NDVI and GPP increased significantly
    across the three types of cropland areas in all basins, except for the in Shiyang
    River basin with an insignificant increasing trend in GPP and a decreasing trend
    in NDVI and GPP for the in Heihe River basin (Table 2). The upward trends in mean
    NDVI and GPP in the areas were significantly greater than those in  areas for
    all three river basins. This may reflect different irrigation and field management
    approaches applied to areas of cropland being transferred in and out of the three
    river basins. Compared with areas, the areas would require additional irrigation
    and field management. This would then lead to an increase in NDVI and GPP in the
    three basins. Download : Download high-res image (786KB) Download : Download full-size

    areas in the three river basins was significantly different, reflecting the different
    water resources management protocols and implementation of water-saving irrigation
    in the basins. At 1.11 mm yr−1, and 0.29 mm yr−1, respectively, the changes in
    growing season for the areas in the Shule and Heihe River basins were not significant,
    whereas in the Shiyang River basin a declining trend (−2.38 mm yr−1) was found
    (Table 2). Growing season in the three river basins showed significant (p ≤ 0.05)
    upward trends of 6.01, 7.69 and 3.13 mm yr−1 for the Shule, Heihe and Shiyang
    River basins, respectively. Comparatively, for the  areas, the rates of change
    in growing season were lower than those in areas for all three river basins, and
    even negative in the areas of Heihe River basin. 3.3. Response of to cropland
    change Variations in NDVI, and GPP due to cropland transformation, led to changes
    in . Fig. 6 shows the response of mean growing season to cropland transformations
    in the Hexi Corridor. In the three river basins, was highest in the areas (vs.
    and areas), except in the Shule River basin, with values of 0.86 ± 0.64, 1.68 ± 1.59
    and 2.14 ± 1.35 g C/kg H2O for the Shule, Heihe and Shiyang River basins, respectively.
    The areas showed the smallest among the three cropland transformation types, except
    in the Shule River basin, where it was the highest: 1.06 ± 1.45, 1.46 ± 1.40 and
    1.21 ± 1.44 g C/kg H2O for the Shule, Heihe and Shiyang River basins, respectively.
    Across all three cropland transformation types, the in Shule River basin was the
    lowest among the basins (Fig. 6). Under the different cropland transformations,
    the variation trends in for the areas were generally smaller than those of or
    areas, especially in Shule River basin (Fig. 7, Table 2). For all basins, the
    annual variation in growing season was largest in the areas with significantly
    increasing trends of 2.78×10−2, 2.48×10−2, and 2.14×10−2 g C kg−1 H2O yr−1 in
    the Shule, Heihe and Shiyang River basins, respectively. The trends of growing
    season in the areas were larger than those in the areas for all basins. This indicates
    that irrigation and field management could ensure that the in areas could be maintained
    at a stable level, thereby reducing the risk of a reduction in grain yield due
    to adverse impacts, such as drought. Download : Download high-res image (202KB)

    GPP,  and A change in cropland type means changes in land cover (e.g., vegetation
    type), soil properties (e.g., soil fertility) and human activities (e.g., irrigation
    and field management), all of which can potentially have an impact on . In an
    arid region such as the Hexi Corridor, a shortage of water is the primary, but
    not only, limitation to vegetative growth. Although irrigation was applied to  areas,
    the growing season NDVI and GPP both decreased compared to areas (Fig. 8). This
    finding is consistent with Liu et al. (2021), who reported that globally, newly
    expanded croplands led to decrease in net primary productivity (NPP) and , with
    respect to the original agroecosystems. Two things may explain this: (i) The spatial
    resolution was not sufficiently small; for example, a pixel assigned the category
    ‘cropland’ may be thus identified because the largest proportion of land within
    the pixel falls in the ‘cropland’ category, although other land use types are
    present at significant levels; or the value of a pixel’s land use variable may
    represent an average of the different land use types within the pixel (Ai et al.,
    2020), (ii) Water-saving irrigation was preferentially adopted in the areas, while
    conventional irrigation was the main form of irrigation in the areas. can, to
    some extent, reflect the water supply and we observed that the was lower in the
    areas compared to areas. Unlike or areas, areas seldom received irrigation, and
    vegetation often shifted into natural vegetation or buildings were constructed
    on the land. Therefore, the NDVI, GPP and were lower in areas compared to areas.

    areas of cropland transferred in or out, with respect to areas of constant cropland
    in the three river basins of the Hexi Corridor. Compared to the areas, the means
    of growing season NDVI, GPP and were all lower in both and areas, particularly
    in areas (Fig. 8). The was also generally lower except for the slight increase
    in the areas of the Shule River basin and an obvious increase in the areas of
    Shiyang River. However, from Fig. 9, one can see that, with the exception of the
    Shiyang River basin, the correlations of with NDVI and GPP were significantly
    greater in than areas. This indicated that the variation in GPP in areas was less
    sensitive to . This further suggested that water resources were not the only factor
    having an impact on the variation of GPP in the  areas. Plants would be able to
    adapt their water use strategies during periods of water insufficiency by improving
    their or having fewer non-productive water losses through evaporation (Groh et
    al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2015). For the three river basins, in areas under sufficient
    irrigation, the significant correlations of with GPP were equivalent to or lower
    than those in areas; therefore, it can be inferred that the sensitivity of GPP
    to would decrease along with an increase in water supply. Since is made up of
    transpiration (T) from vegetation and evaporation (E) from soil, T is directly
    connected with the productivity of vegetation (Wang et al., 2021). Theoretically,
    if all water loss occurred through transpiration ( = T), a strong correlation
    between GPP and would be expected. As water supply increased, the proportion of
    T to would be decreased (Liu et al., 2022, Tian et al., 2013), and accordingly
    the sensitivity of GPP to would be weakened. Download : Download high-res image

    and * represents the correlations are significant at p ≤ 0.05. For the three different
    cropland transformation types, the impact of cropland change on was the result
    of GPP and , i.e., it was essentially determined by the different relationships
    between GPP and under different water supplies. Therefore, the impacts of cropland
    change on in the three river basins were slightly different due to the location
    of areas of change in cropland as well as different irrigation and field management
    practices, resulting in different relationships between GPP and (Fig. 10). Generally,
    for the Hexi Corridor, an increase in water supply caused the correlation between
    GPP and to weaken, the negative impact of on to strengthen, and the positive impact

    transformation types in the Hexi Corridor. 4.2. Contribution of and GPP to variation
    in Although, there were different sensitivities of to GPP and under different
    cropland transformation types, the contribution of GPP and to was the synthetical
    result of their sensitivity to as well as their magnitudes of variation (Wang
    et al., 2020). The contribution of GPP to the variation in for the three cropland
    transformation types in the three river basins (Fig. 10), varied from − 56–90
    %, while the contribution of to variation varied from − 47–42 %. The absolute
    contributions of GPP were larger than that of ETc act, indicating that the GPP
    dominated the variation of in the Hexi Corridor’s croplands. The positive contribution
    of GPP to variation in areas within the Heihe River basin’s  areas was attributable
    to a positive correlation between GPP and under a decreasing GPP variation. In
    contrast, the positive contribution of to variation in areas of the Shiyang River
    basin and in  areas of the Heihe River basin, was the result of decreasing combined
    with a negative correlation between and (Fig. 9). Yang et al. (2022a) analyzed
    the contribution of GPP and to variations in in croplands in northwest China by
    using an attribution method, and confirmed the dominant role of GPP in terms of
    its impact on the variation of cropland . 4.3. Applications to agricultural water
    and land management Farmers or local agricultural managers tend to irrigate more
    during the growing season in order to improve both the and crop yield. However,
    there exists a tradeoff between improvements in and crop yield with irrigation.
    Qiu et al. (2008) found that significantly increased when the frequency and depth
    of irrigation water increased within a growing season, such that the generally
    decreased and grain yield did not increase. Therefore, deficit irrigation is most
    appropriate for the areas where precipitation during the growing season is less
    than 200 mm (Yu et al., 2020), and a suitable irrigation regime is more likely
    to achieve relatively greater levels of and crop yield (Li and Wang, 2021). For
    example, in order to achieve sustainable regional water resources development,
    irrigation and water-conserving cropland management were implemented in the Hexi
    corridor (Tian et al., 2020). According to data from Gansu Province’s Report of
    Water Resources Bulletin (HBGP, 2020), the irrigation quota presented a decreasing
    trend over the last 20 years, while the CWP (crop water productivity, defined
    as the ratio of crop yield to irrigation water) increased in all three river basins
    (Fig. 11). It is consistent in our findings that the increased in the three cropland
    transformation types in the three river basins from 2003 to 2020 (Fig. 6, Fig.
    9). However, the crop yield did not always increase along with the increasing
    CWP. From the correlation between CWP and crop yield in the three river basins
    of Hexi Corridor (Fig. 12), we can see that crop yield increased with increasing
    CWP in the Shule and Heihe River basins, while the crop yield first increased
    then decreased with increasing CWP in the Shiyang River basin. This indicated
    there was a threshold level of water conserving irrigation, above which crop yield
    would be decreased. Therefore, comparison between conventional irrigation, a suitable
    water-saving irrigation or deficit irrigation is crucial for maintaining a relatively
    high CWP, without reducing crop yield (Liu and Song, 2022). Thus, we can conclude
    that the water-saving irrigation in the Shiyang River basin was excessive, and
    more water should be supplied to maintain a CWP around 0.8 kg/m³ , whereas in
    the Shule and Heihe River basins, there remained water-saving irrigation potential
    to improve the CWP. Future studies should focus on the determination of suitable
    irrigation levels for different crops under different field management practices.

    productivity and water use, is defined as the ratio of GPP to at the agroecosystem
    scale. Studying the response of to agricultural land use change could facilitate
    the understanding of water-carbon interactions and the application of effective
    cropland management and efficient water use protocols in agricultural areas, under
    current climate change. In the present study, we investigated different transformations
    of cropland, and evaluated response to these changes from 2003–2020 by studying
    GPP and datasets for the three river basins of the Hexi Corridor. The cropland
    in the Hexi Corridor increased overall, with 2.5 % of cropland transferred out
    and 12.3 % of total cropland transferred in between 2003 and 2020. The growing
    season showed its highest variation in the areas of cropland transferred in, with
    significant increasing trends of 2.78×10−2, 2.48×10−2 and 2.14×10−2 g C kg−1 H2O
    yr−1, while variation for areas was the lowest with values of 0.55×10−2, 0.16×10−2
    and 1.10×10−2 g C kg−1 H2O yr−1 for the Shule, Heihe and Shiyang River basins,
    respectively. For all three river basins, showed increasing trends under all three
    cropland transformation types. The absolute contributions of GPP to were larger
    than that of , indicating the dominance of GPP in controlling the variation of
    in the Hexi Corridor’s croplands. The impact of cropland change on was determined
    by the different correlations between GPP and among the cropland transformation
    types. With an increase in water supply, the correlation between GPP and was weakened,
    the negative impact of on was strengthened, and the positive impact of GPP on
    was weakened. There was a tradeoff between improving and crop yield with irrigation.
    Suitable water-saving irrigation is crucial for maintaining a high without reducing
    crop yield. The water-saving irrigation in Shiyang River was excessive, whereas
    there was still potential for water-saving irrigation in the Shule and Heihe River
    basins. The results of this study can be potentially applied in agricultural water
    and land management and efficient water resource utilization for sustainable development
    in arid regions. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they

  description: Farming is regarded as a major industry in India, accounting for 17%
    of the country's GDP growth. Agriculture employs 60% of the population hence it
    is considered an important sector in India. The important factors for agriculture
    are pest management, disease prevention, irrigation management, soil mineral composition,
    crop management, location, and the season in which the crop is grown. Hence all
    this information along with the techniques are well known only by the experienced
    farmers. Hence it is important to create an agro knowledge management system.
    As a result, this work makes an attempt to develop a multiple ontology-based agro
    knowledge management system. The designed system consists of agriculture information
    related to attributes of soil mineral, moisture, season, location, crop type,
    and temperature. It consists of multiple ontologies such as soil ontology, crop
    ontology, location ontology, and crop season ontology to provide agronomy knowledge.
    Soil ontology is premeditated to classify the soil type in a hierarchical order
    while crop ontology classifies the crop type, location ontology classifies locations
    suitable for different crop types and finally, crop season ontology classifies
    the season that is suitable for different crops. A rule base is built to develop
    the knowledge base and to validate the truthfulness of the knowledge base. Visualization
    of a knowledge base is carried out for better understanding and decision-making.

  description: '【Objective】Water is one of the important factors that restrict agricultural
    production. The grape producing area in the eastern foot of Helan Mountain in
    Ningxia is located in the inland of northwest China, which belongs to temperate
    continental climate. The annual rainfall is small and the climate is dry. Relying
    on the Yellow River water for irrigation, however, there is excessive irrigation
    and unreasonable utilization, resulting in serious waste of water resources, which
    restricts the healthy and sustainable development of grape industry. Therefore,
    advocating scientific and efficient use of water resources is an important measure
    for agricultural sustainable development. In order to explore the effects of different
    water stress on the metabolism of aroma compounds synthesis during the berry development
    of Marselan grape, the present experiment was undertaken to obtain the technical
    measures of water management for improvement of the fruit quality of Marselan
    grape, and optimize the irrigation conditions suitable for arid and semi-arid
    areas as well as lay a theoretical foundation for the optimization of the cultivation
    and management of Marselan grape.【Methods】Taking 5-year-old Marselan grapevines
    as the test materials, three water treatments were set according to the water
    potential of leaves before dawn: no stress (control), light water stress (T1)
    and moderate stress (T2), and the vines were kept within the target range by controlling
    the irrigation amount. Extraction of free aroma: 15 g of crushed fruit samples
    was added into a centrifuge tube, and 1 g of cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone
    (PVPP) and 0.5 g of D-gluconolactone were added. The centrifuge tube was placed
    in a 4 °C refrigerator for 120 min. Then it was centrifuged at 10 000 r·min-1
    for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain clear grape juice. Headspace solid-phase microextraction
    (HS-SPME): Take 5 mL of grape juice into a 15 mL headspace bottle, add 1 g of
    sodium chloride, 5 μL of internal standard 2-octanol and a magnetic rotor, then
    quickly tighten the bottle cap, the extraction head was inserted into the sample
    headspace vial and placed on a magnetic stirrer for adsorption at 60 °C for 40
    min. After adsorption, the extraction head was taken out and inserted into the
    gas chromatography injection port, and decomposed at 250 °C for 5 min. Gas chromatography
    separation conditions: Column: HP-INNO-Wax capillary column (length 30 m, inner
    diameter 0.25 mm, liquid film thickness 0.25 μm), carrier gas He (99.99%), flow
    rate 1.0 mL·min-1; Inlet temperature: 250 °C, desorption for 5 min; programmed
    temperature was 50 °C for 1 min, and then increased to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C·min-1
    and held for 5 min; mass spectrometry interface temperature was 280 °C, ion source
    temperature was 230 °C, ionization method was EI, the ionization energy was 70
    eV, and the scanning range was 30-350 amu. Qualitative analysis and quantitative
    analysis: using the total ion current spectrum in the full ion scanning mode of
    mass spectrometry, the collected total ion map current was searched and data were
    analyzed with NIST08 and RTLPEST3 spectral libraries, combined with the retention
    index (Retention Index, RI) and references of identify volatile aroma components.
    The internal standard method was used for relative quantification, and 2-octanol
    was used as the internal standard to determine the relative content. The calculation
    formula was: relative content of aroma components (μg·L-1) = [peak area of each
    component/internal standard peak area × internal standard mass (μg)]/sample mass
    (kg). Grape fruit (without seeds) RNA was extracted with RNA Extraction Kit (spin
    column type). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using TranScript kit.
    Fluorescence quantitative PCR was performed with Actin as the internal reference
    gene, and the specific sequences of VvGPPS, VvHPLA and VvCCD1 were searched in
    GeneBank, and primers were designed and synthesized by Shanghai Sheng Gong. Relative
    quantification was performed using the 2-ΔΔCt method.【Results】41, 45 and 36 volatile
    organic compounds were detected in the control, light stress and moderate stress,
    respectively, during the ripening stage of Marselan grape. The number of compound
    species was significantly less than that of light stress treatment. It can be
    seen that light water stress can significantly increase the types of volatile
    compounds in berries, which increased by 9.7% and 25.0% compared with the control
    and moderate stress, respectively. Under moderate stress, the types of volatile
    compounds in the berry decreased by 13.8% compared with the control. A total of
    12 aldehydes and 12 alcohols were detected, and their contents increased with
    the development of Marselan grape berry. 120 days after flowering, the content
    of n-hexanol in berries treated with T1 was 54.7% and 60.9% higher than that with
    control and T2, respectively. Nine esters were detected, among which ethyl caprate,
    dibutyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate and propyl heptyl lactone were the main ester
    volatile substances in Marselan grape berry. Twelve kinds of volatile acids were
    detected, among which nonanoic acid had unpleasant pungent odor, and its content
    increased with berry development, indicating that water stress would aggravate
    the inferior aroma brought by nonanoic acid. At maturity, the expression of VvGPPS
    with control was higher than that of T1 and T2, which indicated that water stress
    would reduce the expression of this gene. The expression of VvHPLA decreased with
    the development of Marselan grape berry. The expression of VvCCD1 showed a downward
    trend, but the expression of VvCCD1 in T2-treated grape fruit was always higher
    than control. It was observed that the expression of VvCCD1 in T1-treated grape
    berry was significantly higher than control and T2 at 87th day after anthesis,
    which indicated that water stress treatment could effectively improve the expression
    of VvCCD1 in Marselan grape berry.【Conclusion】In conclusion, compared with the
    control, moderate water stress can significantly increase the variety and relative
    content of volatile organic compounds in Marcelan grape berry. Compared with the
    control, water stress is not conducive to the expression of VvGPPS and VvHPLA,
    but beneficial to the expression of VvCCD1.'

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Uttarakhand, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Modem Internet of Things (IoT) technologies allow for remote monitoring and management
    of devices. It can connect live things with technology. Numerous items are altering
    as a result of the Internet of Things. Nowadays, the adaptable concept of IoT
    has changed and is available to a typical customer. A few examples of where the
    IoT has enhanced human lives include automation, smart cities, innovative education,
    and the e-health industry. In addition to providing human comforts, these techniques
    should be used to meet fundamental needs such as food that can be produced from
    agricultural areas [1]. According to the World Bank, if the population increase
    rate remains the same, over half of the world''s largest food must be produced.
    Farming and agriculture are significant components of the GDP in emerging and
    developed countries. As a result, the present agricultural methods must be improved
    and optimized. The blooming of sustainable human, flora, and fauna growth will
    be aided, as well as global crises like climate change and diseases like drought.
    Agribusiness, India''s most significant and required activity adjusts humanity''s
    food demands and offers critical natural components for numerous industries. Creative
    horticultural practices steadily increase crop yields, make them more productive,
    and minimize water system waste [2]. Improved technologies will increase output,
    reducing the risk of hunger and malnutrition. So that it to have a significant
    influence on the lives of billions of people throughout the world, the technology
    must be made widely accessible at a reasonable cost. In terms of freshwater resources,
    agriculture uses 85% of them This ratio will remain the most prevalent globally.
    Population expansion and rising food demand result in a decrease in water use.
    It should develop quickly. A technologically sound approach. Or using his IoT
    for agricultural purposes is necessary. The current situation follows successful
    contributions to theoretical research over the past ten years. As part of a precision
    agriculture strategy, IoT is a recent and ambitious usage of IT solutions in crop
    fields. Contributions to water usage efficiency, including technical factors in
    agriculture and management, for example, there are different cultures rom the
    simple to the technical and altitude used in irrigation techniques to save water.
    While much research and development are being done on innovative home systems,
    agriculture, particularly Smart Agriculture, is lagging behind other fields and
    necessitating a significant amount of R&D to reach long-term goals at both the
    industrial and grass-roots levels. When traditional irrigation is automated, crop
    yields can be multiplied by ten or more. A novel approach to the farm problem
    is presented [3]. It is necessary to construct a wireless sensor network over
    agricultural ground and level with a domestic orchard to analyze all of the fields,
    whether it is irrigated or not. The suggested research gives the best potential
    answer to the agricultural demands, the water requirements grounded on several
    freely available datasets accessible worldwide, and ML methods such as Linear
    Regression and Logistic Regression [4]. These requirements change throughout the
    year, depending on the crops grown and the weather. Irrigation systems must be
    automated at various points in the process and nature. The replenishment of groundwater
    is aided by efficient irrigation, which enables long-term water usage. Using Arduino
    Mega, Arduino Uno, and Raspberry Pi, the researchers demonstrated water need grounded
    on earth morphology and climate patterns [5]. The General IoT-bas ed agricultural
    model is depicted in Figure 1. Fig. 1. General iot-based agricultural model Show
    All Automating irrigation systems may save money and time, and this paper provides
    an easy-to-understand method. Soil temperature, moisture, and fertility are monitored
    and controlled by these chips and their accompanying sensors, transducers, and
    actuators. Literature reviews and experiments using high-quality research papers
    and machine learning algorithms form the basis of the answer offered in this research
    study. Various sensors and microcontrollers used in agriculture and irrigation
    are covered in this research [6]. Technology in agriculture is examined in this
    study. SECTION II. Existing Work Machine learning (ML) is a breakthrough approach
    that enables machines to learn new knowledge, continuously enhance their performance,
    and mature to a specific level. In the last few years, ML has proven helpful for
    computations, hypotheses, and applications when used with other horticulture practices
    to reduce crop expenses and increase production. Machine learning (ML) applications
    can be widely applied on agricultural farms in crop health, disease monitoring,
    crop detection, irrigation management, soil quality, weed sensing, and weather
    forecasting. The freshness of produce can be evaluated using ML after harvest
    (the freshness of the fruits and vegetables), storage stability, quality of products,
    market analysis, etc. [7]. Some of the best feasible technologies and algorithms
    for the creation of an intelligent agricultural management scheme have been recommended
    in [8] after a thorough literature observation and experiments. A microcontroller-oriented
    water management scheme that is highly competent and then affordable when associated
    with added traditional approaches. Deep learning based system in [9] recognizes
    plants and determine the proper watering volume based on the kind of plant. A
    WSN technique for precision farming offered a cloud and edge computing-based solution
    to smart agriculture [10]. Data analytics and machine learning methods are becoming
    increasingly crucial in the agricultural sector to address the growing problems
    caused by climatic and weather fluctuations like temperature, rain, or humidity,
    among many others, seriously harming crop productivity. The precision of data
    analysis must be increased for a strong and rising output [11]. The ability to
    evaluate large amounts of data allows an organization to cope with information
    that may significantly impact its operations. These analytical tools'' algorithms
    and processes have to look for occult correlations and patterns in the data. Multimedia
    field data gathered by placed sensors assist in weed presence or identification,
    fruit quality assessment, and disease detection in branches, leaves, fruit, and
    roots [12]. The irrigation technique automates the design of the water system
    and minimizes water waste for large areas of crops. The device decides how much
    water a crop needs to be based on the behaviour of the temperatures, humidity,
    and soil moisture. The framework employs a technique called machine learning and,
    for further analysis, compares the values picked up by the sensors to a limit.
    The ML algorithm then compares the result obtained to the prediction to decide
    whether or not to start supplying water [13]. All of the obstacles, possibilities,
    and enablers of a comprehensive intelligent farming strategy were explained in
    detail by Bacco in their research. In other words, this article identifies and
    presents a complete picture of possible solutions to farm demands based on a thorough
    review of the existing literature on contemporary agricultural issues [14] and
    the potential solutions. The prototype of the distributed sensor network described
    in this paper was built specifically for this research [15]. Several researches
    used MSVM to determine the real-time sampling of different soil parameters. She
    suggested the four application components: the cloud, real-time data analysis,
    sensor interface, and user interface modules. In fact, based on the soil qualities
    in their area, farmers can use this technology to choose the type of crop to cultivate.
    A standardized dataset contains all of a crop''s minimal requirements. Several
    sensors are added to the region and communicate real-time data to the cloud when
    crop prediction is required. Farmers receive a mail alert with the findings of
    the decision tree algorithm, which aids in deciding on water supply in advance.
    SECTION III. Proposed System The system utilizes the Raspberry pi three and Arduino
    Microcontroller as such microcontrollers for this proposed model because of their
    processing capability, low cost, and wide availability. Various sensors will continually
    monitor the multiple factors, and irrigation tailored to, and particular to the
    particular crop will be carried out. As a first phase, the wireless communication
    field is laid out whereby every sensor is interconnected by a network and transmits
    information to a shared system, whence an operational python code may continuously
    query the data and direct an aware/jump indication through a specific action to
    be performed. The fundamental network architecture depends on the region''s demographics;
    however, this shows the general topology ofvarious sensing nodes. Small enterprises
    with limited resources can use this microcomputer to use their product or create
    new embedded technology. Small company owners can use it to automate any menial
    work, including hosting a website on the Raspberry Pi or using it as a portable
    video server and database. The product performs well, offering small firms an
    ethical substitute, for example. Unlike giant servers, which demand complex cooling
    systems and a lot of energy, this small card-sized item, for example, makes recycling
    simple and lowers the amount of carbon dioxide released into the environment.
    Sensors across the field or garden are the first stage in building an autonomous
    watering system. The sensor resolves as a gateway system connecting all sensor
    nodes. Every Arduino mega unit has an earth humidity detector with advanced network
    capabilities; one Bluetooth component; an MQ2 gas sensor; an alarm clock; a battery;
    and a relay module. Radar sensors can detect large intruders and rats. One python
    code running on a sensor would save the information in the system, after whence
    it may be made available to end users via an application layer on the gateway
    node or base station. The internet isn''t required for data transfer from the
    raspberry pi to the server. Therefore it may be utilized in regions with no or
    limited internet access. The proposed systemarchitecture is shown in Figure 2.
    Fig. 2. Proposed system architecture Show All The basic concepts of transmitter,
    receiver, positive, and ground link various sensors to the microcontroller. Most
    connections must be made similarly, and the sensor gives plenty of transmitter,
    receiver, positive, numeral, and analog jots in addition to a collection. After
    building the network architecture and gathering the data, the first stage of the
    proposed application is accomplished. The preliminaries and initial stages of
    data processing begin with collecting data from various sensors. To transmit the
    following signal to the actuators and warn the client during physical interruption,
    all data collected by the sensors must be examined and processed. It''s a visual
    representation of the system''s flowchart. Raspberry Pi ran python script checks
    for several criteria in the information recorded from other networks and a website.
    As a precautionary measure, the field will be watered when the humidity decreases
    below a predetermined level for a given crop. Using Machine Learning Algorithms,
    the user can identify the soil type and the crop to be watered to automate the
    irrigation system fully. According to a literature study, Support vector classification
    is the best method for soil type classification. The decision tree algorithm,
    a powerful machine learning technique, is applied to field sensing data to anticipate
    outcomes reliably. The decision tree algorithm''s products are sent to farmers
    through email alerts, facilitating anticipatory water supply decision-making.
    As a result, a signal out from the default gateway to the controllers will activate
    the water pump when all parameters have been processed. After a specified amount
    of soil humidity is reached, the irrigation will be halted, and the soil will
    be surveyed for moisture. SECTION IV. Results and Discussion A sensor known as
    the DHT11 (Digital Humidity and Thermometer) is used to determine soil humidity.
    To determine how much water is needed for irrigation, DHT11 provides the RH percentage.
    Typically, the DHT11 RH percent varies from 20 to 90 percent. A machine learning
    system was used to analyze previously gathered humidity data to improve agricultura1
    irrigation efficiency. Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture measurements are
    included in the data sets provided for the decision tree method. These datasets
    include values for numerous field settings so the model can be trained correctly.
    In addition to showing the percentages of soil moisture and humidity, the temperature
    is expressed in Celsius. The humidity level monitoring result is shown in Table
    1. Table I. Humidity level monitoring The training dataset was used to compare
    the performance of Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM Classifiers, Linear Regression,
    Random Forest, and XGBoost models. The prediction model that had the highest accuracy
    was XGBoost. Several rectilinear deteriorations, provision trajectory regression,
    and RF regression were all examined side by side to see which one is the best-predicted
    soil moisture. As a result of food shortages and economic crises, famine has become
    an epidemic in many countries worldwide. The data from the hardware device will
    be analyzed using machine-learning methods and prior studies on agricultural datasets.
    Based on the outcomes of several backend machine learning algorithms, a proposal
    template will be developed in the web application so that the farmer knows what
    to do next. In Figure 3, the humidity observation analysis is depicted. The humidity
    analysis is based on the ML algorithm, as shown below. Fig. 3. Humidity observation
    analysis Show All An automated farm monitoring system has been designed as a long-term
    solution. Organization and measurable forecasts of the earth type, yield type,
    and water requirements may be made using IoT and ML methods like SVM and SVR through
    the Centrifugal base function. The “Agriculture Production in India” data collection
    contains guidance well about the farming sector in various parts of India. The
    value of temperature observed over time is listed in Table 2. Table II. Temperature
    observation Every person, from significant farmers to modest farmers to backyard
    gardeners, might benefit from this innovative agricultural strategy. When many
    devices are linked together, everything runs smoothly and quickly. The accuracy
    of the forecast depends on the setup''s sound installation. Training a machine
    learning algorithm on significant datasets and data particular to a given geographic
    location is necessary. It''s important to remember that even while wild animals
    are dangerous to the hardware, they may be easily spotted and avoided with the
    proper precautions. Random forest regression has the most excellent F score when
    forecasting RH (percent) when contrasted to other methods, according to a comparison
    of their accuracy and precision. For both independent and dependent variables,
    the model''s p-values fall below the statistical significance of 0.05. In Figure
    4, temperature analysis has been depicted. The visualization process necessitates
    the use of a dedicated server or network storage. Crop water needs are not available
    in an organized form How well a model predicts depends on how much data it has
    access to. There are hyper-parameters and kernel types that influence SVR accuracy.
    The decision tree algorithm is then used for the sensed datasets to produce an
    output that contains the choice of whether to water the crop. Its production includes
    the judgment and is emailed to the users or farmers via the simple mail transfer
    protocol. Fig. 4. Temperature analysis Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Brilliant
    cultivating enables us to break down plant growth and gradually impact the borders
    of our framework, enhancing plant development and supporting the rancher in his
    movement. Web of Things (IoT) techniques are blurring the boundaries between the
    digital and physical worlds in light of application-specific sensor information
    estimations and intelligent treatment. This research study presents an ecological
    and computationally intensive Internet of Things-based strategy to automate the
    agriculture business. SVR, or the Random Forrest Regress, makes accurate predictions
    better when a properly dispersed network is in place. To monitor the entire field,
    sensor nodes must be connected. Future development includes developing a transportable
    system that can assist farmers at every stage of the farming process, from planting
    seeds to harvesting crops. Future work in this subject suggests using tools for
    automated predictions using hyperparameter tweaking and ensemble learning. The
    future of automation lies in a mobile, dynamic, and resilient strategy. The process
    of visualization needs the usage of a dedicated server or network storage. Crop
    water requirements need to be well-documented. The quantity of data available
    to a model influence how well it predicts. Hyper-parameters and kernel types influence
    SVR accuracy. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    Prevention Subject Editor: Athanase Badolo  The Comprehensive Africa Agricultural
    Development Programme (CAADP), a continent-wide program developed under the African
    Union, has prioritized improving the reliability of water supplies for agriculture
    (Woodhouse et al. 2017). In order to boost the food security in arid and semi-arid
    areas of several sub-Saharan countries, the national policies have steadily incorporated
    irrigation systems in their agricultural landscapes (Woodhouse et al. 2017, Xie
    et al. 2018, Gowing et al. 2020). Unfortunately, irrigation can enhance habitat
    availability, diversity, and stability for anophelines (Ijumba and Lindsay 2001,
    Mwangangi et al. 2010, Kibret et al. 2017a, Frake et al. 2020, Hawaria et al.
    2020). Such anthropogenic land-use modifications have been reported to increase
    malaria transmission in Africa (Afrane et al. 2004, Chung 2016, Kyei-Baafour et
    al. 2020), India (Lee et al. 2016), and Central America (Grieco et al. 2006).
    In Kenya, where over 80% of the land is classified as arid or semi-arid (Biamah
    2005, Maundu et al. 2009), some of these irrigation systems are known to create
    habitats that are suitable for the breeding of the region’s two primary malaria
    vectors, Anopheles arabiensis Patton and (Anopheles funestus) s.l. Giles (Mukiama
    and Mwangi 1989, Afrane et al. 2004, Mathenge et al. 2005, Mwangangi et al. 2006,
    Muturi et al. 2009, 2013). Unlike (An. gambiae) s.s. Giles, An.arabiensis predominates
    in semi-arid and arid environments of Africa (Lindsay et al. 1998, Gimnig et al.
    2001) and is common in irrigated areas (White 1972). This species is mainly zoophilic
    and exophilic and can sustain malaria transmission in outdoor settings (Killen
    et al. 2016, Doucoure et al. 2020). In contrast, An. funestus is highly anthropophilic
    and endophilic, making this species an efficient malaria vector in indoor settings
    (Cohuert et al. 2004, Lwetoijera et al. 2014). In addition, this vectorial system
    increases malaria transmission stability via vector ecological succession, with
    An. arabiensis being more abundant than An. funestus during the planting season
    while An. funestus towards the crop maturation period (Chandler and Highton 1975,
    Mwangangi et al. 2006, Sogoba et al. 2007). The most common malaria and vector
    control method in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, has been long-lasting insecticide-impregnated
    nets (LLINs) (WHO 2013a, b). However, malaria vectors have developed resistance
    against pyrethroids (http://www.irmapper.com), the insecticide used to treat the
    nets (Zaim et al. 2000, Orondo et al. 2021). Indoor residual spraying (IRS) using
    the micro-encapsulated organophosphate insecticide pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic
    300CS) has had a significant impact on the vectors and malaria prevalence where
    it has been applied (Rowland et al. 2013, Mashauri et al. 2017). However, vectors
    are known to develop resistance to chemical insecticides, and as such, the implementation
    of integrated vector management (IVM) programs using environmental management
    and pesticide rotations (larvicides and adulticides) to control mosquitoes is
    encouraged (MöRner et al, 2002, WHO 2003, Imbahale et al. 2012). A prerequisite
    to applying any biological control of aquatic stages of malaria vectors is a detailed
    knowledge of their vector and habitat ecology (Dongus et al. 2007, Mereta et al.
    2013, WHO 2013a, b). This includes knowledge of habitat availability, stability,
    and productivity. Such knowledge will allow the informed application of bio-larvicides
    and larval sources management, such as timely applications of low persistence
    or long-lasting formulations of the bio-pesticides Bacillus thuringiensis var.
    israelensis Barjac and Lysinibacillus sphaericus. It may also guide which vector
    to target in terms of its malaria transmission capacity and seasonality, thus
    reducing the densities of emerging adult populations and costs of mosquito control
    in general (WHO 2013a, b). This study was undertaken in a semi-arid area of western
    Kenya where a concrete-lined channel irrigation ecosystem provides water for year-round
    multiple crop cultivation. Malaria is endemic in this region and vector control
    using LLINs and IRS with Actellic 300CS has been implemented. The study examined
    the impact of environmental modifications resulting from irrigation on the ecology
    of aquatic stages of malaria vectors. Environmental modification caused by irrigation
    has impacts on human health. Malaria control in irrigated ecosystem requires a
    collaborated effort between the agriculture and health sector. Policy makers in
    these sectors require evidence-based policies to manage malaria control. Currently,
    there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate the impact of environmental modification
    due to irrigation on vector ecology and malaria transmission. This study intends
    to fill the gap in knowledge of the effects of environmental modifications on
    the potential impacts on vector populations. Materials and Methods Study Site
    This study was conducted in Homa Bay County, western Kenya, a semi-arid malaria-endemic
    area situated along the southern shores of Winam Gulf, the north-eastern corner
    of Lake Victoria (34.6°E and 0.5°S; 1,330 m above sea level, Fig. 1). The average
    annual temperature is approximately 23°C, and rainfall is approximately 1,600
    mm, with two distinct rainy seasons between March–May (‘long rains’) and September–November
    (‘short rains’). The dry season occurs in January–February, and the coolest and
    wettest season is June–July. Precipitation and minimum/maximum temperatures were
    recorded monthly during the study period (Supp Fig. S1 [online only]). Fig. 1.
    Open in new tabDownload slide Map of the study site indicates the sampling clusters
    in the irrigated and the non-irrigated ecosystems in Homa Bay, Kenya. D1–D4 and
    N1–N4 indicate clusters where monthly dynamics were conducted in irrigated and
    non-irrigated ecosystems, respectively. Beginning in 2007, the Ministry of Environment,
    Natural Resources, and Regional Development Authorities of Kenya have undertaken
    modifications of the local environment by constructing concrete-lined, channel
    irrigation systems through the Kimira-Oluch Small-holder Farm Improvement Project
    (KOSFIP). This project was implemented to improve food production at the household
    level by ensuring a reliable water supply. Gravity-fed irrigation water from the
    Tende River runs through these canals all year round, and the local community
    uses the water for crop, animal, and fish farming. Farmers irrigate parcels of
    lands containing mixed crops, such as rice, vegetables, fruits, or maize. Mosquito
    breeding has increased as a result of irrigation and the creation of more water
    sources. The key malaria vectors in this area are An. arabiensis and An. funestus
    s.l. The use of insecticide-treated nets has been the primary vector control strategy
    in this area. In 2018 and 2019, the government implemented IRS using Actellic
    300CS that significantly reduced malaria vector populations. Study Framework The
    larval ecology portion of the study was undertaken using the framework as described
    by Githeko et al. (2012), which enables larval habitat profiling in terms of availability,
    stability, and productivity. The features allowed for targeted applications of
    larval source management, larval control and were conducted in the irrigated and
    non-irrigated ecosystems of Homa Bay to determine the impact of environmental
    modification on larval ecology. The irrigated ecosystem has either concrete- or
    earth-lined irrigation canals that distributes water from the main water supply.
    The non-irrigated ecosystem is an area with no irrigation canals to assist in
    agriculture. The two ecosystems were further divided into 10 clusters based on
    the local villages. Larval sampling was undertaken in 2018 and 2019 from the clusters
    in the irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems (Fig. 1). A cluster is an area of
    1–2.5 km2 that consists of 40–50 houses, or 300–500 residents. Within the ecosystems,
    habitats were classified as either temporary, semipermanent, or permanent. Temporary
    habitats were habitats that remained aquatic for approximately two weeks, while
    semipermanent habitats were those that held water for 2–3 months. Permanent habitats
    were habitats that could sustain their aquatic state for more than 3 months (Mereta
    et al. 2013). The habitats were within 2 km of nearby households; a distance less
    than 3.5 km, which is normally covered by starved Anophelines (Kaufmann and Briegel
    2004). Larval Habitat Availability and Larval Abundance Larval habitat availability
    is defined as the presence of an aquatic habitat capable of harboring immature
    larval species (Githeko et al. 2012). To determine difference between irrigated
    and non-irirgated systems in habitat availability and larval abundance, a cross-sectional
    area-wide samplings were conducted by mapping all available aquatic habitats and
    examining mosquito larval abundance during the dry season (February–March) and
    after the rainy season (June–July) in 2018 and 2019 for all 20 clusters. All aquatic
    habitats within the clusters and 200 m buffer zones from the edge of each cluster
    were sampled using a standard 350 ml mosquito larvae dipper. Aquatic habitats
    within 200 m buffer zone from the edge of each cluster were examined because dispersal
    distance of adult An. gambiae mosquitoes is within 200 m (Yao et al. 2022). These
    habitats were geocoded and documented with metadata, including habitat types,
    dimensions, and the physical characteristics of the surrounding environment (shade
    and vegetation cover, distance from the nearest house, land use, habitat substrate,
    water flow, water clarity). Temporary habitats included animal/human footprints,
    tire tracks/road paddles, rock pools, rain pools, and water containers, while
    semipermanent habitats included drainage ditches, irrigated earthen canals, natural
    ponds, and rice paddies. Permanent habitats included man-made ponds, swamps, concrete-lined
    irrigation canals, fish ponds, and river edges (Supp Fig. S2 [online only]). Mosquito
    larvae identification using taxonomic keys (Gillies and De Meillon 1968, Gillies
    and Coetzee 1987) was done on sampled larvae in the field and enumerated; a subset
    of the sampled larvae was preserved in absolute ethanol, labeled, and transported
    to the laboratory for species identification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
    All mosquito larval abundance, including Anopheles, (Culex), and (Aedes) larvae
    were recorded, and the instar stages of different Anopheles larvae were also indicated.
    Monthly Habitat and Larval Dynamics To examine differences in the dynamics of
    aquatic habitats and larval abundance between irrigated and non-irrigated systems,
    four clusters in each ecosystem (irrigated and non-irrigated) were randomly selected
    and examined monthly from February to November in 2019. Sampling was not done
    in July due to logistical constraint. Sampling was completed in all aquatic habitats
    within the cluster and 200 m from the edge of each cluster. All sampled habitats
    were geocoded and documented with metadata as previously described. Larval sampling,
    morphological identification, and PCR molecular speciation were also completed
    using the above-mentioned methods. Larval densities of Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes,
    and the instar stages of different Anopheles larvae species were recorded. Habitat
    Stability Habitat stability is defined as the duration over which a habitat remains
    aquatic (Githeko et al. 2012). A cohort of 100 aquatic habitats, 50 from irrigated
    and 50 from non-irrigated ecosystems, was selected in September 2018. The irrigated
    ecosystem habitats consisted of man-made ponds, swamps, river edges, concrete
    irrigation lining, drainage ditches, and fish ponds, while the non-irrigated ecosystem
    habitats were composed of swamps, river edges, natural ponds, drainage ditches,
    and man-made ponds. These habitats were followed every 2-weeks between September
    and November 2018, and then monthly from December 2018 to August 2019. During
    each visit, the aquatic status of each habitat was recorded. Larval sampling,
    morphological identification, and PCR molecular speciation were also completed
    using the above-mentioned methods. Habitat Adult Vector Productivity Monitoring
    Using Emergence Traps Habitat adult vector productivity is defined as a habitat
    capable of supporting immature stages of larval development until emergence into
    adults (Githeko et al. 2012). The productivity of malaria vectors in their natural
    aquatic habitats was determined using floating emergence traps (Service 1973).
    The emergence traps were constructed from conical metal frames, 1 m in height
    and 1 m in diameter, and thus each trap covered habitat surface area of 0.785
    m2. The design of the emergence traps prevented oviposition by other gravid mosquitoes.
    Traps were placed in randomly selected areas within the 2 m area from the habitat
    edges, and relocated every 2 d within specific habitats. Six replicates were used
    for each of the 6 habitat types in rice paddies, swamps, man-made ponds, drainage
    ditches, and fish ponds. This cycle was replicated three times for ten consecutive
    days. Productivity was determined by the number of emerging female mosquitoes
    collected using aspiration per habitat type per day. Habitat adult vector productivity
    was monitored daily for ten consecutive days from September to November 2019.
    Emerged mosquitoes were identified using taxonomic keys (Gillies and De Meillon
    1968, Gillies and Coetzee 1987). In addition, habitats were sampled every morning
    to determine mosquito larval densities using the standard larval dippers and the
    sampled larvae returned into the habitats. Overall Adult Vector Productivity in
    Each Ecosystem Based on larval habitat stability and abundance from the field
    survey and habitat productivity from the emergence traps, the overall daily productivity
    of adult malaria vectors in the irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems was modeled
    as the product of productive aquatic habitats area size and habitat productivity
    estimation based on emergence traps. In each ecosystem, the total area size of
    productive aquatic habitats for each cluster was calculated for permanent, semipermanent,
    and temporary habitats, using the field survey from September 2018 to August,
    2019. For large permanent habitats, field observations indicated that mosquito
    larvae tended to concentrate near the edge of large habitats. Thus, the area within
    a 2 m distance from the habitat edge was assumed to be the area that permitted
    mosquito larvae to further develop into pupae and adults. The productivity of
    temporary habitats was based on an earlier publication in the area (0.2 female
    adult mosquitoes per m2 aquatic habitat per day; Himeidan et al. 2009), and productivity
    of semipermanent and permanent habitats was based on the present study (0.104
    and 0.085 adult mosquitoes per m2 aquatic habitat per day, respectively). Due
    to the cluster size difference between irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems,
    the weekly number of adult female mosquitoes produced from permanent, semipermanent,
    and temporary larval habitats for the irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems were
    calculated and standardized against the study cluster area size. DNA Extraction
    and Species Identification All field-collected specimens were morphologically
    identified as Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes species. DNA was extracted from randomly
    selected An. gambiae s.l. specimens, and identified by PCR following the menhtod
    of Scott et al. (1993). Data Analysis During fieldwork, all information was collected
    through Open Data Kit (ODK) on tablets and then transferred to the MySQL database
    server. Larval densities per dip were calculated, and Z-tests were used to determine
    statistical difference between irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems, and among
    different habitat types. Pearson chi-square was used to determine the differences
    in the occurrence of Anopheles larvae among the different habitat types and between
    the irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
    was employed to determine the stability of larval habitats in the irrigated and
    non-irrigated ecosystems. Anopheles densities from the emergence traps were analyzed
    using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine difference in the productivity
    among different habitat types and between the irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems.
    Finally, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with Poisson error and log link
    function was used to analyze the statistical difference in larval densities among
    temporary, semipermanent, and permanent habitats and the two ecosystems. Results
    Habitat Availability and Productivity In comparison to clusters in the non-irrigated
    ecosystem, about 2.9-fold higher number of aquatic habitats were found and 2.6-fold
    higher number of Anopheles larvae were collected in the irrigated ecosystem (Table
    1). The area size of clusters from the non-irrigated ecosystem was 28% larger
    than clusters from the irrigated ecosystem (1.84 vs 1.31 km2). After adjusting
    for cluster area size, irrigated ecosystem had about 4-fold higher number of aquatic
    habitats. The proportion of aquatic habitats that were positive with Anopheles
    larvae was similar. Densities of immature stages decreased significantly with
    age: among all immature mosquitoes collected, pupae represented a small fraction,
    and the pupal proportion varied significantly between the irrigated (3.7%) and
    non-irrigated (1.2%) ecosystems (χ2 = 69.48, df = 2, P < 0.0001, Table 1). In
    addition to Anopheles, similar number of Culex larvae and a few Aedes larvae were
    collected. Within malaria vectors, An. gambiae s.l. accounted for 94.7–95.4% of
    all Anopheles collected (Table 1). Table 1.Habitat availability and immature mosquito

    habitat availability and larval densities (Fig. 2). Habitat availability fluctuated
    more dramatically in the non-irrigated ecosystem than in the irrigated ecosystem.
    Significant difference in the number of available habitats was detected between
    the two ecosystems only during the dry season (P < 0.05, Fig. 2A). In terms of
    larval densities, overall the rainy season exhibited significantly higher Anopheles
    density than the dry season (F = 15.09, df = 1,1311, P < 0.0001). Differences
    in Anopheles densities between irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems was pronounced
    during the dry season in the temporary (Fig. 2B) and semipermanent habitats (Fig.
    2C). Additionally, larval densities in permanent habitats were significantly higher
    in irrigated ecosystems than in non-irrigated ecosystems during the rainy season
    (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2. Open in new tabDownload slide The total number of habitats
    in a unit cluster area (A) and mean larval densities per dip in temporary (B),
    semipermanent (C), and permanent (D) in irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems
    during the seasonal sampling in 2018 and 2019. Monthly Habitat and Larval Density
    Dynamics To determine whether irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems differed
    in aquatic habitat abundance and larval density in months between dry and rainy
    seasons, the availability of aquatic habitats and larval density in 8 randomly
    selected clusters from the irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems were monitored.
    The average area size of the cluster study area in the irrigated and non-irrigated
    ecosystems was similar (2.63 ± 0.06 km2 and 2.78 ± 0.24 km2, respectively). Compared
    to the non-irrigated ecosystem, there were significantly more semipermanent (χ2
    = 56.41, df = 1, P < 0.0001) and permanent (χ2 =35.26, df = 1, P < 0.0001) habitats
    in the irrigated ecosystem, but similar number of temporary habitats (χ2 = 3.12,
    df = 1, P > 0.05) (Fig. 3A and B). The irrigated ecosystem exhibited higher number
    of aquatic habitats and a significantly larger average area size of the aquatic
    habitats was than the non-irirgated ecosystem (Fig. 3C and D). Significantly higher
    Anopheles larval density was found in permanent habitats in non-irrigated ecosystem
    than in irrigated ecosystem (F = 6.25, df = 2,15, P < 0.01), but not in temporary
    (F = 0.17, df = 2,15, P > 0.05) and semipermanent (F = 0.89, df = 2,15, P > 0.05)
    habitats (Fig. 3E and F). Fig. 3. Open in new tabDownload slide Number of habitat
    per unit cluster area (/km2) in the irrigated (A) and non-irrigated (B) ecosystem;
    habitat area per unit cluster area (m2/km2) in irrigated (C) and non-irrigated
    (D) ecosystem; larval density in the irrigated (E) and non-irrigated (F) ecosystem
    during monthly larval dynamics in 2019 in temporary, semipermanent, and permanent
    habitats. Habitat Stability Among a cohort of 100 aquatic habitats enrolled in
    September 2018, 17 habitats were classified as semipermanent (man-made ponds,
    irrigation lining, and drainage ditches) and 33 were permanent habitats (swamps,
    river edges, and fish ponds) in the irrigated ecosystem. In the non-irrigated
    ecosystem, there were 28 semipermanent (man-made ponds and drainage ditches) and
    22 permanent (swamps, river edges, and natural ponds) habitats. One-year monitoring
    of these habitats found that habitats in the irrigated ecosystem remained aquatic
    longer than the habitats in the non-irrigated ecosystem. On average, 89.4% and
    92.3% of the permanent and semipermanent habitats remained aquatic on the inspection
    days in the irrigated ecosystem, respectively (Fig. 4A), significantly higher
    than those in the non-irrigated ecosystem (79.1% for permanent habitats, Z = 12.23,
    P < 0.0001; and 69.2% for semipermanent habitats; Z = 10.69, P < 0.0001; Fig.
    4B). The largest difference in habitat stability between the irrigated and non-irrigated
    ecosystems occurred during the dry season. Fig. 4. Open in new tabDownload slide
    Habitat stability in the irrigated (A) and non-irrigated (B) ecosystems, and Anopheles
    densities per dip in the irrigated (C) and non-irrigated (D) ecosystems from September
    2018 to August 2019. In terms of larval density, permanent and semipermanent habitats
    exhibited no significant difference within the irrigated (F = 0.21, df = 1,23,
    P > 0.05; Fig. 4C) and non-irrigated ecosystems (F = 0.06, df = 1,23, P > 0.05;
    Fig. 4D). However, average Anopheles larval densities in the non-irrigated ecosystem
    were significantly higher than in the irrigated ecosystem for both permanent habitats
    (F = 5.62, df = 1, 23, P < 0.05) and semipermanent habitats (F = 5.46, df = 1,
    23, P < 0.05). The period when the density differed the largest between the irrigated
    and non-irrigated ecosystems was in the dry period. Habitat Productivity Surveillance
    Using Mosquito Emergence Traps Overall, (An. Coustani) were the predominant adults
    collected from the five habitat types, followed by (An. Pharoensi)s and An. gambiae
    s.l., while An. funestus were collected only from the rice paddies (Fig. 5A).
    The number of emerged Anopheles female mosquitoes varied significantly from 0.08
    to 0.23 per trap-night among the 5 habitat types (F = 2.54, df = 4,85, P < 0.05;
    Fig. 5A), with drainage ditches having the highest productivity and the fish ponds
    the lowest productivity. The larval habitat types used for adult mosquito productivity
    surveillance did not differ significantly in larval densities (Fig. 5B). Habitat
    productivity of adult mosquitoes varied significantly from 1.1% to 4.4% (P < 0.01),
    with the highest in swamps and the lowest in man-made ponds and fish ponds (Fig.
    5C). Fig.5. Open in new tabDownload slide Densities of female adult Anopheles
    per trap-night (A) collected from the emergence traps, densities of larval Anopheles
    per dip (B) collected from the habitats, and adult emergence rate (C) from the
    different types of habitats where emergence traps were conducted. Overall Adult
    Malaria Vector Productivity in Each Ecosystem After assessing for habitat availability,
    dynamics, and stability, the overall malaria vector productivity for all the habitats
    in irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems in the study clusters was estimated.
    For both irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems, semipermanent habitats produced
    the largest number of adult vectors as they were most abundant and most productive
    (Fig. 6). The daily productivity of adult vectors from permanent and semipermanent
    habitats in the irrigated ecosystem was 1.4–3.2 fold higher than those in the
    non-irrigated ecosystem, and similar for the temporary habitats (Table 2). The
    overall adult malaria vector productivity of clusters from the irrigated ecosystem
    was estimated to be 137.0 female malaria mosquitoes per km2 cluster area per day,1.9
    fold higher than clusters from the non-irrigated ecosystem (72.1 female malaria
    mosquitoes per km2 cluster area per day) (Table 2).         Table 2.Estimated

    Predicted number of emerged female Anopheles adults produced in unit cluster area
    per day (/km2-day) in Temporary (A), Semipermanent (B), Permanent (C) habitats,
    and all/combined (D) habitat types. Molecular Species Identification In the seasonal
    larval surveillance and dynamics, molecular species identification was made on
    a subset (1,399 samples) of the An. gambiae s.l. sampled during this study. Anopheles
    arabiensis comprised 98.3% of the specimens analyzed, with the remainder being
    An. gambiae. For the adult mosquito productivity surveillance through the emergency
    traps, all female An. gambiae s.l. samples (12) were analyzed for species identification.
    An. arabiensis was the only species identified within An. gambiae s.l. in the
    adult mosquito productivity experiment. An. funestus s.s was the only sibling
    species identified by PCR from the seasonal surveillance (73) and the emergence
    traps (1). Discussion This study was conducted in Homa Bay, an area with high
    ITN coverage (>80%) (National Malaria Control Programme 2015), and IRS was conducted
    in February/March 2018 and 2019 using the organophosphate insecticide Actellic
    300CS. IRS activities in this region have resulted in a significant decrease in
    the proportion of primary malaria vectors (Abong’o et al. 2020). Despite the establishment
    of the KOSFIP irrigation system in Homa Bay County, its impact on malaria vector
    dynamics and transmission remains unknown. Through aquatic habitat characterization,
    this study aimed to understand the effect of irrigation on malaria vector larval
    ecology, which provides insight for larval source management. This study found
    that the irrigated ecosystem had more habitats and higher larval productivity
    than the non-irrigated ecosystem. Furthermore, more stable habitats were observed
    in the irrigated ecosystem. Seasonality had a significant effect in the non-irrigated
    ecosystem but had no effect in the irrigated ecosystem, with 3–5 times more stable
    aquatic habitats in the irrigated ecosystem than in the non-irrigated during the
    dry season. Larval productivity was found to be higher in more stable habitats,
    with semipermanent habitats having higher densities than permanent habitats. An.
    arabiensis accounted for the greatest proportion of anophelines larvae (>95%),
    while other Anopheles species accounted for only 2% each. The current study found
    no significant difference in An. gambiae s. l. populations in either of the ecosystem.
    In non-irrigated areas, rainfall had a significant influence on the number of
    larval habitats since more habitats were sampled during the wet season as opposed
    to the dry season. The findings supported previous research that found a significant
    increase in larval habitats, including temporary pools that were highly productive
    for Anopheles breeding (Nsereko et al. 2020). In contrast to the non-irrigated
    ecosystem, where larval abundance peaked after seasonal rain, larval abundance
    in the irrigated ecosystem was associated with irrigation, while rainfall had
    little effect. Temporary habitats significantly contributed to the larval vector
    abundance in both ecosystems during the rainy seasons, and such has also been
    reported elsewhere as having high larval survivorship for An. gambiae s.l. (Gilles
    and Warrell 1996, Mwangangi et al. 2010, Nsereko et al. 2020). These habitats
    have been observed to be the preferred Anopheles oviposition sites due to fewer
    predators (Service 1977, Sunahara et al. 2002, Munga et al. 2007, Silberbush and
    Blaustein 2008, Munga et al. 2013). The habitat type influenced Anopheles densities
    in irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems. Both habitat type and seasonality affected
    Anopheles densities in both ecosystems. Seasonality had a strong influence on
    habitat availability in the non-irrigated as compared to irrigated ecosystem with
    more stable larval habitats. This could be due to the constant availability of
    water in the irrigated ecosystem, which was not significantly affected by seasonal
    weather changes. The monthly larval sampling revealed higher Anopheles larval
    densities in the non-irrigated compared to irrigated ecosystem. The study attributes
    the observed difference to limited breeding sites in the non-irrigated ecosystem
    with concentrated breeding in temporary water pools (animal and human footprints)
    that serve as communal water collection points. The overall adult vector productivity,
    which integrated the effects of habitat diversity, stability, and availability,
    shows that permanent and semipermanent habitats were more productive than temporary
    habitats in both ecosystems. The daily productivity of adult female vectors from
    the habitats was higher in the irrigated ecosystems. With semipermanent habitats
    dominating the current study site, the overall adult vector productivity was calculated
    based on some assumptions; more field surveys and data collections are needed
    to validate this idea. However, because An. arabiensis was found in various habitats,
    all aquatic habitats should be treated as potential vector breeding sites (Sattler
    et al. 2005). Malaria vector control strategies are determined by several factors,
    such as vector species availability, vector abundance, vector feeding, resting
    behavior, and the endemic nature of the disease in the targeted area. Vector abundance
    and Anopheles breeding sites are essential to reduce malaria transmission and
    should be targeted to guide interventions (Craig et al. 1999, Coetzee et al. 2000,
    Eisele et al. 2003). The relationship between larval densities and adult vectors
    in irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems remains contentious with regards to
    malaria cases (Ijumba and Lindsay 2001), with some studies correlating larval
    densities with increase in malaria cases in irrigated areas (Kibret et al. 2010,
    Kibret et al. 2017b), while others showing no correlation (Hunter et al. 1993,
    Ijumba et al., 1997). Previous studies have shown that the rate of adult vector
    emergence from their aquatic habitats is very low (approximately 1–4% of the immature
    stages) (Service 1971, 1973; Mukiama and Mwangi 1989, Munga et al. 2006, Munga
    et al. 2007) thus affirming the none correlation between larval densities and
    malaria cases. In addition, the current study has shown that the number of female
    Anopheles vectors emerging from the breeding sites is low as collected from the
    emergence traps. Conclusion Environmental modification through the construction
    of an irrigation system increases the availability and stability of vector breeding
    habitats as observed in the study site. Seasonality had no influence on larval
    densities in the irrigated ecosystem since more habitats were stable. This poses
    a constant threat to malaria transmission due to a higher number of potential
    breeding sites. Environmental modifications that result in more malaria vectors
    could offset gains achieved by using LLINs and IRS, making controlling mosquito
    production in irrigated ecosystems crucial in preventing malaria transmission
    in the region. Supplementary Data Supplementary data are available at Journal

    of the best model, three different parts of datasets (all-inclusive, 1st half,

    on the datasets of the test stations. The study concluded that the hybrid PSO-GA
    tuned Sugeno type 1 FT approach, which was composed of several standalone FIS
    objects, was suitable for predicting daily ET0 values.

    Evapotranspiration Chapter © 2019 1 Introduction Evapotranspiration (ET) is considered
    as one of the most visible and important constituents of the hydrologic cycle
    and serves a crucial function in the reliable and careful management of water
    resources, especially in the field of irrigated agriculture where sustainable
    agricultural practices greatly rely on irrigation water (Ferreira and da Cunha
    2020). Due to this vital importance, accurate estimation of ET demands special
    attention from planners and policymakers in drawing the right decisions on the
    allocation of precious water resources. Direct measuring of ET can be accomplished
    using a costly lysimetric method (Holmes 1984), which is associated with small
    area coverage, high setup and operational expenses and laborious work involved
    in data collection (Chia et al. 2020). Alternatively, ET can be measured along
    with other meteorological variables by means of the eddy covariance and Bowen
    ratio methods (Bowen 1926; Shoemaker et al. 2011), which are also costly and involve
    setup and operational complexities. Due to these shortfalls, indirect approaches
    to ET measurement, based solely on reference evapotranspiration (ET0) estimation
    are gaining popularity in many different places around the globe (Allen et al.
    1998; Ding et al. 2013). Estimation of ET0 primarily depends on the climatic variables,
    and it can be predicted accurately once a direct association between ET0 and climatic
    variables are established. Therefore, there is a growing demand for accurate prediction
    models that work on input–output data patterns, and can be generalized for other
    stations once developed for a particular station. Hence, this effort intends to
    propose an approach utilizing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for predicting
    and generalizing ET0 for six meteorological stations located in south Florida,
    USA. ET0 model was developed for a station, and the generalization capability
    of this developed model was verified using data from the other five stations in
    the same hydrological setting. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based ML
    tools have gained considerable attraction during the last decade as one of the
    best alternative methods to accurately model complex and nonlinear relationships
    between independent and target variables. Likewise, the prediction of ET0 using
    AI models with meteorological variables as inputs has gained popularity. Numerous
    soft computing approaches have widely been applied to predict ET0 in different
    hydrological settings. These include Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Kumar et
    al. 2002; Rahimikhoob 2014, 2016; Gocić and Amiri 2021; Maqsood et al. 2022),
    Self-organizing Map Neural Network (Chang et al. 2010), Generalized Regression
    Neural Networks (GRNN) (Feng et al. 2017a, b), Long Short-Term Memory Networks
    (Roy 2021), Deep Neural Network (Ravindran et al. 2021), Random Forests (RF) (Feng
    et al. 2017a; Huang et al. 2019), Tree-based Ensembles (Agrawal et al. 2022),
    Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) (Abdullah et al. 2015; Dou and Yang 2018), Gaussian
    Process Regression (GPR) (Karbasi 2018), Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Huang et
    al. 2019; Chia et al. 2020), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) (Dou
    and Yang 2018; Keshtegar et al. 2017), M5 Model Tree (Rahimikhoob 2014, 2016),
    and Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) ( Wang et al. 2019). Although numerous ML-based
    ET0 models have recently been developed, the majority of the modelling tasks (i.e.,
    train, test, and validate the models) were carried out using meteorological data
    from the same station. Few studies have been conducted to assess the model''s
    performance using data from different stations (i.e., apart from stations for
    which the model was developed). For instance, Wang et al. (2019) used data from
    many weather stations within China to assess the potential generalization capacity
    of RF and GEP models to estimate ET0. In another study, Roy et al. (2021) utilized
    data from two weather stations in Bangladesh: data from the first station was
    used to develop an ET0 model based on a PSO tuned Hierarchical Fuzzy Systems (PSO-HFS)
    while the generalization capability of the developed PSO-HFS model was tested
    using data from the second station. The current study presents a method in which
    training, validating and testing of the model were being carried out for a particular
    meteorological station, then the created model was tested using meteorological
    data from surrounding stations (five stations) to demonstrate the proposed model''s
    generalization capacity. Apart from that, soft computing techniques tuned using
    numerous optimization algorithms were thought to improve ET0 prediction accuracy
    substantially (Tao et al. 2018). As an example, Alizamir et al. (2020) demonstrated
    ET0 modelling using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
    tuned ANFIS models, and compared the prediction precision of the optimization
    algorithm tuned ANFIS models with that of the classic ANFIS and ANN models. To
    optimize the ANFIS parameters for forecasting ET0 in subtropical climatic zones,
    Roy et al. (2020) used Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO), Firefly Algorithm
    (FA), PSO, and Teaching–Learning-based Optimization (TLBO). They also proposed
    an ensemble of these ANFIS models that were tuned using evolutionary algorithms:
    the ensemble model outperformed the majority of the single models, according to
    the researchers. Roy et al. (2021) proposed a PSO-HFS to predict daily ET0 and
    concluded that the proposed PSO-HFS can be used as an effective tool to model
    daily ET0 with an acceptable level of accuracy. In three different climatic zones
    of Iran, Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) tuned Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    models outperformed classic SVR models in forecasting ET0 (Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh
    2020). In a different research work, Tikhamarine et al. (2020a) suggested optimized
    SVR models with WOA, Multi-verse Optimizer (MVO), and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO)
    for forecasting monthly ET0 at two climatological stations in Algeria''s northwestern
    region using three different input scenarios. Tikhamarine et al. (2020b) developed
    a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) tuned SVR model for calculating monthly ET0 at three
    Algerian climatological stations. Wu et al. (2020) developed hybrid ELM models
    to estimate monthly pan evaporation by combining ELM with WOA and Flower Pollination
    Algorithm (FPA). They found that FPA considerably improved the accuracy of the
    ELM model. In a different study, the PSO tuned ELM model was found to be superior
    to standard ELM, ANN, and RF-based prediction models for projecting daily ET0
    utilizing fewer climatological data as inputs for a research work done in a dry
    area of China (Zhu et al. 2020). Consequently, it is evident that model performance
    improves substantially when optimization algorithms are employed to tune the parameters
    of the models; hence, in the present research, optimization algorithms (e.g.,
    GA, PSO, Pattern Search (PS), and their combinations) were employed to tune the
    model parameters of the standalone Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and Fuzzy Tree
    (FT) models. There have been very few studies conducted on hydrological and agricultural
    fields using FTs. However, they have already been successfully applied in different
    fields (Barach et al. 2019). Recently, a few studies on water management and hydrology
    also centered on the application of Fuzzy Decision Trees (FDT). For example, while
    characterizing the magnitudes and frequencies in flood time series, Sikorska-Senoner
    and Seibert, (2020) used an FDT rather than a typical trend analysis. Another
    study by Sikorska et al. (2015) demonstrated the use of FDTs in flood classification
    to identify the patterns of flood at a catchment scale and concluded that FDTs
    provided better estimates of flood class than utilizing a crisp decision tree.
    To construct working conditions for a reservoir system, Wei and Hsu (2008) compared
    three forms of decision trees: conventional decision trees, neural decision trees,
    and FDTs. The findings of their comparison showed that FDTs outperformed the other
    two forms of decision trees. Another study by Schärer et al. (2006) reported the
    utility of FDTs in modelling and predicting phosphorus export from agricultural
    catchments. They demonstrated the high potential of FDTs in the decision support
    system to provide guidances to the policy makers. Using fuzzy logic-based FDTs,
    Han et al. (2002) tackled the uncertainty in instantaneous flood projections.
    The findings of the previous studies clearly demonstrated the capability of tree-based
    modelling approaches in various research domains. Moreover, optimization algorithms
    can considerably improve the ET0 prediction capabilities of the FT-based models.
    This is evident in a recent research by Roy et al. (2021), who improved the prediction
    capability of an HFS model by tuning its parameters using a PSO algorithm. However,
    they used only the PSO algorithm to tune both the input–output Membership Function
    (MF) parameters and the rule base of the HFS model. In contrast, the present study
    incorporates six different combinations of three optimization algorithms (GA,
    PSO, and PS) for the rule base learning and tuning of all parameters separately
    to develop different FIS and FT models. Moreover, a total of 50 models were developed
    and compared including the incorporation of both Sugeno and Mamdani type 1 and
    type 2 fuzzy objects. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid optimization algorithm
    tuned hierarchical tree-based FT model composed of individual fuzzy objects to
    predict daily ET0. The performance of the proposed FT model was compared with
    optimization algorithm tuned FIS, Regression Tree (RT), and M5Tree models as benchmarks.
    In addition, most applications (e.g., ET0 modelling) include input variables that
    are positively or negatively correlated with the target variable, and a cascaded
    structure of FT models is better suited for such applications. Therefore, an FT
    model having a cascaded structure combining hierarchical fuzzy systems was developed
    in this study for ET0 modelling. According to the most recent literature, hybrid
    optimization algorithm tuned FT models are yet to be applied in the research fields
    of agriculture and hydrology, particularly in the modelling of ET0. Furthermore,
    the generated ET0 model''s generalization capacity for the surrounding weather
    stations has not been assessed using the hybrid optimization algorithm tuned FT-based
    ET0 modelling technique. The necessity to build and calibrate a model particular
    to each station is eliminated by using a generalized prediction model that can
    be geographically validated using data from several stations. As a result, it
    is possible to create a generalized prediction model that depicts a hydrogeological
    setting. Hence, the explicit objectives of the current study are as follows: (1)
    to explore the potentiality of an optimization algorithm tuned FT (based on both
    Sugeno and Mamdani type 1 and type 2 fuzzy objects) model for predicting daily
    ET0 in the subtropical climate of South Florida, United States; (2) to compare
    the performance of the proposed FT model with a benchmark single FIS, RT, and
    M5Tree based modelling approaches; and (3) to evaluate the generalization capability
    in terms of prediction accuracy of the FT model using data from the other five
    neighboring stations located in the similar climatic area and hydrologic setting.
    2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Study Area and Data The study area, situated in south
    Florida, USA (Fig. 1) has spatially varying ecosystems with different plant species
    and substrates. Daily meteorological data along with the measured ET0 values from
    six spatially and ecologically varying meteorological stations were acquired from
    the website of the United States Geological Survey (USGS 2020). Daily values of
    six meteorological variables, namely Latent Heat (LH), Solar Radiation (SR), Net
    Radiation (NR), Sensible Heat Flux (SHF), Relative Humidity (RH), and Air Temperature
    (AT) along with the quantified daily values of ET0 used in this study were obtained
    from the following six meteorological stations: Fig. 1 Aerial map of the study
    area with locations of the stations Full size image Station 1- Blue Cypress Marsh
    Station The station is located between 26° 54′ 06\" North latitude and 80° 47′
    21\" West longitude with the available meteorological and ET0 data for around
    5 years (from 11 December 2009 to 20 October 2014). Station 2- Cypress Swamp Station
    The vegetation covers and substrate of this station are recognized as Tall Cypress
    Strand, which locates between 25° 45′ 10\" North latitude and 81° 06′ 01\" West
    longitude. The Station has a data availability of nearly 3 years (from 25 April
    2007 to 24 April 2010). Station 3- Dwarf Cypress Station The coordinates of this
    station lie between 25° 45′ 45\" North latitude and 80° 54′ 27\" West longitude.
    The station has an herbaceous vegetative cover, namely Dwarf Cypress and Sawgrass.
    Available data ranges between 18 April 2007 and 10 April 2010 (approximately 3
    years). Station 4- Marsh Station Herbaceous vegetation such as Sawgrass and Deep-Water
    Marsh constitute the major plants and substrate of this station, which is located
    between 26° 11′ 57\" North latitude and 81° 15′ 58\" West longitude. Approximately
    3 years (17 June 2007 and 20 April 2010) of meteorological data and quantified
    ET0 values are available for this station. Station 5- Pine Upland Station The
    vegetation and substrate of this station are the Pine Upland and Cypress Domes.
    The station has available data for around 3 years (from 23 April 2007 to 16 April
    2010). The geographic location of this station lies between 25° 59′ 59\" North
    latitude and 80° 55′ 29\" West longitude. Station 6- Wet Prairie Station This
    station has available data for approximately 3 years (from 10 October 2007 to
    11 October 2010). The geographic location of this station lies between 25° 44′
    41\" North latitude and 80° 56′ 24\" West longitude. The measurement of ET0 values
    used in this study was performed using the eddy covariance energy-budget method
    (Shoemaker et al. 2011). The two main instruments used in the eddy covariance
    method are the sonic anemometers (measure latent heat fluxes) and krypton hygrometers
    (measure sensible heat fluxes). 2.2 Input–output Data for the Developed Models
    Meteorological variables including LH, SR, NR, SHF, RH, and AT and corresponding
    ET0 values constitute the input–output patterns for training of the proposed FT-based
    ET0 prediction models. ET0 prediction models were built using the data from the
    Blue Cypress Marsh station. This station was selected as a primary station for
    model development and validation purposes because of the availability of a wider
    range of data (from 11 December 2009 to 13 June 2018) and the minimum number of
    missing values. However, few values were missing, which were imputed with the
    RF algorithm (MathWorks 2022a). The missing data imputation was performed for
    both the training and test stations. The developed models at the training station
    (Blue Cypress Marsh) were then used to predict the ET0 values for the other five
    neighboring stations, mainly to evaluate the generalization capability of the
    proposed ET0 model. The entire dataset of the Blue Cypress Marsh station, as a
    representative station of the study area, was divided into the training (40%)
    (from 11 December 2009 to 03 May 2013), validation (40%) (from 04 May 2013 to
    01 October 2016), and applied (20%) (from 02 October 2016 to 13 June 2018). As
    the dataset was sequential, for better model building, the first 80% of the sequential
    data was randomized and split into two datasets of equal size (the first 40% for
    training and the last 40% for the validation). The last 20% of the dataset was
    taken in sequence and was served into the applied dataset. This method of data
    splitting provides for a more accurate assessment of the generated model''s performance
    on the applied data, which is usually a later part of the sequential data (Francone
    2001). The trained and validated ET0 models for the Blue Cypress Marsh station
    were then employed in predicting ET0 values for the other five stations without
    developing models with the datasets at these stations. For assessing the generalization
    capability of the ET0 models, three different arrangements of the test station
    datasets were evaluated: entire sequential datasets, the first half of the dataset,
    and the last half of the dataset. These scenarios of the dataset were used to
    test the ability of the developed ET0 models to capture the input–output relationships
    contained in different parts of the dataset with variations in data ranges and
    numbers. Descriptive statistics of the input meteorological variables and the
    output ET0 for the training (Blue Cypress Marsh station) and test stations are
    presented in Table 1. Table 1 Details and statistics of meteorological data for
    different stations Full size table 2.3 Proposed Optimization Algorithm Tuned Fuzzy
    Tree (FT) Models Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs) are considered to be useful tools
    for modelling dynamic, complex and non-linear systems with multiple inputs and
    single outputs (Sugeno and Yasukawa 1993; Takagi and Sugeno 1985). A Sugeno-type
    FIS is often preferred against a Mamdani FIS since the Sugeno FIS holds the advantage
    of having a more computationally efficient defuzzification process. In general,
    however, the computing efficiency of a FIS differs widely depending on the number
    of inputs and the numeral value of rules, since the number of inputs grows exponentially
    as the quantity of rules increases. A large number of rulesets affects a FIS''s
    computing performance and makes tweaking the rule base and membership function
    settings more challenging. Furthermore, a larger quantity of rule bases lowers
    the ability of tailored FISs to generalize, especially in cases where training
    data is scarce, as is the case in many hydrological applications. Rather than
    a single huge FIS object associated with numerous predictors, an FT made up of
    reduced intersected FIS objects may be used to solve these difficulties. The fuzzy
    systems in an FT are arranged in hierarchical tree configurations, with the low-level
    FIS outputs serving as inputs to the high-level FISs. When compared to a single
    FIS, an FT usually delivers more computing efficiency with an equal amount of
    input variables. Although several FT structures can be utilized, the following
    three are the most commonly used FT structures used in many application areas:
    (a) incremental, (b) aggregated, and (c) cascaded or combined, which is the combination
    of incremental and aggregated structures (Siddique and Adeli 2013). Because a
    cascaded structure is ideal for an application having correlated and uncorrelated
    variables together, and the meteorological variables used in this work are positively
    and negatively correlated with each other, this study used a cascaded or mixed
    (combined) FT framework. This study utilizes an FT to predict daily ET0 (output
    data attribute) by using six input data attributes (meteorological variables:
    LH, SR, NR, SHF, RH, and AT). The procedure of predicting daily ET0 values using
    an FT structure consists of the following two major steps: (a) Constructing the
    FT This step is associated with the following three sub-steps: (i) Ranking of
    the input meteorological variables according to their Pearson correlations with
    the output (ET0): Correlation coefficients between each of the input meteorological
    variables and the output variable (ET0 values) for the training data were calculated.
    The correlation matrix is presented in Fig. 2. It is observed from Fig. 2 that
    RH showed a negative correlation whereas all the other five input variables showed
    positive correlations with the ET0. Ranking of the input attributes having positive
    correlations was performed in descending order using the absolute values of the
    attribute’s correlation coefficients. Fig. 2 Correlation matrix showing Pearson
    correlations between meteorological variables and measured ET0. LH = Latent Heat,
    SR = Solar Radiation, NR = Net Radiation, SHF = Sensible Heat Flux, RH = Relative
    Humidity, AT = Air Temperature Full size image (ii) Creating several FIS objects
    with the help of the ranked input variables: To incorporate both the negative
    and positive effects on the output (ET0) for prediction, input attributes (meteorological
    variables) were combined based on the ranked attributes with both positive and
    negative correlation values. Finally, the input attributes were grouped with respect
    to their ranks as follows: fis1: Relative Humidity and Latent Heat fis2: Net Radiation
    and Air Temperature fis3: Solar Radiation and Sensible Heat Flux (iii) Constructing
    an FT using the created FIS objects: The FT was constructed using five (fis1,
    fis2, fis3, fis4, and fis5) two-input and one-output FIS elements to decrease
    the total quantity of rule sets in the inference system. Three FISs (fis1, fis2,
    and fis3) receive the input variables directly and produce intermediate values
    of ET0, which were then integrated using the leftover two FISs (fis4 and fis5).
    Figure 3 represents the created FT structure. Fig. 3 Illustration of the formation
    of FIS tree using several standalone FIS objects Full size image (b) Tuning the
    FT with the training data Tuning was accomplished in two phases: (i) Learning
    of the rule base only (input and output Membership Function (MF) parameters were
    kept constant), and (ii) Tuning of both the input/output MF parameters and the
    rule base. The first phase required less computation time compared to the second
    phase and was converged rapidly to a fuzzy rule base during the training step.
    In the second phase, the learnt new rules from the first phase along with the
    input and output MF parameters were tuned simultaneously. The parameter tuning
    process in the second phase was made faster (with convergence to near Global optima)
    through using the first phase''s tuned rule base as the second phase''s initial
    condition. 2.4 Tuning of the Proposed Models A two-phase tuning process was carried
    out on the FT. During phase one, the rule base was learned while the MF parameters
    for the inputs and the output were kept constant. During the second phase, tuning
    of the input and output MF parameters as well as the rule base was performed simultaneously
    in which the first phase''s tuned rule base was used as the second phase''s initial
    condition (MathWorks 2022b). This enables speedy parameter adjustment and global
    optima convergence. To obtain optimal parameter values of the FT models, optimization
    algorithms such as GA, PSO, and PS as well as their combinations were used for
    both phases of a simulation. Various combinations of optimization algorithms for
    learning rules and tuning all parameters for the FT-based models are presented
    in Table 2. Table 2 Combinations of optimization algorithms for learning rules
    and tuning all parameters for both FIS and FT-based models Full size table Obtaining
    optimal parameter sets through tuning was completed before the user-defined highest
    number of iterations was reached. In the case of non-convergence, iterations continued
    till the optimal solution was found or until the user-specified total quantity
    of iterations had been reached. The optimum options (various optimization parameters)
    for different optimization algorithms employed in this study are presented in
    Table 3. Table 3 The best parameter values employed for different optimization
    algorithms Full size table 3 Benchmark Models 3.1 Single Fuzzy Inference System
    (FIS) A single FIS object (both Sugeno and Mamdani type 1 and type 2 FIS objects)
    representing the individual fuzzy object in the proposed FT model was also developed
    for comparison purposes. Similar parameters, as in the case of fuzzy objects in
    the FT, as well as the similar MFs and tuning approaches, were used to provide
    a fair comparison. The main difference between the single FIS and the FT was the
    number of input variables fed to the models. Unlike FT modelling approach, the
    single FIS received all six meteorological variables as inputs in predicting the
    target variable, daily ET0. Details of Sugeno and Mamdani type 1 and type 2 FIS
    objects can be found in Sugeno and Yasukawa (1993), and are not repeated. 3.2
    Regression Tree (RT) RTs are variants of decision trees that use input–output
    training patterns to create simple, flexible, and easy-to-understand models. The
    notion of the ''Classification and Regression Tree (CART)'' algorithm is connected
    with RTs (Breiman et al. 1984; Krzywinski and Altman 2017). To generate models,
    the CART method uses three primary sequential procedures: (a) creating a complicated
    tree, (b) pruning, and (c) picking an ideal subtree. At the initial stage, a binary
    split process is used to create a complex complete tree with multiple terminal
    nodes. In the second stage, the complex tree created in the initial step is trimmed
    to avoid or at best decrease the tendency of model overfitting issues. The CART
    algorithm selects an appropriate subtree for new sample prediction in the third
    stage. By tracing the choices from the root node to the leaf node inside the tree,
    the generated RTs offer an anticipated response. An RT''s responses or outputs
    are stored in the leaf node. In the MATLAB environment, the RT-based ET0 prediction
    models were created. 3.3 M5 Model Tree (M5Tree) M5Tree was created using the M5
    method''s concepts (Quinlan 1992). This approach creates single trees using the
    ''Standard Deviation Reduction'' criterion, similar to the ''M5'' method. Model
    trees (MT) are made by combining standard regression trees at the leaf nodes with
    linear regression functions. The constituents of a leaf node of an MT, which is
    nothing more than an RT without these activities, are determined by pruning and
    smoothing processes. Machine learning algorithms such as MTs (Quinlan 1992) have
    proved their predictive skills in a variety of study disciplines (Bhattacharya
    and Solomatine 2005). The MTs are referred to as the ''inverted trees,'' meaning
    that the root nodes are at the crown of the tree while the leaves are at the bottom.
    MTs and RTs are Decision Tree (DT) variants that are especially suitable to solve
    regression problems (Quinlan 1992). The MTs, on the other hand, differ from RTs
    in that they produce linear type models in their leaf nodes, whereas RTs produce
    a constant value in their leaf nodes. The input–output linkages created at the
    leaves are consequently used in predicting responses for a particular dataset.
    When it comes to managing enormous datasets and providing reliable predictions,
    MTs outperform RTs. M5Tree employs the ''divide-and-conquer'' strategy, which
    allows for the division of a large domain of data into several little data sub-domains
    (Bhattacharya and Solomatine 2005). In this method, the input parameter domain
    is divided into numerous subspaces, each of which symbolizes a linear regression
    model. M5Tree can create a hierarchical tree structure with splitting rules''
    in its ''non-terminal nodes'' and ''expert models'' in its leaves by means of
    this unique data splitting technique. 4 Model Ranking: Calculation of Shannon’s
    Entropy Weight When alternative performance evaluation indices are used, machine
    learning-based prediction models consistently generate conflicting prediction
    results. For instance, one model may perform better than others when Index of
    Agreement (IOA) criterion is used. On the other hand, the better performer (based
    on the IOA criterion) may not perform equally well when another performance indicator,
    for instance, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is evaluated. As such, more
    than a few statistical indices need to be computed on the test dataset, and the
    derived indices should be used within a general framework based on a decision
    theory to choose the most effective model. In this study, the performance of the
    constructed prediction models was ranked and to establish the ranking, Shannon''s
    entropy was applied. There were three benefit indices (the higher the better)
    and three cost indices (the lower the better), which were incorporated in a general
    context to compute ranking of the models. Competing ET0 models and their performance
    indicators were integrated into a decision matrix. The calculation steps of the
    Shannon’s entropy can be found in Roy et al. 2020, and are not repeated here.
    5 Statistical Indices for Performance Evaluation To assess the performance of
    the FT-based ET0 models as well as the benchmark ET0 models, several performance
    indicators were used in this study as follows: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
    $$RMSE=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{P}\\right)}^{2}}}{\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{A}}}$$
    (1) Normalized RMSE: $$NRMSE=\\frac{RMSE}{\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{A}}}$$ (2) Accuracy:
    $$Acc=1-abs \\left(mean\\frac{{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{P}-{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}}{{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}}\\right)$$
    (3) Mean Bias Error (MBE): $$MBE=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum \\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{P}-{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}\\right)$$
    (4) Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NS): $$NS=1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{P}\\right)}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{A}}\\right)}^{2}}$$
    (5) Willmott’s Index of Agreement (IOA): $$d=1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{P}\\right)}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left(\\left|{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{P}-\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{A}}\\right|\\left|{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{A}}\\right|\\right)}^{2}}$$
    (6) Correlation Coefficient (R): $$R=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{A}}\\right)\\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{P}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{A}}\\right)}^{2}}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{P}-\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{P}}\\right)}^{2}}}$$
    (7) Maximum Absolute Error (MAE): $$MAE=\\mathrm{max}\\left[\\left|{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{A}-{{ET}_{0}}_{i}^{P}\\right|\\right]$$
    (8) Median Absolute Deviation (MAD): $$MAD\\left({{ET}_{0}}^{A},{{ET}_{0}}^{P}\\right)=\\mathrm{median
    }\\left(\\left|{{ET}_{0}}_{1}^{A}-{{ET}_{0}}_{1}^{P}\\right|,\\left|{{ET}_{0}}_{2}^{A}-{{ET}_{0}}_{2}^{P}\\right|,\\dots

    actual and model-predicted ET0 for the \\({i}^{th}\\) points of data in the dataset,
    respectively; \\(\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{A}}\\) and \\(\\overline{{{ET}_{0}}^{P}}\\)
    are the average values of the actual and model-predicted ET0, respectively; \\(n\\)
    represents the total number of points in the set of data. 6 Results and Discussion
    6.1 Performances of the FT, FIS, RT, and M5Tree Based Models During the Training,
    Validation, and Applied Phases The ET0 values, obtained from the optimization
    algorithm tuned FIS and FT models, RT, and M5Tree were compared with each other
    to obtain the best performing model. The values of the performance evaluation
    criteria for the training phase (training and validation sets of data) and testing
    phase (applied set of data) are presented in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Fig.
    4 illustrates model performances during the steps of training and validation for
    the models created at the base station (Blue Cypress Marsh station) concerning
    R, RMSE, and NRMSE. Fig. 4 Training and validation phase performances of the prediction-models

    through M50 as shown in Table 4. Table 4 Model naming (short form) Full size table
    From Fig. 4, it is evident that all statistical indices indicate a considerably
    satisfactory prediction performance of the models during the training as well
    as the validation phases as indicated by the computed R, RMSE, and NRMSE values.
    All models produced higher values of R and smaller quantities of RMSE and NRMSE,
    and all models showed negligible differences in magnitudes of the evaluation indices
    between the training and validation phases. Although models M4, M13, M31, M32,
    and M33 provided slightly higher differences in the values of R between the training
    and validation phases, the models produced acceptable R values during both the
    training and validation periods. As far as the RMSE criterion is concerned, higher
    differences between the training and validation phases were observed for M2, M10,
    M13, and M21 models. On the other hand, the NRMSE criterion reveals that higher
    differences between the training and validation NRMSE values were observed in
    almost all models. Nevertheless, the extent of these differences is rather low
    and these NRMSE values also show that the generated models perform well when compared
    to the criteria established by Heinemann et al. (2012) and Li et al. (2013). Figure
    5 presents radar (spider) plots of model performances during the test period (applied
    dataset) for the training station (Blue Cypress Marsh station) using R, NS, IOA,
    RMSE, MAE, and MAD criteria. It is perceived from Fig. 5a that the developed models
    provided reasonably accurate performance concerning IOA (> 0.9) and R (> 0.8)
    criteria. However, performances were relatively poor when the NS criterion was
    considered: Models M4 (NS criterion ranged between 0.7 and 0.8), M16 (NS criterion
    ranged between 0.7 and 0.8), M33 (NS criterion ranged between 0.5 and 0.6), and
    M45 (NS criterion ranged between 0.7 and 0.8) produced NS values less than 0.8.
    Figure 5b presents spider plots of the performances with respect to RMSE, MAE,
    and MAD criteria. It can be witnessed from Fig. 5b that the developed models produced
    lower values of RMSE, MAE, and MAD except for models M3, M31, M32, M33, M44, and
    M45 for which the values were slightly higher. However, these values were relatively
    smaller (< 1.0 mm d−1), which is acceptable for machine learning-based prediction
    modelling. As can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5, in general, the performances of
    the proposed FT and the other three benchmark models apparently showed a similar
    trend in prediction capabilities. However, a closer look at the performance indices
    clearly demonstrates that the models performed in a different way when various
    performance indices were employed. That is to say, the models showed a contradiction
    in the prediction performances pertaining to different performance evaluation
    indices computed from the actual and model-predicted outputs. It is really difficult
    to make decisions in this situation. Therefore, a decision theory based on Shannon''s
    entropy was used to choose the best-performing model among a group of various
    models. Instead of a single index, Shannon''s entropy included a collection of
    multiple performance evaluation indices. In this study, Shannon’s entropy was
    computed using 6 (six) performance evaluation indicators (R, NS, IOA, RMSE, MAE,
    and MAD) of which three were benefit indices (R, NS, IOA) and the remaining three
    were cost indices (RMSE, MAE, MAD). These performance evaluation indices were
    the indices computed on the applied dataset during the model testing phase. Table
    5 shows the results of model ranking using Shannon''s entropy. Table 5 Ranking
    of the developed models Full size table Based on the results presented in Table
    5, the proposed FT model (FISTree_PSO_GA_Sug_Type1) is deemed superior, and, therefore,
    the developed FT model is recommended to predict daily ET0 values at the training
    station (Blue Cypress Marsh station). The training, validation, and applied performances
    of the proposed best FT model developed at the training station (Blue Cypress
    Marsh) are presented using absolute error box plots (Fig. 6). It is revealed from
    Fig. 6 that the proposed FT model produced similar errors for both the training
    and validation phases indicating proper training without model over-or under-fitting.
    Similar trends in errors as with the training and validation errors were observed
    during the applied phase (with the applied set of data). This implies that the
    model''s performance in the applied phase was comparable. Fig. 6 Boxplots of absolute
    errors between actual and model-predicted ET0 for the best FT model at Blue Cypress
    Marsh station. The median of absolute errors between actual and model-predicted
    ET0 values is represented by horizontal lines within each box. The mean values
    of absolute errors and the outliers are indicated by black circles and the ‘×’
    symbols, respectively Full size image Although ET0''s actual and anticipated values
    seem slightly higher for the applied dataset, the magnitude of errors was relatively
    small and thus is acceptable for prediction modelling aspects. To further validate
    the performance of the proposed FT model (FISTree_PSO_GA_Sug_Type1), it was employed
    to predict daily ET0 values for the nearby stations located in the same climatic
    zone. The following paragraphs summarize the findings. 6.2 FT-based Model Performance
    During the Generalization Capability Validation Phase The proposed best-performing
    FT (FISTree_PSO_GA_Sug_Type1) model developed at Blue Cypress Marsh station was
    further tested using climatic data from five other meteorological stations, the
    data of which were utilized neither to train the model nor to validate it, i.e.,
    data from outside the training station was used to validate the model. The performance
    evaluation indices were calculated for the whole, 1st half, and the 2nd half of
    the dataset in all five test stations. The use of three sets of data from all
    test stations allows us to look into the model''s capacity to generalize better.
    Tables 6, 7, and 8 provide the findings of the evaluation in terms of several
    statistical indices. As shown by the results, the model performance was equally
    good when compared to the training and validation performance for the training
    station, while the model performance was considerably superior to the training
    station''s applied performance. Table 6 Statistical performance indices on the
    entire dataset of the test stations Full size table Table 7 Statistical performance
    indices on the first half of the entire dataset for test stations Full size table
    Table 8 Statistical performance indices on the second half of the entire dataset
    for test stations Full size table The model performance was acceptable with respect
    to the calculated performance indices: for each of the three datasets of all the
    test stations, the model yielded higher accuracy (higher values of NS, IOA, and
    R, as well as lower values of RMSE, NRMSE, and MBE). Table 6 presents the model
    performance on the entire dataset of the test stations. It is observed that with
    RMSE as the performance criterion, the testing performance was the best at Cypress
    Swamp station (0.051 mm d−1) followed by Wet Prairie (0.060 mm d−1), Dwarf Cypress
    (0.063 mm d−1), Marsh (0.108 mm d−1), and Pine Upland (0.997 mm d−1) stations.
    The numeric values of other statistical indices followed a similar trend. Table
    7 presents the model performance on the first half of the entire dataset for test
    stations. Table 7 shows that the proposed best-performing FT model functioned
    likewise when the first half of the data for the test stations were used for testing.
    As in the case where the entire dataset was used, the FT model performed the best
    and the worst at Wet Prairie (RMSE = 0.030 mm d−1) and Marsh (RMSE = 0.994 mm
    d−1) stations, respectively. It is worth noting that the performance was exceptionally
    good at all stations as far as the prediction modelling context was considered
    (Table 7). Table 8 presents the model performance on the second half of the entire
    dataset for the test stations. For this dataset, the model performance was also
    incredibly good, which is consistent with the previous results when either the
    entire or the first half of the dataset was used for model testing. With RMSE
    as a performance criterion, the model performance was the best at Cypress Swamp
    (0.053 mm d−1) station whereas it was worst at Marsh (0.120 mm d−1) station. Therefore,
    it can be perceived that the testing performance of the developed best-performing
    FT model was consistent and followed similar trends for different datasets at
    each test station. The prediction results of the test stations are presented using
    absolute error boxplots. Figure 7 illustrates the absolute differences in ET0
    values between actual and expected for the nearby five stations. It is observed
    from Fig. 7 that the errors are relatively small and are acceptable for the prediction
    modelling context. Fig. 7 Boxplots of absolute errors between actual and model-predicted
    ET0 of the other stations for the complete (a), 1st half (b), and the 2nd half
    (c) of the datasets. The median of absolute errors between actual and expected
    ET0 values is represented by horizontal lines inside each box. The mean values
    of absolute errors and the outliers are indicated by black circles and the ‘×’
    symbols, respectively Full size image 7 Conclusion This study looked into the
    potentialities of a hybrid PSO-GA optimized Sugeno type 1 FT modelling approach
    for predicting ET0 utilizing the meteorological factors. Six input attributes
    (climatic variables) such as Latent Heat, Solar Radiation, Net Radiation, Sensible
    Heat Flux, Relative Humidity, and Air temperature were used as inputs to compute
    the daily values of ET0. Five FIS objects with input features that are ranked
    (correlations of the inputs with the output, ET0) were used to create the FTs.
    The created FTs’ input–output MFs and rule bases were then optimized in two steps
    using several combinations of different optimization algorithms, resulting in
    quick convergence of the parameter optimization procedure pertaining to the train
    station''s (Blue Cypress Marsh) training dataset. The train, validation, and testing
    (applied dataset) results using the train station’s dataset revealed that the
    created FT model correctly mapped the train station dataset''s input–output patterns.
    Therefore, the suggested FT (PSO-GA optimized Sugeno type 1 FT) can be used to
    forecast ET0 using climatic data as inputs. Nonetheless, testing the produced
    FT model''s effectiveness outside of the training station is critical. To see
    how well the FT model is at predicting ET0 for the neighboring stations without
    developing individual models for those stations, the best FT (PSO-GA optimized
    Sugeno type 1 FT) model developed at Blue Cypress Marsh station was employed to
    predict ET0 for the other five stations. Three different datasets (1st half, 2nd
    half, and the complete dataset) from each of the test stations were tested. According
    to the findings, a Fuzzy logic-based FT may accurately predict daily ET0, especially
    when PSO and GA are used in the development of Sugeno type 1 FIS to construct
    the FT model (PSO-GA optimized Sugeno type 1 FT). The FT model''s accuracy and
    reliability in predicting ET0 for test stations were demonstrated by the findings.
    In subtropical climates, the proposed modelling technique offers a potential method
    for ET0 prediction. This study used data from one meteorological station and the
    created model was tested for other stations located in the same sub-tropical climatic
    zone but with varying substrates and plantations. It is worthwhile to include
    weather stations from various climatic zones to improve the applicability of the
    suggested FT modelling approach. Other bio-inspired optimization techniques may
    be explored and compared in future research, for instance, the Firefly Algorithm,
    or Whale Optimization Algorithm for the FT’s parameter tuning process. In addition,
    the present study evaluates the model performance to predict daily ET0 values
    which can be extended in a future study by developing models with weekly, monthly,
    and seasonal scales. Availability of Data and Material Datasets and other materials

  description: Understanding the water quality and its influencing factors of different
    water bodies is essential for managing water resources in closed inland lake basins
    in semi-arid regions. However, generally, groundwater or surface water is assessed
    separately, and the differences among different water bodies are neglected. This
    study assessed the water quality and its influencing factors of different water
    bodies in the Daihai Lake Basin (a closed inland lake basin in a semi-arid region)
    by analysing the hydrochemical data of groundwater, and spring, river, and lake
    waters in the dry and wet seasons. The dominant hydrochemical type of groundwater
    (81.48%), spring water (80%), and river water (83.33%) was HCO3–Ca•Mg, while that
    of lake water was Cl-Na (100%). Groundwater, spring water, and river water were
    suitable for drinking and agricultural irrigation; however, the groundwater quality
    was worse in the wet season than in the dry season. Na+ and Cl– majorly affected
    the lake water quality. The mean NO3– concentration in groundwater was 28.39 mg/L,
    and its non-carcinogenic hazard quotient indicated that high risk areas were mainly
    distributed in Tiancheng and northern Maihutu. The hydrochemical compositions
    of groundwater, spring water, and river water were mainly influenced by rock (silicate
    and carbonate) weathering and cation exchange, and agricultural activities were
    the main sources of groundwater NO3–. Moreover, the lake hydrochemical composition
    was mainly affected by evaporation and halite dissolution. Thus, groundwater NO3–
    pollution and lake water salinisation should be prioritised. These findings provide
    a more thorough understanding of water quality and its influencing factors in
    the closed inland lake basin in the semi-arid region, and can be used to develop
    the protection of ecosystems and water resources management strategies in the
    Daihai Lake Basin.

    management strategies in the Daihai Lake Basin. Introduction Water resources are
    extremely important to promote socioeconomic development and maintain and conserve
    ecosystems, especially in semi-arid regions (Xiao et al., 2014; Abboud, 2018;
    Liu et al., 2022). In addition, the sustainable development of water resources
    plays an important role in the future social development, as water quality influences
    human health, quality of life, and crop growth (Wang and Li, 2022; Xiao et al.,
    2022). The concentration and occurrence of chemical components in water will have
    direct influence on the water quality (Talib et al., 2019; Sunkari et al., 2022).
    Hydrochemical components in natural water are the products of the interactions
    between water and the surrounding environmental factors during the water cycle.
    Processes, such as atmospheric precipitation, rock weathering, and evaporation,
    usually control the continuous changes in the hydrochemical components in natural
    water bodies (Zhou et al., 2016; Hua et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021). In recent
    years, anthropogenic activities associated with rapid industrialisation, agricultural
    development, and urbanisation have continuously changed hydrochemical components,
    thereby constantly deteriorating the water resources (Armengol et al., 2017; Wang
    et al., 2022b). Therefore, prevention and mitigation of water pollution is necessary
    to ensure water security at a global scale. Analysing the hydrochemistry and water
    quality cannot only identify the mechanisms of interaction between water and the
    surrounding environmental factors, but also reflect the status of regional water
    quality, thus, allowing for more rational protection and sustainable utilisation
    of water resources (Ghezzi et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2021; Wang and Li, 2022).
    Under natural conditions, weathering of rocks due to water can lead to the dissolution
    of various minerals, which results in the gradual accumulation of chemical ions
    in water (Zhou et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2020). Contrastingly, pollutants originating
    from anthropogenic activities may occur in water within a relatively short period
    (Yan et al., 2021). The hydrochemistry of water bodies, particularly source and
    aggregation mechanisms of ions in water, can be assessed through methods, such
    as multivariate statistical analysis (Yidana et al., 2008; Mao et al., 2021),
    Piper diagram (Piper, 1944), Gibbs diagram (Gibbs, 1970), and ion ratios (Xiao
    et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2020). Additionally, water quality index (WQI) can effectively
    combine multiple physical and chemical parameters into a comprehensive value,
    and the method can reflect the overall status of water quality and is widely used
    in the water quality evaluation (Abbasnia et al., 2018; Rabeiy, 2018; Yan et al.,
    2021). Electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), sodium percentage
    (Na%), and permeability index (PI) are effective indices for comprehensively evaluating
    the suitability of water for agricultural irrigation (Brindha and Kavitha, 2014;
    Liu et al., 2021). In addition, health risk assessment (HRA) can quantitatively
    describe the risks posed by water to human health, thereby providing essential
    information for water quality evaluation and water resource management (Su et
    al., 2017; Adimalla et al., 2020). These above-mentioned indices and HRAs, which
    can evaluate the suitability of water, have been widely applied previously in
    arid and semi-arid regions. For example, studies have been conducted on the Aksu
    River, Turkey (Sener et al., 2017), groundwater in Central Sindh, Pakistan (Talib
    et al., 2019), groundwater in the Ningxia, China (Wang et al., 2022b), and groundwater
    in the Upper Egypt area (Rabeiy, 2018). These studies separately assessed the
    water quality of either groundwater or surface water. However, while studying
    regional water quality, different water bodies and seasonal variations must be
    considered. Therefore, investigating the water quality and its influencing factors
    of different water bodies is significant to ensure the sustainable utilisation
    of water resources in a lake basin. The Daihai Lake Basin is an important ecological
    area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The water resources play critical
    roles in ensuring regional ecological environmental security and sustainable socioeconomic
    development in this basin. In recent years, the ecological environment of the
    Daihai Lake Basin has received widespread concern. Previous studies on the ecological
    environment of this area have mainly focused on climate change (Xu et al., 2004),
    ecological restoration (Wang et al., 2019), and lake water quality and quantity
    (Liang et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2022). However, comprehensive
    research on the water quality and its influencing factors in the Daihai Lake Basin
    is lacking. Being a semi-arid, closed inland lake basin, the shortage of water
    resources in the Daihai Lake Basin has hindered local economic development (Wang
    et al., 2022a,c). Additionally, this basin is a farming-pastoral ecotone, and
    thus, the excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides and irrational discharge
    of domestic wastewater can deteriorate the water quality (Liang et al., 2021;
    Sun et al., 2021). These adverse factors have been threatening the local population
    health, and agricultural development. Therefore, a comprehensive hydrogeochemical
    study is necessary to determine the water quality and its influencing factors
    of different water bodies in the region during the dry and wet seasons that can
    contribute to improving the understanding of the changes in the water quality
    of the regional water resources. Additionally, considering that the hydrochemistry
    of the lake basin is changing rapidly, up-to-date observational data must be used
    to comprehensively explore the water quality status and its influencing factors
    to formulate adaptive water resource management and pollution control strategies.
    The main aims of the present study were to: (1) identify the hydrochemical characteristics
    of different water bodies in the Daihai Lake Basin, (2) assess the suitability
    of different water bodies for drinking and irrigation use and evaluate the potential
    human health risk of NO3– in groundwater, and (3) determine the main factors influencing
    the water quality of the different water bodies. The findings of this study can
    contribute to development and implementation of efficient strategies for water
    resource management and protection in the Daihai Lake Basin and provide a reference
    for water quality studies of water resources in other closed inland lake basins.
    Study area The Daihai Lake Basin (∼2341.67 km2; 40°11′–40°48′ N, 112°16′–112°59′
    E) is a typical closed inland lake basin on the Inner Mongolia Plateau (Figure
    1) with a temperate continental semi-arid monsoon climate. The average temperature
    is 6.09°C and multi-annual average precipitation is 415.55 mm. In the study area,
    the annual precipitation distribution is uneven, with significant dry and wet
    seasonal changes. It is mainly concentrated in June–September (wet season), accounting
    for 76.94% of the annual precipitation. The dry season is from October to May
    of the next year. Further, the multi-year average evaporation is 1795.96 mm. figure
    1 Figure 1. Geographical location and sampling points of the Daihai Lake Basin.
    Daihai Lake, a closed lake with an average water depth of ∼4 m and surface area
    of ∼55 km2, is the most important natural lake in this basin. The main sources
    of lake water are surface runoff, groundwater supply, and lake surface precipitation.
    Most rivers in the basin are seasonal rivers, and currently, only the Gongba,
    Tiancheng, and Suodaigou rivers are perennial rivers, which eventually flow into
    Daihai Lake. In recent years, the area of Daihai Lake has decreased sharply, water
    quality has deteriorated, and the flora and fauna in and around the lake have
    diminished on a large scale. Consequently, the lake basin ecosystem is on the
    verge of collapse, and thus, efforts to conserve the Daihai Lake ecosystem are
    urgently required. Daihai Lake is located at the lowest elevation in the region.
    Furthermore, the Daihai Lake Basin is surrounded by Matou Mountain in the south,
    Manhan Mountain in the north, and a rifted basin in the centre. These mountainous
    ranges are inclined to the centre of the basin and are the main groundwater recharge
    areas consisting of harder gneisses and basalts. Cutting of mountain gullies exposes
    aquifers, thus, creating more springs in the mountains. The runoff area is majorly
    a slope plain near the foothills, mainly the middle and upper parts of the alluvial
    fan, and the aquifer comprises sand and gravel. Local groundwater is recharged
    by precipitation infiltration, lateral recharge in hilly areas, and infiltration
    recharge of surface water (floods and spring water). Groundwater movement changes
    according to the changes in lithology and hydraulic gradient. In the Daihai Lake
    shore area and the floodplain fan margin, the hydraulic gradient decreases. The
    aquifer mainly comprises Quaternary sandy soil, and the buried depth of the water
    level is relatively shallow; therefore, groundwater discharge is mainly through
    evaporation. Further, groundwater in this basin forms a complete hydrogeological
    unit from the mountain areas and piedmont gravel plains, which receive recharge
    from precipitation, to recharge runoff areas and the runoff discharge areas of
    the fine soil plains. Materials and methods Sample collection and analysis In
    consideration of the regional hydrogeological condition, groundwater flow field,
    lake morphology, and river-lake link, we selected 27 groundwater sites, 5 spring
    water sites, 3 river water sites, and 5 lake water sites, respectively, to carry
    out the sampling during the dry season (April) and wet season (July) of 2021 (Figure
    1). At each sampling sites, we used two clean polyethylene plastic bottles (500
    mL) rinsed thrice by the source water to collect samples, and then sealed to avoid
    air bubbles and transported back to the laboratory for further testing and analysis.
    The groundwater samples mainly originated from the pore water of quaternary loose
    rocks were taken from the free surface of civilian wells ranging from 6 to 60
    m depth. The collected water source was flowed for at least 10 min prior to water
    sampling to accurately reflect the groundwater at the position. Spring and river
    water samples were sampled at a depth of 0.2 m from the surface. Lake water were
    collected using 1.5 L plexiglass sampler at a depth of 0.5 m from the surface
    and at a depth of 0.5 m from the bottom to ensure reliability and validity of
    the data. During sampling, a global positioning system was used to accurately
    determine the geographical coordinates and elevation of the sampling site. pH
    and total dissolved solids (TDS) of the different water samples were measured
    on site using a WTW Multi 3630 multimeter (Germany) with measurement accuracies
    of ± 0.004 and ± 0.5%, respectively. Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+ concentrations were
    measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, SO42– concentration
    was determined by ion chromatography, and NO3– concentration was determined by
    UV–Vis spectrophotometry. Further, HCO3– concentration, Cl– concentration, and
    chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured by acid-base indicator titration, silver
    nitrate titration, and potassium permanganate titration, respectively. The specifc
    analytical methods and their resources and equipments were listed in Supplementary
    Table 1 in Supplementary material. The same sampling methods and instruments were
    used for all samples. The accuracies of the hydrochemical data were verified using
    the charge balance error ( CBE = ∣ ∣ ∑ Zm cation −∑ Zm anion ∣ ∣ ∑ Zm cation +∑
    Zm anion ×100% ). The CBE of all samples ranged from 0.04 to 5.59%, with a mean
    of 3.03%, which verified the reliability and accuracy of the data. Data analysis
    Data analysis process The general hydrochemical characteristics and types of water
    resources were determined using descriptive statistics and the Piper diagram.
    WQI was used to evaluate the potability of water, while EC, SAR, Na%, and PI were
    used to comprehensively evaluate the suitability of water for agricultural irrigation.
    The model recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA,
    1989) was used to assess the risk posed by groundwater NO3– to human health through
    groundwater consumption. Further, Gibbs diagrams and ion ratios were used to determine
    the main influencing factors controlling the hydrochemistry, ion sources, and
    hydrogeochemical processes. Evaluating the water quality for drinking WQI was
    used to evaluate the potability of water resources in the Daihai Lake Basin. Eleven
    water quality parameters were selected, namely, pH, TDS, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+,
    HCO3–, SO42–, Cl–, NO3–, and COD to calculate the WQI, as follows: W i = w i ∑
    n i =1 w i (1) q i = C i S i ×100(2) WQ I = ∑ i =1 n ( W i × q i )(3) where Wi
    is the relative weight and wi is the weight of each parameter. The weight range
    of water quality parameters was 2–5 (Supplementary Table 2 in Supplementary material),
    which has been verified in previous studies (Xiao et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2021).
    Further, n is the number of parameters, qi is the quality level of the ith parameter,
    Ci is the concentration of each parameter in each sample (mg/L, except for pH),
    and Si is the permissible value of each parameter. Considering the background
    conditions of water quality and the physical condition of the residents in China,
    this study adopted the guideline values of Drinking Water Quality of the People’s
    Republic of China (GB5749-2006) (Ministry of Health, 2006) as permissible values
    for drinking water parameters. The WQI values were divided into five classes:
    excellent (WQI < 25), good (25 < WQI < 50), moderate (50 < WQI < 100), poor (100
    < WQI < 150), and very poor (150 < WQI). Evaluating the water quality for irrigation
    The Daihai Lake Basin includes a large farmland area (Supplementary Figure 1 in
    Supplementary material) (Liang et al., 2021), and the water resources in the basin
    play an important role in agricultural development. Excessive salinity in irrigation
    water can cause soil salinisation, whereas high Na concentrations can cause soil
    alkalinisation, compaction, and reduced permeability (Abbasnia et al., 2018; Bouimouass
    et al., 2022). Therefore, EC, SAR, Na%, and PI were used to comprehensively evaluate
    the suitability of water for agricultural irrigation. Each indicator was calculated
    as follows: E C = 10 lo g TDS +0.215 1.0061 (4) SA R = N a + C a 2+ +M g 2+ 2
    − − − − − − − − √ (5) Na%= N a + + K + C a 2+ +M g 2+ +N a + + K + ×100(6) P I
    = N a + + HC O − 3 − − − − − − √ C a 2+ +M g 2+ +N a + + K + ×100(7) where the
    units of all cations and HCO3– are meq/L, and the units of EC, Na%, and PI are
    μs/cm, %, and %, respectively. Human health risk assessment HRA can quantitatively
    describe the impact of toxic substances in groundwater on human health (Xiao et
    al., 2022). The HRA model and criteria provided by the USEPA were used to assess
    the health risks of NO3– pollution in the groundwater of the Daihai Lake Basin
    to the local residents. As NO3– is a non-carcinogenic toxic substance and the
    risk assessment of toxic substances is based on the reference dose, this study
    adopted a non-carcinogenic HRA model, which can be calculated as follows: H Q
    = I CD D Rf (8) where HQ is the non-carcinogenic risk index (dimensionless), ICD
    is the average daily exposure dose of a non-carcinogenic substance (mg/kg/d) and
    is calculated according to the Eq. 9, and DRf is the reference dose of a specific
    non-carcinogen in groundwater (mg/kg/d). The non-carcinogenic risk threshold HQ
    recommended by the USEPA is 1. HQ values of < 1 and > 1 indicate that the non-carcinogenic
    health risk to humans caused by nitrogen pollution is within acceptable and unacceptable
    levels, respectively; thus, higher the HQ value, greater the non-carcinogenic
    health risks. NO3– in groundwater enters the human body mainly through drinking
    water. The average daily exposure dose (ICD) is calculated as follows (Qasemi
    et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2021): I CD = C ×I R ×E F ×ED B W ×AT (9) where C is
    the measured concentration of NO3– in groundwater (mg/L), IR is the drinking water
    rate (L/d), EF is the exposure frequency (d/a), which is the time of exposure
    in a year, ED is the duration of exposure (a), indicating the number of years
    that the human has consumed the toxic substance throughout its life, BW is the
    average body weight of the inhabitants (kg), and AT is the average exposure time
    (d), that is, the average time of exposure. Supplementary Table 3 in Supplementary
    material lists the parameters of the HRA model for groundwater NO3– used in this
    study. Results Hydrochemical composition The statistical results for the hydrochemical
    parameters are shown in the Table 1, Supplementary Table 4 in Supplementary material,
    and Figure 2. The average pH of the groundwater, spring water, river water, and
    lake water ranged from 8.03 to 9.19, indicating weakly alkaline water bodies in
    the Daihai Lake Basin. The average TDS values of groundwater, spring water, and
    river water were all less than 1000 mg/L, while the average TDS value of lake
    water was 23725 mg/L, indicating that the lake water was mainly salt water, whereas
    the other water bodies were fresh water. The orders of cation concentrations in
    groundwater, spring water, river water, and lake water were Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+
    > K+, Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, and Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > Ca2+,
    respectively, indicating that the dominant cations were Ca2+ (44.04%), Na+ (54.32%),
    Na+ (45.15%), and Na+ (94.22%), respectively, in the four sample types; furthermore,
    the orders of anion concentrations were HCO3–> Cl– > NO3– > SO42–, HCO3–> SO42–>
    Cl– > NO3–, HCO3–> Cl– > SO42−[cpsbreak]> NO3–, and Cl– > HCO3–> SO42–> NO3–,
    respectively, indicating that the dominant anions were HCO3– (74.31%), HCO3– (74.04%),
    HCO3– (79.48%), and Cl– (84.88%), respectively, in the four sample types. Marginal
    differences were observed in the ion concentrations between the dry and wet seasons
    in groundwater, spring water, and lake water, whereas the ion concentrations in
    the river water were higher in the dry season than in the wet season (Figure 2
    and Supplementary Table 4). Overall, the hydrochemical characteristics between
    the different water bodies showed some differences, with the exception of river
    water, which showed marginal seasonal variation. table 1 Table 1. Statistics of
    main chemical parameters of water in the Daihai Lake Basin. figure 2 Figure 2.
    Ion concentrations of in groundwater (A), spring water (B), river water (C), and
    lake water (D). The NO3– concentration in groundwater ranged from 2.25 to 167.83
    mg/L, with an average of 28.39 mg/L, and it exceeded the permissible limit (44.29
    mg/L) of the standards of Drinking Water Quality of the People’s Republic of China
    (GB5749-2006) (Ministry of Health, 2006) in 18.52% of the samples. However, the
    NO3– concentrations in the spring water, river water, and lake water were relatively
    low. The COD concentrations in groundwater, spring water, and river water were
    low, but they ranged from 19.8 to 24.75 mg/L, with an average of 22.05 mg/L, in
    lake water, thus, exceeding the permissible limit (3 mg/L) of the GB5749-2006
    standards (Ministry of Health, 2006) and the Class V limits (10 mg/L < COD ≤ 15
    mg/L) of the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water of the People’s
    Republic of China (GB3838-2002) (Ministry of Ecology and Environment, 2002). These
    results indicated severe organic pollution in Daihai Lake. Hydrochemical types
    RockWare AqQA software was applied to produce the Piper diagram for hydrochemistry
    during the dry and wet seasons (Figure 3). The groundwater, spring water, and
    river water samples were mainly distributed in Zone III, accounting for 81.48,
    80, and 83.33% of the samples, respectively, indicating that the hydrochemical
    types of these water were mainly HCO3–Ca•Mg type; further, some groundwater, spring
    water, and river water samples were distributed in Zone II (HCO3–Na type), accounting
    for 14.81, 20, and 16.67% of the samples, respectively, and a small proportion
    of groundwater samples were distributed in Zone I (SO4•Cl-Ca•Mg type), accounting
    for 3.7% of the samples. All the lake water samples were distributed in Zone IV,
    indicating that the hydrochemical type of the lake was Cl-Na type. figure 3 Figure
    3. Piper diagram of hydrochemistry in the Daihai Lake Basin. Water quality evaluation
    Drinking water quality assessment WQI was used to evaluate the potability of the
    water resources in the Daihai Lake Basin. The average WQI of groundwater was higher
    in the wet season (50) than in the dry season (46.71). Figure 4 shows that the
    proportions of good and moderate water quality of the groundwater samples were
    70.37 and 29.63% in the dry season, respectively, while they were 62.96 and 33.33%,
    respectively, in the wet season. Therefore, this indicates that the water quality
    was good and suitable for drinking in most parts of the Daihai Lake Basin. Notably,
    the proportion of good water quality of the groundwater samples decreased from
    the dry season (70.37%) to the wet season (62.96%), whereas an opposite trend
    was observed for the proportion of moderate water quality. In addition, during
    the wet season, groundwater samples were observed to have very poor quality. These
    results suggested that the groundwater quality decreased from the dry to wet season.
    The groundwater samples with poor water quality were distributed in Tiancheng.
    In addition, the good-quality groundwater samples were found in the recharge runoff
    areas in the piedmont, while the moderate-quality groundwater samples were scatted
    over the groundwater runoff discharge areas of the plain (Figure 4). figure 4
    Figure 4. Spatial distribution of water quality assessment results in dry (A)
    and wet (B) seasons in the Daihai Lake Basin. The spring water and river water
    samples in the dry and wet seasons showed good and moderate water quality, respectively,
    and the changes across the dry and wet seasons were stable, indicating that the
    spring water and river water qualities were good and suitable for drinking. Furthermore,
    all lake water samples in the dry and wet seasons showed very poor water quality,
    with an average WQI value of >800. Thus, the quality of the lake water was very
    poor, which made it unsuitable for drinking. The Na+ and Cl– concentrations in
    the lake water were 26.17 and 31.11 times higher than the standard values, respectively,
    and the concentrations of other ions were 0.12–9.87 times of the standard values,
    indicating that water quality in the lake was mainly affected by Na+ and Cl–.
    Irrigation water quality evaluation High ion concentrations in water affect the
    vegetation growth; therefore, estimating whether the water is suitable for irrigation,
    and ultimately crop growth, is necessary. The USSL diagram (USSL, 1954) was applied
    to analyse water salinity and determine whether the water was suitable for irrigation.
    Highly saline irrigation water is usually not conducive to water infiltration,
    and can consequently deteriorate soil quality. Figure 5A shows that most groundwater,
    spring water, and river water samples in the dry and wet seasons were distributed
    in the C2S1 and C3S1 zones, with the proportions of groundwater and spring water
    samples in the C2S1 zone being 20.37 and 30%, respectively, and the proportions
    of groundwater, spring water, and river water samples in the C3S1 zone being 79.63,
    50, and 100%, respectively. All lake water samples were distributed in the C4S4
    zone. Irrigation water with high Na+ content reduces soil fertility. Wilcox (1955)
    classified irrigation water quality based on Na% and EC. According to this classification,
    most groundwater, spring water, and river water samples in the dry and wet seasons
    were distributed in the excellent to good and good to permissible zones (Figure
    5B). Specifically, the proportions of groundwater and spring water samples in
    the excellent to good zone were 20.37 and 30%, respectively, while the proportions
    of groundwater, spring water, and river water samples in the good to permissible
    zone were 62.96, 50, and 83.33%, respectively. However, all lake water samples
    were distributed in the unsuitable zone. Doneen (1964) classified water quality
    into three categories according to the PI. Accordingly, most groundwater, spring
    water, and river water samples, accounting for 75.93, 60, and 100%, respectively,
    in the dry season and wet season were distributed in the Class I zone, while all
    lake water samples were distributed in the Class II zone (Figure 5C). In summary,
    groundwater, spring water, and river water in the dry and wet seasons were suitable
    as water sources for agricultural irrigation, while lake water, which showed poor
    irrigation water quality, was extremely unsuitable for irrigation. figure 5 Figure
    5. Classification of irrigation water quality in the Daihai Lake Basin according
    to USSL (A), Wilcox (B), and PI (C). Health risk assessment of NO3– NO3– pollution
    of groundwater has become an increasingly common phenomenon, especially in areas
    with developed agricultural and animal husbandry sectors (Liu et al., 2022). Long-term
    drinking of such NO3–-contaminated groundwater can lead to methemoglobinemia,
    cancer of the digestive system, and blue baby syndrome (Gao et al., 2020; Wang
    and Li, 2022). The results of this study showed high NO3– concentrations in the
    groundwater in the Daihai Lake Basin. Therefore, the HRA model and criteria provided
    by the USEPA were used to evaluate the health risks of NO3– in groundwater to
    local residents. The corresponding HRA results showed that the HQ of children
    and adults in the dry season ranged from 0.08 to 3.12 and 0.05 to 1.92, respectively,
    with mean values of 0.82 and 0.5, respectively, whereas in the wet season, it
    ranged from 0.07 to 5.24 and 0.04 to 3.23, respectively, with the mean values
    of 0.96 and 0.59, respectively. The proportion of groundwater samples with HQ
    <1 was 77.78 and 74.07% for children during the dry and wet seasons, respectively,
    whereas for adults, the proportion of groundwater samples with HQ <1 was 88.89
    and 85.19%, respectively (Figure 6). This indicated that groundwater in most areas
    posed an acceptable health risk for children and adults. However, in the wet and
    dry seasons, areas with HQ >1 for children and adults were mainly distributed
    in Tiancheng and northern Maihutu, indicating that the groundwater in these areas
    posed an unacceptable risk to the health of children and adults. Notably, the
    mean HQ value and the proportion of groundwater samples with HQ >1 were higher
    for children and adults in the wet season than in the dry season, indicating that
    the risk of NO3– in the groundwater in the wet season was higher than that in
    the dry season. Additionally, NO3– in groundwater showed a significantly larger
    spatial distribution of health risks to children than to adults. figure 6 Figure
    6. Spatial distribution of the results of health risk assessment of groundwater
    NO3– in the Daihai Lake Basin for children during the dry season (A), adults during
    the dry season (B), children during the wet season (C), and adults during the
    wet season (D). Discussion Natural factors influencing water quality The Gibbs
    diagram is widely used to analyse the main factors controlling hydrochemical composition
    and evolution (Gibbs, 1970; Zhou et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2020). Figure 7 shows
    that all groundwater, spring water, and river water sampling points were located
    in the area of rock weathering dominance, indicating that rock weathering majorly
    controlled the water chemistry of these water bodies. Further, continuous leaching
    of groundwater, spring water, and river water during runoff caused the dissolution
    of minerals through water-rock interaction, thereby contributing to the chemical
    composition in the water. Abundant precipitation and increased leaching during
    the wet season raised the ion concentrations in the groundwater and the proportion
    of pollutants entering the groundwater through precipitation infiltration, consequently,
    resulting in relatively poor groundwater quality, especially in the Tiancheng.
    In addition, in the groundwater recharge runoff areas, where groundwater flow
    was faster and hydrodynamic conditions were stronger, continuous leaching resulted
    in the removal of salt ions and pollutants from the stratum, while the opposite
    was true in the groundwater runoff discharge areas. Therefore, the groundwater
    quality in the recharge runoff areas were better than that in the runoff discharge
    areas. Further, all lake water sampling points were located in the area of evaporation
    dominance, indicating that evaporation mainly influenced the lake water chemistry.
    Precipitation, groundwater, and river water were the main sources of water recharge
    to the lake. During groundwater and river water runoff, the hydrochemical ions
    from upstream continued to accumulate in the lake. In addition, because Daihai
    Lake is a closed inland lake in a semi-arid region, lake water was not leached
    throughout the year, but was lost through evaporation (Zhao et al., 2020). Therefore,
    continuous evaporation resulted in the saturation and eventually precipitation
    of the carbonate ions, and the concentrations of Na+ and Cl– gradually increased.
    figure 7 Figure 7. Gibbs diagram (A,B) of hydrochemistry in the Daihai Lake Basin.
    The main hydrochemical process can be further determined by calculating the ratio
    of cations to anions in water (Yang et al., 2016; Bouimouass et al., 2022). For
    example, during the dissolution of halite, the ratio of Na+ to Cl– is 1:1 (Xiao
    et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2020). Figure 8A shows that most groundwater, spring
    water, and river water samples fell above the y = x line, indicating that the
    Cl– was not available in sufficient proportion to balance Na+ possibly because
    of the weathering and dissolution of silicate rocks or cation exchange. Generally,
    halite dissolution causes water sampling points to be on the y = x line (Rajmohan
    and Elango, 2004; Xiao et al., 2021). Consistent with this previous finding, the
    lake water sampling points were distributed around the y = x line (Figure 8A),
    suggesting that Na+ and Cl– in the lake water were influenced by the dissolution
    of halite. Figure 8B shows that most groundwater, spring water, and river water
    sampling points were distributed below the y = x line, indicating that the weathering
    and dissolution of silicate rocks majorly affected the hydrochemical components
    of groundwater, spring water, and river water (Yang et al., 2016). However, the
    lake water sampling points were distributed on both sides of the y = x line. The
    ratio of (Ca2++ Mg2+) to HCO3– can reflect the influences of weathering and dissolution
    of carbonate rocks, such as calcite and dolomite, on the hydrochemistry (Zhou
    et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2020). Figure 8C shows that the groundwater, spring
    water, river water, and lake water sampling points were mainly distributed near
    the y = x line and between the y = x line and the 2y = x line, indicating that
    the weathering and dissolution of carbonate rocks were the main sources of Ca2+,
    Mg2+, and HCO3– in these water bodies. Moreover, the dissolution of gypsum can
    release equivalent amounts of Ca2+ and SO42– in water (Liu et al., 2021). Figure
    8D shows that all groundwater, spring water, river water, and lake water sampling
    points deviated from the y = x line, indicating that Ca2+ and SO42– in these water
    bodies were not affected by the dissolution of gypsum. figure 8 Figure 8. Ion
    ratios of the water bodies in Daihai Lake Basin: (A) Cl– vs. Na+, (B) ( HCO −
    3 + SO42–) vs. (Ca2+ + Mg2 +), (C) HCO − 3 vs. (Ca2+ + Mg2 +), (D) SO42– vs. Ca2+,

    vs. (Ca2+ + Mg2 + – HCO − 3 – SO42–), and (H) CAI-1 vs. CAI-2. In the Daihai Lake
    Basin, the groundwater is mainly contained in a Quaternary aquifer composed of
    sand pebbles and gravel and the lithology is mainly silicate and carbonate rocks.
    Further, the relationship between the molar ratios of Ca2+/Na+ versus Mg2+/Na+
    and Ca2+/Na+ versus HCO3–/Na+ can be used to identify the effect of different
    types of the water-rock interactions on the hydrochemical components (Gaillardet
    et al., 1999). As shown in Figures 8E,F, most groundwater, spring water, and river
    water sampling points were located in the silicate control zone and between the
    silicate and carbonate control zones, indicating that the chemical components
    of these three water bodies were mainly affected by the weathering and dissolution
    of silicate and carbonate. Thus, the regional geological background considerably
    influenced the hydrochemical composition. Comparatively, the lake water sampling
    points deviated from the silicate and carbonate control zones and were relatively
    close to the evaporite control zone, indicating that the chemical components of
    the lake water were influenced by the weathering and dissolution of evaporites.
    In addition, as Daihai Lake is a closed inland lake in a semi-arid region, evaporation
    and concentration have influenced the chemical components of the lake water for
    long periods, which in turn has increased the concentration of salt ions in the
    lake water (Zhao et al., 2020). Cation exchange has a major impact on the chemical
    composition of water. The relationship between Ca2++Mg2+-HCO3–-SO42– versus Na++K+-Cl–
    can be applied to identify whether cation exchange occurs in water. If it does,
    the ratio will show a negative correlation, with a slope of –1 (Su et al., 2017;
    Wang et al., 2022b). Moreover, the chlor-alkali index (CAI) can indicate whether
    positive or negative cation exchange occurs in water, as shown in Eqs. 10 and
    11 (Abboud, 2018; Wang et al., 2022b). If CAI > 0, Na+ (K+) in the water is replaced
    by Ca2+ (Mg2+) in the aquifer, whereas if CAI < 0, Ca2+ (Mg2+) in the water is
    replaced by Na+ (K+) in the aquifer. As shown in the Figure 8G, most sampling
    points of groundwater, spring water, and river water, except lake water, were
    distributed on the y = –x line, indicating that cation exchange considerably impacts
    the hydrochemical composition of the corresponding water bodies. Figure 8H shows
    that most water sampling points of the groundwater, spring water, and river water
    were distributed in the zone where CAI < 0, indicating positive cation exchange
    (Eq. 12) in the corresponding water bodies, and when the Na+ content increased,
    Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents decreased. Overall, the hydrochemical compositions of groundwater,
    spring water, and river water in the Daihai Lake Basin were mainly influenced
    by rock weathering and cation exchange, which is consistent with the results of
    Zhang (2020), indicating that natural conditions were the dominant factors in
    the hydrochemical compositions of these water bodies. Consequently, under the
    influence of natural factors, the groundwater in the Daihai Lake Basin was mainly
    weak alkaline with the major hydrochemical type of HCO3–Ca•Mg, which was in line
    with the results of Zhang et al. (2021) and Wang (2021). Furthermore, the hydrochemical
    compositions and chemical characteristics of spring water, river water, and groundwater
    and their influencing factors were almost consistent, suggesting a close hydraulic
    connection among three water bodies, which agreed with the statements of Wang
    et al. (2017) and Zhang (2020). Moreover, our evaluation results showed that the
    lake water quality was very poor, which is similar with the results of the water
    quality evaluation using nutrient parameters reported by Liang et al. (2021),
    Zhao et al. (2020), and Wang et al. (2019), indicating that Daihai Lake has been
    seriously polluted. Besides, we found that the chemical ions in the lake water
    were mainly influenced by natural factors like evaporation and evaporites, however,
    the nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus were largely affected by anthropogenic
    activities, suggesting the different pollution ways and mechanisms. CAI- 1 = C

    factors influencing water quality Rapid and continuous socioeconomic development
    and urbanisation, and population explosion negatively influence the aquatic environment
    (Gao et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021). Anthropogenic activities usually result
    in the increase of concentration of chemical components in water; particularly,
    NO3– mainly originates from domestic sewage and agricultural production (Liu et
    al., 2021; Wang and Li, 2022). The molar ratios of NO3–/Na+ versus Cl–/Na+ can
    be used as an index to review the effect of anthropogenic activities on water
    bodies (Xiao et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2021). Generally, these molar ratios are
    high in polluted water. Figure 9 shows that agricultural activities were an important
    source of NO3– in groundwater. The Daihai Lake Basin includes large cultivated
    land and grassland areas, along with extensive animal husbandry sectors (Supplementary
    Figure 1). The total cumulative area of cultivated land and grassland accounts
    for 61.28–67.91% of the total basin area, of which the cultivated land accounts
    for the largest proportion (30.87–45.88%) (Liang et al., 2021), indicating intensive
    agricultural activities in the Daihai Lake Basin. Thus, excessive application
    of nitrogen fertilisers (e.g., NaNO3 and KNO3) and manure could increase the NO3–
    concentration in groundwater (Mao et al., 2021). Furthermore, widespread distribution
    of rural areas resulted in the high-density population (Supplementary Figure 1),
    producing a large amount of untreated domestic wastewater containing high concentration
    of nitrate nitrogen and affecting NO3– concentration directly or indirectly (Liu
    et al., 2021). In particular, attention should be paid to Tiancheng and areas
    to the north of Maihutu, where NO3– pollution was relatively serious. Spring water
    and river water were relatively less affected by agricultural activities, whereas
    lake water was affected by weathering and dissolution of evaporites. figure 9
    Figure 9. Plot of Cl–/Na+ vs. NO3–/Na+. Agricultural activities considerably influence
    NO3– concentration in the groundwater in the Daihai Lake Basin. Although the health
    risk of groundwater NO3– to humans was low in most areas, areas with high local
    HQ and seasonal changes were also observed. Therefore, prevention and risk management
    of groundwater pollution still need to be further strengthened. Study limitations
    and future work This study has addressed the water quality and its influencing
    factors of different water bodies in the Daihai Lake Basin during the dry and
    wet seasons up to certain extent. However, the formation of water chemical ions
    depends on hydrochemical evolution processes undergoing over space and time, which
    has an important impact on water quality (Yang et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2020).
    Future study could increase the numbers of monitoring sites and conduct the long-term
    monitoring to obtain more accurate data and reveal the hydrochemical evolution.
    Our study showed that groundwater in some areas of the Daihai Lake Basin has been
    polluted. Therefore, the dynamic monitoring of groundwater quality should be strengthened
    in the future, with emphasis on the prevention and control of agricultural non-point
    sources of NO3– pollution and effective management of domestic sewage. Further,
    awareness among the citizens regarding the conservation of groundwater quality
    should be promoted to reduce the associated human health risk. In addition, replenishing
    water to Daihai Lake can improve the water quality to a certain extent due to
    the dilution of the pollutants, so the continuous hydrochemical researches should
    be conducted to ensure the efficiency of diversion engineering. Conclusion The
    present study highlighted the water quality and influencing factors of different
    water bodies in the Daihai Lake Basin using hydrochemical methods. The groundwater,
    spring water, and river water in the dry and wet seasons were mainly weakly alkaline
    fresh water, and their hydrochemical types were mainly HCO3–Ca•Mg, whereas the
    lake water was weakly alkaline salt water, with a hydrochemical type of Cl-Na.
    Except lake water, groundwater, spring water, and river water were suitable for
    drinking and agricultural irrigation applications, but the groundwater quality
    in the wet season was worse than that in the dry season. Further, high Na+ and
    Cl– concentrations were the main pollution factors affecting the lake water quality.
    Although 18.52% of the groundwater samples had high NO3– concentrations, the HRA
    showed that groundwater in most areas posed an acceptable risk to human health,
    whereas the areas with unacceptable risk were mainly located in Tiancheng and
    north Maihutu. Rock (silicate and carbonate rocks) weathering and cation exchange
    were the dominant factors in the hydrochemical compositions of groundwater, spring
    water, and river water, and agricultural activities were the main sources of NO3–
    in groundwater. Moreover, the hydrochemical composition of the lake water was
    mainly affected by evaporation and halite dissolution. These results indicated
    that the management of the water resources in the Daihai Lake Basin should be
    strengthened to control and mitigate the NO3– pollution of groundwater and salinisation
    of Daihai Lake. Data availability statement The original contributions presented

  description: Urban nature-based solutions (NBS) are considered cost-effective actions
    to address several social, economic and environmental challenges. Green roofs
    represent one of the most important NBS of the urban green spaces. Since 2018
    we are studying technical aspect of a green roof system having focused on i) waste
    and recyclable materials, ii) types and adaptability of Mediterranean plants,
    and iii) water quality and storm water runoff control. The technological installation
    was carried out on a flat terrace in an industrial site of Livorno, using a light
    substrate of lapillus, pumice and compost and applying temperature sensors and
    a rainwater recovery system. Green roof was divided into two prototypes differentiated
    exclusively for the shrub Mediterranean species planted, with green or grey leaves.
    Temperature monitoring was performed using three data loggers to record both the
    external temperature and that under each vegetation type. The system was effective
    in thermal regulation, keeping the underlying environment cooler by about 3-4°C
    during the thermal peak and warmer by the same amount at the minimum external
    temperatures, with light variability due to substrate humidity and leaves colour
    (albedo). All species resulted suitable to the site and substrate, with low management
    (only one fertilization a year and emergency irrigations in summer). Among species,
    Helichrysum italicum and Rosmarinus officinalis showed the highest CO2 uptake
    capacity, while Thymus vulgaris maintained higher transpiration rates. Senecio
    cineraria and Helichrysum italicum showed the highest instantaneous water-use
    efficiency and electron transport rate, respectively. The analyses of rainfall,
    very scarce over the two years, revealed low levels of heavy metals before and
    after the substrate leaching. The results highlighted that not only this system
    allowed to reach environmental improvement, but also brought to a decrease of
    the loads bearing on the structure, suggesting to consider them in term of the
    sustainability for building engineering and architecture.

    mapping for aiding site-specific management practices in the West Nile Delta,
    Egypt Article Open access 23 November 2023 Introduction Agriculture is a major
    contributor to Egypt''s economy, and it stands to profit from Big Data''s broad
    possibilities. The Nile Valley and Delta have limited natural resources, so there
    is a need to reclaim new land as a result of the increased demand for food (Khanal
    et al. 2020; Nikiel, and Eltahir 2021; Radwan et al. 2019; Radwan 2019).The study
    area is one of the ancient reclaimed areas in the eastern delta. For a better
    living, soil is the most significant natural resource. The importance of soil
    is mainly due to its suitability for agriculture as a source of food in addition
    to other human activities (Foley et al. 2011; Akpoti et al. 2019; Kalichkin et
    al. 2021). Soil is an important and essential natural resource for life and a
    key input into all development efforts (İmamoglu, and Dengiz 2019; Santos-Francés
    et al. 2022). Preserving and improving soil resources originally depends on building
    an integrated land resource base that includes soil capacity, soil condition,
    quality, degree of fertility and suitability for the type of irrigation used (Ebhuoma
    et al. 2022; Tolche et al. 2021; Salman et al. 2019, 2021; Koch et al. 2013; McBratney
    et al. 2014). Although traditional mapping methods are used, there is a clear
    need to obtain more accurate soil data using other methods, which is of great
    interest (Kimsey et al. 2020). Because the expense of gathering new data at a
    finer scale is so costly, it is required to perform a survey to establish the
    demands of soil mapping applications (Richer-de-Forges and Arrouays 2010, De Feudis
    et al. 2021). Furthermore, there is a major misalignment between the themes now
    covered by accessible soil maps and the needs of end users. For the generation
    of new soil information, certain priorities have been established in terms of
    geographic habitats and settings, soil attributes, spatial resolution of maps,
    and the use of uncertainty estimations (Kairis et al. 2020). Digital soil mapping
    has been highlighted as a technology that can bridge the gap between economic,
    scientific, and practical concerns, but it requires focused capacity building
    activities (Antoni et al. 2019) Finally, the need to consider user demands to
    increase the contribution of the new era of digital soil mapping requires the
    creation of a business model for soil security (Arrouays et al. 2014). For studying
    environmental challenges, the availability of remotely sensed data and related
    applications, such as RS indices, help for natural resource monitoring and assessing
    ecosystem change trends (Asokan and Anitha 2019; Salman et al. 2021). Remote sensing
    (RS) is a well-documented technique for mapping and monitoring areas over a large
    area (Ahmad and Pandey 2018; Maurya et al. 2021). Integrating RS data with Geographical
    Information System (GIS) results in highly accurate and relevant information in
    combination with data collected from the field survey. This combination helps
    in the instantaneous interpretation of the phenomena under study and thus helps
    in a good and flexible management (Goetz et al. 2009). The geotechnical (geomatics)
    properties of soils are important parameters to sketch better soil properties
    (Mohameed and Hussein 2020; Koç 2022). These geotechnical properties can be grouped
    into the physical and chemical properties of the soil (Xiao-hui et al. 2012).
    In general, the geology in the region is the main and determining factor for these
    characteristics. While physicochemical properties are mostly used in the calculations
    of general properties of soil, such as fertility and soil quality. The selection
    of soil properties were based on the cost for the testing and soil type. Many
    environmental modelling studies require collecting of information on soil hydraulic
    properties (Van Looy et al. 2017). Most of the time, measured data on soil water
    retention or hydraulic conductivity is unavailable for environmental modelling
    on a territorial or national size. The thorough analyses on the prediction of
    soil hydraulic properties began in the 1980s (Ahuja et al. 1985; Pachepsky et
    al. 1982; Rawls and Brakensiek 1982; Saxton et al. 1986; Vereecken et al. 1989).
    The availability and continual updating of data, as well as the development of
    new statistical approaches, aid in improving prediction performance (pedotransfer
    functions—PTFs). Zhang and Schaap (2017), McNeill et al. (2018), and Román Dobarco
    et al. (2019) among others of latest works include, Geostatistics have proven
    to be effective prediction techniques in general (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil
    2006; Caruana et al. 2008; Olson et al. 2018). These methods are used to derive
    values, with built-in randomization; it can predict multiple individual locations.
    Geostatistics provide average values for groups that can be displayed geographically.
    Because these approaches for giving estimations have been developed, they do not
    derive any odd values; thus, projections will always be reasonable. It has been
    proven that often, but not always, the greater the number of samples collected
    to predict the more accurate the results. (Cichota et al. 2013; Baker and Ellison
    2008; Wu et al. 2018; Nussbaum et al. 2018). Accuracy, interpretation and computational
    ability are required to be used in the geographical forecasting methods (Hengl
    et al. 2017). The model should be able to reconcile various soil texture classification
    schemes (Cisty et al. 2015) and soil bulk density prediction (Chen et al. 2018;
    Dharumarajan et al. 2017; Ramcharan et al. 2017; Sequeira et al. 2014; Souza et
    al. 2016) However, they have not been widely used to extract input parameters
    for hydrological modelling (Koestel and Jorda 2014; Tóth et al. 2014). Adhikari
    et al. (2014) found that kriging was a good method for mapping soil organic carbon
    concentration. The similar thing was noticed by Matos-Moreira et al. (2017) were
    appropriate for this purpose for mapping the phosphorus concentration. Behrens
    et al. (2018) found that a lot of state-of-the-art research is being done on digital
    soil mapping utilizing geostatistical approaches (i.e., geographically weighted
    regression, regression kriging, and ordinary kriging). Hengl et al. (2018) found
    that universal kriging is a powerful method for soil mapping. Soil hydraulic maps
    are mostly created in one of two ways: (i) by applying pedotransfer functions
    (PTFs) to existing soil and/or environmental maps, which is known as an indirect
    mapping method; (ii) using direct spatial inference of observation point data,
    which is known as a direct mapping method (Bouma 1989), which is considered a
    direct procedure. PTFs can be used to measure or predict point data. Several researches
    looked into the effectiveness of geostatistical approaches for mapping water retention
    at different matric potentials. (Farkas et al. 2008) and saturated hydraulic conductivity
    (Motaghian and Mohammadi 2011; Xu et al. 2017). Ferrer Julià et al. (2004) used
    procedures (i) and (ii) to map soil hydraulic conductivity at 1 km resolution
    over the Spanish area of the Iberian Peninsula (ii). They discovered that the
    kriging interpolation map was the most effective. Farkas et al. (2008) used geostatistical
    methods to map water content at field capacity and wilting point for a 1483-hectare
    region. They were able to optimize the sampling density required to generate 10
    m resolution soil hydraulic maps for their research site. In most cases, there
    is insufficient point data to apply geostatistical approaches; as a result, soil
    hydraulic maps were constructed in various investigations using a PTF applied
    to readily available spatial soil data (Dai et al. 2013; Marthews et al. 2014;
    Chaney et al. 2016; Tóth et al. 2017; Montzka et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2018). Montzka
    et al. (2017) provided a possible calculation of the prediction uncertainty for
    modelling tasks, this information for the spatial variability of soil hydraulic
    properties help to better describe extreme conditions. The available input information-environmental
    changes and the predicted soil hydraulic property effect on the root mean square
    error (RMSE) of predicting soil water retention, when RMSE values of published
    PTFs are usually between 0.02 and 0.07 cm3. The main objective of this study is
    to measure the properties of the soil in the study area, and its spatial diversity.
    A combination of traditional analytical methods and geostatistical methods were
    used to analyze the data for spatial variance. This study focused on the correlations
    between statistical data, GIS data and RS data based on soil data collected from
    different locations in the field study. Thus, this data is quickly available and
    can be valuable and provide suggestions for farmers and planners. Materials and
    methods Field description of the study area The study area (Fig. 1) is the agricultural
    land of The Sixth of October Agricultural Projects Company, which is an Egyptian
    joint stock company Established in 1998, with an area of 13,565.95 hectares (32,558.3
    acres) Working in the field of agricultural and animal production, the company
    is located in the Ismailia Governorate. The company’s lands are irrigated with
    the water of the Nile River from the Ismailia Canal, and it uses modern irrigation
    methods (pivot irrigation–drip irrigation). It produces most types of vegetables
    and fruits (peanuts, potatoes, green and dry onions, sweet pepper, cucumber, beans,
    carrots, silage corn, alfalfa, citrus fruits, navel orange, mandarin, grapes,
    peaches, pears, apricots, and dates) (Fig. 2). The company is contracting with
    others in contractual crops. It also leases parts of its lands to produce crops
    and vegetables under pivot irrigation (Fig. 3). Fig. 1 Location of the study area
    and soil sampling sites Full size image Fig. 2 Maps of different irrigation systems
    in the study area Full size image Fig. 3 different crop types in the study area
    of winter season 2020 Full size image The region is located western of Ismailia
    Governorate, between longitudes 31° 54′ 33''–32° 3′40''/E and latitudes 30°22′10''–32°1′12''/N.
    It is part of the Salheya plain, which forms the eastern side of the Nile Delta
    (Fig. 1). The plain''s climatic conditions are comparable to those seen in Egypt''s
    northern regions. Because it is arid to semi-arid, groundwater quality is critical.
    It is a river plain that stretches from the Nile Delta''s farmed plains eastward
    to the Suez Canal. The Tamilat Valley, which stretches from the Nile Delta to
    the west, almost east of Ismailia, runs along the southern boundary of the Salheya
    plain. Sand and gravel cover the plain''s surface, which has been evolved into
    a typical desert pavement (Geostrazivanjie 1965). Loose quartizitic gravels, sands,
    aeolian sands, sand dunes, superficial deposits, sabakhas, and fluviatile and
    fluviomarine deposits are all found in these Quaternary sediments, which cover
    a large area. As coarse sand and flinty pebbles of igneous fragments, the early
    Pleistocene layers (ancient deltaic deposits) predominate. (Gad 1995). In the
    area northeast of Cairo, Tertiary deposits are documented in the subsurface as
    Pliocene sandy limestone and marl dolomite (El-Haddad 2002). According to the
    field survey in 2020, the study region has two types of soils: sandy soil with
    small particles of frozen rock and clay soil with large particles of frozen rock.
    Sandy soils are among the worst for plant growth, because they are deficient in
    nutrients and have a limited water-holding capacity, making it difficult for plant
    roots to absorb water. This sort of soil is excellent for sewage treatment. The
    crushing of rocks such as limestone and quartz produces sandy soils. Silt soil,
    which is larger than clay and contains rock and other mineral particles, has significantly
    smaller particles than sandy soil. The smooth and fine texture of the soil is
    what allows it to hold water better than sand. In comparison to sandy soil, it
    is more fruitful. Climate The average air temperature is 21.2 °C, and the area
    receives an inconsistent annual precipitation rate of 40 mm/year (Embaby et al.
    2017). The soil temperature regime is \"Thermic\" and the moisture regime is \"Torric\"
    according to these climate conditions. Entisols and Aridisols are the two most
    common soil types in the area. The entire area has been reclaimed during the last
    two decades and is currently being planted with a variety of fruits and vegetables.
    Table 1 and Fig. 4 show that the region''s climate falls under the arid climate
    range. The area has a hot desert climate as the rest of Egypt (Climate 2013, 2014),
    with highs usually not surpassing 35 °C in the summer. Only 40 mm of rain falls
    on the area during an average year, and most of this falls in the winter months.
    The area experiences its hottest temperatures in July and August, with a maximum
    average of 34.4 °C. Winter temperatures are normally in the range of 7.7 °C at
    nights to 18.5 °C in the daytime. Table 1 Climate data for El Salheya El Gedida

    Full size image Data sampling methodology The data points were collected randomly
    on July and August, 2020 with distances among neighboring points were designed
    to be ranged from minimum 300 m to maximum 2 km (Fig. 5). The design of this slope
    distances is probably distributed uniformly, which met the geo-statistical interpolation
    methods requirement. The depth of the soil samples was determined by the difference
    in layers as well as the profile depths. The surface layers of all profiles were
    interpolated, and the interpretation of soils was defined using the weighted average
    of all profile layers. Fig. 5 Soil samples location Full size image Soil data
    analysis (EC, pH, soil texture and organic matter analyses) Texture is the main
    factor in soil water holding capacity and drainage properties, root development
    and more, it can significantly affect the movement rate of nutrients and pesticides
    through the soil pores. The determination of soil texture operated using the Bouyoucos
    hydrometer method (Bouyoucos 1962). The hydrometer measures the quantity of each
    particle fraction, sand, silt and clay in suspension based on Stokes law to determine
    the soil texture. In addition, Electrical Conductivity (EC) and pH soil reaction
    were determined based on Soil survey laboratory manual (USDA 2003). Soil carbon
    represented by organic matter is usually the most significance component in the
    soils as it has an impact on most of the soil properties. The determination of
    soil organic carbon operated using the Walkley–Black method (USDA 2003). For each
    soil sample, 1-g soil was treated with 10 ml of 0.167 M potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)
    solution, 20 ml concentrated sulphuric acid 98% (H2SO4), 200 ml water for dilution,
    10 ml concentrated phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and titrated by 0.5 M ammonium ferrous
    sulphate ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2⋅6H2O) using Ferroin (Ortho-Phenanthroline–Ferrous Complex)
    as an indicator. Interpolation methods The following equation is used for IDW
    and kriging interpolation methods are well discussed by Yao et al. (2013): $${Z}^{*}\\left({X}_{0}\\right)=
    \\sum\\nolimits _{i=1}^{n}{w}_{i}Z({x}_{i})$$ (1) where The Z (xi) data value
    of locations which used to generate the variable Z value of at x0 the unsampled
    location, Z (xi) value is assigned by the weight wi, n is the number of the used
    closest neighboring data points for estimation: $${w}_{i}=\\frac{1/{d}_{i}^{2}}
    {{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n} 1/{d}_{i}^{2}}$$ (2) \\({d}_{i}\\) is the distance between
    the estimated point and the observed point: $$\\upgamma \\left(\\mathrm{h}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2n}
    \\sum\\nolimits _{i=1}^{n}[Z\\left({x}_{i}\\right)-Z\\left({x}_{i}\\right)+h){]}^{2}$$
    (3) xi and xi + h are sampling locations separated by a distance h, and Z(xi)
    and Z(xi + h) are the observed values of variable Z at the corresponding locations.
    The least squares method which was used to estimate the linear regression is the
    following equation: $$y={B}_{0}+{\\left(x+a\\right)}^{n}= \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}{B}_{i}{X}_{i}$$

    It has a swath width of Sentinel-2 is 290 km covering the whole study area. The
    specifications of the satellite sensor described in table (2). The data was radiometrically
    and atmospherically corrected and then vegetation indices were derived using the
    Sentinel application platform (SNAP) as described by Gascon and Fabrizzio (2017).
    Then, a wide range of biophysical indices were implemented in the current study
    to state the crop variations. Weighted Difference Vegetation Index (WDVI) (Hancock

    (FAO 2007), according to this system, soils of the study area were classified
    into the existed classes. In addition, the maximum limitation factor is used in
    several techniques to qualitatively characterize land suitability classes for
    a specific land use. Simple matching tables, such as the ones below, are utilized
    in certain situations (Table 1). Making the suitability class ratings reliant
    on more than one limiting land attribute allows for refinement. As a result, more
    complicated rating tables or diagrams are produced (Stomph et al. 1994; de la
    Rosa and van Diepen 2002) Results and discussion Calculated vegetation indices
    The results of biophysical parameters showed significant variations between different
    indices (Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). ARVI had the highest variation with maximum
    value 3.63 and minimum value − 0.56; SAVI and MSAVI ranged from − 0.23 to 0.68
    with an average about 0.22, MCARI ranged from − 0.096 to 0.45 while GNDVI and
    TNDVI varied from − 0.40 to 0.68. Fig. 6 Maps of average vegetation indices calculated

    image The maps of Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 reveal that the agriculture processes
    is established in using pivots and drip irrigation system. The results of soil
    indices indicated spatiotemporal variations between different indices. Soil BI
    and BI2 had the highest variation with maximum value 0.70 and minimum value 0.05;
    the high BI values are indicative of excess soil moisture and the presence of
    salts in soil surface. RI ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0020 with an average about 0.0011,
    CI varied from -0.30 to 0.25. Low soil CI values indicate the presence of a high
    concentration of carbonates or sulfates in the study area. The role of the brightness
    index is to identify the reflectance of soil and to highlight the vegetal cover
    of bare areas. In addition, BI used to describe the surface condition of the soil,
    especially in arid and semi-arid regions (Escadafal et al. 1994; Escadafal and
    Bacha 1996). However, in arid and semi-arid environments, the monitoring of vegetation
    cover is a very important regional indicator for controlling land degradation
    processes. The BI produced strongly conclusive results in terms of the distinction
    between the different soil conditions. This index proved its discriminatory powers
    that have already been reported in the literature (Bannari et al. 2008; Haboudane
    et al. 2002). It can be clearly observed that the slightly degraded soils are
    associated with high values of the blue level of 0.06 in Fig. 7, which characterize
    the presence of the modern agricultural activities, in particular. The moderately
    degraded soils have intermediate values. However, the highly degraded soils are
    distinguished by the red level values that characterize the presence of absorption
    bands of limestone and recent formations (sand) in particular, which are considered
    as implicit indicators of soil degradation (Figs. 7 and 8). CI is used to extract
    information concerning the organic matter content and mineralogical composition
    of the soil (Okaingni et al. 2010; StéphaneKoff et al. 2016; Maimouni and Bannari
    2011).). The CI is a simple standardized ratio of red and blue bands, has been
    developed by various authors (Escadafal and Pouget 1987) In addition, the soils
    are intimately related to the variation of their color and brightness. In terms
    of distinguishing between the various soil conditions, the CI generated highly
    conclusive results. This index demonstrated its discriminatory abilities, which
    have been previously documented in the literature (Bannari et al. 2008; Haboudane
    et al. 2002). The slightly deteriorated soils are clearly related with the values
    of the blue level of − 0.3 in Fig. 9, which represent the characteristics of current
    agricultural activities in particular. Intermediate values are found in moderately
    deteriorated soils. The presence of absorption bands of recent formations (sand)
    in particular, which are viewed as implicit indicators of soil degradation, distinguishes
    highly degraded soils with red level values of 0.25. (Fig. 9). RI used as one
    of the indicators to evaluate the mineralogy of soils, including the iron content
    (Ray et al. 2014; Escadafal and Huete 1991; Mandal 2016). It shows (Fig. 10) that
    compact soils are mostly present in the southern part of the study area, where
    soils are completely bare. The low values of the CI coincide with the high values
    of the RI and correspond to the densely vegetated spaces, which are, therefore,
    rich in organic matter. On the other hand, spaces with a low RI have high values
    of BI, which indicates low soil moisture and a prominent level of drought and
    soil salinity. Furthermore, in the southern part of the study area, where the
    level of CI is already high, the soil texture is also dominated by the presence
    of coarse particles considering the results of the all indices. The results for
    Mapping (Fig. 11) of Soil Properties and (Tables 2 and 3) by Inverse Distance
    Weighting (IDW) (Figs. 11 and 12) showed significant variations within the farm
    site. EC varied from 0.45 to 15.5 dS/m, pH ranged 7–8.8 and organic matter ranged
    0–2.81%. Fig. 11 physio-chemical properties of the soil Full size image Table

    between each of the following soil properties (Silt, Clay, Porosity, W.P., F.C.,
    and A.W.), which confirms the need to take into account the consideration of agricultural
    service operations that help improve the efficiency of plant exploitation in all
    stages of growth for these characteristics, which are directly reflected on the
    health of the plant Thus, increasing production efficiency. Table 5 shows the
    maximum and minimum values of some properties of the soil under study. The soil
    is sandy yellow to gray in color. There are soils with a mixture of large and
    small grains, as in the northern region of the study area. The soil has a weak
    to medium degree of cohesion, and a high degree of water permeability, and there
    are also some northwestern areas of medium permeability. The yellow soil is medium
    to well aerated. The soil is of medium fertility in the northern part and poor
    fertility in the southern part. Thus, the degree of soil varies in being arable,
    as it is suitable for the cultivation of some crops, such as sugar beet, and suitable
    for the cultivation of tubers, such as potatoes, or the cultivation of palms and
    fruits. Principal components “correlation” of soil data collected in Salheya Farm

    on the ecosystem in the study area, these properties include EC and BD, and the
    lack of pH effect, due to the fact that the system is neutral. While the rest
    of the characteristics responded positively to service operations in the region,
    it may be due to the density of vegetation cover and the advanced agricultural
    system used in the region. From Tables 4 and 5 and Figs. 12 and 13 the research
    region, there is no significant difference in performance between the pedotransfer
    function (indirect) and the geostatistical (direct) methods based on the results
    of soil hydraulic maps. The advantage of maps computed for wilting point, available
    water, field capacity, drainage rate, and saturation is that they can better characterize
    locally extreme values. It is advantageous in the case of pedotransfer-function-based
    mapping that the calculation of uncertainty is much less computationally intensive
    than it is with geostatistical methods, though it would be interesting to examine
    the differences between uncertainty maps calculated with the various methods in
    the future, particularly for soil hydraulic properties. Soil conservation is very
    important in regions that experience severe drought, such as Egypt. This study
    showed the importance of big data to improve and increase the efficiency of soil
    quality control to raise its production efficiency. It can be concluded that economic
    benefit can be achieved by providing large amounts of data in modern agriculture
    under arid conditions. Therefore, it can be recommended in general. Soil hydraulic
    maps are closely related. The benefit of computed maps of wilting point, available
    water, field capacity, drainage rate and saturation is that locally determined
    values can be distinguished better than any of the maps produced. This is due
    to the association with the same determinants of soil properties that affect the
    amount of water in the soil. The results showed that the positive improvement
    in some of the physical properties of the studied soil leads to an improvement
    in the water properties of the soil. The study shows the importance of modern
    methods of agriculture, especially modern irrigation methods, which help to reach
    the water directly to the root system, so that it becomes greatly facilitated
    for plants, and to avoid water loss caused by wind or evaporation from the surface
    of the soil during or after the operation process. The localized irrigation technology
    is compatible with the conditions of water conservation and the environment, as
    it ensures the homogeneous distribution of water and nutrients in the root zone
    in the quantities needed by the crop, which results in an improvement in the yield
    in terms of quantity and quality, while the quantities of water and fertilizer
    that are used decrease. Fig. 13 Principal components scatterplot matrix Full size
    image The soil characteristics were calculated and presented at 10 m resolution,
    was provided by the collected soil sample in the entire field. Information on
    topography, meteorology, geology and vegetation was used for interpretation the
    output mapping of soil hydraulic properties values. Soil texture and organic matter
    were used to produce soil information maps. The results were used to develop a
    comprehensive spatial index of soil quality (SQ) based on the characteristics
    of the hydraulic soils in the examined study. Wilt Point (WP) shown in Fig. 7,
    explore the minimum amount of water in the investigated soil that a plant needs
    in order not to wilt. The results showed that the effect of soil texture at this
    level is clear depending on the nature of the soil. In soils where the proportion
    of clay and silt is increased, the wilting point occurs at higher levels than
    in sandy soils, due to the tensile strength of the clay grains of water. Soil
    water content can be measured on a mass or volume basis. At the permanent wilting
    point, the higher amounts of water were found to be retained by Fine-textured
    soils (~ 26–32% v/v), while the coarse textured soils (10–15% v/v). Available
    water (Fig. 8) was found to be highly correlated with the physical properties;
    soil texture, bulk density and porosity and was found to have negative correlation
    with chemical properties, i.e., EC and OM. The field capacity (Fig. 9) was found
    to decrease with the increase in the depth of the sector in the case of sandy
    lands in the region, in contrast to the areas where the percentage of silt and
    clay increases in the lower layers of the land sector. The study shows that the
    field capacity in the study area is affected by many factors that, specifically,
    are not constant (for a particular soil). The importance of soil drainage (Fig.
    14) is due to determining the suitability of the different types of crops. The
    study area is characterized by good drainage that helps in improving or sustaining
    production and thus determines the management of water irrigation, where saturation
    found to be affected by soil physical properties as shown in Fig. 14. The amount
    of water available in the soil depends on several variables and these variables
    include the effective root depth and density of the crop, the efficiency of the
    root system in soil exploration, as well as the ability of the soil to store the
    available water and basic soil properties used to estimate the potential amount
    of available water stock, including field capacity, wilting point, and available
    water. Choosing the type of irrigation process suitable for the hydrological characteristics
    of the soil will contribute to increasing the quality of agricultural land and
    providing a large percentage of water to irrigate a larger area of land. This
    is no less important than improving the irrigation network and increasing its
    efficiency, which will lead to an increase in the productivity of acre of agricultural
    crops. The most prominent advanced irrigation methods are drip irrigation or sprinkler
    irrigation (Fig. 14) instead of the flood irrigation method, which wastes large
    amounts of water up to 200 cubic meters per acre. It is clear that according to
    the characteristics of the soil in the study area, the highest efficiency of drip
    irrigation occupies an area of 47% and sprinkler irrigation occupies the largest
    area by 53%. Fig. 14 Maps of hydraulic soil properties Full size image According
    to the FAO taxonomy the main soil types are Calcaric Fluvisols (81%), Eutric Regosols
    (19%) of the total area. For the spatial information on soil type, clay, silt
    and sand content, organic matter content, calcium carbonate content and pH in
    water (pH) at 10 m resolution were provided by the collected soil sample in the
    entire field. The study area contains a high percentage of individual sand grains
    of different diameters (2–0.05 mm), consisting mainly of quartz, which reaches
    more than 85%. These lands were formed under the conditions of a hot, dry climate.
    From the history of climatic data, it may be exposed to intermittent rainstorms
    for short periods that moisten a specific layer of the land sector. These conditions
    lead to the presence of both gypsum and calcium carbonate in assemblies at different
    depths within the land sector, which is directly proportional to the specific
    amount of rainwater that permeates the layers of the soil which also depends on
    the degree of porosity of the surface layers of the soil. Figure 11 shows the
    sandy lands in the south of the region contain more than 85% of the single grains
    of sand and are characterized as building-less, rapidly permeable, well-ventilated
    soils, low in their ability to hold water, low surface activity, low exchange
    capacity, poor organic matter, and poor grain content, Soft and therefore it is
    no soil structure. The bulk density ranges from 1.55 to 1.80 g/cm3, and this density
    is related to the total porosity, which is (32–42%). Wide pores that help with
    quality ventilation, rapid drainage and reduced water saturation ability. The
    field capacity of sandy lands ranges from 8 to 12%, the withering point is from
    4 to 6%, and the soft water is from 4 to 5%. From these figures, we find that
    the sandy lands have low moisture content and this is due to their poverty in
    fine grains and that the wide inter-spaces are prevalent. The prevailing weather
    conditions that are not suitable for the growth of natural plants (due to the
    high temperature—dry weather—and the scarcity of rain) led to the poverty of these
    lands in organic matter, ranging from 0.008 to 0.015%, and therefore the total
    nitrogen ranges from 0.002 to 0.0085% in addition to the great loss of this The
    element is through water, so organic fertilizers must be added in abundance to
    these lands, with attention to nitrogen fertilization. Total phosphorous in sandy
    lands does not exceed 30 parts/million and the dissolved does not exceed 5 parts/million,
    so it was found that good service for these lands and the use of high quality
    organic fertilizers helps to increase the dissemination of phosphorus in the soil.
    Total potassium in these lands is about 5 mEq/100 g of soil, and the outpour is
    about 0.25 mEq/100 g of soil. It is recommended to add potassium to vegetable,
    tuber and sugar crops, and it is also recommended to add it with leguminous crops
    (Fig. 15). Fig. 15 Maps of irrigation methods, soil capability and soil suitability
    based on soil properties Full size image Surface irrigation with different systems
    (sinks—lines—slides—terraces) is not suitable for sandy lands. The high permeability
    and low water content of these lands makes us unable to control the quantities
    of added water, and the efficiency of surface irrigation in these lands is about
    50%, as the parts far from the irrigation hole do not take enough water while
    the nearby parts take more than necessary and also on the one hand Nutrients follow
    the same distribution as before. In general, it is not recommended under these
    conditions to follow surface irrigation systems in sandy lands. The sprinkler
    irrigation system is to pump water through pipes under pressure, so the loss is
    small, but the most important thing is how to distribute a small volume of water
    over a large area of land in an orderly fashion. This system can be used successfully,
    especially when using high quality water, as is the case in the study area, in
    most crops, whether the roots are superficial or deep, and the cultivation system
    is used on lines, lines or slices. The permeability of the land, the saturation
    capacity, and the percentage of salts in the soil and water should be taken into
    consideration when designing these systems. Drip irrigation, and this is the best
    system for irrigating sandy lands in the region, and the efficiency of this system
    reaches more than 85% according to the field capacity and soil texture. Conclusions
    The geomatics approach was used to build a high accurate database for soil properties.
    The classification of soil soils suitability in the area, shown to be mostly (81%)
    suitable for cultivation, considering the land capacity, ≥ 99% of the investigated
    soils belongs to Class I and II indicating that it can be used for a wide range
    of cultivation. While Class III in the area, represents ≤ 1% of where only a limited
    range of crops should be allowed to be grown. In fact, this area has a high content
    of sand which does not allow for good water retention. This classification can
    help determine the best agricultural practices that must be applied to maintain
    soil functions. This means that soil properties databases should not be considered
    permanent documents, but rather are subject to modification in a positive or negative
    sense depending on human interventions or, in particular, natural climatic influences.
    Hence, the importance of big data in agriculture is clear as provisioning tools
    to assist decision makers in effective land use planning. In addition, data on
    soil characteristics associated with vegetation cover indicators, such as changes
    in land use, contributes to determining the required soil management and appropriate
    agricultural practices. In addition, databases of soil structural and hydrological
    features were built, by increasing the number of field samples, to provide current
    maps with sufficient quality and satisfactory accuracy to meet the needs of many
    users. Maps that predict soil ‘capacity’ and maps describing ‘condition’ of soils
    have been produced, in general the soil studies conducted in this study indicated
    the response of soils to achieve sustainability. References Adhikari K, Hartemink

    manure 1. Introduction Methane (CH4) is one of the most potent greenhouse gases
    (GHG) that significantly contribute to global warming. CH4 concentration in the
    atmosphere has more than been doubled during the industrial era while its concentration
    reached at 1888.5 ppb in March 2021 (Global Monitoring Laboratory, 2021). The
    CH4 is responsible for 21% of the total radiative forcing, placing it in the second
    highest contributor after CO2 (Myhre et al., 2013). Although CH4 has a relatively
    short atmospheric life-time (8–12 years), one molecule of CH4 traps about 32 times
    more heat than a molecule of CO2 (Badr et al., 1991). Moreover, it has significant
    roles in tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry since it can change the composition
    of ozone, water vapor, hydroxyl radical, and numerous other compounds (Wuebbles
    and Hayhoe, 2002). Rice is one of the most dominant crops in Asian countries and
    thus, rice culture is one of the dominant contributors to GHG emissions, especially
    through CH4 emission. In rice farming with standing water (i.e., under anaerobic
    conditions) favors CH4 production while its aerenchyma system facilitates the
    transportation of the generated CH4 to the atmosphere (Aulakh et al., 2001; Lu
    et al., 2000; Wassmann and Aulakh, 2000). Over the last century, the expansion
    of rice production has significantly been increased while it is predicted that
    the cultivation needs to be extended in the future to feed the increasing population
    (Ciais et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016). Therefore, rice farming has become a
    major source of anthropogenic CH4 emission estimating at 11% of the total anthropogenic
    CH4 emission (Oyediran et al., 1996; Smartt et al., 2016). CH4 is produced in
    the rice field through various processes. The most important process is the microbial
    breakdown of organic compounds under strictly anaerobic conditions, which is usually
    maintained in rice cultivation (Oremland, 1988). Under anaerobic conditions, methanogenic
    bacteria utilize carbon substrates including freshly added organic matter, and
    root exudates for their growth and development (Sandin, 2005). The incomplete
    mineralization of organic matter under anaerobic environment produces CH4 through
    generating a number of intermediate products (i.e., H2/CO2, formate, methanol,
    methylamines, and acetate) (Le Mer and Roger, 2001; Yao et al., 1999). However,
    a large fraction of the produced CH4 (80%) in rice paddy is oxidized by methanotrophs
    (obligate aerobes) before escaping it to the atmosphere (Cai et al., 2016; Frenzel
    et al., 1992; Kumar et al., 2021). This oxidation takes place mostly at the aerobic–anaerobic
    interfaces of oxygenated at soil surface or oxygenated water layer and in the
    area around the oxygen-releasing roots of rice plants (Conrad, 2007). Therefore,
    CH4 production can significantly be reduced if the rice farming conditions are
    optimized. Methane emission reduction from rice fields has extensively been studied
    with multiple management practices including water, inorganic and organic fertilizer
    management, adoption of cultivars, etc (details can be found in the supporting
    information, SI). For instance, dry or intermediate irrigation in place of continuous
    flooded irrigation can significantly reduce CH4 emission since aerobic conditions
    promote the growth of methane-oxidizing microbial communities (known as methanotrophs)
    in the soil (Wang et al., 1999). In addition, CH4 production also depends on the
    status of soil organic matter and its quality (labile vs. recalcitrant) while
    the amount and form of organic matter replenishment can affect CH4 emission (Xiong
    et al., 2007: Zou et al., 2005). Moreover, the relevant soil management practices
    (i.e., tillage and fertilization) that control the mineralization of soil organic
    matter are also important for the production of CH4 in rice fields (Allen et al.,
    2003; Bhattacharyya et al., 2013). Generally, the application of labile organic
    matter (i.e., the fresh straw addition just after rice harvest) can generate a
    larger CH4 emission than that of the application of a similar amount of well-decomposed
    organic matter (Watanabe and Kimura, 1998). In addition, nutrient supply, particularly
    the N, largely affects CH4 emission with a positive impulse with N addition rates
    (0–100 kg ha−1) (Sun et al., 2016) while application of N at higher rates (100–250
    kg ha−1) shown to reduce CH4 emission due to a greater oxidation. This oxidation
    is suggested to occur by a relative suppression of methanogens through changes
    in the soil C:N ratio and by encouraging the predomination of denitrifying bacteria
    (Xie et al., 2010). However, the attributed mechanisms for these observed effects
    are diverse and there are still considerable debates on this issue (Guo et al.,
    2017; Linquist et al., 2012). Nevertheless, N application at higher rates (100–250
    kg N ha−1) can be considered as one of the important CH4 reduction strategy. Soil
    properties (i.e., redox potential and pH) have critical roles in CH4 formation.
    It has been determined that methanogenic bacteria in the soil can continue their
    function only when the redox potential is below a certain level of 200 mv (Minami,
    1994; Wang et al., 1993). Since soils vary in buffering soil pH and Eh, therefore,
    soil type could also affect CH4 production (Akter et al., 2018). Apart from the
    aforementioned aspects, soil environment (i.e., temperature and CO2 concentration)
    has also been suggested to be associated with CH4 production (Akter et al., 2018;
    Bhattacharyya et al., 2013; Li et al., 2004). The CH4 reduction potential of different
    management practices has been shown to vary (Guo et al., 2017). Water management
    is believed to be one of the most effective mitigation options while the application
    of recalcitrant or decomposed organic can also reduce the CH4 emission although
    the reduction efficiency may be lower than water management (Liu et al., 2019;
    Tyagi et al., 2010). Similarly, the potentiality of other management practices
    for CH4 emission may also vary suggesting a critical evaluation of their relative
    performance. Although several previous meta-analyses and reviews were published
    on the CH4 emission reduction potentials, recent researchers and methods have
    not been included (Jiang et al., 2019, Liao et al., 2021) while the application
    of simple Gaussian and bootstrapping models could be effective in estimating the
    reduction potential, particularly when the number of observations is low (Hesterberg,
    2011, Mia et al., 2020). Rice is the main food crop and covers 80% of cultivable
    lands in Bangladesh. Moreover, it is grown under diverse conditions in three different
    rice cultivation seasons. Recently, the concentration of CH4 in the atmosphere
    of Bangladesh has been shown to be quite high (Clark et al., 2021). Rice paddies
    are believed to be one of the major sources of CH4 emissions in Bangladesh. To
    reduce the CH4 emission from rice fields in Bangladesh, customized management
    practices are needed. However, the number of researches on CH4 reduction from
    rice fields in Bangladesh is low making it difficult to formulate strategic policies
    for its reduction. Nevertheless, the results of global studies can be customized
    to the rice-growing conditions in Bangladesh. Here, we examined the mitigation
    potentials of CH4 emission under different management practices using a statistical
    (Gaussian) model and bootstrapping technique. Further, the adoptability of these
    management practices in Bangladesh was evaluated to identify suitable management
    practices. 2. Methodology 2.1. Data collection A literature survey of peer-reviewed
    publications was carried out using Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar.
    The literature search was restricted to peer-reviewed articles that were published
    before July 2021. While searching, keywords used for the initial searching included
    CH4 reduction and management practices, i.e., alternate wetting and drying, intermittent
    drainage, mid-season drainage, control irrigation, straw management, amendment
    input, compost, farmyard manure (FYM), nitrogen fertilizer input, no-tillage,
    biochar, herbicide application, symbiosis ecosystem, direct seeding, and rice
    variety. In total, we found 198 studies reporting 1052 observations. The data
    were categorized into five different management practices such as water, organic,
    and inorganic fertilizer management, crop establishment method, and different
    agronomic practices (Table 1 and supporting information, SI). Data on individual
    management practices were also separated. The fraction of CH4 reduction with a
    specific management practice was calculated relative to their control treatment
    (Table 1). Table 1. Categorization system of strategies of CH4 emission reduction

    Herbicide application 2.2. Gaussian model A Gaussian model to the literature data
    was fitted on the fraction of CH4 reduction using SigmaPlot (Sigma Plot 11.0)
    to determine the mean CH4 emission reduction and its associated error margin (Mia
    et al., 2020). The Gaussian equation is given as follows: where x is the observation,
    and the μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the population. An example
    of the model fitting is presented in Fig. 1 while all other fitted data can be
    found in the supporting information (Figs. S5, S6, S7, and S8). When the number
    of observations was low and data did not meet the assumption (i.e., normal distribution)
    of Gaussian model fitting, we followed bootstrapping method to estimate the mean
    and associated error margin (details can be found in SI) (Hesterberg, 2011). Moreover,
    we compared our model fitting with analysis of variance (ANOVA) that provided
    reasonable estimates (Fig. S9). Download : Download high-res image (449KB) Download

    Guassian model fitting to literature data. 2.3. Statistical analysis One-way ANOVA
    was used to examine the statistically significant difference in the effectiveness
    between major management practices while Tukey''s HSD test (α = 5%) was applied
    to separate the means. 2.4. Adaptability analysis An index-based assessment was
    applied to analyze the adoptability of different CH4 emission reduction technologies,
    i.e., Adoptability index =  For this assessment, a total of 100-point adoptability
    score was applied whereas a 25% score was used for each of the criteria. The method
    of assessment can be found in SI (S4). 2.5. Description of rice cultivation in
    Bangladesh In Bangladesh, rice is grown in three possible rice growing seasons
    namely Aus, Aman, and Boro (Siddique et al., 2016) while different rice varieties,
    i.e., local, high yielding variety (HYV), and hybrid are cultivated. Different
    rice cultivars are adapted to different rice ecosystems. The rice grown in different
    ecosystems are discussed below- 2.5.1. Aus rice Aus is the pre-monsoon upland
    rice-growing season where rice is usually cultivated under rainfed conditions.
    The temperature of this rice-growing season is high (Fig. 2) and rainfall is sporadic.
    Aus rice is cultivated following broadcasting (direct seeding) and transplanting
    techniques. Usually, local cultivars are broadcasted between February and March
    after the pre-monsoon shower and harvested between June and July in high land
    to medium high lands while HYV is transplanted in the high land to lowlands in
    April and harvested in June and July (Shelley et al., 2016). However, the coverage
    of Aus rice is only ∼9% (1.2 million ha) (BBS, 2020a). Of the total Aus cultivation
    area, modern varieties cover 89% and local varieties occupy 11%. The production
    of rice grown in Aus season is about 3.7 million MT which is ∼7.5% of total production.
    The share of modern varieties and local varieties is 94% and 6%, respectively.

    Fig. 2. Rice growing seasons in Bangladesh with their agro-climatic conditions.
    2.5.2. Aman rice The monsoon-season rainfed rice is known as Aman, which is the
    most dominant rice in terms of coverage. Aman rice is grown between June to December
    when most of the growing period remains flooded although at the late growing period
    the rice fields may get dried (Uddin et al., 2019) (Fig. 2). Similar to Aus, both
    local and modern Aman varieties are mostly cultivated following transplanting
    technique although local Aman is grown following broadcasting technique at a limited
    scale. However, the coverage of modern varieties (HYV and hybrid) is large with
    more than 80% of Aman growing area while total coverage is 5.5 million ha and
    production is about 14.2 million MT (BBS, 2020b). 2.5.3. Boro season Boro rice
    is cultivated in a range of lands from low-lying waterlogged lands to high lands
    between December and June. In the Boro season, low temperature prevails at the
    early stage while the temperature increases with time reaching the maximum at
    the end of the season (Fig. 2) (Mosleh and Hassan, 2014; Sarker et al., 2017).
    Rice cultivation in the Boro season is quite diverse since local landraces, HYV,
    and hybrid are all cultivated in this season. Generally, local landraces are usually
    cultivated in low-lying lands where floodwater accumulates during the rainy season
    and remains waterlogged until the end of the rice-growing season. On the other
    hand, the HYV and hybrid varieties are grown in medium highland to very lowland
    with irrigation (BBS, 2019). The total coverage of Boro rice is 4.7 million ha
    and production is about 19.6 million MT (BBS, 2020c). In contrast to Aman, the
    coverage of HYV and hybrid varieties is 79% and 20%, respectively of total Boro
    cultivation area. The average yield of HYV and hybrid is relatively estimating
    at 3.98 and 4.40 t ha−1, respectively (BBS, 2020b). 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Methane emission from rice fields-mechanisms and management practices 3.1.1.
    Methane production and emission CH4 is produced in the rice field through various
    processes. The most important process is the microbial breakdown of organic compounds
    under anaerobic conditions, which is usually maintained in rice fields (Oremland,
    1988). In anaerobic conditions, methanogenic bacteria utilize carbon substrates
    and produce CH4 following the equations shown below. A number of intermediate
    products (e.g., H2/CO2, formate, methanol, methylamines, acetate) is also produced
    during these biochemical conversions (Le Mer and Roger, 2001; Yao et al., 1999).
    CO2 is reduced by H2 to CH4 CO2+ 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O Or CH4 can be emitted through
    the reduction of acetate CH3COO− + H+ → CO2 + CH4 And a summary could be written
    as: 2 (CH2O) → CO2 + CH4 When the rice field is converted from anaerobic to aerobic
    conditions, these methanogenic bacteria can survive. These organisms start to
    multiply when the field is re-flooded (Fetzer et al., 1993; Fukui and Takii, 1990).
    CH4 is emitted from rice paddies to the atmosphere via three pathways i.e., ebullition,
    diffusion, and plant mediated transport (Fig. 3) (Holzapfel-Pschorn et al., 1986;
    Schütz et al., 1989). Among the three pathways of CH4 emission from rice field,
    plant-mediated transport is the primary mechanism for CH4 transport from soil
    to the atmosphere and contribute around 90% of total CH4 emission (Akinbile et
    al., 2012; Khosa et al., 2010). CH4 ebullition (gas transport via gas bubbles)
    occurs only during the early growth stages of rice accounting for ∼10% of the
    total emission (Rajkishore et al., 2015; Sandin, 2005). The diffusion of CH4 from
    a rice field in the atmosphere is relatively small estimating only up to 2%. Download

    of CH4 emission 3.2.1. Reduction potentials of CH4 emission for different water
    management practices Different water management practices were compared to the
    continuous flooding treatment (control). Our estimate showed that water management
    practices reduced area scaled CH4 emission on average by 46.53% (Table 2). Among
    the four water management practices, alternate wetting and drying were the most
    efficient (a 52.59% reduction) practice in reducing area-scaled CH4 emission (Table
    2). Controlled irrigation was also almost equally efficient in CH4 emission reduction
    (51.52%) while the estimated reduction for intermittent drainage and mid-season
    drainage practices were 43.47% and 38.54%, respectively. The overall yield-scaled
    CH4 reduction was estimated at 55.19%, a ∼9% more reduction than area-scaled CH4
    emission while similar trends were followed for all subclasses of water management
    practices. These reductions were primarily attributed to the creation of aerobic
    conditions in the rice field through facilitating oxygen (O2) diffusion from the
    atmosphere into the soil. An improvement in aeration could increase soil reduction
    potential (Eh), and shift the soil microbial community from methanogen to methanotrophs
    with consequences for CH4 reduction (Fig. S1). Although different water management
    practices can increase in aeration into soil and thus, effectively reduce CH4
    emission, it could increase CO2 and N2O emission substantially (Islam et al.,
    2020; Liu et al., 2019). Therefore, the trades-off between CH4 reduction and CO2
    and N2O emission should carefully be considered for estimating and adopting any
    water management strategies since the net emission factor of a management practice
    may not be carbon negative. In our study, we did not consider these trades-off
    between emissions of CH4 and other GHGs. Table 2. Estimated CH4 emission reduction

    Reduction potentials of CH4 emission for different fertilizer management practices
    The type, rate, and mode of fertilizer application in rice can significantly affect
    CH4 emission. Across all studies, organic matter management substantially reduce
    area- and yield-scaled CH4 emission by ∼45% and 49%, respectively than control
    treatments. Composted FYM reduced area-scaled CH4 emission by 48.48% than the
    fresh application of FYM while this reduction was 46.50% and 44.14%, respectively
    when straw was incorporated after composting and in the off-season instead of
    its application in rice growing season (Table 2). A similar trend was observed
    in yield-scaled CH4 emission. However, the yield-scaled CH4 emission was lower
    with biochar application compared to area-scaled emission. These changes in CH4
    emission after organic managements have mainly occurred due to the application
    of a non-labile form of organic matter (composted FYM and straw) and supply of
    organic matter (i.e., straw) when soils are not anaerobic to form CH4 (Nakajima
    et al., 2016). However, biochar application might have improved soil aeration
    by carrying air in its large pores while biochar could buffer soil redox potential,
    change microbial community and nutrient dynamics (Zhang et al., 2012). Average
    across all studies, management of inorganic fertilizer reduced area and yield-scale
    CH4 emission by 30.61% and 38.07%, respectively (Table 2). The area-scaled reduction
    was 44% when ammonium sulphate was applied instead of urea while application of
    N at an optimum rate (100–250 kg ha−1) reduced it by 38.04% compared to no N amendment.
    Sulphate has been shown to reduce CH4 emission by suppressing the methanogenesis
    and contributing to anaerobic CH4 oxidation. This mainly happen due to the change
    of soil redox potential (Eh), pH, and possible toxicity to the CH4 producing bacteria.
    Nitrogen application low rates promotes CH4 emission (Fig. S2) while N application
    at higher rates (100–250 kg N ha−1) diminishes it. Although, there are debates
    on the possible mechanism, NH4+ concentration in the soil solution shown to stimulate
    CH4 oxidation in a range of conditions (Linquist et al., 2012). Moreover, the
    deep placement of N reduced area-scaled CH4 emission by 25.53% compared to the
    surface application. When N is placed into the soil, it has been shown to stimulate
    CH4 oxidation by soil methanotrophs (Liu et al., 2020) (Fig. S1). Compared to
    N application alone, N application with amendment inputs decreased CH4 emission
    by 14.89%. The lower CH4 emission from the amended paddy soil was due to an improvement
    in aeration, stabilization of soil C, and soil redox potential. Moreover, electron
    acceptors cites are increased since amendment inputs often carry active iron oxides,
    sulphate and nitrate ionic compounds (Wang et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2013). 3.2.3.
    Reduction potentials of CH4 emission for different crop establishment methods
    The results showed that direct seeded practices significantly decreased the area-scaled
    CH4 emission by 49.88% while these practices reduced yield-scale emission by 53.92%
    (Table 2) compared to the conventional transplanting technique. In contrast, no-tillage
    reduced area-scale and yield-scale CH4 emission by 38.69% and 41.76% respectively
    compared to conventional tillage. The reduction in CH4 emission by no-tillage/minimum
    tillage was attributed to the shifting of methanogenesis to the methanotrophic
    process, reducing the diffusion of CH4 from soils to the atmosphere (Cheng-Fang
    et al., 2012; Sapkota et al., 2015). In contrast, the direct dry seeding method
    may reduce the activity of CH4-producing bacteria since rice is grown under aerobic
    conditions (Gupta et al., 2016). 3.2.4. Reduction potentials of CH4 emission for
    different agronomic practices Average across all studies, growing of HYV rice
    varieties reduced both area and yield-scaled CH4 emission by 43%. This may be
    attributed to an enhanced O2 diffusion through prolific growth of rice plants
    (Jiang et al., 2017). Compared to rice only culture, the symbiosis ecosystem such
    as combined rice-ducks/fish culture reduced CH4 emission by ∼32%, possibly because
    of accelerated air exchange between the soil and the atmosphere. Compared to without
    application, herbicide application (e.g., Butachlor) reduced CH4 emission by ∼30%
    by inhibiting the growth of methanogens (Jiang et al., 2015). 3.3. Possible CH4
    emission strategies for Bangladesh In Bangladesh, rice is cultivated in three
    different seasons under diverse conditions, and therefore, the adoption of CH4
    emission reduction technologies could also vary (detail can be found in SI). The
    possible methods are discussed below- 3.3.1. Boro season Based on the suitability
    analysis of different management options, only a few management practices can
    be applied to local rice, grown in the Boro season (Table 3). For instance, pre-and
    in-season water management practices can hardly be possible to use since the local
    rice is mainly grown as deep-water rice in low and very low lands where the land
    remains flooded from June to December (i.e., pre and growing period of the rice).
    For similar reasons, no other crop establishment methods except transplanting
    (single or double) are possible to adopt for this rice cultivation. However, symbiotic
    techniques (e.g., rice-fish culture, rice-fish-duck culture) can be adopted to
    reduce CH4 emissions from these wetlands (suitability score 60). In contrast to
    local rice, most of the CH4 emission strategies can potentially be adapted to
    high yield variety (HYV) and hybrid since these rice is usually grown in high
    lands to medium high lands where flood water recedes before planting of these
    rice cultivars. For instance, management strategies including pre and in-season
    water management (such as alternate wetting and drying, mid-season drying, etc.),
    fertilizer management (organic and inorganic), and conservation tillage and crop
    establishment methods (e.g., direct seeding/direct dry seeding) can be adopted
    (Rahman et al., 2008). Among the management strategies, alternate wetting and
    drying, composted organic matter amendment (straw, and FYM), urea deep placement
    and application of ammonium sulphate seems most feasible technologies to adopt
    during Boro season since they got higher scores in our suitability analysis. For
    instance, composted straw incorporation received the highest score (68 out of
    100) (Table 3). Altogether, it seems that the adoptability of any CH4 reduction
    strategies largely depends on the land type since major management strategies
    including water management, crop establishment method, and fertilizer management
    have limited scope to use if the land remains flooded. Table 3. Suitability analysis
    of CH4 emission reduction practices for rice cultivation in Boro season in Bangladesh.

    depth 90–180 cm), LL-Low lands (flooding depth 180–270 cm), and VLL-Very low lands
    (flooding depth >290 cm). 3.3.2. Aus and Aman season In Aus and Aman season, there
    is little scope to reduce CH4 emission through adopting water management strategies
    since these rice are grown as rain-fed while crop establishment method and fertilizer
    management could potentially be applied (Table 4, Table 5). In Aus season, direct
    drying seeding can be one of the important means to crop establishment since this
    rice is grown during the dry period of the year (March–June) (suitability score
    63). In contrast, Aman rice is grown during monsoon, therefore, the scope of replacing
    transplanting with direct seeding is minimal. Because the land remains flooded.
    However, organic matter management after composting can be applied to both of
    the seasons equally while nitrogen fertilizer management (e.g., urea deep placement)
    can be adopted provided technologies are available at a reasonable cost (Ali et
    al., 2008, 2012). Moreover, symbiotic techniques (rice-fish/duck culture) can
    be applied in the medium high land to low lands in both of the seasons with more
    feasibility during the Aman season. Although there has been significant progress
    in modern rice cultivars adoption (more than 99% in Boro season, 81% in Aman season,
    and 88% in Aus season), there are still some scopes to increase coverage of modern
    varieties that could potentially reduce yield normalized CH4 emission (BBS, 2020a,
    b, c). Table 4. Suitability analysis of CH4 emission reduction strategies for

    this study synthesized a large data pool for generalizing the effects, it would
    be more useful if it was possible to assess each of the management strategies
    in relation to diverse rice-growing zones of Bangladesh. However, we tried to
    synthesize the suitability of a few potential technologies (S5). Moreover, research
    is needed to examine the suitability of proposed methods under the conditions
    of Bangladesh before advocating their large-scale adoption. 5. Conclusions CH4
    is one of the most potent greenhouse gases that is emitted from rice fields. Hundreds
    of studies are conducted for identifying suitable technologies to mitigate CH4
    emission. Our synthesis of literature data showed that water management, organic
    matter management, and reduced tillage practice are the most effective methods
    for CH4 emission reduction. When these technologies are customized to the situation
    of Bangladesh, water management and crop establishment methods seem most feasible.
    Altogether, our study provides fundamental insights into global CH4 reductions
    strategies with their customization to the context of Bangladesh. Credit author

  description: Rice is the main food crop grown in China. Lodging is one of the main
    limiting factors affecting stable and high yield of rice. As for rice cultivar,
    japonica (J) and indica (X), which differ in their growth and physiological characteristics
    due to the genomic variation, are widely cultivated in southern China. As for
    fertilizer types, excessive application of chemical fertilizer (C) could result
    in numerous environmental problems, thus it is recommended to use the organic
    fertilizer (O) in recent years. As for irrigation modes, in addition to traditional
    shallow-frequent irrigation (2), various water-saving irrigation modes for rice,
    such as controlled irrigation (1), have been developed in the light of the ongoing
    global water scarcity. It has been reported that the individual effects of rice
    cultivar, fertilizer type, and irrigation mode could affect rice growth and thus
    influence lodging index (LI) of rice. However, the combined effects of these three
    factors on yield and lodging resistance of rice are not well understood. Furthermore,
    understanding the regulation of lodging resistance as a function of cultivar,
    fertilizer type, and irrigation mode, could benefit food security and environmental
    sustainability under increasing water scarcity. This study was conducted in the
    Water-saving Park, Hohai University, Nanjing, China from June to October in 2019
    and 2020 to investigate the combined effects of rice cultivar (J or X), fertilizer
    type (C or O), and irrigation mode (1 or 2) on yield and LI of rice as well as
    the relationships between LI and morphological and mechanical traits of rice plant.
    A total of 2×2×2=8 treatments, Nanjing 5055 supplied with chemical fertilizer
    and irrigated with controlled irrigation mode (JC1), Nanjing 5055 supplied with
    chemical fertilizer and irrigated with shallow-frequent irrigation mode (JC2),
    Nanjing 5055 supplied with organic fertilizer and irrigated with controlled irrigation
    mode (JO1), Nanjing 5055 supplied with organic fertilizer and irrigated with shallow-frequent
    irrigation mode (JO2), Y liangyou 900 supplied with chemical fertilizer and irrigated
    with controlled irrigation mode (XC1), Y liangyou 900 supplied with chemical fertilizer
    and irrigated with shallow-frequent irrigation mode (XC2), Y liangyou 900 supplied
    with organic fertilizer and irrigated with controlled irrigation mode (XO1), Y
    liangyou 900 supplied with organic fertilizer and irrigated with shallow-frequent
    irrigation mode (XO2), were set up. For different irrigation mode, compared with
    shallow-frequent irrigation, controlled irrigation significantly reduced plant
    height and above-ground fresh weight (P<0.05); For different fertilizer types,
    compared with chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer treatment significantly
    increased the short axis internode diameter and stem wall thickness of I1 (I1
    represents the second internode counted from the shoot base to the neck of the
    panicle) and Young's modulus of I2 (I2 represents the third internode counted
    from the shoot base to the neck of the panicle) (P<0.05), and significantly decreased
    the second moment of area (Ib) (P<0.05); For different rice cultivar, compared
    with japonica, plant heights and stem morphological indexes of indica rice were
    significantly higher than those of japonica (P<0.05). In addition, rice cultivar
    also significantly affected the stem mechanical traits, such as maximum Bending
    force (Fmax), Bending moment at breaking (M), Bending stress (BS), Ib and LI.
    In 2020, the LI of I1 was affected by the interaction effects of rice varieties
    and fertilizer types. For japonica rice, the LI of I1 for the two fertilizer types
    had no significant difference (P>0.05); For indica rice, the LI of I1 under organic
    fertilizer treatment was significantly greater than that under chemical fertilizer
    treatment (P<0.05). Overall, for the consideration of yield and LI, japonica rice
    is suitable for supplied with organic fertilizer under controlled irrigation mode,
    and indica rice is suitable for supplied with chemical fertilizer under controlled
    irrigation mode. This study could provide data support and theoretical support
    for the regulation of lodging resistance of different rice cultivar by application
    of different irrigation modes and fertilizer types.

  description: A non-contact and online detection system was developed for the soil
    moisture using Fabry Perot interference near-infrared chip. A large number of
    points were reduced for the cost-saving and non-destruction of the cultivated
    layer after the probe of the soil moisture sensor was inserted into the soil.
    The hardware of the system consisted of an airborne automatic detection device,
    an electrical control box, and Beidou dual antenna real-time differential positioning.
    The specific sensors were then selected to detect the soil water content. The
    packaging of the module was designed to protect the internal structure of the
    sensor from damage. A lifting detection device was used to control the soil moisture
    sensor onto the soil surface for the detection. The obstacle avoidance of the
    device with the ultrasonic sensor was installed to realize the automatic positioning
    of the measured height. The spectral data in the range of 1750-2150 mm was collected
    from the soil samples with different water content and types. A partial least
    squares (PLS) prediction model was established for the water content of the soil
    surface. The determination coefficients of all prediction models were above 0.9.
    There was a high curve fitting degree of the overall soil model, where the R2
    reached 0.9334. Although there was slightly lower than that of the single soil
    prediction model, there was a high universality of the overall model suitable
    for the prediction of most soil water content. Furthermore, the secondary development
    of the sensor data acquisition was realized to embed the prediction model of soil
    water content into the original near-infrared sensing chip system. As such, the
    measured value of soil water content and the corresponding spectral data curve
    were more intuitively displayed on the industrial computer in real time, when
    measuring soil samples. The measured distance information by the ultrasonic sensor
    was transformed into the voltage signals using the cooperated Xinjie PLC and analog
    module. The closed-loop stepping motor was utilized to adjust the height of the
    soil moisture sensor in real time, according to the PLC feedback signals, thereby
    realizing the coordination between the positioning system and the detection device.
    Correspondingly, a trial prototype was fabricated to integrate the near-infrared
    detection system of soil moisture and the automatic self-propelled transplanter.
    The field test results show that the soil moisture sensor after online calibration
    was dropped onto the soil surface with the lifting detection mechanism for measurement
    when the transplanter moved at the inspection speed of 0.3 m/s. After that, the
    moisture content value rose within 5 s, after the real-time display of the moisture
    content on the industrial computer. The measured water content of surface soil
    was combined with the positioning of the Beidou RTK system, thereby calculating
    the soil moisture content under the accurate longitude and latitude. The distribution
    map of soil moisture content was generated on the measured plot. Subsequently,
    the sampling points after the test were sampled, pretreated, dried, and calculated
    to obtain the actual moisture content of the sampling points, where the relative
    error was calculated between the measured and actual moisture content. Consequently,
    the measured soil moisture content in the test was basically consistent with the
    actual one, where the relative error of continuous detection was less than 10%.
    The distribution map of soil surface water content can be expected to directly
    match the early warning level of soil moisture for the visualization of the abstract
    information. Therefore, the soil moisture information of the field can be detected
    to accurately display in real time. The finding can provide a strong reference
    and practical significance for the variable irrigation, such as the sprinkler
    and drip irrigation, thereby optimizing the regional water and soil adaptation
    in the spatiotemporal pattern of water productivity. Intelligent agricultural
    machinery can also be created to fully realize the “border inspection and side
    management” of field management.

    ratio of the leaf area to a given unit of land area, is an essential parameter
    to describe plant productivity and make management decisions. Most methods for
    estimating the LAI are not suitable for practical agricultural management at the
    field scale due to delayed availability of data, high costs, or inaccuracy at
    late growth stages. Therefore, a new approach for rapid LAI mapping by ground-based
    laser rangefinders mounted on a vehicle was evaluated. Two types of laser rangefinders
    were tested in various configurations. Field trials were conducted to evaluate
    whether these sensors were capable of capturing temporal and spatial variability
    of LAI, biomass, and crop height. Crops included in the trials were winter wheat
    (Triticum aestivum L.), winter rye (Secale cereale L.), and oilseed rape (Brassica
    napus L. ssp. napus). Correlation coefficients ranging from 0.3 to more than 0.9
    (Pearson''s r) between sensor readings, LAI, and biomass were observed. Best correlations
    were achieved with the time-of-flight based rangefinder in winter wheat. This
    study demonstrated that vehicle-based laser distance sensors offer potential for
    rapid mapping of LAI in crops. The sensors are robust and allow for real-time
    data processing. It is anticipated that they will become affordable in the near
    future, for example, due to mass production for collision avoidance in automobile
    industry. Thus, vehicle-based laser distance sensors might be used for precision
    agriculture applications like fertilizing, crop protection, and yield prediction.

    NDVI normalized difference vegetation index r Pearson''s linear correlation coefficient
    ρ Spearman''s rank correlation coefficient The LAI is a dimensionless parameter
    describing the ratio of half of the leaf area to a given unit of land area (Watson,
    1947). It is an important parameter to quantify many biological and physical processes.
    There is a functional relationship between LAI and gross net photosynthesis (Bunce,
    1989; Running, 1990; Campbell,1996) and crop growth rate (Larcher, 1980; Machado
    et al., 2002), The LAI can be related to several crop properties such as number
    of plants, plant height, and biomass (Ganguli et al., 2000). Consequently, it
    can help to optimize crop management (e.g., Teruel et al., 1997; Wilhelm et al.,
    2000; Kennedy and Hutchinson, 2001; Wallach et al., 2001; Jongschaap, 2006). The
    LAI has been shown to be particularly useful in precision agriculture, which considers
    the within-field variability of soils and crops (e.g., Yang and Anderson, 1999;
    Machado et al., 2002; Guan and Nutter, 2002; Johnson et al., 2003). Precision
    agriculture is composed of a set of technologies that combines sensors, information
    systems, enhanced machinery, and information management to optimize production
    by accounting for variability and uncertainty within agricultural systems (Gebbers
    and Adamchuk, 2010). Adapting production inputs site-specifically within a field
    allows for better use of resources to maintain the quality Of the environment
    while improving the sustainability of the food supply. In the framework of precision
    agriculture, the LAI can be helpful for site-specific adaption of the application
    rates of N fertilizers, growth regulators, and fungicides. For example, application
    of fungicides according to the LAI provides optimum leaf cover, which guarantees
    sufficient effectiveness of the chemicals while also reducing soil contamination
    (Dammer and Ehlert, 2006). The leaf area can only be measured directly by destructive
    and time-consuming laboratory methods (Bréda, 2003; Jonckheere et al., 2004).
    After clipping the planimetric area of individual parts of the plant is obtained,
    usually by image analysis in the laboratory. A nondestructive and slightly less
    time-consuming approach is the point quadrat method, which, according to Goodall
    (1952), can be dated back to Cockayne (1926). Long needles (point quadrats) are
    passed through the stand, and the number of contacts made with the foliage by
    each needle is recorded (Warren Wilson, 1959). For more rapid investigations in
    the field, several nondestructive scientific instruments are available providing
    estimates of the LAI by indirect noncontact methods (Jonckheere et al., 2004).
    These instruments measure the incoming light above and below the canopy (Fig.
    1). The LAI is estimated by the ratio of the light intensities. Typical LAI meters
    have to be operated manually in a stop-and-go mode. During a single measurement,
    the instrument must be kept still, and measurements must be repeated several times
    to obtain a reliable estimate for one location. Contrary to spectral reflectance
    methods, as discussed in the next paragraph, these LAI meters are still sensitive
    when LAI is relatively high. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer Nondestructive measurement
    of the leaf area index (LAI) with the SunScan SS1 (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge,
    UK) equipment. The direct laboratory procedure and field methods mentioned above
    are expensive in both labor and time. To cover large areas within a reasonable
    time, remote sensing image analysis is used for LAI determination. This is usually
    done by analyzing canopy reflection in the visible and near infrared range of
    the spectrum (e.g., Asrar et al., 1984; Boegh et al., 2002; Scotford and Miller,
    2005; Darvishzadeh et al., 2008; Houborg et al., 2009). Typically, the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used for LAI estimation (Asrar et al., 1984;
    Huete and Jackson, 1988), (1) where NIR is the reflection in the near infrared
    range (0.7–1.1 μm) and R is the reflection in the red range (0.6–0.7 μm) of the
    electromagnetic spectrum. Large areas can be covered quickly by images from satellites
    and aircrafts. However, air- or space-borne remote sensing is affected by weather
    conditions and may be unable to provide timely information to perform research
    and crop management tasks. Furthermore, it becomes increasingly difficult to estimate
    LAI by canopy reflectance methods after canopy closure (LAI > 1) (Scotford and
    Miller, 2004). With increasing LAI, reflectance based indices become saturated.
    For instance, Asrar et al. (1984) and Scotford and Miller (2004) observed in wheat
    that LAI larger than three cannot be differentiated by the NDVI. Ground based,
    air- or space-borne laser systems can be used to describe morphological vegetation
    characteristics by measuring the distance between the sensor and the target (Hodgson
    et al., 2003; Kraus, 2004; Jensen et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008; Falkowski
    et al., 2009; Hosoi and Omasa, 2009; Zhao et al., 2009). Air- or space-borne laser
    systems are capable of analyzing forest canopy, but they are not very suitable
    for online acquisition of LAI in agricultural crops. Because they have a relatively
    large footprint (more than 30 cm), they are not able to separate soil and canopy
    in dense crops (Kraus, 2004; Hosoi and Omasa, 2009). In research, stationary ground-based
    scanning and nonscanning (fixed beam) lasers with a much finer resolution (<1cm)
    have been applied to canopy measurement and 3-D reconstruction (Hosoi and Omasa,
    2009). These sophisticated systems require postprocessing of data and costs for
    buying and operating these systems are high. For applications in agriculture,
    LAI mapping must be productive, robust, and cost-efficient, and it must deliver
    data in real time. Real-time availability of LAI data is essential because crop
    protection and N fertilization are time-critical measures in agriculture. For
    these applications, systems with real-time sensors were preferred by farmers.
    Until now, ground-based sensors mounted on a vehicle appear to have the highest
    potential of meeting these requirements (Heege et al., 2008). The Yara N-Senor
    (Yara GmbH & Co. KG, Dülmen, Germany) was the first commercial optical sensor
    designed to be placed on a tractor and to control N application by a fertilizer
    spreader in real time (Heege and Reusch, 1996). The Yara N-Sensor consists of
    a spectroradiometer, from which the red-edge inflection point and the NDVI are
    calculated. Other sensors that are regularly used in practice are the Crop Circle
    (New Holland Scientific Inc., Lincoln, NE) and the GreenSeeker (Ntech Industries
    Inc., Ukiah, CA) (Hong et al., 2007). Recently, Li et al. (2010) tested digital
    color cameras to estimate the LAI and other crop parameters. These spectral reflectance
    sensors represent an improvement toward online control of agricultural chemicals
    application. However, they are limited in LAI detection after canopy closure.
    Among others, Asrar et al. (1984), Aparicio et al. (2000), Heege et al. (2008),
    Li et al. (2010), and Scotford and Miller (2004) pointed out that the correspondence
    of the NDVI and other vegetation indices with the LAI is restricted. To overcome
    this limitation of optical reflection intensity analysis, other methods have been
    considered. Dammer and Ehlert (2006) discussed the application of a mechanical
    sensor, known as the Crop Meter (Agrocom GmbH & Co. Agrarsysteme KG, Bielefeld,
    Germany). Further research is focused on ultrasonic sensors (Scotford and Miller,
    2004) and mobile laser scanners (Palacin et al., 2007; Thomsen and Schelde, 2007;
    Ehlert et al., 2008). In this study, we analyzed a new method for estimating the
    real-time LAI in agriculture by using a vehicle-mounted laser distance sensor.
    While being driven over the field, the sensor obtains distance readings from the
    crop and soil surfaces (when there is a gap between the leaves) (Fig. 2). Evaluations
    of these signals yield the reflection height hR, (Fig. 2) which is useful for
    describing the morphology of crop stands (Ehlert et al., 2008). The average hR
    measured at several locations within a small area such as 1 m2 should theoretically
    be a function of plant morphology (leaf area, leaf orientation, plant height)
    and plant density. It was hypothesized that there is a correlation between the
    average reflection height and the LAI because the LAI increases with plant height
    and canopy closure. Our study compared the measurements of a portable LAI meter
    and hR readings of vehicle-mounted laser rangefinders in oilseed rape, winter
    rye, and winter wheat. The objectives of the research were to analyze the relations
    between LAI and hR over (i) crop type, (ii) time, and (iii) space, to evaluate
    (iv) the repeatability of hR measurements under field conditions, (v) the influence
    of sensor arrangement (inclination angle), and (vi) the performance of two types
    of laser rangefinders. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Principle of measuring morphological
    crop parameters by a laser rangefinder. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laser Rangefinders
    A laser distance sensor emits a beam of near-monochromatic, nonscattering (coherent)
    light with high energy density. If the light is reflected from a target, distance
    information is extracted by either the triangulation or the time-of-flight principle
    (Hosoi and Omasa, 2009). Triangulation type sensors evaluate the spatial shift
    between the emitted laser beam and the reflected beam caused by diffuse reflection
    of the target by an optical array. The sensor enclosures, the emitted laser, and
    the reflected light form a triangle, which explains the name “triangulation principle”
    (Ehlert et al., 2008). Time-of-flight sensors analyze the time it takes to travel
    from the sensor to the target and return. The time-of-flight methods are usually
    based on pulsed laser beams, whereas other, more sophisticated methods are based
    on modulated beams. In some of the time-of-flight sensors, the emitted and reflected
    beams are using the same path. In these cases, the beams are coaxial. These time-of-flight
    sensors have advantages over the triangulation type sensors because using the
    same path avoids trouble caused by obstacles that are slightly beside the path
    of the emitted beam, which can cause a deflection or absorption of the reflected
    beam in the case of the triangulation sensors. However, triangulation sensors
    are regarded as more precise when measuring over short distances. Some modern
    laser sensors are operating with small beam diameters (in the millimeter range),
    high measuring frequency, and high energy density to compensate for ambient light.
    These compensations are important to receive distinct signals from measurements
    on-the-go under environmental conditions which are often difficult due to dust
    and ambient light. In the trials presented here, two laser rangefinders were used.
    The Lase ODS 1600 HT 2-select is a triangulation type sensor manufactured by LASE
    GmbH, Wesel, Germany. It is a modified version of the ODS 1400 with enhanced power,
    increased measuring distance and a smaller housing. The second sensor was the
    Acuity AccuRange 4000-LIR from Schmitt Measurement Systems Inc., Portland, OR.
    The Acuity sensor uses the coaxial modulated beam time-of-flight technology. The
    characteristics of the sensors are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Specifications

    The Sensor System The sensors were mounted on a Hege tool carrier (Fig. 3) that
    was used because of minimum crop damage due to its high ground clearance of approximately
    0.8 m. Sensor readings and inclination (in the scanning mode, see below) were
    collected at 5000 Hz using DasyLab based data acquisition software on a laptop
    PC (DasyLab, measX GmbH & Co KG, Mönchengladbach, Germany). Coordinates of a differential
    global positioning system (dGPS) were stored every second (Trimble, AgGPS with
    OMNISTAR correction, Trimble Navigation Ltd, Sunnyvale, CA). Distance readings
    of the laser rangefinders were converted to heights, which were subsequently averaged
    over time intervals of 1 s and attributed to the GPS positions. As shown in Fig.
    2, the measured reflection distance lR depends on crop parameters such as height,
    density, and shape, the sensor inclination (zentithal angle) ϕ, and the aboveground
    sensor height hS. To obtain the reflection height hR of the crop, the influences
    of hS and ϕ must be regarded according to Eq. [2]: (2) The crops under investigation
    are usually seeded in narrow rows (approximately 14 cm row spacing for cereals),
    and it is possible that a zenithal laser beam was preferentially hitting the intrarow
    area, thus producing biased measurements of the reflection distance of the canopy.
    An oblique orientation of the laser beam could likely prevent this problem. Therefore,
    different inclination angles were used to investigate whether inclination of the
    laser influences the results. The sensors were arranged as either fixed at 0°
    (zenithal), fixed at 30° (oblique), or oscillating between −15 and +15° (scanning
    mode). Warren Wilson (1959) suggested 57.5° as the optimum zenith angle (ϕ). However,
    due to our experiences the accuracy in determining hR decreased with increasing
    ϕ because of the shaking caused by the moving vehicle. Due to the same reason,
    localization of measurement points becomes less accurate when ϕ increases. Figure
    3 Open in figure viewer (left) The Hege tool carrier in 2005 and (right) the mounting
    of laser sensors onto the height control unit in 2006. Field Trials Field trials
    were conducted in 2005 and 2006 on commercial fields. The fields were located
    in northeast Germany, approximately 40 km east of Berlin (52°27'' N, 13°01'' E).
    The average annual precipitation in this area is 592 mm, and the average temperature
    is 8.7°C. The soil texture is predominantly sandy with considerable small-scale
    variation due to the glacial and postglacial origin of the parent material. The
    main soil types are Dystric Arenosols, Leptic Cambisols, Dystic Leptosols, Albic
    Arenosols, and Humic Gleysols. Trials in 2005 Research in 2005 focused on the
    temporal relationships between the sensor readings and LAI. The reference LAI
    was obtained by a SunScan SS1 LAI meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK) (Fig.
    1). From April to June 145 runs were performed in oilseed rape, winter rye, and
    winter wheat. Growth stages ranged from BBCH 31 to 79 for oilseed rape, BBCH 31
    to 69 for winter rye, and BBCH 31 to 61 for winter wheat (see Meier, 1997 for
    BBCH code). In these tests, we were restricted to the Lase triangulation sensor
    because this was the only sensor available to us at that time. During the test
    runs, the sensor beam was directed vertically on the ground (ϕ = 0°) or inclined
    (ϕ = 30°) (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 left). Ground speed during the measurements was 2
    m s−1, and readings were taken only at the test plots. The sensor height, hS for
    each plot was obtained by an additional run with the distance sensor after harvesting
    and removing the plants from the plots. Trials in 2006 In 2006, only the spatial
    relationships were studied after the sensor system was optimized, and a second
    laser rangefinder was introduced. Improvement of the system was achieved by an
    automatic height control unit. In addition to the Lase sensor, an Acuity rangefinder
    was used. Both sensors were mounted side by side taking readings at approximately
    the same locations (Fig. 3 right). The tests were performed in winter rye at BBCH
    51 (17 May 2006, field Schneiderfichten) and winter wheat at BBCH 47 to 55 (6
    June 2006, field Heineberg). Laser distance readings were averaged over 1 s while
    the tool carrier was driving at approximately 1.3 m s−1. Positions were recorded
    by a dGPS Trimble AgGPS132. After investigating the mapping results, test plots
    were selected in each field to obtain a wide range of spatial variation in reflection
    height. Two runs were performed with the sensors in a fixed zenithal position
    (ϕ = 0°). A second series of runs was performed in the scanning mode where the
    inclination of the sensors was oscillating between −15° and +15°. Due to the height
    control unit, the sensor height (hS) above ground level was kept constant even
    though ground level in and between the wheel tracks may be diverging (Ehlert et
    al., 2006). Reference Measurements The test plots for reference measurements were
    selected between the wheel tracks of a tramline. The width of the plots was approximately
    1.15 m, and the length was 10 m in 2005 and 2 m in 2006. The reference LAI was
    obtained by averaging 10 replicated measurements per plot with the SunScan SS1
    LAI meter. To evaluate crop biomass, plots were hand harvested. The area of each
    plot was measured by a ruler. The weight of fresh biomass was obtained in the
    field by using a handheld electronic scale. Fresh matter density (FM, kg m−2)
    was calculated based on the area of the plots. In 2006 the plots were geo-referenced
    by a handheld dGPS Garmin GPS60 (Garmin Ltd., Olathe, KS) with EGNOS differential
    service. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Systat
    12.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA), Matlab (The Mathworks, Nattick, MA)
    and Surfer 8.0 (Golden Software, Golden, CO). The mapping results and reference
    plots in 2006 were not always exactly co-located, because positioning errors could
    have occurred due to GPS errors (4 m is in the range of the typical accuracy of
    the Garmin dGPS). Thus, spatially weighted correlation and regression was calculated
    between the mobile laser readings and reference measurements at the plots. Laser
    readings within a distance of 4 m were included in this analysis. Weights were
    derived from the inverse distances between the laser and the plot positions. To
    account for measurement errors in both variables, (spatially weighted) orthogonal
    regression was applied (Gentle, 2002). For correlation analysis, Pearson''s linear
    coefficient r and Spearman''s rank coefficient ρ were calculated. Spearman''s
    rank coefficient can handle monotonic nonlinear relationships. Independent correlation
    coefficients were compared by the t test using Fisher z-transformed data, dependent
    correlations, having a common variable coming from the same population, were compared
    by Steiger''s z-test (Sachs and Hedderich, 2006). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Investigations
    over Time During the temporal study in 2005, the LAI varied between 4.5 and 9.1
    for oilseed rape, 0.9 and 7.9 for winter wheat, and 1.9 and 4.0 for winter rye.
    Results from the comparison of the reflection height, LAI and FM are summarized
    in Fig. 4 and Table 2. Deviations from the regression lines in Fig. 4 indicate
    nonlinear relationships and the presence of outliers in some cases. Thus, we will
    mainly refer to Spearman''s rank coefficient ρ even though significant tests for
    ρ and r lead to the same conclusions in most cases. Rank correlations between
    LAI and hR generally increased from oilseed rape (0.410) to winter rye (0.839)
    to winter wheat (0.931); those between oilseed rape and winter wheat were significantly
    different (p = 0.005). The overall correlation FM and hR (0.988) was higher than
    the overall correlation between LAI and hR (0.815) and LAI and FM (0.832), but
    these differences were not significant. Biomass-hR relationship in terms of ρ
    was fairly similar for all crops (oilseed rape: 0.986, winter rye: 0.976, winter
    wheat: 0.920). Consequently, no significant differences were indicated by the
    t test. Sensor inclination had no significant influence on LAI-hR and FM-hR correlations
    (0° inclination, LAI-hR: 0.842; 30° inclination, LAI-hR: 0.775; 0° inclination,
    FM-hR: 0.986; 30° inclination, FM-hR: 0.990). Table 2. Correlation and orthogonal

    figure viewer Relationship between reflection height (hR), leaf area index (LAI),
    and fresh matter (FM) measured at different growth stages in 2005 for oilseed
    rape, winter rye, and winter wheat. A closer look at the data in Fig. 4 reveals
    some irregularities. For oilseed rape, the highest reflection heights measured
    appear to be outliers. The LAI and FM correspond well over the range of growth
    stages; however, hR and LAI as well as hR and FM may have shown a different trend
    when the growth stage of flowering (BBCH 60–69) was excluded. This can be explained
    by the presence of petals during flowering. The petals increased the number of
    reflective surfaces in the upper levels of the crop canopy. This caused the laser
    rangefinder to produce a higher hR (1.3 m in the zenithal mode and 1.5 m in the
    oblique mode) than before or after flowering (about 1 m in the zenithal mode and
    1.2 m in the oblique mode). Interestingly, flowering had very little influence
    on the LAI measurements with the LAI meter. This can be explained by the fact
    that the LAI meter is not only sensitive to direct light but also to transmitted
    and diffuse light, and that petals are not absorbing much light in the effective
    range of the LAI meter (Potter et al., 1996). There are also outliers in the data
    sets from winter rye and winter wheat. While FM and hR fit neatly to the straight
    line, the relationships to the LAI were contaminated by at least one outlying
    observation where the LAI was seemingly underestimated by the LAI meter. Spatial
    Investigations The LAI readings of winter rye in the field Schneiderfichten ranged
    from 1 to 4.6 m2 m−2, whereas fresh biomass varied between 0.29 and 4.25 kg m−2.
    Table 3 shows the correlations with the reflection height obtained by the two
    lasers in two modes. Most of the correlations were significant except situations
    where the Lase sensor in the scanning mode was involved. The Acuity sensor produced
    significantly (p = 0.011) better correlations with the LAI than the Lase sensor.
    The Acuity sensor working in a scanning mode produced the best results. However,
    these differences were not significant. The correlation of hR with FM (r = 0.860)
    was much better (p = 0) than hR with the LAI (r = 0.793) for both sensors. This
    is likely a result of the limited accuracy of the LAI meter. Table 3. Correlations
    between reflection height (hR), leaf area index (LAI), and fresh matter (FM) measured

    with winter wheat, the LAI ranged from 1.2 to 6.3 m2 m−2, whereas fresh biomass
    ranged from 0.57 to 5.30 kg m−2. The locations of the 10 reference plots and mapping
    results are shown in Fig. 5. To obtain the LAI map, hR readings were converted
    into LAI by a weighted orthogonal linear regression model derived from the measurements
    at the reference plots, according to Eq. [3]: (3) For this model, the weighted
    r2 was 0.944, and the standard error of estimate was 0.48 m2 m−2. After conversion
    of hR readings into LAI, the estimated LAI values were interpolated on a regular
    grid by means of ordinary kriging. The resulting map is shown in Fig. 5. The correlations
    of the Acuity sensor readings with LAI and FM were better in all cases (Table
    4). Furthermore, the Acuity sensor output produced nearly identical regression
    lines for all four runs. The overall correlation for Acuity''s hR with LAI was
    0.906 whereas the overall correlation of Lase''s hR with LAI was 0.897. While
    this difference in correlations was small it was not confirmed by the test of
    significance. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Measurements in winter wheat (field

    in the scanning mode (r fixed = 0.956, r scanning = 0.985, p = 0.022). On the
    contrary, the Lase sensor was not significantly superior in the scanning mode
    (p = 0.859). These results are shown in Fig. 6 from measurements in the scanning
    mode (this was the best run of the Lase sensor). Furthermore, the scattering of
    points around the regression lines for Acuity and LAI or FM is very similar to
    that of LAI and FM. This indicates that the LAI meter provides no better estimate
    of FM than the Acuity range finder (p = 0.806). The highly significant linear
    correlation of 0.983 between FM and LAI express a close relationship between these
    parameters. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Measurements in winter wheat, scanning
    mode, first run. Leaf area index (LAI), fresh matter (FM), reflection height by

    Pearson''s correlation coefficients are placed in the lower left triangle of the
    matrix. Coefficients of the orthogonal linear regression (“a” for intercept and
    “b” for slope) are placed in upper right triangle of the matrix. Repeatability
    in Practice Two runs of each sensor configuration were performed to test the ability
    of the sensors to reproduce values. Pairs of hR readings were collected within
    a range of 0.6 m summing up to 7020 observations. The Acuity sensor replicated
    measurements much better than the Lase rangefinder. This was true for both the
    fixed and the scanning modes. The overall correlation between the different runs
    was r = 0.893 for the Acuity sensor and r = 0.719 for the Lase sensor, which was
    significantly different with p = 0. Figure 7 shows an example of the repeatability
    in the fixed mode. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer Repeatability of laser readings
    in the fixed mode. Scatter plots of second run vs. first run with regression line
    (left: Lase sensor, right: Acuity sensor). Coefficients of the orthogonal linear
    regression are “a” for intercept and “b” for slope. Pearson''s correlation coefficient
    is denoted as r. The mean reflection heights of the Lase sensor were generally
    higher than those from the Acuity sensor (Table 5 and Fig. 7). Analysis of variance
    confirmed the significance of this difference (Table 6). Diverging results may
    be partly related to the measuring principle and partly related to the signal
    processing within the Lase sensor. From laboratory tests by Ehlert and Adamek
    (2007), it was shown that during dynamic measurements, the Lase sensor tends to
    produce an offset that increases with distance. The offset for the Lase sensor
    was larger than for the Acuity sensor. This discrepancy is likely caused by the
    triangulation principle used by the Lase sensor. As indicated in the materials
    and methods section, the triangulation principle can have a disadvantage due to
    its biaxial path analysis. It requires that the reflected light returns on a different
    path than the emitted light. Crop parts slightly beside the emitted beam can attenuate
    or mask the reflected beam. This obstruction is likely to increase the deeper
    the laser beam penetrates into the canopy. Thus, the triangulation-based sensors
    may receive fewer reflections from the soil surface or deeper layers of the canopy
    than from the upper layers of the canopy. This may also be the reason why the
    increase of the average hR of the Lase sensor in the scanning mode compared to
    the fixed mode is significantly stronger than increase of the average hR obtained
    by the Acuity sensor in the respective modes (Tables 5 and 6). Table 5. . Average

    The investigations over time in oilseed rape, winter rye, and winter wheat showed
    that LAI and mean reflection height (hR) obtained by laser rangefinders are closely
    correlated. Consequently, LAI estimation by hR is applicable for these crops over
    a range of growth stages. Specific limitations appear in oilseed rape during flowering.
    Petals caused the rangefinder to produce increased values of reflection height,
    which were not in accordance with the hR to LAI relationship at other growth stages.
    Less significant differences in hR to LAI correlation were observed between rye
    and wheat. Correlations between LAI and hR were consistently slightly better in
    winter wheat. This can likely be explained by the long awns of winter rye. While
    the size of these structures can sometimes be smaller than the laser beam diameter,
    incomplete reflections may occur, which can disturb the sensor. Due to the speed
    of measurements and the compactness of the sensor, the method offers high potential
    for mapping large areas in a short time. The practical tests under field conditions
    have shown the feasibility of laser-based mapping of LAI under harsh environmental
    conditions. However, there are marked differences between the sensors studied.
    Whereas measurements of the reflection height by the Lase sensor showed more outliers,
    poorer correlation, and less accuracy, measurements by the Acuity sensor based
    on the time of flight principle achieved better results. Tractor mounted spectral
    reflectance based crop sensors such as the Yara N-Sensor, the Green Seeker, and
    the Crop Circle are being increasingly adopted in agricultural practice. For example,
    more than 900 units of the Yara N-Sensor were sold worldwide (Agricon, 2011).
    However, spectral reflectance sensors are limited in detecting the LAI after canopy
    closure (Heege et al., 2008). Laser distance sensors offer new opportunities in
    surveying this highly relevant crop parameter. The method presented here can be
    used in agricultural research as well as in site-specific crop management on practical
    farms. Unmistakably, adoption by agricultural equipment manufacturers and farmers
    requires lower prices for laser rangefinders with small beam diameters and sufficient
    power to work under difficult ambient light conditions. Laser systems meeting
    these requirements are under development to be implemented in automotive collision
    avoidance and driving assistance systems (Ewald and Willhoeft, 2000; Jones, 2001;
    Velupillai and Guvenc, 2009). First systems are readily available, for example,
    the ibeo LUX Fusion System (Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Mass
    production and progress in laser technology will result in reduced prices (Velupillai
    and Guvenc, 2009). Prices of about $2000 are anticipated. Testing these automotive
    laser scanners in agricultural applications is part of ongoing research. Optimization
    of the sensor inclination angle should be investigated in the light of Warren
    Wilson''s (1959) point quadrat theory. However, point quadrat theory may not be
    fully applicable because it assumes the point quadrats to be of constant diameter
    while laser beams show a certain divergence which causes a widening of the beam
    diameter with increasing distance. Additionally, deviation from the inclination
    angle due to shaking of the sensor during vehicle motion has to be regarded. Further
    research should aim to investigate other crops and management scenarios as well
    as the simplification of hR conversion into LAI values by the establishment of
    calibration tables. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the editors

    into agriculture presents a significant challenge; at the same time, this technology
    contributes effectively in many countries'' economic and social development. In
    this work, we will study environmental data provided by precision agriculture
    information technologies, which represents a crucial source of data in need of
    being wisely managed and analyzed with appropriate methods and tools in order
    to extract the meaningful information. Our main purpose through this paper is
    to propose an effective Big data architecture based on profiling system which
    can assist (among others) producers, consulting companies, public bodies and research
    laboratories to make better decisions by providing them real time data processing,
    and a dynamic big data service composition method, to enhance and monitor the
    agricultural productivity. Thus, improve their traditional decision-making process,

    SECTION I. Introduction In the recent years, the huge volume of real time data
    in the agricultural sector and its need for an efficient and effective processing,
    stimulate the use of novel technologies and platform to acquire, store, process,
    analyze and visualize large data sets for future predictions and decision making.
    Big Data is an evolving term given to a wide area of data-intensive technologies
    in which the datasets are extremely large that dealing with them become more challenging
    than how it was before [1]. Due to the critical challenges facing the agriculture
    sector [2], farmers feel more forced to adopt intensive farming practices and
    sustainable agricultural ones, in order to increase both economic and environmental
    costs. Being able to know where and when to apply fertilizers, meeting demand
    for food while maintaining soil fertility, predicting future climatic conditions,
    controlling pests and diseases that are affecting crops and livestock, monitoring
    plants growth and productivity, applying efficient and sustainable techniques
    to crop production, all of these represent great challenges to be overcome in
    the near future [3]. In this context, varieties of terminologies and techniques
    have been done to make agricultural practices more efficient, having as purpose
    to increase yields and productivity while optimizing the use of natural resources
    and reducing the negative impacts of intensive farming on the environment. Among
    these techniques we mention Precision Farming [4] (PF), Smart Agriculture, Global
    Positioning System (GPS) [5], and Geographic information System (GIS) [6] etc.,
    but the underlying concept in all of them is the same. The main goal of this paper
    is to provide an elastic and variable Big data architecture based on a profiling
    system, which aims at providing to agricultural actors a dynamic Big data service
    composition and an accurate analytical method to help them retrieving meaningful
    information, in order to enhance decision making. Our approach responds to the
    situation where many users with different interest shall work in a centralized
    platform such as Cloud Computing. By using a dynamic and accurate selection of
    Big Data services, the agricultural actors can exploit data in real time and with
    appropriate tools. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
    II presents the related work. Big data and cloud computing application in Precision
    Agriculture will be discussed in Section III. Section IV describes the profile
    based architecture for agricultural big data description, its main components,
    and the methodological approach used. In section V, a case study based on our
    approach is presented and described in detail. Finally, Section VI provides a
    summary and upcoming perspectives. SECTION II. Related Work Precision farming
    (PF) is simply the information technology applied to agriculture [4]. It aims
    to optimize yields and investments by automatic and real-time monitoring of site
    specific environmental and soil conditions (e.g. soil type, fertility levels,
    etc.) using four technologies: remote sensing [7] (RS), geographic information
    systems (GIS), positioning systems (GPS) and process control. Precision farming
    technique was sufficient for small-scale farms, it deals with a set of data coming
    from sensors, GPS, GIS limited to a few hundred meters for a specific crop land
    area. WSN architecture was particularly well adapted to meet the needs of precision
    farming. This kind of network is composed of a large number of spatially distributed
    sensor nodes, able to cooperate with each other using wireless communication.
    Regarding sensing, computing, processing and communication capabilities, we can
    continuously sense and transmit agricultural data to a base station where data
    can be stored, analyzed and observed in real time [8]. The WSN architecture adopted
    in PF was limited to a very small field size compared to the average of agricultural
    fields that exist, it focused on processing data from a local area using a remote
    control station in order to help farmer to make decisions related to its own farm,
    without carrying about the other external requirements (e.g. logistics, concurrence,
    market prices, etc.). However, the implementation of these technologies has highlighted
    some limitations for precision farming. The emergence of new needs such as real-time
    processing and analysis of collected data, predicting weather and climate changes
    at the right time, integrating logistics requirements in the agricultural data
    process since the acquisition phase until the production one, has open new track
    of research. Hence the need to go for the new trend of information technology
    such as big data and cloud computing is a very prominent case study to consider.
    Responding to this need, we propose a novel approach which mixes and matches between
    Big Data technologies, cloud computing and a new profiling system, within the
    same architecture, in order to boost agricultural production sustainably and yields
    in the years ahead. SECTION III. The Main Purpose of Using Big Data and Cloud
    Computing for Precision Agriculture With the recent technological advances in
    data analysis, data processing and decision making tools, information technology
    for agriculture becomes an evidence. Actually, many farms are using these advanced
    technologies to facilitate crop management, minimize losses and maximize yields.
    Our approach adds a new concept to these technologies in order to build an elastic
    and variable Big Data architecture based on the user''s needs: the profiling system.
    In this section, we will start by describing the main advantages of using Big
    Data and Cloud Computing in the context of agriculture. We will describe the profiling
    system in more details in the next section. A. Big Data for Agriculture Big Data
    [1] can be simply defined as the huge amounts of data in need for an in-depth
    analysis and processing with the use of additional computational support. Agricultural
    practices, in all their forms, are responsible of the considerable data quantity
    (yield/production, remote sensing data, etc.), and they use a large number of
    external data (weather data, satellite images, etc.) to guide farmer decisions.
    Looking behind these examples, three characteristics are typically used to describe
    the big agricultural data phenomenon; Volume, Variety, Velocity [9]. In other
    words, data originates from agriculture can be considered as a Big Data by reason
    of its data variety with huge volume following high velocity. The interest of
    agricultural Big Data is to cross, process and analyze the data produced from
    distributed and heterogeneous sources in order to generate added value applications
    that will meet the needs and requirements of various end users. B. Cloud Computing
    for Big Data Environment Cloud computing [10] is the ideal model for large data
    because of its endless scalability and resources used on-demand. It promises reliable
    services based on virtualized storage technologies. Resort to a cloud computing
    technology in agriculture can give considerable solutions to analysts and decision
    makers [11]. Using the cloud, we can benefit from special bricks in Big Data management
    to collect and centralize data the maximum as possible regardless their sources,
    to make detailed analysis in order to obtain valuable data. This can be ensured
    by the use of new database models including mixed approaches between relational
    and non-relational (NoSQL) databases, also by a distributed architecture at processing
    level of unstructured data with the aim to spread the load over a large number
    of servers (cluster) using a total abstraction of subjacent parallelizing mechanism
    (Hadoop 1 principle) [12]. SECTION IV. Our Profile Based Architecture for Precision
    Agriculture One of the main features of our architecture is that it behaves differently
    with each type of user, and it uses dynamically different Big data services based
    on the type of information requested. As depicted on figure 1, the service composition
    provider represents a crucial component in the architecture, because it is responsible
    of creating the user profile that will query the system as well as creating the
    related big data services that will be used to meet the requirements requested
    by this user. The creation of suitable Big data services that can be adapted to
    each kind of user and any data source is our ultimate goal. To this end, the methodological
    approach that we will follow is composed of three main steps: The description
    of users profile; The selection of accurate Big data services for each profile;
    The composition of the Big data services for each profile. Each step of our methodological
    approach is briefly described as follows. Fig. 1: A profile based architecture
    for agricultural big data Show All As shown in the figure 1, the datasets are
    generated from various sources such as sensors, weather stations, satellites and
    public bodies. The data gathering is quite a crucial task because it will help
    in bringing together these data sources before going through the storage process.
    In this work, we focus more on the Big data service composition and the profile
    service, while the acquisition service will be addressed in our future work. A.
    The Users Profile Description Due to the increasing use of ubiquitous technology
    including desktops, mobile devices, servers and sensor networks, data might be
    available at any time and from anywhere. In this vein, we propose a profile based
    architecture (see figure 1) which is dedicated to manage various users according
    to their nature, by providing them meaningful information that can support the
    adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. This proposal interacts with multiple
    user categories depending on their access rules, and it offers a suite of services
    that let them benefit from real-time monitoring of data gathered from distributed
    fields. The users can have as profile: farmer, research laboratory, policy maker,
    public administration, consulting or logistic company, etc. Fig. 2: The user specifications
    description Show All Within this step of our method, we shall understand the business
    process in a good manner and the phases through which passes the processed data
    flow. Because if we get any trouble describing the user needs from the beginning,
    the interactions conducted between actors and systems will be translated differently
    from what is specified by the user. Hence, the non-efficiency of the next two
    steps. In the context of UML, a sequence diagram is a good way to visualize and
    validate various runtime interactions between actors and the system [13]. These
    can help to predict how the system will behave while describing the sequence of
    actions that will be carried out. For that reason, having a sequence diagram specification
    (see figure 2) allow us to know whether our system is compliant with the specification
    in the desired way, also the system should potentially be able to perform every
    behavior that the specification requires it to offer. Among the various profiles
    pointed out above, we describe two types of user profile who are studied from
    our system: a. Farmer Profile Farmers are ever more users of online applications,
    as they are also asking for more mobility. In this vein, they can use their own
    devices in order to be connected to our profiling system. They can single out
    all relevant information related with the best crops for a given date and location,
    by using sensor, climate and weather data. b. Lab Research Profile Research laboratory
    represents another kind of users who benefits more from our system. Generally,
    it is composed of a set of members like scientists, agronomists, biologists, etc.
    The goal of our system is to provide them a platform for high resolution crop
    analysis in real world growing conditions, which support their experiments. On
    the one hand, they can study the requirements of the cultivated plant, facing
    its growth and production goals, according to its vegetative stages. On the other
    hand, they can be able to follow weather events which vary from year to year,
    and pests which evolve in their location and behavior. B. The Selection of Accurate
    Big Data Services Once we define the runtime actions between the users and the
    system, and before moving to create the correspondent big data services that provide
    ingestion, storage, processing, analysis, research and visualization of data,
    we need to identify various criteria to be taken into account, when choosing the
    right tools, and which meet the specifications required in the previous step.
    Here, we explain how we choose services from the specifications made by a user
    profile. In our context, we are dealing with a wide variety of agricultural data
    sources, so we can find: i) static data coming from some departments specialized
    in agriculture and environmental conditions like historical crop yield, soil conditions,
    land capability, suitability and vocation. These later are generally stored in
    relational databases, and they must integrate a big data system using efficient
    ingestion tools to be stored, analyzed and processed; ii) sensor, weather and
    image are represented as the persistent real time data, because they require real
    time processing in order to get better control at an appropriate time, and powerful
    analytics engine which leverages a distributed and parallel paradigm of Big Data
    processing (e.g, MapReduce1, Strom4) to analyze large volumes of data, generating
    actionable insights rapidly. Additionally, these static and dynamic data require
    querying and scripting languages to simplify the use of MapReduce programs written
    in Java for a business user''s perspectives. We can also note as a selection criterion,
    machine learning, because in some cases we will need to use a predictive model
    for example to manage pests and diseases. Finally, all these data types are requested
    to be available for exploration and visualization using flexible and real time
    tools. As for the characteristics described in the table I, we note batch data
    processing which is an efficient way of processing high volumes of data, and it
    is where data could be gathered quietly over a period of time before being analyzed
    by packet. In contrast, real time processing is designed to act on realtime streaming
    data in a small time period (or near real time). Batch querying is the query process
    that can simultaneously analyze several queries at once. However, real time querying
    enables faster queries (e.g, input/output of key/value) and the operations run
    in real time on its database rather than Mapreduce jobs. Regarding the data access,
    it can be random read and write which enables to do faster lookups for analytics
    irrespective of data size. In the other hand, streaming read access provides continuous
    reads with a constant bitrate, as opposed to reading data as packets or chunks.
    Fig. 3: Selection of accurate big data services Show All Table I: Big data services
    and characteristics As depicted on figure 3, once we identify the needs of the
    user, we try to retrieve different features that correspond to the specifications
    given in each scenario. C. The Composition of Big Data Services The data deluge
    that we address is likely to become even more acute as we opt for a new generation
    of tools. Based on the user specification, data type and its processing requirements,
    we propose a suite of tools in table I which contain the characteristics to be
    considered in order to process agricultural data in an efficient manner. And from
    this criteria table, we can conceive the component diagram containing the various
    Big data services required (see figure 4). Among these characteristics we note
    real time processing, querying and charting; batch processing which is usually
    used for static and historical data; data flow and SQL languages; machine learning
    analytics; streaming reads and random access. According to all these features,
    we can identify what is the most appropriate tool to a specific need, that is
    to say if we consider having Mahout machine learning application, it takes initiatives
    like real world data sets management in precision agriculture, where it can gain
    knowledge from historical unstructured data, uncover patterns to predict events
    that are hurtful for farming. Thus, these patterns and decisions may help landowners
    in the disaster management of their fields. Moreover, this predictive and analytics
    solution can ensure automatic irrigation and water management (e.g., as per soil
    moisture and new technology of irrigation) in real time to enhance best practices
    to crops. Fig. 4: Composition of big data services Show All SECTION V. A Case
    Study: Farmer and Research Lab In this section, our methodological approach will
    be further described and applied to two cases of study in order to show how we
    can provide a dynamic architecture based on big data components and tools. Farmer
    and research lab profiles were chosen as scenarios of profile to describe consequential
    operations of profiling system. A. Farmer Scenario Among the specific tasks done
    by farmers, we mention: understanding the implications of the weather and making
    contingency plans; buying supplies, such as fertilizer and seeds; as well as maintaining
    and monitoring the quality of yield, whether livestock or crops; knowing the variety
    of cultivated plants, conditions of its growth and its needs of seeds; choosing
    the type of fertilizer and pesticides, understanding their employment conditions
    and their impact on the climate-soil-plant; recognizing daily water needs for
    each kind of plant; calculating the median and mean values of yield; studying
    the conditions of natural environment; having knowledge about cultivation techniques
    employed and having the ability to estimate the financial revenue and manage the
    potential risks. In order to discover the functionalities that we aim to reach
    using our proposal, we choose to treat as a case study the example of wheat cultivation.
    Generally, this later follow five steps before it becomes ready for consumption.
    These steps are explained in the following diagram: Fig. 5: Wheat cultivation
    steps Show All Taking into consideration the various steps of wheat cultivation
    process, we focus on one of them which is watering, and we put forward the related
    sequence diagram (see figure 6) to illustrate and clarify the interactions between
    actors and systems for a farmer profile needs. Fig. 6: Farmer sequence diagram
    for watering step Show All Based on the sequence diagram above and the characteristics
    mentioned in table I, the service composition provider will create the suitable
    big data services that respond to the farmer requests according to the selected
    criteria. The big data services created differ according to the nature of data
    processed and the type of processing and analysis required. Figure 7 shows all
    big data component used for a farmer profile. In this case, the system component
    diagram is composed of diverse tools that deal with agricultural data in the different
    phases of data flow, from the acquisition step to the visualization and exploration
    one. Static data requested by farmer are integrated to HDFS for storage using
    Sqoop2 , which is used to import data from external sources into related Hadoop1
    component. Unlike data coming from relational databases (RDBMS), sensor and weather
    data which are fully unstructured are collected from their origin and sent back
    to the storage location HDFS1 through Flume3 . Fig. 7: System component diagram
    for a farmer profile Show All Then, once we have stored data in HDFS we cannot
    make changes. This is why we managed to work with HBase1, a persistent NoSQL data
    store where we can make changes in our data also after writing it once, because
    HBase supports random ‘read or write’ access to big datasets. Storm4 is used for
    processing data in real time. In our case, we need to process sensor data in order
    to know soil moisture level, also we need to predict weather changes at the right
    moment, for these reasons we selected Storm as a real time engine. Then, we have
    to query the processed data in hadoop. Hive1 and Pig1 can perform this function.
    Hive is used to process completely structured data as opposed to Pig which can
    be used for both structured as well as unstructured data. The difference between
    these two types of language is that Pig focuses on queries optimization aspect
    and provides control on the data flow more than Hive. Mahout1 is needed to forecast
    weather changes (e.g. the farmer decides whether it is time to water the crop
    using irrigation techniques or not). Having data from various sources available
    through Hive and Pig, we need to get it into Elasticsearch5 which is able to achieve
    fast search responses, instead of searching the text directly, it goes through
    an indexed search. It also holds the data, provides the analytics engine, and
    it is used as predecessor of Kibana5 which provides in its turn the visualization
    rendering and the generation of queries into Elasticsearch. Finally, the farmer
    can get clear graphs and dashboards proposed by Kibana tool to help him for making
    smart and accurate decision. B. Research Lab Scenario The present case study is
    related to a research lab profile. As an entity, the research lab has several
    activities to execute daily in an agricultural field. Among these later, we remain
    in the same example about wheat cultivation shown in the previous scenario, and
    we describe in figure 8 the different interactions performed to predict the disease
    X that can affect the wheat crop. So, the research lab must be able to detect
    the right location of this disease as earlier as possible and limits its spread
    in the entire field [14]. Fig. 8: Research lab sequence diagram for predicting
    crop disease Show All As mentioned previously, the big data system components
    required changes depending on the type of the data sources and the user''s needs.
    The diagram below gives the composition of big data services in the case of research
    lab profile. Fig. 9: System component diagram for a research lab profile Show
    All Regarding the research lab scenario, our system is faced to deal with dynamic
    data including satellite images, sensor and weather data. These data are invited
    to be stored in HDFS via Flume. Once stored, Mahout provides analytic methods
    and libraries to predict time and cause of future disease. Storm engine is used
    for real time processing. Pig is designed for querying the large datasets in Hadoop.
    Elasticsearch is used for the powerful search and analytic capabilities, while
    Kibana gives shape to any kind of data. SECTION VI. Conclusion In the present
    paper, we proposed a profile based approach to manage agricultural data within
    a cloud computing architecture. Our approach will guide the big data providers
    and the various agricultural actors to identify and select the best services adapted
    to their specific needs. By using our approach, the agricultural actors can easily
    integrate the world of big data customers, and benefit from the advantages of
    big data technologies. Actually, the work done in this paper is focused on the
    Big data service composition and the profile service identification and selection.
    In a future work, our approach will be extended by developing an application to
    automate the processes of selection and composition of big data services. Authors

    \ demand for food worldwide,\nimproving productivity in farming procedures is\
    \ essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes\nthe use of modern technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nto enhance\
    \ productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts\
    \ of data\nare collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks,\
    \ network-connected weather\nstations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These\
    \ data are valuable resources to be used in\ndata-driven services and decision\
    \ support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one\nof the major challenges\
    \ with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in\n\
    terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies\
    \ in a smart farming\necosystem have limited capability to work together due to\
    \ the lack of standardized practices for data\nand system integration. These issues\
    \ create a signiﬁcant challenge in cooperative service provision,\ndata and technology\
    \ integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper,\n\
    we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building\
    \ effective, reliable,\nand robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform\
    \ approach considers six requirements\nfor seamless integration, processing, and\
    \ use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming\nplatform include interoperability,\
    \ reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security\nand\
    \ privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform\
    \ that considers\nthese requirements leads to increased productivity, proﬁtability,\
    \ and performance of connected smart\nfarms. In this paper, we aim at introducing\
    \ the platform approach concept for smart farming and\nreviewing the requirements\
    \ for this approach.\nKeywords: smart farming; precise agriculture; platform approach;\
    \ interoperability; security and\nprivacy; reliability; scalability\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [1],\
    \ food\nproduction should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in the world\
    \ population by\n2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity\
    \ using solutions that con-\nsider resource shortage and farm proﬁtability [2].\
    \ Employing information communication\ntechnology (ICT), smart technologies, in\
    \ addition to the rapid development of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called\nsmart farming.\
    \ Smart farming is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4].\n\
    By managing inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart\
    \ system can\nhelp farmers to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall\
    \ costs, and to reach a\nmore sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher\
    \ productivity [5,6]. According to\nthe Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion\
    \ was dedicated to the global smart farming\nmarket in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs\
    \ to increase yields, improve livestock production,\nand reduce management costs\
    \ to meet the growing demand for food, smart farming should\nexperience rapid\
    \ growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060838\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n2 of 18\n\
    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data\
    \ are\ngenerated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent\
    \ different\naspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops,\
    \ soil, and the environ-\nment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial\
    \ images, human experiences, and\nobservations collected via mobile smartphone\
    \ applications [9]. Such data can be analyzed\nto ﬁlter out invalid or wrong data\
    \ [2] and to compute personalized recommendations for\na farm to improve productivity\
    \ [10]. Different modern technologies can be utilized for\ndata generation and\
    \ data analysis in digital agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are\nexamples\
    \ of technologies that have recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12].\n\
    Although data-driven solutions have provided various beneﬁts in agriculture, data\
    \ integra-\ntion, processing, and usage processes and protocols are still prominent\
    \ challenges that need\nto be addressed [13]. Some of these challenges are limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge of dig-\nitalization [14], lack of standardization and\
    \ suitable management to cope with fragmented\nand heterogeneous data [15], lack\
    \ of high-quality data and proper analysis [16], privacy\nand security challenges\
    \ in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and lack of compliance\nwith uniform\
    \ regulations and policies [18].\nA uniﬁed solution that considers the requirements\
    \ in various stages of the data pro-\ncessing lifecycle can address various issues\
    \ in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances\nawareness regarding the needs\
    \ and requirements of different data sources, technologies,\nprocesses, and protocols\
    \ (including policies). This solution assists the actors in smart\nfarming ecosystems\
    \ to provide their services and products to other parties in a more usable\nformat.\
    \ Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production, and sustainability\
    \ by\nproviding transparent and trustable data about every stage of the food chain.\
    \ In addition,\na uniﬁed solution provides an excellent opportunity for building\
    \ decision frameworks to\naggregate data from diverse sources and to provide high-quality\
    \ data-driven services. This\napproach also facilitates data sharing and multiparty\
    \ cooperation in farming applications,\nand thus, increases productivity and reduces\
    \ resource waste.\nIn this paper, we suggest the platform approach as a uniﬁed\
    \ solution that facilitates\ncooperation in smart farming applications. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach enforces relation-\nships between farmers and system providers\
    \ to track crop cycle information, livestock, and\ndairy production in a secure\
    \ manner for their decisions and data management.\nIn recent years, several platforms\
    \ have been proposed for smart farming applications.\nSmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based\
    \ platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary\nAustralian team to\
    \ automate the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and\nsoil\
    \ data. This platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and\
    \ cloud servers\nfor storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results\
    \ in the paper showed that\nSmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time\
    \ query responses. Moreover, the\nauthors demonstrated that increasing the number\
    \ of sensors had a negligible impact on the\nperformance of the system, therefore,\
    \ the proposed platform was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19]\nproposed Smart Farming\
    \ Oriented BigData Architecture (SFOBA), a platform for big data\nprocessing that\
    \ provided real-time processing on acquired data from smart farm systems and\n\
    devices. In this study, the authors utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset\
    \ [20] to show\nhow the proposed platform could finish multidimensional queries\
    \ on 40 million rows of data\nin less than one second. Clements et al. [21] developed\
    \ an interactive digital tool that collected\ndata from different sources such\
    \ as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and the Key\nIndicators Database\
    \ System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the\
    \ United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information regarding livestock\n\
    production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules for risk assessment\
    \ at the\ncountry level.\nAnother ﬁeld in smart farming is smart dairy farming\
    \ which aims to utilize modern\nsmart technologies to satisfy the increasing demand\
    \ for quality dairy products, to reduce\nconsumed resources, and to decrease the\
    \ ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed\nSmartHerd, a platform\
    \ enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and\nproviding\
    \ controls for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n3 of 18\nin Waterford, Ireland, and was developed to\
    \ gather and analyze data regarding dairy\ncattle. The presented platform is designed\
    \ to keep working when the internet connection\nis lost. The generated data in\
    \ this platform are stored locally and are shared on a cloud\ninfrastructure when\
    \ the internet connection is available.\nMost of the proposed platforms in smart\
    \ farming have focused on a speciﬁc aspect of\nsmart farming such as crop production\
    \ recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],\ndata transformation [19] reliability\
    \ [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing need to\ncollect, integrate,\
    \ analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated at farms, effective\nfarm\
    \ data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the adoption and success\
    \ of\ndigital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing studies have\
    \ not provided a\nholistically designed approach by considering different requirements\
    \ for smart farming\napplications. To ﬁll this gap, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a design thinking approach, which\nwe refer to as the “platform approach”, for\
    \ smart farming data processing. This approach\nencourages consideration of six\
    \ core requirements when designing, implementing, and\ntesting smart farming solutions.\
    \ These requirements are interoperability of data, processes,\nand technologies;\
    \ reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability\n\
    in terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;\
    \ real-time\ndata processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection\
    \ of infrastructure\nand smart farming assets (privacy and security); and ﬁnally,\
    \ compliance with policies and\nregulation. The proposed approach facilitates\
    \ cooperation among different parties in smart\nfarming ecosystems and enables\
    \ these actors to make the most use of available data sources.\nThe rest of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data\nprocessing\
    \ in smart farming systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges\n\
    and requirements in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate\
    \ the main\nrequirements and related solutions in a smart farming platform; ﬁnally,\
    \ in Section 5, we\nconclude the paper with a summary of the platform approach\
    \ and some future insights.\n2. The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart\
    \ Farming Systems\nTo improve smart farming data processing through the integration\
    \ of various systems,\nin this paper, we propose the concept of the platform approach,\
    \ which is a design approach\nfor data processing. The smart farming platform\
    \ approach allows farmers, researchers,\ntechnology providers, and all other stakeholders\
    \ to have a standard and reliable solution\nto collect and share information,\
    \ resources, and experiences to improve the productivity\nand performance of smart\
    \ farming solutions. We demonstrate an overview of the main\ncomponents of smart\
    \ farming data processing in Figure 1 in ﬁve main layers. This abstract\nplatform\
    \ can shed light on the components of the smart farming application platform,\n\
    deﬁning the main tasks and core components for data processing in these systems.\n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse\nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as\nweather and climate data. The collected data from these different\
    \ sources can be in different\nformats that are not compatible to be stored in\
    \ a unique database. In addition, some\ncollected data may contain incomplete\
    \ data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous\ninstances [26]. To address\
    \ these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices\nfor data preprocessing\
    \ can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These practices\ninclude standardizing\
    \ data to a predeﬁned format, identifying and deleting duplicated\ndata, handling\
    \ the gaps in generated data, and validating data sources and contents. Addi-\n\
    tionally, the collected data from different sources can be stored in a common\
    \ infrastructure\nand can be integrated with other data sources that are collected\
    \ from diverse smart farm-\ning systems. These methods assist in ensuring data\
    \ consistency, completeness [27], and\naccuracy [28]. The components in the second\
    \ and the third layers are highly correlated,\nand many of the smart farming data\
    \ processing functions can be assigned to both layers.\nThe data processing layer\
    \ components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical\nmodeling, statistical\
    \ methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge\nfrom farm\
    \ data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques to\
    \ make\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n4 of 18\nautomated decisions with limited human\
    \ involvement. Machine learning can perform\nrapid optimizations, classiﬁcations\
    \ [30], predictions, and recommendations and add value\nto the entire system [31].\
    \ For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton [13], utilizes machine\nlearning\
    \ for identifying individual cows. This system also monitors the cows to detect\n\
    disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at milking stations on dairy\
    \ farms.\nAs another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an open-source analytic platform\
    \ that uses machine\nlearning to categorize iceberg lettuces to improve the actual\
    \ yield and crop marketability\nbefore harvesting [32]. Model deployment in the\
    \ context of machine learning refers to\nthe application of generalizing a model\
    \ to predict new items in the system. Prediction is\naccording to estimating the\
    \ outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.\nFor example,\
    \ the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest time\n\
    and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction about\
    \ the future\nusing time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming\
    \ is weather forecasting\nusing temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].\n\

    \ branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques to \nmake automated decisions\
    \ with limited human involvement. Machine learning can per-\nform rapid optimizations,\
    \ classifications [30], predictions, and recommendations and add \nvalue to the\
    \ entire system [31]. For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton [13], utilizes\
    \ \nmachine learning for identifying individual cows. This system also monitors\
    \ the cows to \ndetect disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at\
    \ milking stations on dairy \nfarms. As another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an\
    \ open-source analytic platform that uses \nmachine learning to categorize iceberg\
    \ lettuces to improve the actual yield and crop mar\nFigure 1. Smart farming components\
    \ that facilitate integration, processing, and use of farm data.\nThe decision-making\
    \ stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model\nmetadata management\
    \ to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed\nmodel. Metadata\
    \ (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding of\nthe meaning\
    \ of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking devices\n\
    can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.\
    \ These data\ncan help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during\
    \ the decision-making\nprocess. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,\
    \ pesticide control, and\nwater management. In the last stage of smart farming\
    \ applications, end-users, i.e., farmers,\nfarming service providers, agriculture\
    \ researchers, and governments access the system\nresults through services. System\
    \ monitoring can audit the entire system and provide\nfeedback to optimize the\
    \ predictors and to improve decision making. In addition, rule\nmanagement can\
    \ check the compliance of decisions against available rules.\nSince trustworthiness\
    \ is a core requirement to ensure system adoption and use, it is\nnecessary to\
    \ consider security and privacy concerns in all communications and end-to-end\n\
    in the platform. Moreover, the data workﬂow should comply with the available policy\
    \ and\nregulations in smart farming. Application programming interfaces (APIs)\
    \ are common\nmethods for the integration of different components and resources\
    \ (e.g., data sources, legal\nprocesses, and policy protocols) in a platform approach.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n5 of 18\n3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart Farming\n\
    The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using platform\n\
    structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build effective,\
    \ reliable,\nand robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing a common\
    \ understanding\nand semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate in data-sharing\
    \ practices and\ncooperative service provision. In Section 2, we presented an\
    \ abstract overview of such a\nplatform as well as the main components of data\
    \ processing in smart farming systems. In\nthis section, we discuss the challenges\
    \ in smart farming applications and convey the major\nrequirements that any agricultural\
    \ platform should have to address these challenges.\nIn agriculture, data are\
    \ highly heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format,\nand intent\
    \ of data, different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data.\
    \ For\nexample, poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior\
    \ of birds, such\nas their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility\
    \ of a disease outbreak\nin the early stages. A major challenge in such an application\
    \ is combining heterogeneous\ndata collected from different sensors in smart poultry\
    \ farms. In addition to collecting and\nprocessing data, aggregating diverse data\
    \ among various farms can improve the prediction\noutcome. However, lack of interoperability\
    \ among data, technologies, and data processes is\na signiﬁcant barrier to reaching\
    \ this goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim\nto equip their farms\
    \ with new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers\ndo not\
    \ follow a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new\
    \ digital\ntools and devices to their smart farming network.\nIn the context of\
    \ smart farming, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more\ndifferent\
    \ systems, services, and components (i.e., software components and IoT devices)\
    \ to\nbe able to work together to exchange information, facilitate processes,\
    \ integrate technology\nsolutions, and comply with policies and legal requirements.\
    \ There are four categories of\ninteroperability including semantic/data interoperability,\
    \ technology or system interop-\nerability, operational interoperability, and\
    \ legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic\ninteroperability, the entities\
    \ should mutually agree on the meaning, content, and context\nof data exchange\
    \ and use [35]. Interoperability improves the ﬂexibility of smart farming\nnetworks\
    \ as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data sharing and enhance\n\
    their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability is standardization.\
    \ In the\ncontext of data processing, without mechanisms to take data from diverse\
    \ sources of digital\nagriculture solutions, it would be extremely resource based\
    \ and time-consuming to make\nthe most use of data. Using processes and best practices\
    \ that convert data and information\nto harmonized formats is critical to enabling\
    \ data sharing and integration practices and\ncollaborative decision making.\n\
    Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems, controlling data\
    \ reli-\nability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform. Data reliability,\
    \ sometimes referred\nto as data quality, is deﬁned as the extent to which the\
    \ data and its source are trustworthy,\nunfailing, authentic, genuine, and representative\
    \ of the problem [36]. Reliability can be\nevaluated at different levels, such\
    \ as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of\nview, it is essential\
    \ to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device\nthat is\
    \ physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid\
    \ and\nunstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming\
    \ platform should\nensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and\
    \ trustable. Data quality issues\nare also likely to arise in the integration\
    \ process as the quality of all data sources cannot\nbe veriﬁed [37,38]. Wrong\
    \ decisions originating from unreliable data in decision-making\nprocesses cost\
    \ agricultural businesses billions per year [39].\nScalability is another requirement\
    \ that should be considered while designing a smart\nfarming platform [40]. Scalability\
    \ in smart farming refers to the adaptability of a system\nto increase the capacity,\
    \ for example, the number of technology devices such as sensors\nand actuators,\
    \ while enabling timely analysis [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart\n\
    farming architecture, in the context of data processing, would lead to weak system\
    \ perfor-\nmance. For instance, integration with other devices and applications\
    \ may not be possible if\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n6 of 18\nscalability requirements\
    \ are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider\nthe possibility\
    \ of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems\nfrom\
    \ the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large\
    \ poultry\nproduction that owns farms in different locations. This company needs\
    \ a platform to build a\nscalable business by integrating the supply chain from\
    \ feed to hatcheries and poultry farms\nto distribution [43]. These poultry farms\
    \ may have different sensors and acquire various\ntypes of technologies to collect\
    \ data in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The\ncompany should\
    \ be able to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other compu-\ntation\
    \ resources to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need\
    \ for resource\ngrowth is not considered in the design of the system, the company\
    \ cannot easily expand\ntheir system to process and use other data sources. Platforms\
    \ for smart farming should\nconsider scalability as a core requirement to enable\
    \ growth and future needs for integration.\nMoreover, in smart farming systems,\
    \ we need fast and accurate decisions and actions.\nThus, we need platforms that\
    \ enable farmers to deliver proper actions at the right time.\nReal-time data\
    \ analytics is deﬁned as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data\n\
    when they are created or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer\
    \ decides to sell\ntheir products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting\
    \ access to data and making\ndecisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly\
    \ offering an estimation originated\nfrom outdated data. Real-time processing\
    \ is an approach to capture, process, and export\ndata promptly [46,47]. Furthermore,\
    \ real-time data processing enables smart farming actors\nto take proper decisions\
    \ at the right time which leads to minimizing risks and undesirable\nconsequences\
    \ [48]. A smart farming platform can also facilitate real-time processing as a\n\
    requirement for reinforcing farming practices and preparing farmers against unexpected\n\
    circumstances [45]. To achieve real-time data processing, it is also necessary\
    \ to collect the\ndata in real time. The results acquired based on analyzing old\
    \ data can cause inaccurate\ndecisions, while real-time data facilitates real-time\
    \ decisions and actions [46].\nSimilar to any other smart platform, a smart farming\
    \ platform should bring security\nand privacy to the core of attention and provide\
    \ sufﬁcient protection mechanisms. Mod-\nern technologies form an ecosystem in\
    \ which connected devices are accessible remotely,\nallowing adversaries to plan\
    \ cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to steal information or\ncarry out disruptive\
    \ actions on the smart farming systems [49]. For example, Yang et al.\nillustrated\
    \ how adversaries used IoT devices in IT infrastructure to compromise security\
    \ [4].\nAs an illustration, a malicious actor can get access to a farm’s data\
    \ using an unsecured\nsmart device and steal information about the products, ﬁnancial\
    \ decisions, and future plans.\nThe intruder can also damage the products and\
    \ equipment. Because of the availability\nof diverse data sources in smart farming\
    \ systems, including personal and business data,\nprivacy is another paramount\
    \ concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms\nto ensure security\
    \ requirements and data protection. These practices must protect data\nend-to-end\
    \ and in different data processing stages, from data collection to data-driven\n\
    service provision.\nRegulations for agricultural practices affect the design and\
    \ development of smart\nfarming technologies. For instance, farmers’ concerns\
    \ about data sharing and privacy\nhave been discussed in recent studies [50,51].\
    \ Farmers are not convinced that the available\npolicies to protect their intellectual\
    \ property, business proﬁt share, and privacy are sufﬁcient.\nThere are also concerns\
    \ about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and farm\ndata agreements\
    \ by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns and build\ntrust,\
    \ there is a need to establish standards and best practices that mandate the rights\
    \ and\nresponsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems. There is\
    \ also the need to set\nstandards for data-sharing practices and to apply policies\
    \ to determine accountability and\npenalties in the case of possible disputes.\
    \ Other regulations related to food safety, supply\nchain management, disease\
    \ monitoring, and other applications can also impact agriculture\ndata management\
    \ and processing. These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new\nand emerging\
    \ agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded\ninto\
    \ technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability purposes.\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 838\n7 of 18\nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend\
    \ consideration of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for\
    \ smart farming data processing. These\nrequirements enable seamless integration\
    \ of data, system, and processes with the end-user\nin mind. They include interoperability\
    \ to provide compatibility among different compo-\nnents of the platform; real-time\
    \ processing to generate fast and accurate information for\ndecision making; scalability\
    \ that enables the platform to extend the entities and resources;\nreliability\
    \ to assure accessing valid and up-to-date data; ensuring security and privacy\
    \ to\npreserve the system safety and conﬁdentiality; and, ﬁnally compliance with\
    \ the related\npolicies and regulations in smart farming. A platform that satisﬁes\
    \ all these requirements\ncan enhance farming practices, and therefore, can increase\
    \ productivity, proﬁtability, and\nperformance while decreasing resource waste.\n\
    \ \nbuild trust, there is a need to establish standards and best practices that\
    \ mandate the rights \nand responsibilities of different actors in smart farming\
    \ systems. There is also the need to \nset standards for data-sharing practices\
    \ and to apply policies to determine accountability \nand penalties in the case\
    \ of possible disputes. Other regulations related to food safety, \nsupply chain\
    \ management, disease monitoring, and other applications can also impact \nagriculture\
    \ data management and processing. These policies can be renewed to be appli-\n\
    cable to new and emerging agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements\
    \ can be \nembedded into technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability\
    \ purposes. \nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend consideration\
    \ of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for smart farming\
    \ data processing. These \nrequirements enable seamless integration of data, system,\

    \ \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\n4. Requirements, Discussion\
    \ and Solutions\nIn Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered\
    \ in the design\nof smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements\
    \ are necessary for any\nplatform that aims to provide fast and robust services\
    \ in a smart farming ecosystem. In\nthe following, we investigate these requirements\
    \ and the solutions to address them in the\nplatform approach.\n4.1. Interoperability\n\
    Currently, there is an extensive number of digital solutions including software\
    \ tools\nand services that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted\
    \ in the\ngeneration of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication\
    \ technologies\nwith different formats and semantics. However, data generated\
    \ by precision farming tools\nare not portable and cannot be integrated among\
    \ smart farming systems. Interoperability\namong technical software tools, hardware,\
    \ or processes/protocols is relatively limited\noften because of the lack of established\
    \ standards [53]. Interoperability requirements cut\nacross various components\
    \ of smart farming technologies (Figure 1) from collecting data\nwith varying\
    \ accessibility rules, data integration across multiple sectors/devices, and data\n\
    processing and protection regulation for data governance and data access.\nInteroperability\
    \ can be viewed from legal, organizational or operational, semantic,\nand technical\
    \ dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability involves ensuring the integration of\n\
    smart farming platforms under various legal frameworks including food policies,\
    \ privacy\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n8 of 18\npolicies and procedures, and data\
    \ agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming\nsystem, data could\
    \ be combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This\nintegration\
    \ should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address\n\
    legal interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles\
    \ can\nbe used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access\
    \ to and re-use of data,\ndeciding who has access to and is responsible for the\
    \ data, managing the legal interests,\nexplaining the rights clearly, and promoting\
    \ harmonization of rights in the data. These\nprinciples can be embedded into\
    \ the farm data processing platform and integration can be\nenabled through application\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs).\nOrganizational interoperability is concerned\
    \ with agricultural actors’ capacity to\naccept and utilize services from other\
    \ organizations to collaborate effectively [54]. This\nis dependent on the degree\
    \ to which farms’ processes, responsibilities, and roles are\nharmonized toward\
    \ shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural systems to make\nservices\
    \ more accessible, easily identiﬁable, and user focused. To address the organizational\n\
    interoperability requirements, farm business processes and exchanged data need\
    \ to be\nintegrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly agreed modeling\
    \ method [55].\nSemantic interoperability ensures that the precise meaning and\
    \ format of the shared\ndata are understood and preserved. In existing smart farming\
    \ ecosystems, data are col-\nlected from fragmented systems in varying formats\
    \ and meanings. To tackle the lack of\nsemantic interoperability in data processing,\
    \ it is necessary to describe all data elements by\ndeveloping vocabularies and\
    \ schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties\nunderstand the\
    \ data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability\n\
    in smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable\
    \ to a\ncommon language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic\
    \ interoperability\nissues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using\
    \ standardized languages\nsuch as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing\
    \ farm production processes\nas well as the real-world objects required in conducting\
    \ these processes. For semantic\ninteroperability enhancement, a smart farming\
    \ application can leverage metadata that\ndescribes original data, allowing the\
    \ user to make the best decision possible about how to\nuse it. Metadata is generated\
    \ to add meaning and context to data values and to establish a\ncommon understanding\
    \ of the meaning and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct\nand proper\
    \ use and interpretation of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore,\
    \ it\nalso enables farm machines to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating\
    \ ambi-\nguity [58]. For example, in the modeling and simulation of a decision\
    \ support platform in\nsmart farming, there is a need for a method to detect conﬂict\
    \ between system components\nand concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address\
    \ the interoperability of such systems\nby capturing information about model concepts\
    \ which allows software agents to reason in\nan unambiguous and machine-readable\
    \ form [59].\nData interoperability is considerably resolved in smart farming\
    \ when metadata is\nstandardized, and common language deﬁnitions are used. Such\
    \ standards are deﬁned\nand promoted by standard agencies such as the International\
    \ Standards Organisation\n(ISO) [60]. The Agricultural Information Management\
    \ Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricul-\ntural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) [62],\
    \ and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata\ninitiatives in the agriculture\
    \ area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable\nbetter interoperability\
    \ by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy\naids in the interpretation\
    \ of relationships between data entities and the categorization of\ndata [64].\
    \ Ontology explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic\n\
    relationships among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies\
    \ such as\nFoodWiki, Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics\
    \ of food and\nagricultural data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In\
    \ addition, sensor ontologies\nsuch as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data\
    \ ontology [66] are used for semantic\ninteroperability of data collected from\
    \ IoT devices. The goal of these ontologies is to identify\nessential elements\
    \ of sensor data and to model resources, services, and geographical data\nto ease\
    \ data access for users.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n9 of 18\nAnother aspect of\
    \ interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the\ncapacity\
    \ of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services,\
    \ or proto-\ncols to easily integrate and enable process and data ﬂow [54]. This\
    \ concept is fundamental\nto software and hardware compatibility. For example,\
    \ interoperability is required among\nfarm machines, software, IoT devices, and\
    \ sensors. If the data processing modules do not\nrecognize the data format collected\
    \ by the combined harvester, the IoT will be of little\nuse in terms of assisting\
    \ decision making. Technical interoperability often can be satisﬁed\nby selecting\
    \ and implementing the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and\nprotocols,\
    \ as well as standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical inter-\n\
    operability could be satisﬁed by creating a decentralized network of existing\
    \ systems to\nenable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system\
    \ could be independent\nand built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS\
    \ initiative is one of the projects\nthat developed such an open technical interoperable\
    \ network involving stakeholders from\ndiverse agricultural domains by using open\
    \ technical speciﬁcation. This project aims to\nprovide a distributed service-oriented\
    \ platform that enables some tasks such as watering\nmanagement, soil management,\
    \ and behavioral analysis of livestock. This framework\ninvolves all actors in\
    \ the food chain, enhancing the process from farm to fork.\nInteroperability is\
    \ made possible by data standards that allow the sharing and ex-\nchange of data.\
    \ In the absence of standardization of data, processing data from heteroge-\n\
    neous and incompatible sources is challenging and often inefﬁcient. Data standardization\
    \ is\na key step toward data interoperability to promote data quality, data sharing,\
    \ data reusabil-\nity, and to optimize data usage. The standardization process\
    \ of data, processes, policies,\nand concepts is critical in ensuring all types\
    \ of interoperability. This goal may be realized by\nwell-deﬁned and well-established\
    \ protocols and regulations that facilitate the integration\nof multiple data\
    \ sources and external knowledge-based services given by stakeholders and\npartners.\
    \ Due to the complexity of data standardization, data harmonization [68] can be\n\
    used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity record to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69]. The main difference\
    \ between data standardization and data\nharmonization comes from the level of\
    \ strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of\ndata standardization is\
    \ to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure\nthat\
    \ data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,\n\
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms\
    \ and\nformats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69].\n4.2. Reliability\n\
    Reliability is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across\
    \ smart\nfarming ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on\
    \ effective processes,\ndata, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability\
    \ should be considered in\nall stages of smart farming, from data acquisition\
    \ to data preparation and model building.\nReliability can be considered from\
    \ different aspects such as data reliability and technology\nreliability. The\
    \ main components of data reliability are data consistency, data complete-\nness\
    \ [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency as the main component of reliability\
    \ [2]\nrefers to keeping data concepts, value domains, and formats unchanged.\
    \ Changes to farm\ndata might take place while processing, moving through networks,\
    \ or sharing between\napplications [28,72]. Data completeness is about the availability\
    \ of all necessary data for\ndecision making [72]. In other words, the deﬁciency\
    \ of a component should not impact the\naccuracy and integrity of data [28]. Data\
    \ completeness in smart farming does not mean that\nall data attributes must be\
    \ present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need\nto be decided\
    \ for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reﬂect the\n\
    true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision agriculture\
    \ system\nmay be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable or broken\
    \ sensors, lost\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n10 of 18\ninformation, and failed\
    \ transmissions [74]. The inaccurate data can lead to a risk of missing\nevents\
    \ and hard interpretations [74].\nIn addition to data reliability, smart farming\
    \ platforms require robust and reliable\ntechnologies such as high speed and reliable\
    \ internet connection [75]. The physical safety\nof IoT devices for precision\
    \ agriculture systems should be ensured in different environ-\nmental conditions\
    \ to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should process data\naccurately\
    \ and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly to emerging issues and\n\
    changing conditions [76].\nBecause agricultural data cover a wide range of heterogeneous\
    \ and unstructured\nsources, simple ratios can be used to measure the percentage\
    \ of data elements that meets\nspeciﬁc rules [77]. To manage information structure\
    \ in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested\nusing parsing techniques. Using\
    \ this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,\nwas calculated by comparing\
    \ it with data coming from multiple reference sensors, existing\nhistorical data,\
    \ or an alternate data source. There are, however, several challenges to using\n\
    this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors is not always\
    \ guaranteed,\nhistorical data might not be available, and there might be additional\
    \ costs using alternate\ndata sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing\
    \ on the aggregated data from sensors\nand other sources is recommended to raise\
    \ data reliability in smart farms. For example,\noutlier detection can help to\
    \ detect faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged\nwith other farms.\n\
    4.3. Scalability\nScalability is another requirement that should be considered\
    \ in a smart farming plat-\nform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase\
    \ available resources and system capability\nwithout the need to go through a\
    \ major system redesign or implementation. As an illustra-\ntion, in Figure 1,\
    \ we can increase the capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud\nresources\
    \ in the second layer and computation resources in the third layer.\nThe challenges\
    \ related to scalability in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity\n\
    and performance [79]. Scaling capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes\
    \ or resources\nto the system [41]. Scaling performance is the ability to improve\
    \ performance or to keep\nthe performance identical while expanding capacity.\
    \ The fundamental bottleneck that\nmay affect system performance may be caused\
    \ by different deployment conﬁgurations\nof various components [80]. Other challenges\
    \ of scalability are identity management\nand access control, security [81], privacy\
    \ [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since\nfarming data generation is\
    \ rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large to be stored\non a single\
    \ node. A fundamental solution to address this need is distributing data collection\n\
    mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou et al. [82] employed Hadoop\
    \ to\nprocess and store 1.44 million data records for daily temperature monitoring.\
    \ Since most\nsmart farming data are small ﬁles that lead to many small ﬁles,\
    \ Hadoop cannot be effective\nwithout a distributed system equipped with a high-performance\
    \ computing system. To\naddress this problem, the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ (HDFS) has been designed to\nprocess large (and small size) datasets.\nUsing\
    \ cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform is another solution\n\
    that can address scalability challenges related to capacity due to ﬂexible and\
    \ robust data\ncollection, management, and processing capabilities [83]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a\nhigh level of ﬂexibility by providing remote services\
    \ for monitoring and managing farm\ndata. Moreover, these services can provide\
    \ on-demand storage and computation resources\nwith no need for on-farm hardware\
    \ installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems\nare usually distributed\
    \ in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms.\nThe data-driven\
    \ services are ﬁnally offered by web services accessible through diverse\ntools,\
    \ including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming\
    \ tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform\
    \ that utilizes\ncloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for\
    \ smart farming.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n11 of 18\nDespite several beneﬁts\
    \ of employing cloud technology in smart farming systems, the\nchallenges such\
    \ as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring a large amount of\n\
    data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues, the use of edge\
    \ computing\nat the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85]. Edge computing\
    \ is a technology\nthat aims to process data at the edge of the network, near\
    \ the source of the data in order\nto reduce the transmitted data to the cloud\
    \ servers, as well as to decrease the workload\non the centralized cloud computing\
    \ servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage\nthe scalability of cloud\
    \ computing resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge\ncomputing and\
    \ decreasing the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem\nwith\
    \ the right APIs and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability\n\
    and real-time processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture\n\
    is the platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform\n\
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This\
    \ platform\nwas implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures\
    \ related to\ntomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock\
    \ production and health\nmanagement. Although edge computing increases scalability\
    \ in a system, it increases\nconcerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized\
    \ devices in a network. Because this\ntechnology utilizes diverse software and\
    \ hardware products in different layers of the\nnetwork, the performance of the\
    \ system is highly correlated with the compatibility of the\nused components.\
    \ Ning et al. [86] discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing\nand the\
    \ solutions to address this problem.\n4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and\
    \ Decision Making\nSimilar to many other emerging real-world applications, smart\
    \ farming applications\nneed real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88].\
    \ Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming\
    \ system, making fast and accurate decisions\nis a major goal. To achieve this\
    \ goal, we need mechanisms to collect and process the\ndiverse available data\
    \ sources in real time. These data are generated by different technolo-\ngies\
    \ including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones, climate forecasting services,\
    \ and\nsmartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big data processing which provides\
    \ real-time\nprocessing in many domains of agriculture. This platform integrates\
    \ different data sources,\ndata modeling, and software products to provide real-time\
    \ data analysis in farming ap-\nplications. Al-Thani et al. [89] investigated\
    \ the set-up process for the use of a drone in\nmonitoring sheep livestock. They\
    \ also used image processing and ML models in a real ﬁeld\napplication. With the\
    \ massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision\nand deep learning\
    \ models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses\nand\
    \ farms. These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real\
    \ time [90]. For\nexample, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop\
    \ a model to estimate the\nleaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce\
    \ [91]. Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. For example,\
    \ agile actions can be carried out in sudden changes\nin operational conditions\
    \ or other circumstances such as weather changes and disease\nprediction alerts.\n\
    In addition, the use of IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and\n\
    robotics is increasing in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart\
    \ farming.\nThese technologies can establish the networking of machines and control\
    \ farm activities\nautomatically and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing\
    \ data at intermediate points at the\n“edge” of the network rather than always\
    \ at the central server or data center leads to faster\ndata processing and a\
    \ shorter response time critical for real-time processing [93].\nTo analyze the\
    \ large agriculture data collected from ﬁelds and reveal hidden patterns of\n\
    interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting models such as disease,\
    \ pests, and\nyield prediction models. Machine learning models that were mostly\
    \ used in the prediction\ninclude artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine,\
    \ and logistic regression [76].\nThese algorithms can be integrated with data\
    \ analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and\nSpark for real-time analysis and better\
    \ performance [19,76].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n12 of 18\nUtilizing edge computing\
    \ provides another opportunity for data processing which is\nfederated learning\
    \ that can address a major concern in data processing for smart farming,\nwhich\
    \ is data sharing. Many farmers prefer to keep their data private, decreasing\
    \ their mo-\ntivation to participate in collaborative learning activities. Alternatively,\
    \ utilizing federated\nlearning, the learning model is distributed to the edge\
    \ nodes without sharing the farms’\ndata with a central unit in the system. This\
    \ approach reduces data privacy concerns and\nencourages farmers to participate\
    \ in cooperative learning processes.\n4.5. Security and Privacy\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be consid-\nered throughout\
    \ a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure a smart\n\
    farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms\
    \ that\ncan enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.\
    \ It enables a\nservice provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors\
    \ in the system and to set some\nrestrictions on the activities of low-trustable\
    \ parties. AgriTrust [94] is a trust management\napproach designed for smart farming\
    \ applications. This framework monitors the interac-\ntions in the system and\
    \ updates trust metrics such as credibility, robustness, and reliability\nthrough\
    \ time. Using this approach, smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on\
    \ each\ntransaction to the network, therefore, this feedback can be utilized by\
    \ the trust management\nframework for trustworthiness evaluation.\nAnother mechanism\
    \ for security enhancement in smart farming is access control\nwhich is a mechanism\
    \ to consider the policies and agreements to handle requests and\naccess permissions.\
    \ These permissions can be granted based on the roles and attributes\nor agreements.\
    \ For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95] proposed an Attribute-Based Access\nControl\
    \ (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes policies that combine different attributes\n\
    from different sources, including user, data, device, and environment, and provides\
    \ ﬁne-\ngrained, ﬂexible access management. In this study, the authors modeled\
    \ a smart farming\necosystem with different agriculture sensors for temperature\
    \ and soil monitoring, tractor\nand truck movement controls, as well as labor\
    \ management, and presented a mechanism\nto handle access requests to data and\
    \ devices.\nIn smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the ﬁeld and usually\
    \ transferred to\non-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different technologies\
    \ are used for data transfer\nin agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\
    \ To protect data from adversaries\nin the transfer stage, encryption is a common\
    \ technique. For this purpose, the data are\nencrypted before transmission and\
    \ then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97]\npresented an encryption\
    \ method for agricultural information systems. This method builds\nsecure communication\
    \ among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in\nthe paper\
    \ showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as\n\
    compared with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming\n\
    applications was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid\
    \ method\ncombining two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the\
    \ presented method\non a crop monitoring system.\nA platform for smart farming\
    \ can leverage the mentioned solutions, including trust\nmanagement, access control,\
    \ and encrypted data transmission to ensure that security and\nprivacy during\
    \ all stages of smart farming procedures, as shown in Figure 2. Another\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technology that can be used for enhancing security and privacy in smart\nfarming\
    \ is the blockchain. This technology has been used in some agriculture applications\n\
    and could reshape smart farming ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology\
    \ is a\ndistributed ledger that keeps the records of all previous transactions\
    \ in a system [99]. In\naddition, this technology enables automatic procedure\
    \ execution using smart contracts.\nA smart contract is a computer program that\
    \ can be deployed on a blockchain platform\nto run some procedures automatically\
    \ without human intervention [29]. In recent years,\nblockchain technology and\
    \ smart contracts have been widely used in different smart\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n13 of 18\nfarming applications, including trust management [100,101],\
    \ water management [102,103],\nfood traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106].\n\
    4.6. Regulation and Policies\nConsidering the available regulations and practices\
    \ in agriculture, a mechanism for\ncompliance with these rules is beneﬁcial in\
    \ a smart farming platform. The regulations\nrelated to smart farming cover different\
    \ aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to,\nfood security, biosecurity,\
    \ climate change, and data governance. In the following, some of\nthese regulations\
    \ in different jurisdictions are brieﬂy reviewed.\nThe European Union’s Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a uniﬁed policy\nacross Europe to support\
    \ farmers and to improve agricultural productivity. This policy\naims to improve\
    \ the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate changes, and\nmanage\
    \ natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications, the policy supports\n\
    technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as well as reduce ecological\
    \ foot-\nprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control the availability\
    \ of supplies and to ensure\nthat the prices of products are reasonable for both\
    \ producers and customers. Another\nwidely used regulation under the European\
    \ Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union\n(EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural\
    \ Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The\nCommittee of Professional\
    \ Agricultural Organizations (COPA) and the General Confed-\neration of Agricultural\
    \ Cooperatives (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020.\nThis code mainly\
    \ focuses on non-personal data collected on farms and leaves the personal\ndata\
    \ to be treated under other regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature\
    \ of\ncollected data in agriculture, it is impossible to deﬁne data ownership\
    \ in the same way as\nphysical objects and it suggests using different levels\
    \ of rights. Therefore, the key step from\nthis code’s point of view is a contract\
    \ that determines the rights of all parties to protect\ntheir sensitive information,\
    \ while all permissions related to data collection, access, and\nutilization are\
    \ needed to be approved by the data originator. To evaluate the compliance\nof\
    \ a product or service with this code, a checklist consisting of ﬁfteen questions\
    \ has been\nprovided by the publishers. These questions specify the collected\
    \ data and the rights to\nshare, access, and use these data.\nIn addition, several\
    \ regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S. juris-\ndiction. An\
    \ example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different aspects\n\
    of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy, and\
    \ organic\nfarming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the productivity\
    \ of the farm-\ning process, and to reduce negative environmental impact. Generally,\
    \ in a ﬁve-year cycle,\nthe farm acts are updated to govern agriculture, food,\
    \ and rural development programs.\nIn the context of smart farming, this policy\
    \ considers different technologies such as GPS,\ncomputer mapping, guidance systems,\
    \ and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety\nModernization Act (FSMA)\
    \ [111] is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This\nact aims to\
    \ enhance food safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules\n\
    ensuring responsibility and accountability of different parties that work in the\
    \ agricultural\nsections. Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government\
    \ to facilitate product\ntracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety\
    \ plans. Another regulation related\nto smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction\
    \ is the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm\nData (PSPFD) [112]. It was\
    \ established by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in\n2014. The principles\
    \ under this regulation are mostly around data ownership, consent, and\ndisclosure.\
    \ To ensure compliance with PSPFD, the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Trans-\n\
    parency Evaluator. This tool assesses contracts among agriculture stakeholders\
    \ against the\nprinciples provided in the PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful,\
    \ the contract gets an\nAg Data Transparency seal that informs the parties that\
    \ it has been approved.\nDespite the efforts on regulations related to big data\
    \ in smart farming, there are\nstill some gaps in this ﬁeld. One of the issues\
    \ is the lack of comprehensive and uniﬁed\nregulations for agriculture data, while\
    \ the available practices and a code of conduct are\nnot compulsory. To make the\
    \ most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart farming\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n14 of 18\nplatform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance\
    \ with available policies in\nsmart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage\
    \ the parties to trust the services\nprovided and participate in collaborative\
    \ practices that enhance the performance of data\nprocessing systems in agriculture\
    \ applications.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart farming provides the agricultural industry\
    \ with diverse data-driven services\nwhich improve different applications from\
    \ farm to fork. These services beneﬁt from a large\namount of available data in\
    \ smart farming ecosystems. However, a major challenge in\nsmart farming information\
    \ processing is consistency and compatibility among the utilized\ntechnologies,\
    \ procedures, and protocols. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest\
    \ the\nplatform approach which is a design thinking approach that encourages different\
    \ actors in\na smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration among different\
    \ services by following\nsome requirements. Moreover, we suggest six requirements\
    \ for a smart farming platform,\nincluding interoperability, real-time data processing,\
    \ scalability, reliability, security, and\ncompliance with farming regulations.\
    \ Such a platform can enhance the available services\nin the agriculture industry\
    \ by enabling collaboration among different service providers.\nFurthermore, such\
    \ a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders.\n\
    Currently, a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of uniﬁed\
    \ protocols\nand standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers\
    \ is needed\nto address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement\
    \ a sample of the\nproposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available\
    \ software and hardware\nproducts that follow similar protocols, and therefore,\
    \ are compatible.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D. and M.A.-Z.;\

    Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image registration has recently been
    widely applied in many fields such as agriculture, forestry, and urban planning.
    A high-resolution remote sensing image can depict the texture features of ground
    details more clearly, but it also brings new challenges to registration such as
    texture similarity, image storage space, and image information leakage. In this
    paper, to solve the above problems, we propose a finite-state chaotic compressed
    sensing (CS) cloud remote sensing image registration method. First, chaotic CS
    with a finite state not only saves storage space required for an image but also
    improves the security of the image in the transmission process. Next, we process
    the image in the cloud platform, improve the speed of image processing, and facilitate
    real-time data processing. Finally, we propose an improved scale invariant feature
    transform (SIFT) image registration method based on local and global information
    (LG-SIFT) that reduces the impact of texture similarity on high-resolution remote
    sensing images. The experimental results show that the runtime of the original
    processing method is twice as long as that of the proposed scheme and that the
    accuracy of registration improves considerably. Topic: Theory, Algorithms, and
    Applications of Sparse Recovery In this paper, the images above are the scheme

    SECTION I. Introduction The first application of remote sensing image registration
    appeared in the military field in the 1970s. Image registration is the process
    of overlaying two or more images of the same scene taken at different times, from
    different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors [1]. Recently, it has been applied
    in many different fields, such as agriculture, forestry, and urban planning. For
    example, with respect to the Wenchuan earthquake and the Yushu earthquake, local
    satellite remote sensing data were acquired for the first time, which provided
    a reliable basis for subsequent rescue. With the improvement of remote sensing
    image resolution, registration of high-resolution remote sensing images creates
    the following new challenges. Specific performance: The spatial information of
    high-resolution remote sensing images is more abundant. Because the similarity
    of features between near-surface objects is more obvious, feature matching is
    easily disturbed by the similarity of features, which lowers the matching accuracy.
    High-resolution remote sensing images have high spatial resolution and wide width,
    which makes image processing difficult and storage inconvenient. There is a great
    deal of important information in high-resolution images, and information leakage
    easily occurs in the process of image transmission. Currently, there are many
    related studies on image registration. Next, we will introduce several representative
    research results. In 2004, David L. proposed the scale invariant feature transform
    (SIFT) [2], which became a famous point matching algorithm. SIFT has good matching
    performance and has been widely studied for many years. In 2005, Mortensen et
    al. [3] proposed a new and improved algorithm for the similarity of local features.
    By extracting SIFT feature points and describing the curvature distribution of
    SIFT feature points in a shape context, Mortensen combined them with SIFT feature
    descriptors to form a new descriptor. In 2010, Carmichael et al. [4] proposed
    a similar global context descriptor for speeded up robust features (SURFs) and
    maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs). In 2015, Kim [5] proposed a local shape
    context combined with SIFT descriptors, which are used for local features of a
    tattoo object, and a global shape is used for the overall shape of a tattoo object.
    Ning et al. [6] presented a feature matching algorithm based on a partial DAISY
    descriptor and global texture information. In 2017, Zhou et al. [7] proposed a
    global context verification scheme to filter false matches for copy detection.
    Chen et al. [8] proposed a novel similarity metric based on rotationally invariant
    regional mutual information (RIRMI). Similarity to the algorithm before, the similarity
    metric based on RIRMI considers not only the spatial information, but the effect
    of the local grey variations and rotation changes on computing probability density
    function as well. In this paper, an improved SIFT image registration method based
    on global information is proposed to reduce the texture similarity of high-resolution
    remote sensing images. With the increasing resolution and data volume of remote
    sensing images, image processing is becoming increasingly laborious and inefficient,
    and the storage space required is becoming increasingly larger. At the same time,
    the emergence of cloud computing creates new directions for remote sensing image
    processing and storage. With the emergence of cloud computing, mobile operational
    devices and 5G high-speed networks, these emerging technologies are used in many
    fields, such as large-scale data computing, updating, population flow statistics,
    etc. [9], but they also face various security threats. Mobile cloud platform information
    leakage [10], [11], user privacy information theft [12], and then mainly for the
    transmission in the cloud and PC side. Encryption of image information in process
    is studied, and a method of encrypted compression synchronization based on finite
    state chaotic compressed sensing is proposed. Due to their large number of pixels,
    remote sensing images should be compressed to reduce communication bandwidth.
    In addition, to protect the sensitivity of state and personal information, some
    encryption measures need to be adopted [13]–[17]. Compressed sensing (CS) [18],
    [19] is a new signal-sampling paradigm that meets a nearly optimal Nyquist sampling
    rate. This technology reduces the sampling points of traditional signals, such
    as images and videos, by utilizing in-natural redundancies. By using CS, the original
    picture can be reconstructed by sampling only a fraction of the data. Chaotic
    tent [20] systems have been widely used in image protection based on their unpredictability
    and sensitivity. In an image encryption algorithm based on chaotic maps, a sensing
    matrix is generated using chaotic sequences that uses just a symmetric key. Therefore,
    many scholars have conducted in-depth research on CS and chaotic cryptography.
    Huang and Sakurai [21] used the characteristics of CS and proposed a compression-combined
    digital image encryption method. However, this type of secret key is too large
    to distribute and store. To solve this problem and simultaneously realize compression
    and encryption, Zhou et al. [22] proposed a new image compression-encryption hybrid
    method by using random measurement matrices. Liu et al. [23] presented a block
    compressed sensing (BCS) scheme by using double random phase encoding (DRPE) to
    enhance the security level and increase the performance of CS. This method is
    based on random phase encoding in the fractional Fourier domain for each image
    block. Based on BCS, Zhang et al. [24] proposed a scalable encryption framework
    along with the so-called Sobel edge detector and cascade chaotic maps. Therefore,
    based on these methods, we propose a finite-state chaotic CS method to solve the
    considerable storage space problem and simultaneously satisfy security. In addition,
    to improve the efficiency of image processing, we process images on a cloud platform.
    The following contents are arranged in four sections. Section 2 presents the related
    methodology: CS, chaotic theory and image registration. We introduce the proposed
    scheme in Section 3. Next, we conduct related experiments to verify the proposed
    scheme in Section 4. In Section 5, we give a conclusion about the contribution
    of this paper. SECTION II. The Related Methodology A. Compressed Sensing CS theory
    consists of three parts: sparse representation of signals, sampling of signals
    and reconstruction of signals. 1) Sparse Representation Sparse representation
    of signals is the first step. Signal x is an N-dimensional vector that can be
    expressed by a set of linear combinatorial bases Ψ=[ Ψ 1 , Ψ 2 ,⋯, Ψ M ] , x=Ψs
    (1) View Source where Ψ is a random projection (M<N) dimension and s is an N-dimensional
    signal. If there are only K nonzero elements in the transformation coefficient
    Ψ T x or only K large components are retained, signal x is considered K-sparse
    or approximately K-sparse. 2) Sampling Sampling of signals is the second step.
    If a vector y can be expressed as: y=Ωx (2) View Source then we regard the random
    projection M×N dimension as the measurement matrix. y is obtained by linear projection
    of the signal x diagram, where y is an M -dimensional signal, and Ω is a random
    projection M×N dimension. FIGURE 1 shows the schematic process of signal sampling
    compression. FIGURE 1. PC client upload to cloud server. PC client can upload
    high-resolution remote sensing images to cloud server by route 1, while PC client
    can download the processed images from cloud server by route 2. In this paper,
    we only focus on route 1. Show All 3) Reconstruction The signal reconstruction
    algorithm is the third step and a key part of CS theory. The problem is how to
    accurately recover the original high-dimensional data from the low-dimensional
    data. Convex optimization indicates that the objective function of the optimization
    problem is a convex function, and the constrained variables are valued on the
    convex set. The convex optimization problem can be solved globally with sufficient
    computing resources, but this kind of method is often limited by the actual conditions.
    A nonconvex optimization algorithm has become another research direction and has
    high feasibility in practical applications because of its low time complexity.
    Many scholars have made many improvements and optimization based on OMP, for example:
    Wen et al. [25], [26] proposed two optimization algorithm. In this paper, we adopt
    orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with random measurements [27]. For OMP, random
    frequency measurements offer two specific advantages. The first advantage is that
    it can compute the maximum correlation between a signal and the columns of the
    matrix in time O(dlnd) . The second advantage is that the matrix can be constructed
    and stored using only O(Nlnd) bits because it is only necessary to choose N rows
    from a d -row matrix. OMP with Gaussian measurements Fix δ∈(0,0.36) and choose
    N≥[K×m×ln(d/δ)] , and draw N measurement vectors x 1 , x 2 … x N which are independent
    of the standard Gaussian distribution on R d . Assume s is an arbitrary m -sparse
    signal in R d . If the data {⟨s, x n ⟩:n=1,2,…N} is given, OMP can reconstruct
    the signal with probability over 1−2δ . The constant satisfies K≤20 . OMP with
    admissible measurements If we take random measurements of a sparse signal using
    an admissible measurement matrix, then OMP can be used to recover the original
    signal with high probability. Fix δ∈(0,0.36) , and choose N≥[K×m×ln(d/δ)] . Given
    the data v=Γs (3) View Source OMP can reconstruct a signal with probability exceeding
    1−δ , where K is an absolute constant, s is an arbitrary m-sparse signal in R
    d , and N×d is a random admissible measurement matrix Γ independent of the signal.
    For Gaussian measurements, we obtained more precise estimates for the constant.
    Therefore, we adopt the OMP with Gaussian measurements as the reconstruction algorithm.
    B. Tent Chaotic Theory Chaos is a kind of complex dynamical behavior with pseudorandom
    and finite special properties. The sensitivity of the initial value and the chaotic
    parameters are important properties in the chaotic system. This sensitivity is
    very suitable for encryption [28]. Moreover, the chaotic sequence is suitable
    for constructing the measurement matrix [29] by the deterministic method. Therefore,
    the measurement matrix can be used as a secret key to encrypt the plain text,
    which can simplify the construction process of the measurement matrix. There are
    many chaotic systems, such as Chebyshev, the logistic map and the tent map. Thus,
    we improve the method based on the tent map. The skew tent map affects the global
    searching capacity and computational efficiency of the chaos optimization algorithm.
    First, skew tent mapping [30] is a generalized tent map, which is defined as:
    f a (x)= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ x a x−1 a−1 0<x≤a a<x≤1 (4) View Source The structure of skew
    tent mapping is simple. Skew tent mapping can eliminate rounding error in the
    iteration process and obtain accurate numeric calculations. C. Image Registration
    Theory Currently, there are many methods based on image registration. According
    to the different image information used in the registration process, image registration
    can be divided into a region-based registration method and a feature-based registration
    method. In this paper, we adopt the feature point. The method based on feature
    points selects the corresponding feature pixels from the reference image and the
    image to be registered and judges them according to certain similarity criteria.
    If the criteria are met, the feature points are determined as feature point pairs.
    The similarity of the image is judged by analyzing the ratio of the correct matching
    points to the total matching points. The most famous method is SIFT. It is a good
    local image feature method. SIFT consists of four steps: scale-space extrema detection,
    keypoint localization, orientation assignment and keypoint descriptor. The first
    step searches over all scales and image locations. To be invariant to scale and
    orientation, SIFT is implemented by adopting a difference of Gaussian function.
    The second step determines location and scale by a detailed model. Keypoints are
    selected based on measures of their stability. In the third step, one or more
    orientations are assigned to each keypoint location based on local image gradient
    directions. In the last step, the local image gradients are measured at the selected
    scale in the region around each keypoint. SECTION III. The Proposed Scheme In
    this section, we mainly elaborate on the proposed scheme, which can be roughly
    divided into three parts. First, we process the original image by Φ . Φ is a measurement
    matrix that is produced by CS and finite-state tent chaos. Therefore, CS and finite-state
    tent chaos can run simultaneously. Then the image can be recovered on the cloud
    platform by the same matrix Φ . Finally, images extracted at different times and
    from different angles are processed by LG-SIFT. The procedure of the proposed
    scheme is shown in FIGURE 3 and FIGURE 4. FIGURE 3 and FIGURE 4 are the compared
    schemes, we perform the experiments by these two schemes on PC and the cloud platform.
    FIGURE 2. Sampling of compressed sensing. Show All FIGURE 3. The procedure of
    the first compared scheme. Show All FIGURE 4. The procedure of the second compared
    scheme. Show All A. Finite-State Tent Chaotic Compressed Sensing Method CS not
    only increases efficiency but also simultaneously encrypts the images. However,
    the encryption effect is not sufficient. Chaos is a kind of complex dynamical
    behavior with pseudorandom and finite special properties. It is suitable for encrypting
    plain text because of its sensitivity. In the paper “Secure and Energy-Efficient
    Data Transmission System Based on Chaotic Compressed Sensing in Body-to-Body Networks”,
    Peng et al. [31] proposed a method to combine chaos and CS and fulfill in one
    step. This method simultaneously increases efficiency and encrypts the images.
    It also saves considerable storage space because it stores just the matrix seed
    rather than the whole measurement matrix. However, in the above method, the chaotic
    function is a two-to-one mapping, and there is no one-to-one corresponding inverse
    function. The inverse function is not unique and will create consistency problems
    during decryption so that the original cannot be restored. However, chaotic function
    is complex to implement. The encryption system of the skew tent mapping with finite
    state discretizes the skew tent mapping into one-to-one corresponding discrete
    mapping while retaining the chaotic characteristics of the original tent mapping.
    Its orbital sequence can be regarded as a Bernoulli sequence; that is, it has
    strong random characteristics. In this case, we propose an improved method that
    uses a one-to-one discretization mapping transformation finite-state method [32].
    The finite state tent is defined specifically as follows: assume M>2 , defines
    the following two sets, P=C={x;x= 1 m , 2 m … m m } (5) View Source and the transformation
    relation induced by the upper form is defined as follows: f  a (x)= | x ′ ∈P|
    f a ( x ′ )< f a (x)||+1 M (6) View Source B. LG-Sift The descriptors fail to
    consider global context and can produce ambiguity when matching, especially in
    texture-similar regions. In these regions, a detected feature point easily matches
    at least two feature points, and mismatches occur. In the introduction, there
    are many good methods from different angles. Most methods are based on SIFT and
    global context information. Moreover, by extracting the global context, the features
    are robust to texture-similar regions. “A SIFT Descriptor with Global Context”
    was the first paper to combine local information and global context. Mortensen
    presented a feature descriptor that augments SIFT with a global context vector.
    The vector adds curvilinear shape information from a larger neighborhood, and
    it can reduce mismatches when multiple local descriptors are similar. In this
    paper, we improve the method based on Mortensen’s idea. We replace the shape context
    by relative shape context [33] and give the definition of the similarity matching
    measure for the relative shape context descriptor again. Compared with the shape
    context, the relative shape context (RSC) has many advantages, such as translation
    and rotation invariance. RSC is also scale invariant because it is not necessary
    to calculate the logarithmic distance between pairs of points. It is also robust
    to noise without calculating the average distance between all pairs of points
    in a point set when the distance term is regularized. FIGURE 5 and FIGURE 6 are
    the explanation of RSC. FIGURE 5. Spatial distribution of relative shape context
    descriptors. Show All FIGURE 6. Histogram of point p i relative to p j relative
    shape context. Show All Assuming that there are n points in point set P, the RSC
    of any point p i relative to any other point p j is H p i,j (s) . A polar coordinate
    system is established in which, p i is the origin and vector p i p j − → − is
    the positive axis. H p i,j (s) is a histogram of the polar angles of the other
    n-2 points in the point set relative to the positive direction of the polar coordinate
    system. H p i,j (k) is: H p i,j (k)=♯{p≠ p i , p j ∣p, p i , p j ∈P,∠ p j p i
    p∈bin(k)} (7) View Source where ♯ is the potential of set P, ∠ p j p i p expresses
    anticlockwise rotation angle between vector p i p j − → − and p i p − → . Assume
    point set is divided s sections, the degrees of every section is △ θ s =⌊ 360
    ∘ s ⌋ . Therefore, the k-th section is: bin(k)=[(k−1)△ θ s ,k△ θ s ] (8) View
    Source 1) LG-Sift Descriptor The LG-SIFT descriptor consists of two parts: a vector
    representing local features and a global distribution vector for removing local
    similarity features. We define LG-SIFT vector of this paper as follows: U=[ μL
    (1−μ) G θ ]. (9) View Source where L is a 128-dimensional local description vector,
    G θ is a 12-dimensional global distribution description vector, μ is the relative
    weight factor. 2) The Establishment of Similarity Measures According to the RSC,
    the relative shape context vector is calculated using χ 2 statistics. We construct
    a similarity measure as: d G θ = χ 2 = 1 2 ∑ K ( H p i,k − H p j,k ) 2 H p i,k
    + H p j,k (10) View Source where H p i,j is the RSC of p i relative to p j . The
    SIFT description vector is calculated by the Euclidean distance: d L =| L i −
    L j |= ∑ K ( L i,k − L j,k ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (11) View Source According
    to the above definition of LG-SIFT descriptor construction, the similarity measure
    is as follows: d ij (k,l)=μ d L ¯ +(1−μ) d G θ ¯ (12) View Source where the relative
    weight coefficient μ is consistent with the weight coefficient in the LG-SIFT
    descriptor. SECTION IV. Experiments and Effect In this section, we perform the
    related experiments and then present the performance analysis based on the results
    of the experiments. The datasets in the experiments are from different geographical
    environments. Our experimental environment is an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU
    @3.40 GHz Windows 10. The datasets run on MATLAB (version: 2015b). In the experiments,
    to verify the performance of the proposed method, three groups of high-resolution
    remote sensing images from different satellites, different phases and different
    widths are chosen as the test dataset. We name the datasets m1, m2, m3. Among
    them, m1 is from the Gaofen-2 satellite and covers the intersection of the ocean
    and the land at the junction. m2, which is from the WorldView-1 satellite, mainly
    covers the river area. m3, which is from the High-resolution 8 satellite and covers
    farmland. m1 and m2 are used to determine the effect of LG-SIFT. m3 is used to
    determine the effect of our proposed scheme. A. Effect of Recovery The peak signal-to-noise
    ratio (PSNR) is the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the
    power of corrupting noise that affects the fidelity of its representation. It
    is most commonly used to measure the quality of reconstructed images, and the
    higher is better in general scopes. Considering that many signals have a very
    wide dynamic range, PSNR (dB) is usually expressed in logarithmic decibel scale
    and calculated via the mean square error (MSE). That is, PSNR= MSE= 10⋅ log 10
    ( MA X 2 MSE ) 1 S⋅R ∑ i=1 S ∑ j=1 R [I(i,j)−K(i,j) ] 2 (13) (14) View Source
    where S and R are the numbers of pixels of horizontal and vertical coordinates
    of the image, respectively, while I(i,j) and K(i,j) denote the gray matrices of
    the original and the reconstructed images, respectively. The constant MAX (in
    this paper 28−1) is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. Figure 7 is
    the MSE of data set 2 under different compression ratios. From the above figure,
    we can see that when the compression ratio is between 0 and 0.2 MSE changes significantly,
    indicating that the image restoration is not ideal. When the compression ratio
    is between 0.2 and 0.6, MSE changes relatively smoothly. When the compression
    ratio is between 0.7 and 0.9, the change in the MSE of the image tends to be gradual,
    the minimum amplitude, indicating that the image restoration effect in this compression
    ratio interval is better. FIGURE 7. MSE at different compression ratio. Show All
    The PSNR of two different datasets under different compression ratios is shown
    in Figure 7. The PSNR between the compression ratios of 0 and 0.3 is unstable.
    The compression ratio between 0.3 and 0.7 results in a PSNR that increases almost
    linearly. Compared with the range of the PSNR (approximately 20–25 dB) [34], the
    peak PSNR in this paper is 24 -42 dB, which shows that the proposed scheme has
    a great improvement in image restoration. B. Effect of Recovery Image From the
    MSE, runtime and PSNR, we can obtain a better recovery effect with a ratio of
    0.7, and thus, the experiment is implemented at a compression ratio of 0.7. We
    will show the effect of image histogram and adjacent correlation. 1) Effect of
    Histogram An image histogram is a type of graphical representation of the tonal
    distribution in a digital image that plots the number of pixels for each tonal
    value. It is a very intuitive and popular tool for evaluating the encryption effectiveness
    for a specific image since a viewer can judge the entire tonal distribution at
    a glance. Through the analysis of PSNR, runtime and MSE in 4.1, we use 0.7 as
    the compression ratio. In this paper, m1 and m2 are selected as datasets to analyze
    the histograms of remote sensing images before and after encryption. The histograms
    in the first row are the gray histograms of the two different datasets used in
    this part, showing the gray distribution of the original image pixels. It can
    be seen that most of the pixels in the images are less than 125, thus inferring
    that the gray level of the original image is dim. The images in the second row
    are processed by the scheme proposed in this paper. It can be seen from the images
    that the gray distribution is uniform and that these images are almost the same,
    which shows that the scheme proposed in this paper can be used as it has a better
    encryption effect on remote sensing images. In general, cryptographic encryption,
    attackers can extract the statistical features of plaintext images from ciphertext
    images and obtain pixels with obvious features of the original image. 2) Effect
    of Adjacent Correlation Intuitively speaking, a good encryption scheme should
    map the pixel distribution of the original signal to approximately random and
    uniform distributions as much as possible. Therefore, adjacency correlation analysis
    provides us with a way to evaluate the quality of image encryption. In our experiments,
    correlation analysis of adjacent pixels is shown as FIGURE 10. The first row in
    the figure is from the original image correlation scatter plots of different datasets,
    and the second row is the encrypted image pixel scatter plot distribution. From
    FIGURE 10, we can see that the pixels in all directions of the original image
    are linearly distributed, and the pixel correlation of the image is very strong.
    The distribution of the pixels in the encrypted images are confused and random,
    which indicates that the pixel distribution correlation of the image is very low,
    so the encryption scheme proposed in this paper is effective. We can get the same
    effect in FIGURE 11. FIGURE 8. PSNR at different compression ratio. Show All FIGURE
    9. Histograms of dataset m1, m2. Show All FIGURE 10. Adjacent pixel correlation
    analysis of dataset m1. Show All FIGURE 11. Adjacent pixel correlation analysis
    of dataset m2. Show All We randomly select 1600 pixels from rows, columns and
    diagonals to calculate their respective correlation coefficients in Table 1. From
    the correlation coefficients of the row, column and diagonal, we can see that
    the correlation of the original remote sensing images is very high, and the correlation
    of the encrypted images tends to 0. Therefore, the encryption scheme proposed
    in this paper is effective for data. TABLE 1 Correlation Coefficients of Two Datasets
    From Different Orientations C. Effect of LG-Sift In the following, we compared
    the performance of SIFT, SIFT+GC, SIFT+DAISY and the proposed method (LG-SIFT)
    for two different high-resolution remote sensing areas. We use correct matching
    rates (CMR) and root MSE (RMSE) as the evaluation criteria. We evaluate the matching
    performance for the two experimental environments by comparing the CMR of the
    four methods. The registration results of different methods in the dataset are
    shown in Table 2, and the corresponding visual matching results are shown in FIGURE
    11 and FIGURE 12. TABLE 2 Matching Results of Different Registration Methods on
    the Dataset m1 FIGURE 12. Visual effects of remote sensing image registration
    of dataset m1. Show All From FIGURE 11, FIGURE 12, TABLE 2, and TABLE 3, the CMR
    of the proposed method is higher than that of the other three methods, and the
    RMSE is smaller. The local descriptors are poorly distinguishable due to similar
    textures. The SIFT+GC, SIFT+DAISY and LG-SIFT methods consider both local and
    global information and are robust to distinguishable texture-similar descriptors;
    therefore, the matching effect is better. LG-SIFT is the best method because RSC
    is translation invariant, rotation invariant, scale invariant and robust to noise.
    The experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain higher CMR and
    more matching pairs for remote sensing images with intensive similar textures.

    Comparison of Cloud and PC Server Remote sensing images uploaded to the cloud
    can perform a series of operations, such as image fusion, location recognition,
    and location detection. These operations are based on accurate image registration,
    so the registration accuracy directly affects other subsequent processing. We
    process the images uploaded to the cloud. The visual effects and specific data
    are shown in FIGURE 14, FIGURE 15 and FIGURE 16. FIGURE 13. Visual effects of
    remote sensing image registration of dataset m2. Show All FIGURE 14. Running time

    first line, the first image is original image and the second image is the deformation
    image on cloud platform. In the second line, the order of images is the same as

    All FIGURE 14 is the runtime of the PC client and cloud platform on m3 under different
    compression ratios. From FIGURE 14, we can see that there is not much difference
    in running time when the compression ratio is smaller than 0.5. When the compression
    ratio is larger than 0.5, the PC runtime is longer than that of the cloud platform.
    FIGURE 15 is a countryside area that contains many crops. In this figure, the
    pair of the second line is the image deformation of the first line. We compare
    these two pairs to check what influence the proposed method would be as FIGURE
    3. Feature points are prone to mismatches because crops are similar in appearance.
    Line 1 and Line 2 were processed by the same method(finite-state tent chaotic
    CS). Then, we process the images by LG-SIFT. From FIGURE 15, the influence of
    pixel features on the image can be neglected, which shows the reliability of the
    proposed scheme. FIGURE 16 is another experiment. In this experiment, we match
    the original image and the deformed image to check what influence would be using
    the same image as FIGURE 4. In the first line, we process the original image by
    finite-state tent chaotic CS. We do not any process on Line 1, just send it to
    the cloud platform. Then, we process these two images by LG-SIFT. From FIGURE
    16, the influence of pixel features on the image can be neglected, which shows
    the reliability of the proposed scheme. Table 3 and Table 4 are the digital representation
    of the countryside area images, which can more intuitively illustrate the loss
    degree of the proposed scheme to the image features. I1 and I2 are different images
    in the same scene. For I1, the number of match pairs is 1720, the number of correct
    pairs is 1532, the correct matching rate is 89.07%. For I2, the number of total
    pairs is 1318, the number of correct pairs is 1144, the correct matching rate
    is 86.82%. I3 and I4 are different lines in the FIGURE 16. For I3, the number
    of match pairs is 1720, the number of correct pairs is 1532, and the correct matching
    rate is 89.07%. For I4, the number of total pairs is 1318, the number of correct
    pairs is 1144, and the correct matching rate is 86.82%. The numerical results
    show that the proposed compressed and chaotic scheme has approximately 2% loss
    on the different images, and most of the image features are retained. Therefore,
    the effects are good unless we have a high accuracy demand on original images
    and processed images. TABLE 4 Correct Ratio of Original Image and Processed Image

    m3 SECTION V. Conclusion Remote sensing image registration has been widely used
    in many fields in recent years. However, with the improvement of the resolution,
    it also brings new challenges to registration, such as texture similarity, image
    storage space, and image information leakage. In this paper, to solve the above
    problems, we propose a finite-state chaotic CS cloud remote sensing image registration
    method. First, chaotic CS with a finite state not only saves image storage space
    but also improves the security of the image in the transmission process. Then,
    we process the image in the cloud platform to improve the speed of image processing,
    and facilitate real-time data processing. Finally, we propose an improved remote
    sensing image registration method based on local and global information that reduces
    the impact of texture similarity on high-resolution remote sensing images. The
    simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is excellent
    for runtime and encryption and for matching accuracy rates. Authors Figures References

    Abstract. The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has reshaped

    the industrial system, agricultural system, healthcare systems, and even our daily

    livelihoods, as the number of IoT applications is surging in these ﬁelds. Still,

    numerous challenges are imposed when putting in place such technology at large

    scale. In a system of millions of connected devices, operating each one of them

    manually is impossible, making IoT platforms unmaintainable. In this study, we

    present our attempt to achieve the autonomy of IoT infrastructure by building
    a

    platform that targets a dynamic and quick Plug and Play (PnP) deployment of

    the system at any given location, using predeﬁned pipelines. The platform also

    supports real-time data processing, which enables the users to have reliable and

    real-time data visualization in a dynamic dashboard.

    Introduction

    Enterprise architectures with a large number of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices

    impose challenging operational issues. It is possible to deal with these issues
    for a limited

    number of IoT devices, yet it is almost impossible to do likewise for many devices.
    We

    argue that a faster approach to tackle the operational issues of IoT by adopting
    the Plug

    and Play (PnP) concept in IoT architecture. IoT is a concept that builds a connection

    between all devices to the internet and facilitates communication with each other
    over

    the internet, with over 10 billion IoT devices wirelessly connected as of recently
    [1, 2].

    In today‘s IoT technology, the major requirement is an architecture which is capable
    of

    supporting a large number of devices and still provides reliable performance.
    With the

    increasing number of devices, it becomes exceedingly complex to add a new one
    to an

    existing platform, and to reduce the integration phase of the system, therefore
    the concept

    of PnP in a smart environment was ﬁrst proposed in 2006 [2]. The main objectives
    of PnP

    architecture in IoT systems are to reduce user intervention for system integration,
    and to

    have a real time solution from the system services. As an example, Helal et al.
    proposed

    a platform based on the PnP principle that enables a seamless integration of devices
    to

    the back-end systems without exterior interventions from integrators or engineers
    [3].

    Although the concept of PnP is very intriguing, the PnP based IoT systems’ reliability

    is the next big challenge. The reliability of a system can be evaluated by: the
    ability

    to perform a required task, ability to perform without failures, ability to perform
    under

    stated conditions, and ability to perform for a speciﬁed period [4].

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 is the literature review
    of the

    existing architectures, implementation of IoT platforms, and visualization techniques.

    In Sect. 2, we propose our AMI IoT platform, wherein we give an overview of our

    architecture and implementations. In Sect. 3, we move into the details of our
    architecture

    and implementations of different components of the PnP base IoT architecture.
    In Sect. 4,

    we have the results and validation of our platform. We ﬁnally conclude the paper
    with a

    summary of our platform and its uniqueness compared to the other existing solutions
    in

    Sect. 5.

    Literature Review

    The reliability of PnP in IoT systems is linked to the diverse components of the
    IoT

    architecture. Therefore, there is a need to understand the different architectural
    imple-

    mentations for IoTplatforms that cover theexistingdomains. Inthefollowing, wediscuss

    the existing systems and their architectural implementations.

    IoT Platforms and Architectures The IoT architectures that exist today have an
    evolv-

    ing pattern, each new one overcomes the major challenges faced by the previous
    one.

    The initial approach was the three-layered architecture (Fig. 1.a) [5] with a
    limitation of

    having only the cloud layer for data processing, then came the Fog layer architecture,

    which resolved the limitations of cloud computing, by extending cloud-based services

    and bringing them closer to the IoT end-user environment, but it still had many
    issues

    on every layer, each distinguished by speciﬁc faults and errors that lead to an
    overall

    infective IoT system: * First, starting from the end-user layer, where the sensors
    and/or

    actuators recording environmental data could have reading errors [6]. * Second,
    the

    fog layer, where the gateways face a lack of memory, and processor overloading
    and

    overheating, which leads to serious issues in IoT systems [6, 7]. * Third, the
    network

    layer where communication links in the IoT system are frequently prone to breaking,

    malfunctioning (e.g., incorrect state), or unavailability of the medium [7]. *
    Fourth, the

    cloud layer with the challenge of sustaining all the different connected gateways,
    on

    both the computation and maintenance level.

    We run a generalized analysis on the existing IoT platforms based on the following

    metrics- the deployment duration, the real-time capability, the reliability of
    the system,

    the business layer (mainly the data visualization aspect), and ﬁnally the cost
    factor, and

    following are the results. The existing platforms can be classiﬁed into two major
    groups

    * Consumer IoT (e.g., OpenHAB [8], SmartThings [9], HomeKit [10]) and * Enter-

    prise IoT (e.g., AWS IoT [11], Watson IoT [12]), the dependencies of this classiﬁcation

    include functionality and contextual information, interoperability, scalability,
    security,

    and costs [13]. We can categorize the existing platforms into three sets. * The
    ﬁrst set of

    IoT Architecture with Plug and Play for Fast Deployment and System

    45

    Fig. 1. IoT (a) three-layered, (b) ﬁve-layered, and (c) Fog/IoT architectures
    [5]

    the platform involves a centralized hub (e.g., OpenHAB or SmartThings). The advan-

    tage is that it provides data processing and storage in the local settings meaning
    fast data

    processing and real-time visualization along with ofﬂine capabilities. The disadvantages

    include higher resource requirements, higher cost of the entire setup. This implemen-

    tation also involves a lot of user intervention for the conﬁguration of the system
    which

    hinders its scalability factor and in turn does not support the PnP aspect of
    IoT systems.

    * The second set, which involves the cloud implementations, avoids the initial
    involve-

    ment of the users to a greater extent along with no requirements of any speciﬁc
    hubs

    which reduces the cost (e.g., AWS IoT, Watson IoT). The major drawback is the
    real-time

    performance or the reliability of the system as it depends on the connectivity
    of the sys-

    tems. *The third set is the hybrid approach which uses most of the hub implementations

    and the cloud services. Watson IoT or AWS IoT or SmartThings have tried optimizing

    the entire platform pipeline by segregating them into the local edge processing
    and the

    cloud processing, but we still ﬁnd issues with deployments or installations due
    to the

    complexities of having to conﬁgure the environmental settings. The other major
    issue is

    the cost of the systems, which are often not affordable to all users.

    Plug and Play in IoT Platforms In order to overcome the abovementioned issues,
    sev-

    eral studies draw their attention to bring the idea of PnP into IoT platforms.
    Kim et al.

    [14] proposed using web semantics to manage IoT devices. In their approach all
    sensors

    and actuators are connected to Arduino boards as embedded IoT devices. Each Arduino

    can accept conﬁguration from central server and adapt their functionality to the
    new con-

    ﬁguration. Meanwhile, they developed a Knowledge Base which stores the conﬁguration

    of all supported devices and once a new device is connected, appropriate conﬁguration

    is shared with the device so that they can start collecting data or triggering
    actions to

    control the environment. As a result, they were able to reduce the complexity
    of deploy-

    ments and provide more dynamicity in IoT environments. However, they only focused

    on the perception layer and did not address the business and application layer,
    and how to

    visualize the result dynamically. *) Kim et al. [15] target a framework dynamic
    enough

    to integrate new sensors, devices or services to an environment. They proposed
    a device

    discovery service that (1) automatically detect and generate a description of
    the device

    46

    B. Abdulrazak et al.

    and its functionalities, and (2) integrating that same device seamlessly in the
    reasoning

    process without causing any interruption to platform or the framework functionality.

    *) Kesavan et al., bring forward the scalability and dynamic approach which is
    an essen-

    tial aspect for remote monitoring of patient data with real time analysis [16].
    In their

    proposed method they focused on the scalability of the system in accordance with
    the

    PnP approach. The gateway is capable of handling dynamic addition of sensors and

    is capable of handling data transmission in a seamless manner. Another aspect
    of this

    method is the edge analytics part which informs the users of the battery level
    status of

    the sensors used so that necessary actions can be taken when required.

    3

    AMI Platform

    To address all the drawbacks of the implementations described above, we built
    AMI

    platform, based on the fog layered architecture (Fig. 1.c). AMI platform architecture

    has ﬁve main layers (Fig. 2), the edge layer which includes all the sensing devices
    with

    different communication protocols, the fog layer which is tasked with preprocessing
    the

    acquired data before sending it to the above layers, then comes the network layer
    which

    deals with the communication protocols and the security and privacy of the data
    being

    transmitted to the cloud. The fourth layer is the cloud layer, where the data
    received is

    decoded and processed in speciﬁc models which are then stored in storage hubs.
    The

    ﬁnal layer is the business layer where the real-time data is visualized in a dynamic
    pattern

    through dashboards based on the user speciﬁcation. Our platform targets supporting
    PnP

    features in all the presented layers, and as well as the link between them.

    3.1

    Architecture Overview

    The AMI Platform involves a set of physical (i.e., sensing devices and computing
    hard-

    ware) and logical (i.e., software applications and virtual computing resources)
    com-

    ponents that collect, process, transmit, store, and analyze data. These components
    are

    layered following Fog Computing architecture.

    The physical gateway is situated in the end-user environment. It represents the
    fog

    layer and thus the bridge connecting the sensor devices in the end-user layer
    with the

    network layer. Additionally, a virtual gateway is located inside the cloud infrastructure

    as an extension of the network layer, to receive the data transmitted through
    the network

    layer, and push it to the cloud storage. The beneﬁt of the separation is to utilize
    the

    computing resources on the gateways for pre-processing and ensuring the quality
    of

    service. A common challenge with the physical gateways is the deployment and update

    of the numerous services that are running on them that handle the communication
    and

    acquisition of data from sensors. Our focus while designing and building the physical

    gateway was to ensure the ease of PnP integration of a “Pipeline” that automatically

    or semi-automatically handles the deployment of said services. The data ﬂows through

    the platform as follows: First, at the end-user layer, a cluster of heterogeneous
    sensors

    collects both environmental (e.g., temperature, motion, location) and biomedical
    (e.g.,

    heart rate, breathing rate, sleep pattern) data. Next, the data is sent to the
    physical

    gateway for pre-processing and pushed to the cloud layer via a secure channel
    created

    by the network layer. Upon arriving at the cloud layer, the data will be decoded,
    processed

    in speciﬁc formats, and stored in databases. The business layer is for the user
    interface

    which also has models for dynamic graphs and charts creation which helps for a
    better

    adaptation of data visualization for any kind of user need. We also propose a
    different

    approach to resolve the existing challenges of scalability and maintainability
    based on

    microservices, where the different functional components of the system are split
    into

    independent applications [17].

    3.2

    Edge Layer

    In the context of IoT, the end-user layer is located in the monitored person’s
    living

    environment, and it is considered the entry point of the platform. It consists
    of a set

    of sensing devices of heterogeneous nature that observe key parameters of both
    the

    living environment and the person in multiple dimensions. *) Wearable Sensors
    (e.g.,

    Apple Watch, Garmin Watch, Fitbit Watch, Mi Bands, Pulse Oximeters), which are

    installed and/or implanted on participants’ bodies (e.g., wrist, ﬁngers) to monitor
    their

    everyday activities, provide various measurements, including motion (e.g., acceleration,

    step count, distance walking), location (e.g., attitude, longitude, altitude),
    biomedical

    information (e.g., heart rate, heart rate viability, breathing rate, and oxygen
    saturation).

    One major advantage of wearable sensors is their portability: the participants
    can eas-

    ily carry the devices either at their home, doing outdoor activities, or during
    clinical

    assessment. However, this type of sensor also shows limitations under speciﬁc
    circum-

    stances. Because the patient’s expertise in advanced technologies cannot be guaranteed,

    ensuring proper charging, usage, and maintenance of the devices are challenging
    tasks.

    48

    B. Abdulrazak et al.

    *) To overcome these limitations, there is the second type of sensing devices,
    Environ-

    mental Sensors (e.g., door/window, motion, temperature, illuminance, and humidity

    sensors) that are designed to track indoor environmental parameters and patients’
    ADL

    continuously while maintaining their autonomy and independence [18]. These sensors

    are often installed in ﬁxed positions (e.g., wall, door, and window) inside a
    subjective

    room. *) Additionally, other sensors can be placed or connected to furniture such
    as

    the smart mat device, a highly sensitive micro-bend ﬁber optic sensor (MFOS) often

    placed on top of the bed (under the mattress or bed sheet) or on a char non-intrusively
    to

    monitor location information and vital signs (e.g., heart rate (HR), breathing
    rate (BR),

    Ballistocardiograph (BCG)), which enables the possibility of detecting sleep cycles
    and

    sleep disorders, such as Apnea [19].

    3.3

    Fog Layer

    Our implementation of the fog layer is represented as a physical gateway, that
    acts as the

    hub for multiple devices with different communication protocols. The physical
    gateway

    hasthefollowingmajorfunctionalities:*)Dataacquisition:thegatewaysupportsdiverse

    communication protocols, e.g., Z-Wave, Insteon, Bluetooth, Serial line communications,

    and other similar protocols. Each adapter is an abstract layer for the hardware
    and

    constantly listens to its corresponding sensor. It also enables easy and reliable
    integration

    of new devices (PnP concept in sensor installation [20]) with the same set of
    protocols.

    *) Preprocessing of data: the raw data obtained from heterogeneous sensors suffers

    from poor interoperability, so the data format varies between different types
    of sensors,

    leading to difﬁculties in data interpretation and transmission. Therefore, we
    developed a

    data model library to overcome this issue. The data model library enables the
    gateway to

    pre-process the data by adding semantic information and populating its values
    into one

    of the compatible formats. *) Data Transfer: The next step is the transfer of
    data from the

    edge layer to the network layer, the processed data is sent through network protocols,
    for

    example, the messaging protocol called Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)

    or the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) protocol. Currently, in our implementation,

    we are using MQTT as it has a publish-and-subscribe architecture where the client

    devices and applications publish and subscribe to topics handled by a broker.
    *) Status

    Updates: The other service offered by the gateway is the system or status updates.
    All

    the above-mentioned services require system resources and to avoid failures the
    system

    check services provide live status updates of the resources, for example, CPU,
    memory,

    and internet connectivity.

    3.4

    Network Layer

    Sending conﬁdential data and information over the internet is vulnerable to attacks,
    so it

    is critical to create a secure channel for connections, which is taken care of
    by the network

    layer, the subspace between the physical gateway (at the edge of the end-user
    layer) and

    the virtual gateway (at the edge of the cloud layer). A great amount of effort
    is put into

    securing the network connection. *) Firstly, a virtual network is created to establish
    a

    peer-to-peer secure channel between the two gateways, adding an extra layer of
    security

    to our protocol of communication. The advantages of the software network solution
    are

    IoT Architecture with Plug and Play for Fast Deployment and System

    49

    efﬁciency and quick adaptability. It takes advantage of the existing internet
    connection

    instead of setting up a new one. In our platform, we use OpenVPN to implement
    this

    secure channel. OpenVPN is an open-source virtual private network (VPN) system

    that creates routing and bridging connections between entities. An OpenVPN server

    automatically issues certiﬁcates for our physical and virtual gateways, triggered
    by their

    respective deployment pipelines, and then stores them in a secure storage hub.
    This

    approach limits the risks of transporting the certiﬁcates/keys from one entity
    to another

    one. *) lastly, enforce the ﬁrewall rule by allowing only a small number of essential

    connections and blocking all others. All communication between the physical gateways

    and virtual gateway goes through this channel, securing the conﬁdential data transmitted

    between them.

    3.5

    Cloud Layer

    The cloud layer is responsible for the management, storage of the collected data.
    Con-

    sidering the essential need for a real-time monitoring solution, the cloud infrastructure

    needs to have minimal delay and downtime, to allow for a reliable and real-time
    visual-

    ization and analysis. Hence, the agent-based microservices approach is adopted
    on the

    cloud layer. Each component on the cloud layer is containerized using Docker daemon.

    This allows easy deployment of components anywhere without having to worry about

    the speciﬁcs of the underlying platform.

    Virtual Gateway: Being the contact point of the cloud layer, the virtual gateway
    is

    created from a pre-built docker image and plays a crucial part in the platform.
    It connects

    with its peer physical gateway through the VPN in the network layer, receives
    data

    with the conﬁgured communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, REST), and reconstructs

    the data message using a mapping function to meet the requirement of the data
    storage.

    However, managing on the physical gateway the rapid evolution of sensors’ data
    models

    and numerous deployments of physical gateways requires a manual conﬁguration and

    intervention before every deployment and after every update. This challenge pushed
    us

    to build the gateway in a way that will allow for a PnP integration seamlessly
    with a

    pipeline that automates its deployments, and updates.

    Data Storage: IoT data representation and storage are an ever-changing and expanding

    ﬁeld, with this in mind we have opted to use a non-relation database, or more
    speciﬁcally

    document based. The advantages of this are: 1) ﬁrst the dynamicity and ﬂexibility
    of

    document-based databases, which is particularly useful for our platform due to
    the evo-

    lution of data generated by IoT devices over time, and by eliminating the time
    required

    to adapt or update the structure of tables or other entities to allow inserting
    new ﬁelds or

    data models; 2) second the horizontal scalability of non-relational databases,
    as opposed

    to vertical scalability of relational databases [21]. As consequence, keeping
    up with the

    increase in either the volume or velocity is only a question of adding more nodes
    to the

    database cluster. This architecture also ensures higher availability because,
    if any node

    fails, all its functions will be delegated to other nodes in that cluster. Our
    choice of data

    Business Layer

    Data Visualization: Environmental and wearable sensors acquire a massive amount
    of

    data, e.g., on average, 1.2 to 1.8 million entries per day during the course of
    our ﬁrst

    deployment. With such amount of data constantly generated, it is crucial to develop

    an appropriate visualization tool that can present collected information in real-time
    to

    provide better assistance to the end-users. However, the variety of needs, roles,
    and

    metrics in different applications along with changes in needs over time make it
    difﬁcult

    to have only one dashboard to ﬁt all the needs. Our adaptive solution enables
    even users

    without technical knowledge to create a dashboard adapted to their needs in minimal

    time.

    Fig. 3. Approach for adaptive data visualization

    In our architecture, a unique approach is taken to ensure PnP by visualizing data

    adaptively (Fig. 3). We ﬁrst choose web-based technologies to create our system
    due

    to their accessibility. Unlike traditional software that is tied to a speciﬁc
    system, web

    applications are reachable from multiple platforms, including desktop, mobile,
    tablets,

    and smart TV. Through these web-based solutions, we enable users to dynamically
    deﬁne

    the environment and add sensors to it. When the environment model is deﬁned, they
    can

    design the dashboard based on their needs which will be adapted to the environment

    automatically. This system consists of three major components:

    1) Chart Template Designer: Empower users to dynamically design charts and save

    them as templates speciﬁc to each type of sensors. Users can choose the data source

    and visually generate queries to ﬁlter data for charts. Once the user ﬁnalizes
    the chart

    design, the conﬁguration of the designed chart is stored in our data storage,
    and the

    deﬁned query is parsed to accept parameters in order to enable linking the designed

    charts to external parameters. The ﬁrst step to design charts is to retrieve required
    data

    from the data source. We used a query builder tool to allow users to deﬁne their
    intended

    criteria to ﬁlter fetched data. We added the concept of chart template to our
    platform in

    which when a request is sent to view a chart, the conﬁguration of the chart along
    with

    other information will be loaded. Thus, the designed system gives the user ﬂexibility
    to

    reuse designed charts in many places by only passing the required parameters (e.g.,
    a

    device id).

    2) Environment Conﬁguration Tool: This tool enables non-technical users to create
    a

    3D model of the deployment environment, input the address and occupants, and place

    IoT Architecture with Plug and Play for Fast Deployment and System

    51

    items, furniture, and predeﬁned sensors using simple drag-and-drop actions [Fig.
    4].

    The output of this component is used by Dashboard Designer and Reasoner Engine
    to

    generate the intended design and knowledge for each space in this environment.
    We

    deﬁned the concept of “Space” in our platform as a group of sensors, associated
    with a

    place. The output generated by this tool is a number of “Spaces,” each of them
    includes

    several sensors and descriptive information about the area. This form of output
    enables

    all other consumer components to adapt themselves to the different Spaces.

    Fig. 4. 3D representation of the environment

    3) Dashboard Designer: Allows users to dynamically design their desired pages
    accord-

    ing to the needs. This designer incorporates conﬁguration tool data and designed
    chart

    templates to visualize sensors information on the pages automatically. Users can
    drag

    and drop necessary components to the page and easily move the elements and change

    components’ size to achieve the desired design. A rich set of components are added
    to

    the designer which enables users to add and customize pages and link them to environ-

    mental sensors. Once the design is ﬁnished, the design will be applied to the
    all provided

    “Spaces,” received from conﬁguration tool and the data sources for elements in
    each page

    will be adapted to the related environment automatically. e.g., a user may design
    a chart

    to visualize room temperature, they can design it for one room and the dashboard
    engine

    will adapt the chart for other rooms provided by conﬁguration tool and replace
    all the

    required parameters to visualize data related to each room. Another layer of ﬂexibility

    is provided by allowing users to customize the elements for one speciﬁc environment
    so

    that they can fully adjust the design and deliver the data collected from sensors
    instantly

    to intended users. To manage the access level of designed pages, we built an integrated

    authentication system based on JWT tokens, each token contains information about
    the

    user and their assigned roles. Once a user logs into the system, a token is automatically

    added to the requests which allows the server to authenticate users. This authentication

    52

    B. Abdulrazak et al.

    service is integrated with our designer to allow speciﬁc groups of users to have
    access

    to certain pages.

    4

    Pipelines

    To speed up the process of PnP deploying and running the system, we have created
    a

    set of pipelines to automate the deployment of all services on every layer of
    the Fog

    Computing Architecture. It is a three steps process that starts from a sensor-gateway

    connection and ends with a running, real-time dashboard.

    4.1

    Gateway

    The gateway acting as the hub is capable of handling multiple sensors simultaneously.

    For the installation of the services to provide the functionalities described
    in the previous

    section, we use Ansible to automatize the process. The ansible scripts are divided
    into

    three sections, ﬁrst group of scripts are tasked with installation of all the
    required depen-

    dencies that our services would be needing to run properly in the system, along
    with this

    the setting up of ﬁrewall rules and other security aspects are also taken care
    of by these

    group of scripts, the second section includes the installation scripts for all
    the services

    provided by our platform, from cloning the repositories to providing them the
    execution

    rights to act as a system service is being handled in this section. The third
    section is

    the self-healing installation phase, it installs services that are used for monitoring
    the

    system resources, and report back for cases of abnormalities. This approach results
    in

    a signiﬁcant decrease in user complexity and errors in the installation phase.
    Once the

    installation is done the gateway nodes are ready to plug and play for any deployment.

    The time taken for this installation phase of the deployment process is approximately

    less than thirty minutes. The gateway nodes have OpenVPN installed during this
    process,

    which gives them a secure connection to the servers to communicate with.

    4.2

    Server

    The server pipeline consists of two main steps, both of which are automated with
    a script

    as well and require only the identiﬁer of the gateway being deployed for an easy
    PnP

    solution. Each step corresponds to a layer in the Fog Computing Architecture.
    The ﬁrst

    step is the conﬁguration of the Network Layer by registering the gateway certiﬁcates
    in

    the VPN server and then setting up ﬁrewall rules to only accommodate the ports
    used

    by our services, thus protecting the connection between the server and the gateway
    by

    ﬁltering and blocking all other trafﬁc from gaining unauthorized access. The second

    step is to conﬁgure the node microservice that is responsible for receiving and
    pushing

    the data into our storage hub. As we support multiple communication protocols,
    the

    microservices need to be conﬁgured to a speciﬁc protocol before their deployment.

    Once the execution of the deployment script ﬁnishes, the gateway would be able
    to

    connect to our VPN server and start sending the data collected from the sensors
    and

    actuators to our node microservice, which will then be pushed to our data store.

    53

    4.3

    Dashboard

    This step completes the IoT cycle by offering a plug-and-lay solution to design
    a dash-

    board where we can monitor the collected data in real-time. The ﬁrst step is to
    design the

    Environment in our 3D conﬁguration tool where we would create the 3D space where

    we have deployed our gateway and communicate with it to collect the list of sensors
    and

    actuators that have been deployed in the environment. Right after we feed the
    generated

    Environment Model to our Dashboard Designer to automatically generate a view for
    all

    the spaces in the environment and the devices that have been deployed in each
    space.

    The user has full ﬂexibility to design the required pages.

    Results and Analysis/Validation

    Our platform was deployed for a project which validates the working of our architectural

    metrics. The project was conducted for a span of six months at an apartment in
    AMI. The

    main goal of the project was to monitor the behavior change of a person based
    on the

    type of medication received at different stages of medical intervention. For the
    platform

    analysis, the metrics we targeted in this deployment are as follows:

    5.1

    Fast Deployment

    We deployed in an apartment to monitor the behavior of a person and to mark the
    changes

    with the change of medication provided to that person. In this deployment, we
    deployed

    two nodes (Raspberry PIs), ﬁve door sensors, and seven motion sensors, along with

    a sleep mat. The steps followed in the deployment of our platform in the apartment

    are as follows: scouting of the area to have a better understanding of the environment,

    start connecting our nodes to the power outlets and conﬁguring them with the network

    available in the apartment, once the node conﬁguration is done with the network
    we

    start attaching the sensors at different places in the apartment like the walls
    and doors,

    with the completion of our entire setup the ﬁnal step is to check the system performance

    and the data being transmitted to our servers. This entire deployment, from attaching

    the sensors to the walls and doors in every bedrooms and kitchen and living room,
    to

    deploying the nodes to set up the network for the nodes, took us less than two
    hours in

    the apartment.

    5.2

    System Reliability

    The key challenge in any IoT system is the reliability of the platform. Reliability
    in

    this context refers to system failures and the efﬁciency of the platform in providing

    the decided upon services through various technical and non-technical challenges.
    The

    technical challenges include the resources of the system, the CPU and memory capacities

    might fail or overﬂow with time resulting in an unreliable system. The non-technical

    challenges include internet failures, the ofﬂine capability of a system is a big
    challenge

    in the development of any IoT system nowadays. In our deployment, we received
    certain

    reporting on our system status (Fig. 5) which highlighted the warnings related
    to CPU

    usage, physical memory usage, internet connectivity, and service resource consumption.

    54

    5.3

    Real-Time Data Processing

    In the healthcare system, a real-time platform is essential because of the impact
    each

    data might contain. For example, heart rate monitoring systems cannot have a huge
    delay

    for patients with cardiac issues. In IoT, there are very few systems in the market
    that can

    provide a real-time data processing platform. The deployment of our platform was
    at

    an apartment in Sherbrooke, Canada, which is around 10 kms (about 6.21 mi) from
    our

    servers. Our architecture has proven to be able to provide a real-time data processing

    and visualization technique with an average delay of less than one second (Fig.
    6). We

    have a speciﬁc model for the data encapsulation in which we have two timestamps,
    the

    ﬁrst timestamp (phenomenonTime.instant in Fig. 6) is recorded at the moment the
    data

    is received from the sensors and the other timestamp (resultTime in Fig. 6) is
    noted after

    the data is processed in the gateway and is ready to be transmitted. Based on
    these two

    timestamps we see that there is very little to no delay being added in our data
    processing

    period.

    Discussion: Lessons Learned

    The results obtained with the deployment of our platform showcase our real-time
    success

    however we faced a few major challenges throughout the period of deployment. The

    ﬁrst major challenge was the sensors or device malfunctioning. Now our platform
    is

    dependent on third-party manufacturers for the devices and the sensors which hinder
    the

    performance of our system. One of the deployed sensors stopped working due to
    some

    manufacturing issues in the very ﬁrst week of deployment. We quickly resolved
    the issue,

    by changing the sensor with a new one, as our system has a continuous monitoring
    aspect

    which informed us about the failure in a short time interval. Using trusted manufacturers

    for the devices might lead to higher prices but comes with greater reliability.
    The second

    challenge was with memory leaks. Currently, the physical gateways (in our case,
    the

    raspberry pi) have a limited memory resource. Due to the explicit number of services

    runningtherewas amemoryleakconcerningtheloggingof issues. This issuewas quickly

    resolved with the introduction of another self-monitoring service which monitored
    the

    overall memory usage of the system along with speciﬁc usages by each service.
    If the

    usage surpasses a speciﬁc threshold the logs are rotated and the unwanted system
    logs are

    deleted. Along with this our visualization platform provided a great level of
    ﬂexibility

    and enabled us to design desired content for our deployments. However, there are
    still

    spaces left for improvement, especially when users add a large number of visualizations

    and charts. The high-frequency data generated by some devices (namely smart mats)

    was another challenge for visualization which we were able to overcome in the
    new

    versions of our platform. For our future works, we have already advanced on some
    new

    self-healing concepts [23] and distributed architecture to provide better performance

    while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) of our IoT platform.

    Conclusion

    Faster PnP deployments of IoT platforms with reliable performance, especially
    in tack-

    ling real-time data processing, is a challenge that hinders wider implementation
    of most

    IoT solutions. Thus, we focus in this paper on the approach to addressing these
    key issues.

    We start this paper by reviewing the progress of the research works related to
    IoT archi-

    tectures and platforms that are in the market. After analyzing the existing solution,
    we

    come across the deﬁnitive drawbacks, and we present our architecture and IoT platform

    which addresses these drawbacks. We also detailed in this paper each of the components

    of the architecture and described how components are connected to overcome the
    said

    drawbacks. The logic in our business layer provides for a unique approach to handling

    user speciﬁcations by creating dynamic dashboards. We highlighted the success
    and

    the challenges faced during the six months of deployment of our system in a residence

    which acts as proof of concept for our main objectives. It also opened the possibility
    of

    future developments and improvements. We target in our future work to focus more
    on

    the quality-of-service (QoS) nature of the platform and to have a distributed
    architecture

    to enhance our scalability aspect.

    robotic technology to assist the farmer by detecting the disease of leaf (guava
    as sample one) along with measuring the temperature and humidity. The initial
    goal was to implement a prototype and test its feasibility for helping the farmer
    to find out the diseases easily. The prototype has been designed with two features.
    One is motion and the second one is analysis with image processing along with
    real-time data processing. In motion part, the robot is taking the decision whether
    to take left turn, right turn or stop, based on three specific range of colors
    (preset on the field). In the second part the robot analyzes whether the leaf
    is normal or affected by disease. The temperature and humidity monitoring of the
    environment is an additional feature of the prototype. This prototype has been

    Location: DHAKA, Bangladesh I. Introduction The machine which is programmable
    by a computer and designed in such a way to execute complex tasks with speed and
    accuracy is called robot. Nowadays, robots are assisting the humans to do a lot
    of hard tasks and dangerous tasks in the universe which humans do not usually
    prefer [1] –[3]. In the early century first autonomous farming robot had been
    made [4]. In modern agricultural activities autonomous robots are built to attempt
    to harvest, water or seed. Some of the autonomous robots pick fruits from trees
    [5]. Weeds are very dangerous in farming field. They destroy farmer’s crop very
    easily. To solve that, farmers need to work very hard, which is also a time-consuming
    task. To overcome that problem autonomous weed removing tractors have been used
    [6]. That kind of robots can detect weeds and able to kill weeds in the field.
    Some robots can travel over plant’s row and send data to the farmer to optimize
    seeds procreation. In texture mapping, F. C. Crow did an outstanding research
    [7]. For an autonomous robot, object detection is also very important. R. Lienhart
    and J. Maydt had analyzed the object detection of farming criteria brilliantly
    [8]. Moreover, O. Jensen and S. C. Nelson, researched on plant disease and performed
    some methods of detection; which had been helpful to implement on autonomous farming
    robot [9]–[10]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

    View Full Text PDF Abstract The current global water crisis, caused by factors
    such as population growth, urbanization, and climate change, has a significant
    impact on agriculture, which consumes 70% of the world''s freshwater. One potential
    solution to this problem is the use of intelligent irrigation systems. Cloud-based
    smart irrigation systems offer a more efficient and cost-effective approach to
    water consumption management. This study examines the concept of cloud-based smart
    irrigation systems, their advantages, and their potential application in agriculture.
    To begin, the authors detail the various components of a cloud-based smart irrigation
    system, including sensors, controllers, and cloud computing. They then explore
    the benefits of cloud-based systems, which include scalability, cost-effectiveness,
    and real-time data processing capabilities. They also delve into the different
    types of sensors used in smart irrigation systems, such as soil moisture, weather,
    and crop sensors, as well as their respective advantages and limitations. Furthermore,
    they discuss the various controllers utilized in smart irrigation systems, such
    as scheduling, sensor-based, and weather-based controllers. They elaborate on
    how these controllers function and the advantages they offer in terms of water
    conservation and crop yield optimization. Lastly, they examine the practical application
    of cloud-based smart irrigation systems in agriculture, including how to create,
    implement, and tailor the system to suit the specific requirements of a particular
    farm. They also consider potential barriers to adoption, such as cost and technological
    complexity, and how to overcome them. In short, cloud-based smart irrigation systems
    present a promising solution to the water crisis in agriculture. These systems
    can significantly reduce water waste, increase crop yield, and save costs by utilizing
    cloud computing technology to manage irrigation. With careful planning, installation,
    and configuration, cloud-based smart irrigation systems have the potential to
    be an effective tool for farmers in improving their productivity and sustainability.

    Preview Introduction Water management and irrigation systems have been an integral
    part of human civilization for thousands of years. From the ancient civilizations
    of Mesopotamia to the modern-day societies, water management has played a crucial
    role in sustaining human life and fostering economic development. The history
    of water management can be traced back to the early agricultural societies, where
    farmers used simple techniques, such as diverting water from rivers and streams
    to irrigate their crops. In many parts of the world, water was considered a scarce
    resource, and the ability to manage it effectively was critical for survival.
    As societies became more complex, so did their water management systems. Xiao
    Yun Zheng (2021) explains the water management in ancient Egypt, for example,
    the construction of canals and reservoirs allowed farmers to harness the power
    of the Nile River to irrigate their crops. The Maya civilization of Central America
    also developed sophisticated water management systems that allowed them to grow
    crops in areas with limited rainfall. The importance of water management and irrigation
    systems continued to grow as societies became more urbanized and industrialized.
    In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution led to the development of large-scale
    irrigation systems that allowed for the cultivation of crops on a massive scale.
    The construction of dams and reservoirs also became increasingly common, providing
    a reliable source of water for both agriculture and industry. Today, water management
    and irrigation systems are more important than ever. As the world''s population
    continues to grow and climate change brings more unpredictable weather patterns,
    the need for effective water management has become critical. Governments and organizations
    around the world are investing in advanced water management technologies and infrastructure
    to ensure that future generations have access to clean water and food security.
    In short, the history of water management and irrigation systems is a testament
    to humanity''s ability to adapt and innovate in the face of challenges. As we
    look towards the future, it is clear that effective water management will play
    a critical role in ensuring the health and prosperity of our planet and its people.
    We all know about the scenario of water scarcity. It affects not only rural areas
    but also urban areas. This scarcity is further exacerbated by the uneven distribution
    of rainfall between locations and at different times of the year. As per information
    given by AQUASTAT, the global information system of the Food and Agricultural
    Organization of the United Nations (FOA), the agricultural industry uses 69% of
    the fresh water available on Earth. Water''s significance and requirement may
    be seen in the agricultural production industry and for ensuring food security.
    Almost 40% of the world''s food is produced by irrigated agriculture. But farmers
    still irrigate their crops using conventional irrigation systems. These systems
    are time- and labor-intensive and ineffective, especially when several fields
    are dispersed over various geographical areas. For instance, in developing nations,
    farmers are required to constantly visit their fields and remain there when irrigation
    is taking place in order to manage and plan irrigation in the area in question.
    Moreover, conventional irrigation frequently results in the issue of overwatering,
    which uses a lot of water. Moreover, it may result in concerns with inadequate
    irrigation, which impacts crop quality. Farmers that only use rainwater for irrigation
    are concerned about this. As a result, it becomes extremely important to monitor
    and manage each crop''s water requirements. Regardless of weather, soil type,
    or crop variety, this irrigation method must carefully match the water needs of
    the entire field. Due to evaporation and a lack of suitable resources, a large
    amount of irrigation water is squandered. Irrigation system management of water
    resources becomes crucial in agriculture to aid farmers in improving their produce.
    A smart irrigation system strategy has emerged to solve this issue. The system
    will be more practical and able to monitor a variety of characteristics, including
    temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, utilizing a variety of sensors thanks
    to the use of IoT. Continue Reading References Follow Reference Agarwal, S., &

    in agri-food supply chains. Abstract The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to
    the term "Industry 4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the
    origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept
    of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry
    2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution
    by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including
    and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well
    as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit
    real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge
    is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised
    within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply
    chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain
    is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the
    domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and
    has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition,
    electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several
    agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals
    and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use
    of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains
    performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved
    and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance
    in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support
    a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to
    farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore,
    in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the
    new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand
    the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. Previous article in issue Next article

    to support rural employment and to make a considerable contribution to territorial
    development. Even though they have always been considered a cornerstone of agricultural
    activity in the European Union (EU), this sector most often suffers from very
    low efficiency and effectiveness, sensitivity to weather, market disruptions and
    other external factors, such as poor agriculture supply chain stakeholders’ linkages
    and communication, especially at the food processing level. In fact, and as stablished
    by the FAO,1 under an approach from “field to fork” the agriculture supply chain
    structures can also be named Agri-Food supply chains, where main events coming
    from the agricultural production of food to the food processing events, including
    trading, are linked. Across this Agri-Food Supply Chain, in most of the cases,
    the transferred agriculture knowledge, from generation to generation, is paramount
    from a cultural point of view, but most of the time, it does not answer to the
    needs nor the requirements of the Agri-Food Supply Chains. Furthermore, such delineation
    does not exist also between farms as economic units and farmers who are producing
    food, mostly, for their own consumption. However, no formal delineation to what
    is a “small” and/or a “large” farm formally exists that is holistically accepted,
    it depends on several factors, such as countries, regions, politics, strategies,
    market shares amongst many others. Nonetheless, there are two criteria to classify
    farm size: standard output (in economic terms) and utilised agricultural area
    (UAA), as alternative measure2 . In this same line, Eurostat3 predicts that, by
    2026, an increment of 4%–6% in agriculture cost savings, as well as an increment
    of 3 % in market value, will be regarded to the use and development of smart agriculture.
    Hence, “Agriculture 4.0″ emerges to provide advanced technologies to the famers
    in order to meet agri-food production challenges, hence, to achieve more affordable
    prices for open market and the minimum cost for farmers. Thus, the expectation
    for the further coming years, is that Agri-Food 4.0 should help meeting sustainable
    challenges by increasing the agri-food supply chain stakeholders revenues as well
    as decreasing their pressure for handling complex and external factors they cannot
    control, such as weather, market behaviours and policies, but also to react on
    time by visualising current trends in needs. This paper focus principally on the
    factory farm model issued from the European and north American style. In those
    typologies of farms the Industry 4.0 elements can be introduced and merged with
    the agricultural domain to create the Agri-Food 4.0. The focus is more specialised
    on the industrial farming although the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted
    also to the organic and silvo-pasture paradigms. Thus, this paper, considering
    a review over than two hundred papers, provides a contribution to knowledge by
    establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies and Agri-Food
    Supply Chain Challenges, which opens the 4.0 research field for a multidisciplinary
    work. The choice of the literature review methodology focused firstly on key words
    related to the Agri-food technology, then the second approach was to focus on
    selected journals and at the end we looked for the data-based repository and the
    linked publications. To accomplish this, the structure in this paper is as follows:
    in the first place, a compressive state of the art of Agri-Food 4.0 related technologies
    is covered. In the second place, a review and contribution coming from digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food shows linkages with
    next trends and technologies. Next, and linked to the agri-food supply chain challenges,
    the fourth section presents new trends and models in agri-food supply chains,
    especially in the domain of risk management, collaboration, governance, cold chain
    management, globalization, information and communication technologies, Logistics,
    supply chain structures and sustainable agri-food supply chains. Finally, the
    fifth section covers the main conclusions, visions and perspectives for this novel
    research. 2. Agri-food 4.0 and technologies state-of-the-art The agricultural
    sector has been active in digital innovation for decades already. Especially the
    advances in Precision Agriculture, remote sensing, robots, farm management information
    systems, and (agronomic) decision support systems have paved the way for a broad
    digital transformation in farming and food (Pedro and Gonzalez-Andujar, 2019).
    Recent developments, such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain,
    Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, allow for the integration of so far isolated
    lines of development into smart, connected systems of systems. Those technologies
    will let the agriculture to evolve in a data-driven, intelligent, agile and autonomous
    connected system of systems. The operations of each agricultural process will
    be automatically integrated in the food chain through the semantically active
    technologies up to the end consumer. The 4th industrial revolution is now reaching
    agriculture. The digital platform (DP) concept emerged as an integration of heterogeneous
    mainly open software solutions for ecosystem building (Yablonsky, 2018). The EU
    promote the creation of digital platforms for several application domains as manufacturing
    (i.e. FoF 11 – 2016 projects, DT-ICT-07-2018-2019, etc.), construction (BIM + calls),
    etc. As a concentration of technology enablers, research on DP covers several
    issues such as software engineering (Guertin and Van Benthem, 2016; Wang et al.,
    2006), process simulation and development (Zhao and Yao, 2016; Hu et al., 2016),
    features analysis (Wang et al., 2014), resource performance (Mocnej et al., 2018),
    test algorithms (Santiago et al., 2017) or performance control (Sahota et al.,
    2011). The technological platforms allow access to the different stakeholders
    and provide deployment capabilities for IT solutions. These solutions are exposed
    by service providers or developed by software engineers. Agricultural Data management
    and exploitation is the central node between digital transformation capabilities
    and the agriculture concerns. The main research issues concern the consolidation
    of data repositories with open data (Gumaste and Kadam, 2016) (weather, maps,
    etc.), governance data (policies, local regulation, etc.) and domain specific
    data from end users. Data typology is very rich (land, location, energy, climate,
    climate impact, etc.) and data volume is continually increasing by the integration
    of sensors and IoT platforms in agriculture (Amandeep et al., 2017; Biradar and
    Shabadi, 2017). Data engineering effort covers pattern definition (Laube et al.,
    2011; Spekken et al., 2016), classification algorithms (Narvaez et al., 2018;
    Shi et al., 2015; Yalcin and Razavi, 2016), correlation analysis (Nilsson et al.,
    2016; Xavier et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2017), etc. All those technologies provide
    engineering capabilities for agricultural data. The implementation of these techniques
    will handle farmers data, will integrate new data repositories from external providers,
    will transform data to knowledge and feed decision support systems. The data transparency
    enabler with necessary sharing policies will accelerate data ingestion and ejection
    processes. 2.1. Big data technologies Research activities in Big Data provide
    relevant results in several application domains (healthcare, marketing, maritime,
    urban, manufacturing, etc.). The Big Data Value Association (BDVA)4 promote the
    application of bigdata in different domains (Belaud et al., 2019). The Big Data
    Grapes EU project5 provides data semantic, analytics, integration and exploitation
    solutions as well as a software stack for grapes agriculture. As additional ongoing
    research issues, we identified tools and technology development (Devarakonda et
    al., 2014; Hashem and Ranc, 2016), analytic methods and services (Malhotra et
    al., 2017; Deka and Walczak, 2017), clustering methods (Balan et al., 2015), transformation
    algorithms (Penar and Wilczek, 2016; Hashem and Ranc, 2016) performance and data
    processing technics (Wu and Zhao, 2009), data source and storage management (Cha
    et al., 2018; RubyDinakar and Vagdevi, 2017), etc. The integration of Big Data
    technologies in Agri-Food projects plays an important role in: the extension of
    farmers data to create new knowledge; the creation of innovative services and
    processes by IT providers and software developers as well as the extension and
    the adaptation of ICT and Factories of the Future (FoF)6 related Big Data models
    and patterns for agriculture. There are several Big Data Repositories that guarantee,
    nowadays, the access and the exploitation to Agri-Food data. As example: the “National
    Climatic Data Centre” (about 2,9 Go per day); Satellite Imagery and metrological
    information from Google and the NASA Earth Exchange; Soil, water and geospatial
    data from the National Resources Conservation Service (US); the OpenCorporates
    as the world’s largest open repository of companies (165 million companies around
    the word); etc. 2.2. Internet of things technologies The integration of IoT platforms
    in agriculture provides additional data sources describing agricultural features
    (water, soil, humans, animals, etc.) with more data. The recent research issues
    on IoT highlight the multiplication of IoT platforms. This expansion generates
    new implementation frameworks (Lee et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018) answering
    to different requirement models, new networks of heterogeneous components and
    sensors with different monitoring models (Pflanz et al., 2018; Vergara et al.,
    2017; Prathibha et al., 2017), time processing scheme and misbalanced energy consumption
    (Ruano et al., 2018; Jarolimek et al., 2016). The integration of the IoT platforms
    with the agricultural issues could add additional research challenges, specifically
    when the data are stocked or used in the cloud, in terms of interoperability (Panetto,
    2007; Mocnej et al., 2018; Zarko et al., 2017; Hefnawy et al., 2017; Martinez
    et al., 2016; Leal et al., 2019; Panetto et al., 2016) (protocols, security, etc.),
    performance monitoring (Paulraj et al., 2018; Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017), etc.
    In addition, IoT serves Robotics (Murar and Brad, 2015) and Automated Guided Vehicles
    (AGV) (Sanchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). An interesting activity might be the
    benchmarking of all the existing IoT platforms and their proposed functionalities
    and mapping them with Agri-Food stakeholders’ requirements. The integration of
    IoT capabilities will support farmers in the harvesting of new data sources to
    create new valuable services. 2.3. Knowledge model approaches The development
    of valuable knowledge models in agriculture aims to transform shared multi-sources
    data repositories to create profitable services and support the decision making
    for different stakeholders. Recent research topics address precise data collection
    and engineering to serve knowledge creation of new farming models (Abdullah et
    al., 2017; Irmak et al., 2006), technology application in farming (Chen and Jin,
    2011; Gerhards et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2013), resource allocation (Garcia
    et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2017; Musacchio and Grant, 2002), assessment frameworks
    (for risk, policies definition and quality management) (Jacxsens et al., 2016;
    Louwagie et al., 2012) as well as the qualification of decision models (Costanzo
    and Faro, 2012; Dragincic et al., 2015) and the identification of decision parameters
    (region, land, climate, plant, time, process, etc.). 2.4. Artificial intelligence
    techniques Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques propose important contributions
    to knowledge model’s identification, service creation and the decision-making
    processes as support for the different Agri-Food’s applications (Solemane et al.,
    2019). AI offers formal general algorithms for prediction (Bhatt and Buch, 2015;
    Soh et al., 2018), accuracy and performance evaluation (Jeon et al., 2017) as
    well as pattern classification (Ott et al., 2003; Pinho et al., 2011; Starr, 2005)
    that might solve knowledge issues in the agricultural domain such as the pest’s
    identifications and the correct treating methods. In addition, AI supports applications
    in farming technics development: land allocation regarding the targeted activity
    (Pokhrel et al., 2018), irrigation process analysis and control (Ait-Mouheb et
    al., 2018; Mohanraj et al., 2017), robot guidance (Tian et al., 2018; Roshanianfard
    et al., 2018; Sheridan, 2016), etc. 2.5. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture emerges
    as a main concept in Agri-Food 4.0. By integrating new technology enablers propelled
    by the Industry 4.0 paradigm (Annosi et al., 2019), smart agriculture addresses
    important farming objectives as water saving (O’Connor and Mehta, 2016), soil
    conservation (Li et al., 2002), limit carbon emission (Ochoa et al., 2014) and
    productivity increasing (Mayer et al., 2015) by doing more with less. The new
    agricultural age aims to harmonize and share better local European policies and
    rules to scale the best farming practices and applications. Smart agriculture
    offers the opportunity to farmers, technology and service providers, governance
    agencies and other impacted stakeholders (financial organization, investors, traders,
    etc.) to share their experiences and preoccupations in the optimization in the
    farming Supply Chain with the close respect of production sustainability (Swisher
    et al., 2018; Oberholster et al., 2015). 2.6. Precision farming techniques and
    robot development The Precision Farming topic is already covered by other H2020
    calls (SFS-05-2017, SFS-06-2018-2020, SFS-08-2018-2019, etc.). The analysis of
    released projects outcomes and related research issues allows to identify new
    technologies, processes and applications in agriculture. Relevant models are proposed
    for land, grain and arable related activities (Gumma et al., 2016). Relevant listed
    results cover harvesting distribution accuracy (Roshanianfard et al., 2018; Kamata
    et al., 2018; Alzahrani, 2018), cost development (Pomar et al., 2010) and distribution
    optimization (Zhou et al., 2018; Tabatabaie et al., 2013; Ruiz-Garcia et al.,
    2010; Eisele et al., 2001). Within the Agri-Food projects is planned to reuse
    available precision farming technologies and results to improve the quality of
    targeted farmers’ processes and applications. Results in the integration of robots
    in agriculture are well mature and already proposed by Agri-Food stakeholders.
    With precision farming enablers, it will be ensured the performance of impacted
    farming processes. Agriculture Robots are already investigated in the precision
    farming topic. Recent research in this area covers the adaptability of robot design
    to the agriculture sector, the improvement of navigation conditions through additional
    sensing (Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2017; Jhonattan et al., 2019) and localization
    capabilities as well as real-time image processing (Xu et al., 2017; Pilli et
    al., 2015) and camera detection (Dworak et al., 2013) to maximize the operational
    capabilities and behaviour of robots and collaborative robots (cobots). Robots
    can assist humans (Chilcanan et al., 2017; Dondeynaz et al., 2013) for difficult
    tasks or replace them for difficult ones. The cost reduction (Pomar et al., 2010)
    effectiveness is demonstrated and research in decision error reduction (Montecinos
    et al., 2018; Shin and Ko, 2017; Brigido et al., 2015) is intensive to improve
    accuracy by simulation (Xu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Latorre-Biel et al.,
    2018) and by more precise path finding (Spekken et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2017)
    and guidance algorithms (Kviz et al., 2014; Baio, 2012). The new Agri-Food projects
    fund the integration of Agriculture Robots to support the applications since the
    beginning to ensure the maximum results. Building resilient and sustainable farming
    system is the ultimate concept behind Agriculture 4.0. Recent research in this
    topic covers farming processes sustainability analysis (McGuire and Sperling,
    2013; Joly, 2005), farming activity calibration (Suryoputro et al., 2017; Hosseini
    et al., 2014; do Nascimento et al., 2012) (rotation cycles, control of accuracy),
    the development of conservation protocols (Kladivko et al., 2014; Gaspary et al.,
    2002) and the alignment of business development strategies. 3. How the new digital
    technology transforms the agri-food supply chains To achieve robust, resilient
    and sustainable agri-food supply chains is very complex because they face more
    sources of uncertainty and risks in comparison with other supply chains that give
    rise to serious questions and concerns about their economic, environmental and
    social performance. Several studies identify agricultural sources of uncertainty
    (Mundi et al., 2019; Esteso et al., 2017; Esteso et al., 2018) and how to model
    them (Grillo et al., 2019). In Esteso et al. (2018) four types of crop-based uncertainty
    are identified: Product (shelf-life, deterioration rate, lack of homogeneity,
    food quality and food safety), Process (harvesting yield, supply lead time, resource
    needs, production), Market (demand, market prices) and Environment (weather, pests
    & diseases and regulations). Poor management of these sources of uncertainty can
    have a very negative impact on safety, quality, quantity and waste of products
    as well as human, technological and natural resources. Indeed, the agri-food sector
    is one of the economic and political areas worldwide, with key implications in
    sustainability to cover not only the food needs of the population, contribute
    to their employability and economic growth, but also in the impact on the natural
    environment (Iakovou et al., 2014). Therefore, the agri-food supply chains are
    strongly pressured to manage these sources of uncertainty and risks whose precise
    evolution over time is unknown but may jeopardize the future sustainability of
    these type of supply chains. It is necessary to move away from “business as usual”
    developing new solutions and implement innovative technologies (FAO, 2018). Along
    these lines, a digitalized supply chain, allows companies to monitor material
    flows in real time making potential risks visible and develop future plans to
    face them. The main drivers for the digitalization of the processes of SC are
    usually the increase of the flexibility and the speed of reaction of the industrial/logistical
    systems (ten Hompel and Henke, 2017a, ten Hompel and Henke, 2017b) as well as
    the improvement of agri-food supply chain robustness and resilience. In this context,
    data becomes crucial. Data is the lifeblood of any business and the agricultural
    business is not an exception but rather a referent. The new technologies have
    a great impact on the reduction of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise
    data in real time, whose treatment, together with the capacities of autonomous
    and intelligent decision making will help to increase the efficiency, sustainability,
    flexibility, agility, and the resilience along the whole supply chain from the
    farmers to the final customers. In the context of data-driven supply chains, the
    new technologies listed in the previous section, provide different and complementary
    support to the sequence of activities from data chain (Wolfert et al., 2017):
    data capture, storage, transfer, transformation, analytics and marketing. The
    support of each technology to different data chain activities lets envisage that
    the true potential of the data comes from the combination and integration of these
    technologies. Indeed, each one will improve some of the following basic functions
    of agri-food supply chains: sensing, monitoring, control, analysis (descriptive
    capabilities), prediction (predictive capabilities), decision-making (prescriptive
    capabilities) and adaptive learning. Through the sensing, monitoring, control
    and analysis it is possible to the early and accurate detection of problems and
    even predicting them before occurring, making better decisions and learn of them
    improving the sustainability and resilience of agri-food supply chains. In fact,
    the integration of previous technologies allows a more intelligent management
    of the agri-food supply chains, being able to combine multiple models of independent
    data analysis, repositories of historical data and data flows in real time. Real-time
    information and data processing tools provide new opportunities for companies
    to react more quickly to changing conditions in the supply chain. Due to this
    integrated intelligence, the agri-food supply chain management goes from supporting
    decisions to delegating them and, ultimately, to predicting which decisions should
    be taken. From all the above, there is no doubt that these new technologies are
    transforming the way agricultural sector organize and make decisions. In order
    to provide a general overview about how the new digital technology transforms
    the agri-food supply chains, the tables (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) integrate
    and classify the main positive impacts of the most relevant technologies as well
    as the challenges to be faced according to recent studies in the field carried
    by different authors. Table 1. IoT: Impact and Challenges. Internet of Things

    • Cultural adoption: blockchain represents a complete shift to a decentralized
    network which requires the buy-in of its users and operators. Technological Challenges:
    • Blockchain integration with other technologies (BDA, IoT, CPS) • Strategize
    the transition: blockchain applications offer solutions that require significant
    changes to, or complete replacement of, existing systems. • Limited storage capacity
    and scalability • Control, security, and privacy: while solutions exist, including
    private or permissioned blockchains and strong encryption, there are still cyber
    security concerns that need to be addressed before the general public will entrust
    their personal data to a blockchain solution. • Throughput and latency issue:
    in the context of agri-food Supply Chain management, due to the original restriction
    of block size and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current
    processing capacity of blockchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing
    millions of transactions in real-time • Infrastructure and capacity development
    challenges: it can only be applied as long as an internet connection is available,
    which can still be a challenge in some developing countries Table 3. Big Data
    Analytics: Impact and Challenges. Big Data Analytics References (Bronson and Knezevic,

    2020) Impact Functional impact: • Descriptive analytics allows understand what
    has happened and, therefore, diagnosis (identify patterns, clustering, identify
    agri-food risks, benchmarking) • Predictive analytics allows gain insights about
    what will be happening or likely to happen by exploring patterns in data (forecasting
    of demand, yield, price, weather, consumer behaviour) • Prescriptive analytics
    allows make better decisions and influencing what should be happening using mathematical
    optimization, simulation or multi-criteria decision-making techniques (real-time

    existing problems faster or cheaper or providing a better and richer understanding
    of those problems. Technological Impact: Capability of dealing with 5 Vs: • Volume
    (magnitude of data) • Variety (data from heterogeneous sources), • Velocity (speed
    of data generation and delivery, which can be processed in batch, real-time, nearly
    real-time, or streamlines) • Veracity (data quality and level of trust) • Value
    (detecting underexploited values from big data to support decision-making) Challenges
    Organizational Challenges: • Big Data decentralization • Big Data control when
    there are multiple actors involved • Big Data trust, privacy and security among
    actors • Big Data Monetization (transfer of rights on data) Social Challenges:
    • Demonstrate value of innovations as compared its costs, to encourage companies
    and individuals to collect and exchange data • Exploring the ethical implications
    of Big Data in food and agriculture • Availability of skilled human resources
    for big data analysis Technological Challenges: Improving the capability of dealing
    with 5V’s • Volume (data exponentially increased, posing a challenge to the capacity
    of storage devices) • Variety (sustainable integrate and combine data from different

    and distributed computation Integration with other technologies • Openness of
    platforms to accelerate solution development and innovation in general but also
    empower farmers in their position in supply chains. Table 4. Artificial Intelligence:
    Impact and Challenges. Artificial Intelligence References (Mercy et al., 2011;
    Liakos et al., 2018; Divya and Sreekumar, 2014; Mishra et al., 2014; Mishra et
    al., 2016; Elsayed et al., 2018; Reshma and Pillai, 2018) Impact Functional impact:
    AI techniques enable: • Classification: to predict the categories of input data
    for e.g. weather attributes are sunny, windy, rainy etc. • Regression: to predict
    numeric value e.g. price of stocks. • Clustering: to organize similar items in-to
    groups. • Association Analysis: to find interesting relationships between sets
    of variables. • Graph Analysis: to use graphic structure to find connections between
    entities. • Decision Tree: To predict modelling insights of objective variables
    by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. Above capabilities
    have been applied to: • Crop Management (yield prediction, disease detection,
    weed detection, insect pests, biotic stress in crop, crop quality, species recognition,
    predict soil moisture) • Water management (smart irrigation systems), • Weather
    forecasting • Soil management • Monitoring faster and with greater accuracy than
    other monitoring systems • Grading and sorting • Fraud detection system at very
    high speed, efficiency and with huge scale • Livestock (animal welfare, livestock
    production) • Environmental Protection • Production Planning Economic Impact:
    • Reduce employee training costs • Create efficiencies, improve problem solutions
    and reduce the time needed to solve problems. Social Impact: • Combine multiple
    human expert intelligences. • Reduce the amount of human errors. • Review transactions
    that human experts may overlook. • Reduce human intervention enabling human expert
    to concentrate on more creative activities Business Impact: • Automated decision-making
    • Expert system increases the probability, frequency and consistency of making
    good decisions, additive effect of knowledge of many domain experts, facilitates
    real-time, low-cost expert-level decisions by the non-expert, enhance the utilization
    of most of the available data • Learning ability Artificial Intelligence, goes
    a step further by not simply applying pre-programmed decisions, but instead exhibiting
    some learning capabilities • Data transformation: ML and AI can help create value
    by providing enterprises with intelligent analysis of big data and capturing structured
    interpretations of the wide variety of unstructured data increasingly available.
    Technological Impact: • Advancement of ML with machine vision will make agricultural
    technologies accurate, robust and low cost. • AI can be used to identify and clean
    dirty data or use dirty data as a means of establishing context knowledge for
    the data. • AI contributes to the velocity of data, by facilitating rapid computer-based
    decisions that lead to other decisions • AI contributes to variety mitigation
    by capturing, structuring, understanding unstructured data generating structure
    data • AI allows data analysis and decision making • From smart machines to clever
    computers and to Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs. • Expert systems developed
    in regional languages to be more accessible Challenges Social Challenges: • Replacement
    of human intervention perceived as a threat Technological Challenges: • AI to
    further facilitate additional developments on visualization • AI algorithms designed
    for single-machine environments might have emergent subproblem structures useful
    for parallelization. • Adding speech interface to the system may be proved to
    be more beneficial for the farmers of the remote area • Expert systems will not
    be able to give the creative responses that human experts can give in unusual
    circumstances. • Lack of flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments.
    • Not being able to recognize when no answer is available. • Knowledge acquisition
    remains the major bottleneck in applying expert system technology to new domains.
    • Maintenance and extension of a rule base can be difficult for a relatively large
    rule base • Enhance IoT with machine learning techniques to analyse data captured
    by sensors in real time in agriculture. As it can be seen in the above tables,
    some challenges of these digital technologies appear as strengths of others. This
    allows intuiting the suitability of using them as complements with the others.
    Indeed, in the near future, the full potential of data will rely on the combination
    of the different technologies that enhance data-driven agri-food supply chains
    more informed, efficient, secure, sustainable and resilient. For instance, IoT
    and BDA can benefit from blockchain providing data security, anonymity, trust
    and decentralization. Since blockchain exchange information in a distributed network,
    novel IoT applications will be developed for distributed environments. On the
    other side, the valuable data generated from the IoT could enrich transaction
    details that are registered on the blockchain (Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018).
    In turn, the accurate data provided by blockchain technology can be used as input
    for AI applications and to also record their outputs (Rabah et al., 2018). Besides,
    AI can enhance IoT by developing applications to analyse data captured by sensors
    in real time using machine learning algorithms (Reshma and Pillai, 2018). Machine
    learning and other analytic methods can also improve predictive and prescriptive
    capabilities (decision making) of Big Data Analytics. There is a broad consensus
    on the need to strengthen research and innovation in the Agri-food sector, both
    in terms of practices and technologies, through the creation of new products,
    the improvement of processes, services or processes or the integration of digital
    possibilities. Indeed, one of the persisting challenges to take advantage of the
    full potential of the data is to achieve not only the integration of these technologies
    but also their interoperability. Diversity of stakeholders integrating agri-food
    supply chains with different interests and characteristics make difficult to find
    solutions that fit all those involved, so group decision-making tools should be
    developed (Zaraté et al., 2019). Moreover, when these solutions require significant
    investments and there are stakeholders, such as small farmers with a limited budget.
    For this reason, it will be key to demonstrate the value of innovations as compared
    to their companies and to collect and exchange data. Other challenges reside on
    the needs of data standards. The standardization of the fruition data would provide
    equity for all stakeholders because of the possibility to access to the same information
    that might provide financial gain. The fruition data might provide the training
    for ensuring the availability of the required technical skills and definition
    of regulatory actions by governments. Research may be co-financed with partners
    private (e.g., companies or business groups), government (many departments and
    agencies involved) or institutional (e. g. universities). This approach accentuates
    the effect leverage government support and improve the transfer of innovations
    to businesses. It enables the training of highly qualified personnel and a new
    generation of scientists for companies and centres of research. The stability
    of funding agreements with the centres promote the retention of their qualified
    staff and facilitate partnerships with industry for the realization of structuring
    projects. Access to appropriate funding and research tax credits and development
    (R&D) is also a source of funding structuring for the industry to absorb financial
    risks generated by innovation activities (Tuhin et al., 2019). This type of financing
    is particularly important when innovation takes place directly in the company,
    which is often the case in food processing. 4. The new models of the Agri-Food
    supply chains The competitiveness of food processing companies depends on their
    investment capacity, the increase in their production, the development of new
    products and the implementation of processes to stand out from the competition
    (Guoqing et al., 2020). Over the past 30 years, we have seen a significant reduction
    in biodiversity, FAO estimates that we will have a 70 % reduction in biodiversity
    on our planet by 2050 (FAO, 2018). Human activities seem to be the main cause
    of this loss. The agriculture has many cards in hand to slow this process by implementing
    environmental protection practices and reducing the chemicals that have led to
    the destruction of many animals and insects living on land, in the air and in
    the water; creating green corridors and shelters for animals and insects; the
    cultivation of old species or species with high genetic variability, leaving the
    design of hybrid plants and monocultures that lead to significant genetic depletion;
    the reduction of arable land to make way for the replanting of forests, grasslands
    and hedges. The competitiveness is addressed to a new way of thinking the Agriculture
    that will let to optimize the process and respecting the nature. The labour shortage
    in many regions of Europe requires processing companies to automate and robotize
    their processes. In addition, investment in these new technologies allows them
    to improve their productivity and provide better working conditions necessary
    to the attraction and retention of the workforce. In addition, to meet the quality
    standards requirements of large chains and food retailers, they must use recognised
    quality management and traceability systems. Investment in digital technologies
    also promotes automation of operations, data management and access to a new range
    of management tools (Industry 4.0). The industry is particularly requested, as
    shown in the previous section, for the use of digital technologies, which allows
    it to optimize production and the supply chain while ensuring traceability of
    food from more and more pointed (Panetto et al., 2019). It is not new that, nowadays,
    agricultures supply chain practices, especially regarding to food products, are
    currently under public scrutiny. As established by Van Der Vorst (2006), this
    is because several factors, which considers food contamination issues, the new
    consumer healthy requirements, requirements for more precise information about
    the farming, marketing, and distribution practices used to bring the agricultural
    products into the shelves into supermarket, to name a few. In this same context,
    and regarding to Suprem et al. (2013), agricultural industry has been solely dependent
    on human labour with limited application of mechanical equipment and machines.
    Moreover, the applications of advanced technology such as embedded computing,
    robotics, wireless technology, GPS/GIS (Geographical Positioning System/Geographical
    Information System) and DBMS (Database Management System) software are seen to
    be recent developments, where regulations are vaguely considered. Moreover, the
    increasing gap between farmer''s expectations and the ability of the government
    led extension services has created a big business opportunity for private parties
    (Kumar and Ali, 2007). In this context, the information about the geometric properties
    of crops provided by digital based techniques, such as: ultrasound, digital photographic
    techniques, light sensors, high-resolution radar images, high-resolution X-ray
    computed tomography, stereo vision and LIDAR sensors; has innumerable applications
    in agriculture. Some important agricultural tasks that can benefit from these
    plant-geometry characterization techniques are the application of pesticides,
    irrigation, fertilization and crop training, improving the environmental and economic
    impact. But there is still a need to resolve several technological and commercial
    questions (Rosell et al., 2012). In line to this, agriculture technologies are
    focused on how traceability can be performed, in fact, the food industry had developed
    efficient traceability methods for the management of logistics and warehouses,
    based on the balance of costs and benefits of the traceability system level (Dabbene
    et al., 2013). Because of this, several authors are currently reviewing main agriculture
    supply chain technology based methods, and example of this is provided by Ahumada
    and Villalobos (2008), who identified that the use of integrated planning models
    in the agriculture supply chains is still very limited, with a high potential
    to manage perishable agri-food products, especially to deal with complex environments.
    In addition, (Ali and Kumar, 2011a) study the implication of using ICT in agriculture.
    From the authors’ findings it is highly appreciated that there is still a medium
    level of dissemination of information and knowledge sharing in agricultural developments
    (Boshkoska et al., 2019), as well as there is still a need for empirical evidences
    as to how ICT interventions are enabling the farmers to take informed decisions.
    Complementary to this, S. Araba and M. Fellows (Araba and Fellows, 2009) address
    that the majority of current research have not established a clear link between
    public access to ICTs and socioeconomic change/impacts in agriculture. In fact,
    there is a need for researchers to go beyond anecdotal evidence of downstream
    public access impacts on end‐users. Nevertheless, it is also evidenced that there
    is still limited ability on information to make definitive statements about agriculture
    expected impacts, as well as to identify and attribute specific impacts to specific
    ICT usage. Table 5 presents a summary on well-known methods and approached to
    support this, in special the agriculture supply chain decision-making methods.

    Hence, and as depicted from Table 1, as studied and established by Reardon et
    al. (2019), the food system can be thought of as “dendritic,” linking R&D, finance,
    input, and output supply chains. This means (1) the first and “core” supply chain,
    is the output Supply Chain. The second and upstream “feeder” supply chains are
    the farm input supply chains. The third and downstream ‘feeder’ supply chains
    are those supplying inputs to the post-farmgate segments. The fourth “pan-system
    feeder” supply chain is that supplying finance into every segment of every chain
    in the dendritic system. The fifth ‘feeder’ supply chain is a broad set of public
    assets apart from agricultural research institutions. The sixth set of “feeders”
    is the R&D supply chains, which supply technology and product innovations. Moreover,
    the ICT challenges in Agriculture supply chains are still open. Birkel in Birkel
    and Hartmann (2019), studied most of the recent ICT developments in this field,
    and found that most of the technological challenges in agriculture mainly includes
    security issues, lack of standards and interoperability, as well as hardware and
    software limitations are the focus of current research. Hence, the main challenges
    and risks are also in relation to the methodology, where (Ben-Daya et al., 2017)
    has revealed that the design aspect is primarily identified as a technological
    issue, while neglecting social and political challenges. Food processing companies''
    projects must benefit from financial levers that the government makes available
    to all in the manufacturing sector (Hernández et al., 2020). In order to further
    stimulate the investments, particularly in the SMEs and in innovative sectors,
    from financial tools considering the needs of the processing sector are decisive
    for the development of the implementation of development projects (Hernandez et
    al., 2020). In a business environment characterized by technological innovation,
    the consolidation of industries, deregulation and demand for consumers in constant
    evolution, the approaches of the traditional managers can no longer allow for
    companies to remain profitable. They are therefore forced to find new ways to
    stay competitive in agri-food domain, as it is also the case for all other industrial
    sectors (Boehlje, 1999; Senge, 1997; Senge et al., 2006). In the value chain management
    (VCM) domain, the informed decision making to unite resources to improve the competitiveness,
    is proving to be a powerful strategic approach that allows organizations to adapt
    to an environment of business in full motion. (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011;
    Dunne, 2008; Fearne, 2007; Fernandez et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). The concept
    of a continuous observation results in continuous and significant improvement
    of the design and the system performance, this is only possible when the companies
    are able to establish a degree of coordination and integration with their suppliers
    and customers that do not allow them the usual relationships with the latter based
    on the transactional approach buyer-seller (Sparling, 2007). Closer strategic
    relationships with customers and suppliers allow companies to better learn and
    adapt (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Multiple firms that co-invent and work together
    for the same objectives using integrated processes can increase their performance
    in a much more significant way that if they had gone it alone (Bonney et al.,
    2007; Fearne, 2007). Co-innovation allows companies to improve their own practices
    as well as those of all of them, it is a process that gives companies competitive
    forces that are difficult to match by others (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011).
    Several of the cases mentioned below demonstrate the benefits sustainable and
    competitive products obtained by companies who have chosen to co-innovate with
    other members of their supply chain. 5. Conclusions, vision and perspectives For
    this scientific contribution to knowledge, more than two hundred papers support
    the analysis on scientific work on the smart agriculture technology trends, but,
    more importantly, on how they emerge as a main concept in the agriculture domain
    as Agri-Food 4.0. From this reviews and analysis, it is clearly revealed that
    integration across new technologies allows smart agriculture to address important
    farming objectives as water saving, soil conservation, limit carbon emission and
    productivity increasing by doing more with less. In fact, the new technologies
    have a positive impact and at the same time pose new challenges in the management
    of different domains of human knowledge. Hence, two main conceptual pillars impact
    and challenges, arising from the use of various technologies in the world of the
    new conception of agriculture are the fundamental aspects in Agri-Food 4.0. A
    precision is due. This paper focus principally on the factory farm model issued
    from the “western” style. In those farms, the Agri-Food 4.0 started to be applied
    and validated. The focus is more specialised on the industrial farming although
    the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted also to the organic and silvo-pasture
    paradigms. The paper pays attention particularly to four major technologies, the
    Internet of Things, the Blockchain, the Big data and the Artificial Intelligence.
    For each of those technologies is presented some type of impacts: functional,
    economic, environmental, social, related to the business and technological and
    the challenges that come with their introduction. The literature is segmented
    in relation to the functionality of the specific technology and a panoramic view
    gives the possibility to better understand the paths needed to face the new challenges.
    The future of the Agriculture domain is in the creation of a resilient and sustainable
    farming system. On the four types of crop-based uncertainty that have been identified:
    Product, Process, Market and Environment the core problem is the management. Poor
    management of these sources of uncertainty have a negative impact on safety, quality,
    quantity and waste of products as well as human, technological and natural resources.
    Today, and always more in the future, the data is the lifeblood of any business
    and the agricultural business is not an exception but rather a referent. As aforementioned
    in the discussion section, the new technologies have a great impact on the reduction
    of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise data in real time, and real-time
    information tools provide new opportunities for companies to react more quickly
    to changing conditions in the supply chain. Our interest in the next future is
    to use formal methods to extract knowledge from the interrelation of the difference
    technologies impacts and from the existing solutions to the highlighted challenges
    to increase the efficiency, sustainability, flexibility, agility, and the resilience
    along the whole supply chain from the farmers to the final customers, and the
    analysis and outcomes from this paper, will contribute to support that from the
    main research knowledge findings. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors,

    the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world
    is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of
    sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment
    of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous
    amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to
    understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in
    relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing
    has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey
    context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background
    by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning.
    Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset
    of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions
    proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade
    (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight
    the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future
    research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities,
    systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and
    IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work
    but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards
    the IoT. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials ( Volume: 16, Issue:

    Information: DOI: 10.1109/SURV.2013.042313.00197 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction
    Context awareness, as a core feature of ubiquitous and pervasive computing systems,
    has existed and been employed since the early 1990s. The focus on context-aware
    computing evolved from desktop applications, web applications, mobile computing,
    pervasive/ubiquitous computing to the Internet of Things (IoT) over the last decade.
    However, context-aware computing became more popular with the introduction of
    the term ‘ubiquitous computing’ by Mark Weiser [1] in his ground-breaking paper
    The Computer for the 21st Century in 1991. Then the term ‘context-aware’ was first
    used by Schilit and Theimer [2] in 1994. Since then, research into context-awareness
    has been established as a well known research area in computer science. Many researchers
    have proposed definitions and explanations of different aspects of context-aware
    computing, as we will discuss briefly in Section III. The definitions for ‘context’
    and ‘context-awareness’ that are widely accepted by the research community today
    were proposed by Abowd et al. [3] in 1999. During the last two decades, researchers
    and engineers have developed a significant amount of prototypes, systems, and
    solutions using context-aware computing techniques. Even though the focus varied
    depending on each project, one aspect remained fairly unchanged: that is the number
    of data sources (e.g. software and hardware sources). For example, most of the
    proposed solutions collect data from a limited number of physical (hardware) and
    virtual (software) sensors. In these situations, collecting and analysing sensor
    data from all the sources is possible and feasible due to limited numbers. In
    contrast, IoT envisions an era where billions of sensors are connected to the
    Internet, which means it is not feasible to process all the data collected by
    those sensors. Therefore, context-awareness will play a critical role in deciding
    what data needs to be processed and much more. Due to advances in sensor technology,
    sensors are getting more powerful, cheaper and smaller in size, which has stimulated
    large scale deployments. As a result, today we have a large number of sensors
    already deployed and it is predicted that the numbers will grow rapidly over the
    next decade [4]. Ultimately, these sensors will generate big data [5]. The data
    we collect may not have any value unless we analyse, interpret, and understand
    it. Context-aware computing has played an important role in tackling this challenge
    in previous paradigms, such as mobile and pervasive, which lead us to believe
    that it would continue to be successful in the IoT paradigm as well. Context-aware
    computing allows us to store context1 information linked to sensor data so the
    interpretation can be done easily and more meaningfully. In addition, understanding
    context makes it easier to perform machine to machine communication as it is a
    core element in the IoT vision. When large numbers of sensors are deployed, and
    start generating data, the traditional application based approach (i.e. connect
    sensors directly to applications individually and manually) becomes infeasible.
    In order to address this inefficiency, significant amounts of middleware solutions
    are introduced by researchers. Each middleware solution focuses on different aspects
    in the IoT, such as device management, interoperability, platform portability,
    context-awareness, security and privacy, and many more. Even though, some solutions
    address multiple aspects, an ideal middleware solution that addresses all the
    aspects required by the IoT is yet to be designed. In this survey, we consider
    identifying the context-aware computing related features and functionalities that
    are required by an ideal IoT middleware solution as a key task. There have been
    several surveys conducted in relation to this field. We briefly introduce these
    surveys in chronological order. Chen and Kotz [6] (2000) have surveyed context
    awareness, focusing on applications, what context they use, and how contextual
    information is leveraged. In 2004, Strang and Linnhoff-Popien [7] compared the
    most popular context modelling techniques in the field. Middleware solutions for
    sensor networks are surveyed by Molla and Ahamed [8] in 2006. Two separate surveys
    were conducted by Kjaer [9] and Baldauf et al. [10] in 2007 on context-aware systems
    and middleware solutions using different taxonomies. Both surveys compared limited
    numbers, but different projects with very little overlap. c et al. [11] (2009)
    reviewed popular context representation and reasoning from a pervasive computing
    perspective. In 2010, Bettini et al. [12] also comprehensively surveyed context
    modelling and reasoning by focusing on techniques rather than projects. In the
    same year another survey was done by Saeed and Waheed [13] focusing on architectures
    in the context-aware middleware domain. Bandyopadhyay et al. [14] have conducted
    a survey on existing popular Internet of Things middleware solutions in 2011.
    In 2012, Makris et al. [15] have conducted a survey on context-aware mobile and
    wireless networking (CAMoWiN) domain where they have identified all the possible
    components of a typical CAMoWiN architecture. The latest survey is done by Bellavista
    et al. [16] (2013) which is focused on context distribution for mobile ubiquitous
    systems. Our survey differs from the previous literature surveys mentioned above
    in many ways. Most of the surveys evaluated a limited number of projects. In contrast,
    we selected a large number of projects (50) covering a decade, based on the unique
    criteria that will be explained at the end of this section. These projects are
    different in scale. Some are large scale projects and others corresponds to small
    scale contributions. We took a much broader viewpoint compared to some of the
    previous surveys, as they have focused on specific elements such as modelling,
    reasoning, etc. Finally and most importantly, our taxonomy formation and organisation
    is completely different. Rather than building a theoretical taxonomy and then
    trying to classify existing research projects, prototypes and systems according
    to it, we use a practical approach. We built our taxonomy based on past research
    projects by identifying the features, models, techniques, functionalities and
    approaches they employed at higher levels (e.g. we do not consider implementation/code
    level differences between different solutions). We consolidated this information
    and analysed the capabilities of each solution or the project. We believe this
    approach allows us to highlight the areas where researchers have mostly (priorities)
    and rarely (non-priorities) focused their attention and the reasons behind. Further,
    we have also used a non-taxonomical project based evaluation, where we highlight
    how the different combinations of components are designed, developed and used
    in each project. This allows to discuss their applicability from an IoT perspective.
    Our objectives in revisiting the literature are threefold: 1) to learn how context-aware
    computing techniques have helped to develop solutions in the past, 2) how can
    we apply those techniques to solve problems in the future in different paradigms
    such as the IoT, and 3) to highlight open challenges and to discuss future research
    directions. This paper is organised into sections as follows: Section II provides
    an introduction to the IoT. In this section, we briefly describe the history and
    evolution of the Internet. Then we explain what the IoT is, followed by a list
    of application domains and statistics that show the significance of the IoT. We
    also describe the relationship between sensor networks and the IoT. Comparisons
    of popular IoT middleware solutions are presented at the end of the section in
    order to highlight existing research gaps. In Section III, we present context
    awareness fundamentals such as context-aware related definitions, context types
    and categorisation schemes, features and characteristics, and context awareness
    management design principles. In Section IV, we conduct our main discussion based
    on context life cycle where we identify four stages: acquisition, modelling, reasoning,
    and distribution. Section V briefly discusses the highlights of each project,
    which we use for the comparison later. Finally, Section VI discusses the lessons
    learn from the literature and Section VII identifies future research directions
    and challenges. Conclusion remarks are presented in Section VIII. For this literature
    review, we analyse, compare, classify a subset of both small scale and large scale
    projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions
    proposed in the field of context-aware computing based on our own taxonomy. We
    selected the existing solutions to be reviewed based on different criteria. Mainly,
    we selected projects that were conducted over the last decade (2001–2011). We
    also considered main focus, techniques used, popularity, comprehensiveness, information
    availability, and the year of publication, in order to make sure that our review
    provides a balanced view on context-aware computing research. SECTION II. The
    Internet of Things Paradigm In this section, we briefly introduce the IoT paradigm.
    Our intention is not to survey the IoT, but to present some fundamental information
    (e.g. how Internet evolved, what is the IoT, statistics related to IoT, underline
    technologies, characteristics, and research gaps in IoT paradigm) that will help
    with understanding the historic movements and the direction into which technology
    is moving today. The IoT paradigm has its own concepts and characteristics. It
    also shares significant amounts of concepts with other computer fields. The IoT
    bundles different technologies (e.g. sensor hardware/firmware, semantic, cloud,
    data modelling, storing, reasoning, processing, communication technologies) together
    to build its vision. We apply the existing technologies in different ways based
    on the characteristics and demands of the IoT. The IoT does not revolutionise
    our lives or the field of computing. It is another step in the evolution of the
    Internet we already have. Fig. 1. Evolution of the Internet in five phases. The
    evolution of Internet begins with connecting two computers together and then moved
    towards creating World Wide Web by connecting large number of computers together.
    The mobile-Internet emerged by connecting mobile devices to the Internet. Then,
    peoples'' identities joined the Internet via social networks. Finally, it is moving
    towards Internet of things by connecting every day objects to the Internet. Show
    All A. Evolution of Internet Before we investigate the IoT in depth, it is worthwhile
    to look at the evolution of the Internet. In the late 1960s, communication between
    two computers was made possible through a computer network [17]. In the early
    1980s the TCP/IP stack was introduced. Then, commercial use of the Internet started
    in the late 1980s. Later, the World Wide Web (WWW) became available in 1991 which
    made the Internet more popular and stimulate the rapid growth. Web of Things (WoT)
    [18], which based on WWW, is a part of IoT. Later, mobile devices connected to
    the Internet and formed the mobile-Internet [19]. With the emergence of social
    networking, users started to become connected together over the Internet. The
    next step in the IoT is where objects around us will be able to connect to each
    other (e.g. machine to machine) and communicate via the Internet [20]. Figure
    1 illustrates the five phases in the evolution of the Internet. B. What is the
    Internet of Things? During the past decade, the IoT has gained significant attention
    in academia as well as industry. The main reasons behind this interest are the
    capabilities that the IoT [22], [23] will offer. It promises to create a world
    where all the objects (also called smart objects [24]) around us are connected
    to the Internet and communicate with each other with minimum human intervention
    [25]. The ultimate goal is to create ‘a better world for human beings’, where
    objects around us know what we like, what we want, and what we need and act accordingly
    without explicit instructions [26]. The term ‘Internet of Things’ was firstly
    coined by Kevin Ashton [27] in a presentation in 1998. He has mentioned “The Internet
    of Things has the potential to change the world, just as the Internet did. Maybe
    even more so”. Then, the MIT Auto-ID centre presented their IoT vision in 2001
    [28]. Later, IoT was formally introduced by the International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU) by the ITU Internet report in 2005 [29]. The IoT encompasses a significant
    amount of technologies that drive its vision. In the document, Vision and challenges
    for realising the Internet of Things, by CERP-IoT [4], a comprehensive set of
    technologies was listed. IoT is a very broad vision. The research into the IoT
    is still in its infancy. Therefore, there aren''t any standard definitions for
    IoT. The following definitions were provided by different researchers. Definition
    by [30]: “Things have identities and virtual personalities operating in smart
    spaces using intelligent interfaces to connect and communicate within social,
    environment, and user contexts.” Definition by [20]: “The semantic origin of the
    expression is composed by two words and concepts: Internet and Thing, where Internet
    can be defined as the world-wide network of interconnected computer networks,
    based on a standard communication protocol, the Internet suite (TCP/IP), while
    Thing is an object not precisely identifiable Therefore, semantically, Internet
    of Things means a world-wide network of interconnected objects uniquely addressable,
    based on standard communication protocols.” Definition by [21]: “The Internet
    of Things allows people and things2 to be connected Anytime, Anyplace, with Anything
    and Anyone, ideally using Any path/network and Any service.” We accept the last
    definition provided by [21] for our research work, because we believe, this definition
    encapsulates the broader vision of IoT. Figure 2 illustrates the definition more
    clearly. The broadness of IoT can be identified by evaluating the application
    domains presented in Section II-C. Fig. 2. Definition of the Internet of Things:
    The Internet of Things allows people and things to be connected anytime, anyplace,
    with anything and anyone, ideally using any path/network and any service [21].
    Show All C. IoT Application Domains The IoT, interconnection and communication
    between everyday objects, enables many applications in many domains. The application
    domain can be mainly divided in to three categories based on their focus [23],
    [4]: industry, environment, and society. The magnitude of the applications can
    be seen in the statistics presented in Section II-D. Supply chain management [31],
    transportation and logistics [32], aerospace, aviation, and automotive are some
    of the industry focused applications of IoT. Telecommunication, medical technology
    [33], healthcare, smart building, home [34] and office, media, entertainment,
    and ticketing are some of the society focused applications of IoT. Agriculture
    and breeding [35], [36], recycling, disaster alerting, environmental monitoring
    are some of the environment focused applications. Asin and Gascon [37] listed
    54 application domains under twelve categories: smart cities, smart environment,
    smart water, smart metering, security and emergencies, retail, logistics, industrial
    control, smart agriculture, smart animal farming, domestic and home automation,
    and eHealth. D. IoT Related Statistics The vision of the IoT is heavily energised
    by statistics and predictions. We present the statistics to justify our focus
    on the IoT and to show the magnitude of the challenges. It is estimated that there
    about 1.5 billion Internet-enabled PCs and over 1 billion Internet-enabled mobile
    phones today. These two categories will be joined with Internet-enabled devices
    (smart objects [24])) in the future. By 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
    devices connected to the Internet [4]. According to BCC Research [38], the global
    market for sensors was around 56.3billionin2010.In2011,itwasaround 62.8 billion.
    Global market for sensors is expected to increase to $91.5 billion by 2016, at
    a compound annual growth rate of 7.8%. E. The Essential Component of IoT: Sensor
    Networks We provide a brief introduction to sensor networks in this section as
    it is the most essential component of the IoT. A sensor network comprises one
    or more sensor nodes, which communicate between themselves using wired and wireless
    technologies. In sensor networks, sensors can be homogeneous or heterogeneous.
    Multiple sensor networks can be connected together through different technologies
    and protocols. One such approach is through the Internet. The components and the
    layered structure of a typical sensor network are discussed in Section II-F. We
    discuss how sensor networks and the IoT work together in Section II-G. However,
    there are other technologies that can complement the sensing and communication
    infrastructure in IoT paradigm such as traditional ad-hoc networks. These are
    clearly a different technology from sensor networks and have many weaknesses.
    The differences are comprehensively discussed in [39]. There are three main architectures
    in sensor networks: flat architecture (data transfers from static sensor nodes
    to the sink node using a multi-hop fashion), two-layer architecture (more static
    and mobile sink nodes are deployed to collect data from sensor nodes), and three-layer
    architecture (multiple sensor networks are connected together over the Internet).
    Therefore, IoT follows a three-layer architecture. Most of the sensors deployed
    today are wireless. There are several major wireless technologies used to build
    wireless sensor networks: wireless personal area network (WPAN) (e.g. Bluetooth),
    wireless local area network (WLAN) (e.g. Wi-Fi), wireless metropolitan area network
    (WMAN) (e.g. WiMAX), wireless wide area network (WWAN) (e.g. 2G and 3G networks),
    and satellite network (e.g. GPS). Sensor networks also use two types of protocols
    for communication: non-IP based (e.g: Zigbee and Sensor-Net) and IP-based protocols
    (NanoStack, PhyNet, and IPv6). The sensor network is not a concept that emerged
    with the IoT. The concept of a sensor network and related research existed a long
    time before the IoT was introduced. However, sensor networks were used in limited
    domains to achieve specific purposes, such as environment monitoring [40], agriculture
    [35], medical care [41], event detection [42], structural health monitoring [43],
    etc. Further, there are three categories of sensor networks that comprise the
    IoT [44]: body sensor networks (BSN), object sensor networks (OSN), and environment
    sensor networks (ESN). Molla and Ahamed [8] identified ten challenges that need
    to be considered when developing sensor network middleware solutions: abstraction
    support, data fusion, resource constraints, dynamic topology, application knowledge,
    programming paradigm, adaptability, scalability, security, and QoS support. A
    comparison of different sensor network middleware solutions is also provided based
    on the above parameters. Several selected projects are also discussed in brief
    in order to discover the approaches they take to address various challenges associated
    with sensor networks. Some of the major sensor network middleware approaches are
    IrisNet, JWebDust, Hourglass, HiFi, Cougar, Impala, SINA, Mate, TinyDB, Smart
    Object, Agilla, TinyCubus, TinyLime, EnviroTrack, Mires, Hood, and Smart Messages.
    Some of the above approaches are surveyed in [8], [45]. A survey on web based
    wireless sensor architectures and applications is presented in [46]. Fig. 3. Layered
    structure of a sensor network: These layers are identified based on the capabilities
    posed by the devices. In IoT, this layered architecture may have additional number
    of sub layers as it is expected to comprises large verity of in sensing capabilities.
    Show All F. Layers in Sensor Networks We have presented a typical structure of
    a sensor network in Figure 3. It comprises the most common components in a sensor
    network. As we have shown, with the orange coloured arrows, data flows from right
    to left. Data is generated by the low-end sensor nodes and high-end sensor nodes.
    Then, data is collected by mobile and static sink nodes. The sink nodes send the
    data to low-end computational devices. These devices perform a certain amount
    of processing on the sensor data. Then, the data is sent to high-end computational
    devices to be processed further. Finally, data reaches the cloud where it will
    be shared, stored, and processed significantly. Based on the capabilities of the
    devices involved in a sensor network, we have identified six layers. Information
    can be processed in any layer. Capability means the processing, memory, communication,
    and energy capacity. Capabilities increase from layer one to layer six. Based
    on our identification of layers, it is evident that an ideal system should understand
    the capability differences, and perform data management accordingly. It is all
    about efficiency and effectiveness. For example, perform processing in the first
    few layers could reduce data communication. However, devices in the first few
    layers do not have a sufficient amount of energy and processing power to do comprehensive
    data processing [47]. IoT research needs to find more efficient and effective
    ways of data management, such as collecting, modelling, reasoning, distributing.
    G. Relationship Between Sensor Networks and IoT In earlier sections we introduced
    both IoT and sensor network concepts. In this section we explain the relationship
    between the two concepts. Previously, we argued that sensor networks are the most
    essential components of the IoT. Figure 4 illustrates the big picture. The IoT
    comprises sensors and actuators. The data is collected using sensors. Then, it
    is processed and decisions are made. Finally, actuators perform the decided actions.
    This process is further discussed in Section IV. Further, integration between
    wireless sensor networks and the IoT are comprehensively discussed in [48]. The
    difference between sensor networks (SN) and the IoT is largely unexplored and
    blurred. We can elaborate some of the characteristics of both SN and IoT to identify
    the differences. SN comprises of the sensor hardware (sensors and actuators),
    firmware and a thin layer of software. The IoT comprises everything that SN comprises
    and further it comprises a thick layer of software such as middleware systems,
    frameworks, APIs and many more software components. The software layer is installed
    across computational devices (both low and high-end) and the cloud. From their
    origin, SNs were designed, developed, and used for specific application purposes,
    for example, detecting bush fire [44]. In the early days, sensor networks were
    largely used for monitoring purposes and not for actuation [49]. In contrast,
    IoT is not focused on specific applications. The IoT can be explained as a general
    purpose sensor network [50]. Therefore, the IoT should support many kinds of applications.
    During the stage of deploying sensors, the IoT would not be targeted to collect
    specific types of sensor data, rather it would deploy sensors where they can be
    used for various application domains. For example, company may deploy sensors,
    such as pressure sensors, on a newly built bridge to track its structural health.
    However, these sensors may be reused and connect with many other sensors in order
    to track traffic at a later stage. Therefore, middleware solutions, frameworks,
    and APIs are designed to provide generic services and functionalities such as
    intelligence, semantic interoperability, context-awareness, etc. that are required
    to perform communication between sensors and actuators effectively. Sensor networks
    can exist without the IoT. However, the IoT cannot exist without SN, because SN
    provides the majority of hardware (e.g. sensing and communicating) infrastructure
    support, through providing access to sensors and actuators. There are several
    other technologies that can provide access to sensor hardware, such as wireless
    ad-hoc networks. However, they are not scalable and cannot accommodate the needs
    of the IoT individually [39], though they can complement the IoT infrastructure.
    As is clearly depicted in Figure 4, SN are a part of the IoT. However, the IoT
    is not a part of SN. H. Characteristics of the IoT In Section II-G, we highlighted
    the differences between sensor networks and the IoT. Further, we briefly explore
    the characteristics of the IoT from a research perspective. Based on previous
    research efforts we identified seven major characteristics in the IoT [4]: intelligence,
    architecture, complex system, size considerations, time considerations, space
    considerations, and everything-as-a-service. These characteristics need to be
    considered when developing IoT solutions throughout all the phases from design,
    development, implement and evaluation. Fig. 4. Relationship between sensor networks
    and IoT. Show All Intelligence: This means the application of knowledge. First
    the knowledge needs to be generated by collecting data and reasoning it. Transforming
    the collected raw data into knowledge (high-level information) can be done by
    collecting, modelling, and reasoning the context. Context can be used to fuse
    sensor data together to infer new knowledge. Once we have knowledge, it can be
    applied towards more intelligent interaction and communication. Architecture:
    IoT should be facilitated by a hybrid architecture which comprises many different
    architectures. Primarily there would be two architectures: event driven [51] and
    time driven. Some sensors produce data when an event occurs (e.g. door sensor);
    the rest produce data continuously, based on specified time frames (e.g. temperature
    sensor). Mostly, the IoT and SN are event driven [52]. Event-Condition-Action
    (ECA) rules are commonly used in such systems. Complex system: The IoT comprises
    a large number of objects (sensors and actuators) that interact autonomously.
    New objects will start communicating and existing ones will disappear. Currently,
    there are millions of sensors deployed around the world [53]. Interactions may
    differ significantly depending on the objects capabilities. Some objects may have
    very few capabilities, and as such store very limited information and do no processing
    at all. In contrast, some objects may have larger memory, processing, and reasoning
    capabilities, which make them more intelligent. Size considerations: It is predicted
    that there will be 50–100 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020 [4].
    The IoT needs to facilitate the interaction among these objects. The numbers will
    grow continuously and will never decrease. Similar to the number of objects, number
    of interactions may also increase significantly. Time considerations: The IoT
    could handle billions of parallel and simultaneous events, due to the massive
    number of interactions. Real-time data processing is essential. Space considerations:
    The precise geographic location of a object will be critical [54] as location
    plays a significant role in context-aware computing. When the number of objects
    get larger, tracking becomes a key requirement. Interactions are highly dependent
    on their locations, their surroundings, and presence of other entities (e.g. objects
    and people). Everything-as-a-service: Due to the popularity of cloud computing
    [55], consuming resources as a service [56] such as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),
    Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), has become main
    stream. Everything-as-a-service [57] model is highly efficient, scalable, and
    easy to use. IoT demands significant amounts of infrastructure to be put in place
    in order to make its vision a reality, where it would follow a community or crowd
    based approach. Therefore, sharing would be essential, where an everything-as-a-service
    model would suit mostly sensing-as-a-service [5]. I. Middleware Support for IoT
    As we mentioned at the beginning, the IoT needs to be supported by middleware
    solutions. “Middleware is a software layer that stands between the networked operating
    system and the application and provides well known reusable solutions to frequently
    encountered problems like heterogeneity, interoperability, security, dependability
    [58].” The functionalities required by IoT middleware solutions are explained
    in detail in [4], [19], [20], [21], [29]. In addition, challenges in developing
    middleware solutions for the IoT are discussed in [59]. We present the summary
    of a survey conducted by Bandyopadhyay et al. [14]. They have selected the leading
    middleware solutions and analyse them based on their functionalities, each one
    offers, device management, interoperation, platform portability, context-awareness,
    and security and privacy. Table I shows the survey results. By the time we were
    preparing this survey, some of the middleware solutions listed (i.e. GSN and ASPIRE)
    were in the processing of extending towards next generation solutions (i.e. EU
    FP7 project OpenIoT (2012–2014) [60]) by combining each other''s strengths. J.
    Research Gaps According to Table I, it can be seen that the majority of the IoT
    middleware solutions do not provide context-awareness functionality. In contrast,
    almost all the solutions are highly focused on device management, which involves
    connecting sensors to the IoT middleware. In the early days, context-awareness
    was strongly bound to pervasive and ubiquitous computing. Even though there were
    some middleware solutions that provided an amount of context-aware functionality,
    they did not satisfy the requirements that the IoT demands. We discuss the issues
    and drawbacks with existing solutions, in detail, in Section V. We discuss some
    of the research directions in Section VII. In this section, we introduced the
    IoT paradigm and highlighted the importance of context-awareness for the IoT.
    We also learnt that context-awareness has not been addressed in existing IoT focused
    solutions, which motivates us to survey the solutions in other paradigms to evaluate
    the applicability of context-aware computing techniques toward IoT. In the next
    section we discuss context-aware fundamentals that helps us understand the in-depth
    discussions in the later sections. TABLE I IoT Middleware Comparison [14] SECTION
    III. Context Awareness Fundamentals This section discusses definitions of context
    and context awareness, context-aware features, types of context and categorisation
    schemes, different levels and characteristics of context-awareness, and finally,
    context management design principles in the IoT paradigm. A. Context-awareness
    Related Definitions 1) Definition of Context The term context has been defined
    by many researchers. Dey et al. [72] evaluated and highlighted the weaknesses
    of these definitions. Dey claimed that the definition provided by Schilit and
    Theimer [2] was based on examples and cannot be used to identify new context.
    Further, Dey claimed that definitions provided by Brown [73], Franklin and Flachsbart
    [74], Rodden et al. [75], Hull et al. [76], and Ward et al. [77] used synonyms
    to refer to context, such as environment and situation. Therefore, these definitions
    also cannot be used to identify new context. Abowd and Mynatt [78] identified
    the five W''s (Who, What, Where, When, Why) as the minimum information that is
    necessary to understand context. Schilit et al. [79] and Pascoe [80] have also
    defined the term context. Dey claimed that these definitions were too specific
    and cannot be used to identify context in a broader sense and provided a definition
    for context as follows: “Context is any information that can be used to characterise
    the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered
    relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user
    and applications themselves [3].” We accept the definition of context provided
    by Abowd et al. [3] to be used in this research work, because this definition
    can be used to identify context from data in general. If we consider a data element,
    by using this definition, we can easily identify whether the data element is context
    or not. A number of dictionaries have also defined and explained the word context:
    Synonyms [81]: “Circumstance, situation, phase, position, posture, attitude, place,
    point; terms; regime; footing, standing, status, occasion, surroundings, environment,
    location, dependence.” Definition by FOLDOC [82]: “That which surrounds, and gives
    meaning to, something else.” Definition by WordNet [83]: “Discourse that surrounds
    a language unit and helps to determine its interpretation” Definition by Longman
    [84]: “The situation, events, or information that are related to something and
    that help you to understand it” In addition, Sanchez et al. [85] explained the
    distinction between raw data and context information as follows: Raw (sensor)
    Data: Is unprocessed and retrieved directly from the data source, such as sensors.
    Context Information: Is generated by processing raw sensor data. Further, it is
    checked for consistency and meta data is added. For example, the sensor readings
    produced by GPS sensors can be considered as raw sensor data. Once we put the
    GPS sensor readings in such a way that it represents a geographical location,
    we call it context information. Therefore in general, the raw data values produced
    by sensors can be considered as data. If this data can be used to generate context
    information, we identify these data as context. Therefore, mostly what we capture
    from sensors are data not the context information. Ahn and Kim [86] define context
    (also called compound events) as a set of interrelated events with logical and
    timing relations among them. They also define an event as an occurrence that triggers
    a condition in a target area. There are two categories of events: discrete events
    and continuous events. If the sampling rate is p : Discrete Events: An event that
    occurs at time t and t + p, there are considered to have been two separate event
    instances. (e.g. a door open, lights on, etc.) Continuous Events: An event instance
    lasting for at least time p , where an event occurring at time t and t+p , cannot
    be considered as two separate events. (e.g. raining, having a shower, driving
    a car, etc.) 2) Definition of Context-awareness The term context awareness, also
    called sentient, was first introduced by Schilit and Theimer [2] in 1994. Later,
    it was defined by Ryan et al. [87]. In both cases, the focus was on computer applications
    and systems. As stated by Abowd et al. [3], those definitions are too specific
    and cannot be used to identify whether a given system is a context-aware system
    or not. Therefore, Dey has defined the term context-awareness as follows: “A system
    is context-aware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services
    to the user, where relevancy depends on the user''s task. [3]” We accept the above
    definition on context-awareness to be used in our research work, because we can
    use this definition to identify context-aware systems from the rest. If we consider
    a system, by using this definition we can easily identify whether this system
    is a context-aware system or not. Context awareness frameworks typically should
    support acquisition, representation, delivery, and reaction [72]. In addition,
    there are three main approaches that we can follow to build context-aware applications
    [88]. No application-level context model: Applications perform all the actions,
    such as context acquisition, pre-processing, storing, and reasoning within the
    application boundaries. Implicit context model: Applications uses libraries, frameworks,
    and toolkits to perform context acquisition, pre-processing, storing, and reasoning
    tasks. It provides a standard design to follow that makes it easier to build the
    applications quickly. However, still the context is hard bound to the application.
    Explicit context model: Applications uses a context management infrastructure
    or middleware solution. Therefore, actions such as context acquisition, pre-processing,
    storing, and reasoning lie outside the application boundaries. Context management
    and application are clearly separated and can be developed and extend independently.
    3) Definition of Context Model and Context Attribute We adopt the following interpretations
    of context model and context attributes provided by Henricksen [89] based on Abowd
    et al. [3] in our research work. “A context model identifies a concrete subset
    of the context that is realistically attainable from sensors, applications and
    users and able to be exploited in the execution of the task. The context model
    that is employed by a given context-aware application is usually explicitly specified
    by the application developer, but may evolve over time [89].” “A context attribute
    is an element of the context model describing the context. A context attribute
    has an identifier, a type and a value, and optionally a collection of properties
    describing specific characteristics [89].” 4) Definition of Quality of Context
    There are number of definitions and parameters that have been proposed in the
    literature regarding quality of context (QoC). A survey on QoC is presented in
    [16]. QoC is defined using a set of parameters that expresses the quality of requirements
    and properties of the context data. After evaluating a number of different parameter
    proposals in the literature, [16] has defined QoC based on three parameters: context
    data validity, context data precision, and context data up-to-dateness. QoC are
    being used to resolve context data conflicts. Further, they claim that QoC is
    depend on quality of the physical sensor, quality of the context data, and quality
    of the delivery process. B. Context-aware Features After analysing and comparing
    the two previous efforts conducted by Schilit et al. [79] and Pascoe [80], Abowd
    et al. [3] identified three features that a context-aware application can support:
    presentation, execution, and tagging. Even though, the IoT vision was not known
    at the time these features are identified, they are highly applicable to the IoT
    paradigm as well. We elaborate these features from an IoT perspective. Presentation:
    Context can be used to decide what information and services need to be presented
    to the user. Let us consider a smart [22] environment scenario. When a user enters
    a supermarket and takes their smart phone out, what they want to see is their
    shopping list. Context-aware mobile applications need to connect to kitchen appliances
    such as a smart refrigerator [90] in the home to retrieve the shopping list and
    present it to the user. This provides the idea of presenting information based
    on context such as location, time, etc. By definition, IoT promises to provide
    any service anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone, ideally using any path/network.
    Execution: Automatic execution of services is also a critical feature in the IoT
    paradigm. Let us consider a smart home [22] environment. When a user starts driving
    home from their office, the IoT application employed in the house should switch
    on the air condition system and switch on the coffee machine to be ready to use
    by the time the user steps into their house. These actions need to be taken automatically
    based on the context. Machine-to-machine communication is a significant part of
    the IoT. Tagging: In the IoT paradigm, there will be a large number of sensors
    attached to everyday objects. These objects will produce large volumes of sensor
    data that has to be collected, analysed, fused and interpreted [91]. Sensor data
    produced by a single sensor will not provide the necessary information that can
    be used to fully understand the situation. Therefore, sensor data collected through
    multiple sensors needs to be fused together. In order to accomplish the sensor
    data fusion task, context needs to be collected. Context needs to be tagged together
    with the sensor data to be processed and understood later. Context annotation
    plays a significant role in context-aware computing research. We also call this
    tagging operation as annotation as well. C. Context Types and Categorisation Schemes
    Different researchers have identified context types differently based of different
    perspectives. Abowd et al. [3] introduced one of the leading mechanisms of defining
    context types. They identified location, identity, time, and activity as the primary
    context types. Further, they defined secondary context as the context that can
    be found using primary context. For example, given primary context such as a person''s
    identity, we can acquire many pieces of related information such as phone numbers,
    addresses, email addresses, etc. However, using this definition we are unable
    to identify the type of a given context. Let us consider two GPS sensors located
    in two different locations. We can retrieve GPS values to identify the position
    of each sensor. However, we can only find the distance between the two sensors
    by performing calculations based on the raw values generated by the two sensor.
    The question is, ‘what is the category that distance belongs to?’ ‘is it primary
    or secondary?’ The distance is not just a value that we sensed. We computed the
    distance by fusing two pieces of context. The above definition does not represent
    this accurately. Thus, we define a context categorisation scheme (i.e. primary
    and secondary) that can be used to classify a given data value (e.g. single data
    item such as current time) of context in terms of an operational perspective (i.e.
    how the data was acquired). However, the same data value can be considered as
    primary context in one scenario and secondary context in another. For example,
    if we collect the blood pressure level of a patient directly from a sensor attached
    to the patient, it could be identified as primary context. However, if we derive
    the same information from a patient''s health record by connecting to the hospital
    database, we call it secondary context. Therefore, the same information can be
    acquired using different techniques. It is important to understand that the quality,
    validity, accuracy, cost and effort of acquisition, etc. may varied significantly
    based on the techniques used. This would be more challenging in the IoT paradigm,
    because there would be a large amount of data sources that can be used to retrieve
    the same data value. To decide which source and technique to use would be a difficult
    task. We will revisit this challenge in Section VI. In addition, a similar type
    of context information can be classified as both primary and secondary. For example,
    location can be raw GPS data values or the name of the location (e.g. city, road,
    restaurant). Therefore, identifying a location as primary context without examining
    how the data has been collected is fairly inaccurate. Figure 5 depicts how the
    context can be identified using our context type definitions. Primary context:
    Any information retrieved without using existing context and without performing
    any kind of sensor data fusion operations (e.g. GPS sensor readings as location
    information). Secondary context: Any information that can be computed using primary
    context. The secondary context can be computed by using sensor data fusion operations
    or data retrieval operations such as web service calls (e.g. identify the distance
    between two sensors by applying sensor data fusion operations on two raw GPS sensor
    values). Further, retrieved context such as phone numbers, addresses, email addresses,
    birthdays, list of friends from a contact information provider based on a personal
    identity as the primary context can also be identified as secondary context. Fig.
    5. Context categorisation in two different perspectives: conceptual and operational.
    It shows why both operational and conceptual categorisation schemes are important
    in IoT paradigm as the capture different perspectives. Show All We acknowledge
    location, identity, time, and activity as important context information. The IoT
    paradigm needs to consider more comprehensive categorisation schemes in a hierarchical
    manner, such as major categories, sub categories and so on. Operational categorisation
    schemes allow us to understand the issues and challenges in data acquisition techniques,
    as well as quality and cost factors related to context. In contrast, conceptual
    categorisation allows an understanding of the conceptual relationships between
    context. We have to integrate perspective in order to model context precisely.
    We compare different context categorisation schemes in Table IV. In addition to
    the two categorisation schemes we discussed earlier there are several other schemes
    introduced by different researchers focusing on different perspectives. Further,
    we highlight relationships between different context categories (also called context
    types) in different perspectives in Table II and in Table III. These context categories
    are not completely different from each other. Each category shares common characteristics
    with the others. The similarities and difference among categories are clearly
    presented in Table III. Further, we have listed and briefly explained three major
    context categorisation schemes and their categories proposed by previous researchers.
    In Table II, we present each categorisation effort in chronological order from
    left to right. Schilit et al. [79] (1994): They categorised context into three
    categories using a conceptual categorisation based technique on three common questions
    that can be used to determine the context. Where you are: This includes all location
    related information such as GPS coordinates, common names (e.g. coffee shop, university,
    police), specific names (e.g. Canberra city police), specific addresses, user
    preferences (e.g. user''s favourite coffee shop). Who you are with: The information
    about the people present around the user. What resources are nearby: This includes
    information about resources available in the area where the user is located, such
    as machinery, smart objects, and utilities. Henricksen [89] (2003): Categorised
    context into four categories based on an operational categorisation technique.
    Sensed: Sensor data directly sensed from the sensors, such as temperature measured
    by a temperature sensor. Values will be changed over time with a high frequency.
    Static: Static information which will not change over time, such as manufacturer
    of the sensor, capabilities of the sensor, range of the sensor measurements. Profiled:
    Information that changes over time with a low frequency, such as once per month
    (e.g. location of sensor, sensor ID). Derived: The information computed using
    primary context such as distance of two sensors calculated using two GPS sensors.
    Van Bunningen et al. [95] (2005): Instead of categorising context, they classified
    the context categorisation schemes into two broader categories: operational and
    conceptual. Operational categorisation: Categorise context based on how they were
    acquired, modelled, and treated. Conceptual categorisation: Categorise context
    based on the meaning and conceptual relationships between the context. TABLE II
    Different Context Categorisation Schemes and their Scopes Based on the evaluation
    of context categorisation, it is evident that no single categorisation scheme
    can accommodate all the demands in the IoT paradigm. We presented a comparison
    between conceptual and operational categorisation schemes in Table IV. To build
    an ideal context-aware middleware solution for the IoT, different categorisation
    schemes need to be combined together in order to complement their strengths and
    mitigate their weaknesses. D. Levels of Context Awareness and characteristics
    Context awareness can be identified in three levels based on the user interaction
    [104]. Personalisation: It allows the users to set their preferences, likes, and
    expectation to the system manually. For example, users may set the preferred temperature
    in a smart home environment where the heating system of the home can maintain
    the specified temperature across all rooms. Passive context-awareness: The system
    constantly monitors the environment and offers the appropriate options to the
    users so they can take actions. For example, when a user enters a super market,
    the mobile phone alerts the user with a list of discounted products to be considered.
    Active context-awareness: he system continuously and autonomously monitors the
    situation and acts autonomously. For example, if the smoke detectors and temperature
    sensors detect a fire in a room in a smart home environment, the system will automatically
    notify the fire brigade as well as the owner of the house via appropriate methods
    such as phone calls. In addition, Van Bunningen et al. [95] has identified comprehensively,
    and discussed, eight characteristics of context: context 1) is sensed though sensors
    or sensor networks, 2) is sensed by small and constrained devices, 3) originates
    from distributed sources, 4) is continuously changing, 5) comes from mobile objects
    6) has a temporal character 7) has a spatial character, 8) is imperfect and uncertain.
    E. Context Awareness Management Design Principles Martin et al. [105] have identified
    and comprehensively discussed six design principles related to context-aware management
    frameworks (middleware). Further, Ramparany et al. [106] and Bernardos et al.
    [107] have also identified several design requirements. We summarise the findings
    below with brief explanations. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Only
    the most important design aspects are considered. Architecture layers and components:
    The functionalities need to be divided into layers and components in a meaningful
    manner. Each component should perform a very limited amount of the task and should
    be able to perform independently up to a large extent. TABLE III Relationship
    Between Different Context Categories Scalability and extensibility: The component
    should be able to added or removed dynamically. For example. new functionalities
    (i.e. components) should be able to be add without altering the existing components
    (e.g. Open Services Gateway initiative). The component needs to be developed according
    to standards across the solutions, which improves scalability and extensibility
    (e.g. plug-in architectures). Application programming interface (API): All the
    functionalities should be available to be accessed via a comprehensive easy to
    learn and easy to use API. This allows the incorporation of different solutions
    very easily. Further, API can be used to bind context management frameworks to
    applications. Interoperability among different IoT solutions heavily depends on
    API and their usability. Debugging mechanisms and tools: Debugging is a critical
    task in any software development process. In the IoT paradigm, debugging would
    be difficult due to the exponential number of possible alternative interactions.
    In order to win the trust of the consumers, the IoT should prove its trustworthiness.
    Integrated debug mechanisms inbuilt into the framework will help to achieve this
    challenge. For example, the justifications behind the results produced by the
    reasoners should be available to be evaluated to find possible inaccuracies so
    further development can be carried out. Some initial work in this area is presented
    in the Intelligibility Toolkit [108]. Automatic context life cycle management:
    Context-aware frameworks should be able to be understand by the available context
    sources (i.e. physical and virtual sensors), their data structure, and automatically
    built internal data models to facilitate them. Further, raw context needs to be
    retrieved and transformed into appropriate context representation models correctly
    with minimum human intervention. Context model in-dependency: Context needs to
    be modelled and stored separately from context-aware framework related code and
    data structures, which allows both parts to be altered independently. Extended,
    rich, and comprehensive modelling: Context models should be able to extend easily.
    The IoT will need to deal with enormous amount of devices, and will be required
    to handle vast amounts of domain specific context. It also needs to support complex
    relationships, constrains, etc. In an ideal context-aware framework for the IoT,
    multiple different context representation models should be incorporated together
    to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. TABLE IV Comparison of Context
    Categorisation Schemes Multi-model reasoning: No single reasoning model can accommodate
    the demands of the IoT. We will discuss reasoning in Section IV-C. Each reasoning
    model has its own strengths and weaknesses. An ideal framework should incorporate
    multiple reasoning models together to complement each others'' strengths and mitigate
    their weaknesses. Mobility support: In the IoT, most devices would be mobile,
    where each one has a different set of hardware and software capabilities. Therefore,
    context-aware frameworks should be developed in multiple flavours (i.e. versions),
    which can run on different hardware and software configurations (e.g. more capabilities
    for server level software and less capabilities for mobile phones). Share information
    (real-time and historic): In the IoT, there is no single point of control. The
    architecture would be distributed. Therefore, context sharing should happen at
    different levels: framework-to-framework and framework-to-application. Context
    model in-dependency has been discussed earlier and is crucial in sharing. Resource
    optimisation: Due to the scale (e.g., 50 billion devices), a small improvement
    in data structures or processing can make a huge impact in storage and energy
    consumption. This stays true for any type of resource used in the IoT. Monitoring
    and detect event: Events play a significant role in the IoT, which is complement
    by monitoring. Detecting an event triggers an action autonomously in the IoT paradigm.
    This is how the IoT will help humans carry out their day-to-day work easily and
    efficiently. Detecting events in real time is a major challenge for context-aware
    frameworks in the IoT paradigm. SECTION IV. Context Life Cycle A data life cycle
    shows how data moves from phase to phase in software systems (e.g. application,
    middleware). Specifically, it explains where the data is generated and where the
    data is consumed. In this section we consider movement of context in context-aware
    systems. Context-awareness is no longer limited to desktop, web, or mobile applications.
    It has already become a service: Context-as-a-Service (CXaaS) [109]. In other
    terms, context management has become an essential functionality in software systems.
    This trend will grow in the IoT paradigm. There are web-based context management
    services (WCXMS) that provide context information management throughout the context''s
    life cycle. Hynes et al. [109] have classified data life cycles into two categories:
    Enterprise Lifecycle Approaches (ELA) and Context Lifecycle Approaches (CLA).
    ELA are focused on context. However, these life cycles are robust and well-established,
    based on industry standard strategies for data management in general. In contrast,
    CLA are specialised in context management. However, they are not tested or standardised
    strategies as much as ELA. We have selected ten popular data life cycles to analyse
    in this survey. In the following list, 1–5 belong to ELA category and 6–10 belong
    to ELA category. Three dots (…) denotes reconnecting to the first phase by completing
    the cycle. The right arrow (→) denotes data transfer form one phase to another.

    dissemination → context usage → context deletion → context request →…)→ context
    maintenance → context disposition →… Baldauf et al. [10]: sensors → raw data retrieval
    → reprocessing → storage → application. In addition to the life cycles, Bernardos
    et al. [107] identified three phases in a typical context management system: context
    acquisition, information processing, and reasoning and decision. After reviewing
    the above life cycles, we derived an appropriate (i.e. minimum number of phases
    but includes all essential) context life cycle as depicted in Figure 6. This context
    life cycle consists of four phases. First, context needs to be acquired from various
    sources. The sources could be physical sensors or virtual sensors (context acquisition).
    Second, the collected data needs to be modelled and represent according to a meaningful
    manner (context modelling). Third, modelled data needs to be processed to derive
    high-level context information from low-level raw sensor data (context reasoning).
    Finally, both high-level and low-level context needs to be distributed to the
    consumers who are interested in context (context dissemination). The following
    discussion is based on these four phases. A. Context Acquisition In this section
    we discuss five factors that need to be considered when developing context-aware
    middleware solutions in the IoT paradigm. The techniques used to acquire context
    can be varied based on responsibility, frequency, context source, sensor type,
    and acquisition process. Fig. 6. This is the simplest form of a context life cycle.
    These four steps are essential in context management systems and middleware solutions.
    All the other functions that may offer by systems are value added services. Show
    All 1) Based on Responsibility Context (e.g. sensor data) acquisition can be primarily
    accomplished using two methods [118]: push and pull. A comparison is presented
    in Table V. Pull: The software component which is responsible for acquiring sensor
    data from sensors make a request (e.g. query) from the sensor hardware periodically
    (i.e. after certain intervals) or instantly to acquire data. Push: The physical
    or virtual sensor pushes data to the software component which is responsible to
    acquiring sensor data periodically or instantly. Periodical or instant pushing
    can be employed to facilitate a publish and subscribe model. 2) Based on Frequency
    Further, in the loT paradigm, context can be generated based on two different
    event types: instant events and interval events VI. Instant (also known as threshold
    violation): These events occur instantly. The events do not span across certain
    amounts of time. Open a door, switch on a light, or animal enters experimental
    crop field are some types of instant events. In order to detect this type of event,
    sensor data needs to be acquired when the event occurs. Both push and pull methods
    can be employed. Interval (also known as periodically): These events span a certain
    period of time. Raining, animal eating a plant, or winter are some interval events.
    In order to detect this type of event, sensor data needs to be acquired periodically
    (e.g. sense and send data to the software every 20 seconds). Both push and pull
    methods can be employed. 3) Based on Source In addition, context acquisition methods
    can be categorised into three categories [119] based on where the context came
    from. A comparison is presented in Table VII. Acquire directly from sensor hardwa
    re: In this method, context is directly acquired from the sensor by communicating
    with the sensor hardware and related APIs. Software drivers and libraries need
    to be installed locally. This method is typically used to retrieve data from sensors
    attached locally. Most devices and sensors today require some amount of driver
    support and can be connected via USB, COM, or serial ports. However, wireless
    technologies are becoming popular in the sensor community, which allows data transmission
    without driver installations. In the IoT paradigm most objects will communicate
    with each other via a wireless means. TABLE V Comparison of Context Acouisition
    Methods Based on Responsibility (Push Pull) TABLE VI Comparison of Context Acquisition
    Methods Based on Frequency (Instant, Interval) Acquire through a middleware infrastructure:
    In this method, sensor (context) data is acquired by middleware solutions such
    as GSN. The applications can retrieve sensor data from the middleware and not
    from the sensor hardware directly. For example, some GSN instances will directly
    access sensor hardware and rest of the GSN instances will communicate with other
    GSN instances to retrieve data. Acquire from context servers: In this method,
    context is acquired from several other context storages (e.g. databases, RSS (Really
    Simple Syndication) feeds, web services) via different mechanisms such as web
    service calls. This mechanism is useful when the hosting device of the context-aware
    application has limited computing resources. Resource-rich context servers can
    be used to acquire and process context. 4) Based on Sensor Types There are different
    types of sensors that can be employed to acquire context. In general usage, the
    term ‘sensor’ is used to refer to tangible sensor hardware devices. However, among
    the technical community, sensors are refer to as any data source that provides
    relevant context. Therefore, sensors can be divided into three categories [120]:
    physical, virtual, and logical. A comparison is presented in Table VIII. Physical
    sensors: These are the most commonly used type of sensors and they are tangible.
    These sensors generate sensor data by themselves. Most of the devices we use today
    are equipped with a variety of sensor (e.g. temperature, humidity, microphone,
    touch). A discussion on commonly used sensor data types and sensors is presented
    in [121]. The data retrieved from physical sensors is called low-level context.
    They are less meaningful, trivial, and vulnerable to small changes. IoT solutions
    needs to understand the physical world using imperfect, conflicting and imprecise
    data. Virtual sensors: These sensors do not necessarily generate sensor data by
    themselves. Virtual sensors retrieve data from many sources and publish it as
    sensor data (e.g. calendar, contact number directory, twitter statuses, email
    and chat applications). These sensors do not have a physical presence. They commonly
    use web services technology to send and receive data. TABLE VII Comparison of
    Context Acquisition Methods Based on Source (Direct Sensors, Middleware, Context
    Servers) TABLE VIII Comparison of Context Acquisition Methods Based on Sensor
    Types (Physical, Virtual, Logical) Logical sensors (also called software sensors):
    They combine physical sensors and virtual sensors in order to produce more meaningful
    information. A web service dedicated to providing weather information can be called
    a logical sensor. Weather stations use thousands of physical sensors to collect
    weather information. They also collect information from virtual sensors such as
    maps, calendars, and historic data. Finally, weather information is produced by
    combing both physical and virtual sensors. In addition, the android mobile operating
    system consists of a number of software sensors such as gravity, linear accelerometer,
    rotation vector, and orientation sensors. 5) Based on Acquisition Process There
    are three ways to acquire context: sense, derive, and manually provided. Sense:
    The data is sensed through sensors, including the sensed data stored in databases
    (e.g. retrieve temperature from a sensor, retrieve appointments details from a
    calendar). Derive: The information is generated by performing computational operations
    on sensor data. These operations could be as simple as web service calls or as
    complex as mathematical functions run over sensed data (e.g. calculate distance
    between two sensors using GPS coordinates). The necessary data should be available
    to apply any numerical or logical reasoning technique. Manually provided: Users
    provide context information manually via predefined settings options such as preferences
    (e.g. understand that user doesn''t like to receive event notifications between
    10pm to 6.00am). This method can be use to retrieve any type of information. B.
    Context Modelling We discuss the basic definition of context modelling in Section
    III-A3. Context modelling is also widely refereed to as context representation.
    There are several popular context modelling techniques [10], [122] used in context-aware
    computing. Before we present the discussion on context modelling techniques, let''s
    briefly introduce context modelling fundamentals. Context models can be static
    or dynamic. Static models have a predefined set of context information that will
    be collected and stored [103]. The requirements that need to be taken into consideration
    when modelling context information are identified and explained in [12] as heterogeneity
    and mobility, relationships and dependencies, timeliness (also called freshness),
    imperfection, reasoning, usability of modelling formalisms, and efficient context
    provisioning. Typically, there are two steps in representing context according
    to a model: Context modelling process: In the first step, new context information
    needs to be defined in terms of attributes, characteristics, relationships with
    previously specified context, quality-of context attributes and the queries for
    synchronous context requests. Organize context according to the model: In the
    second step, the result of the context modelling step needs to be validated. Then
    the new context information needs to be merged and added to the existing context
    information repository. Finally, the new context information is made available
    to be used when required. The first step performs the actual modelling of context.
    However, the factors and parameters that are considered for the modelling context
    are very subjective. It varies from one solution to another. We use two examples
    to demonstrate the variance. Currently, there is no standard to specify what type
    of information needs to be considered in context modelling. We discussed context
    categories proposed by the researcher in Section III-C. Even though these categories
    provide high-level guidelines towards choosing relevant context, choosing specific
    context attributes is a subjective decision. Example 1: MoCA [49] has used an
    object oriented approach to model context using XML. There are three sections
    in the proposed context model: structural information (e.g. attributes and dependencies
    among context types), behavioural information (e.g. whether the context attribute
    has a constant or variable value), and context-specific abstractions (e.g. contextual
    events and queries). Example 2: W4 Diary [123] uses a W4 (who, what, where, when)
    based context model to structure data in order to extract high-level information
    from location data. For example, W4 represents context as tuples (e.g. Who: John,
    What: walking:4km/h, Where: ANU, Canberra, When: 2013–01-05:9.30am). In the IoT
    paradigm, context information has six states [124]: ready, running, suspended,
    resumed, expired, and terminated. These states are also similar to the process
    states in an operating system. They align context to an event. An example scenario
    from the smart agriculture domain can be used to explain the state transition
    of context. Ready: Every context is in the ready state at the initial stage (e.g.
    possible event can be ‘an animal eating crop’). Suspended: When the context seems
    to be invalid temporally (e.g. sensors detect that animal stops eating crop temporarily).
    Resumed: When the context becomes valid from being suspended (e.g. sensors detect
    animal starts to eat crop again). Expired: When the context has expired and further
    information is not available (e.g. sensor data has not been received by the system
    for the last 60 seconds where all sensor data is considered to be expired (based
    on policy) within 20 seconds from the time it is collected). Terminated: When
    the context is no longer valid (i.e. inferred something else) and further information
    is not available (e.g. sensors detects that animal moves away from the crops).
    The most popular context modelling techniques are surveyed in [6], [7]. These
    surveys discuss a number of systems that have been developed based on the following
    techniques. Each of the following techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses.
    We discuss context modelling techniques at a high-level. The actual implementations
    of these techniques can vary widely depending on application domain (e.g. implementation
    details may differ from embedded environments to mobile environments to cloud
    based environments). Therefore, our focus is on conceptual perspective of each
    modelling technique no on specific implementation. Our discussion is based on
    the six most popular context modelling techniques: key-value, markup schemes,
    graphical, object based, logic based, and ontology based modelling. A comparison
    of these models is presented in Table X. 1) Key-Value Modelling It models context
    information as key-value pairs in different formats such as text files and binary
    files. This is the simplest form of context representation among all the other
    techniques. They are easy to manage when they have smaller amounts of data. However,
    key-value modelling is not scalable and not suitable to store complex data structures.
    Further, hierarchical structures or relationships cannot be modelled using key-value
    pairs. Therefore, lack of data structuring capability makes it difficult to retrieve
    modelled information efficiently. Further, attaching meta information is not possible.
    The key-value technique is an application oriented and application bounded technique
    that suits the purpose of temporary storage such as less complex application configurations
    and user preferences. 2) Markup Scheme Modelling (Tagged Encoding) It models data
    using tags. Therefore, context is stored within tags. This technique is an improvement
    over the key-value modelling technique. The advantage of using markup tags is
    that it allows efficient data retrieval. Further, validation is supported through
    schema definitions. Sophisticated validation tools are available for popular markup
    techniques such as XML. Range checking is also possible up to some degree for
    numerical values. Markup schemas such as XML are widely used in almost all application
    domains to store data temporarily, transfer data among applications, and transfer
    data among application components. In contrast, markup languages do not provide
    advanced expressive capabilities which allow reasoning. Further, due to lack of
    design specifications, context modelling, retrieval, interoperability, and re-usability
    over different markup schemes can be difficult. A common application of markup
    based modelling is modelling profiles. Profiles are commonly developed using languages
    such as XML. However, the concept of markup languages are not restricted only
    to XML. Any language or mechanism (e.g. JSON) that supports tag based storage
    allows markup scheme modelling. An example of popular markup scheme modelling
    is Composite Capabilities/Preference Profiles (CC/PP) [125]. There are a significant
    number of similar emerging applications such as ContextML [126] in context-aware
    computing. Tuples are also used to model context [103]. TABLE IX Comparison of
    Semantic Web Ontology Languages (RDF(S), OWL(2)) 3) Graphical Modelling It models
    context with relationships. Some examples of this modelling technique are Unified
    Modelling Language (UML) [127] and Object Role Modelling (ORM) [128]. In terms
    of expressive richness, graphical modelling is better than markup and key-value
    modelling as it allows relationships to be captured into the context model. Actual
    low-level representation of the graphical modelling technique could be varied.
    For example, it could be a SQL database, noSQL database, XML, etc. Many other
    extensions have also been proposed and implemented using this technique [89].
    Further, as we are familiar with databases, graphical modelling is a well known,
    easy to learn, and easy to use technique. Databases can hold massive amounts of
    data and provide simple data retrieval operations, which can be performed relatively
    quickly. In contrast, the number of different implementations (i.e. different
    databases and other solutions) makes it difficult with regards to interoperability.
    Further, there are limitations on data retrieval mechanisms such as SQL. In addition,
    sophisticated context retrieval requirements may demand very complex SQL queries
    to be employed. The queries can be difficult to create, use, and manage even with
    the sophisticated tools that exist today. Adding context information and changing
    the data structure is also difficult in later stages. However, some of the recent
    trends and solutions in the noSQL [129] movement allows these structure alteration
    issues to be overcome. Therefore, graphical modelling techniques can be used as
    persistent storage of context. 4) Object Based Modelling Object based (or object
    oriented) concepts are used to model data using class hierarchies and relationships.
    Object oriented paradigm promotes encapsulation and re-usability. As most of the
    high-level programming languages support object oriented concepts, modelling can
    integrated into context-aware systems easily. Therefore, object based modelling
    is suitable to be used as an internal, non-shared, code based, run-time context
    modelling, manipulation, and storage mechanism. However, it does not provide inbuilt
    reasoning capabilities. Validation of object oriented designs is also difficult
    due to the lack of standards and specifications. 5) Logic Based Modelling Facts,
    expressions, and rules are used to represent information about the context. Rules
    are used by other modelling techniques, such as ontologies, as well. Rules are
    primarily used to express policies, constraints, and preferences. It provides
    much more expressive richness compared to the other models discussed previously.
    Therefore, reasoning is possible up to a certain level. The specific structures
    and languages that can be used to model context using rules are varied. However,
    lack of standardisation reduces the re-usability and applicability. Furthermore,
    highly sophisticated and interactive graphical techniques can be employed to develop
    logic based or rule based representations. As a result, even non-technical users
    can add rules and logic to the systems during run time. Logic based modelling
    allows new high-level context information to be extracted using low-level context.
    Therefore, it has the capability to enhance other context modelling techniques
    by acting as a supplement. 6) Ontology Based Modelling The context is organised
    into ontologies using semantic technologies. A number of different standards (RDF,
    RDFS, OWL) and reasoning capabilities are available to be used depending on the
    requirement. A wide range of development tools and reasoning engines are also
    available. However, context retrieval can be computationally intensive and time
    consuming when the amount of data is increased. According to many surveys, in
    context-aware computing and sensor data management, ontologies are the preferred
    mechanism of managing and modelling context despite its weaknesses. Due to its
    popularity and wider adaptation during the last five years in both academia and
    industry we present a brief discussion on semantic modelling and reasoning. However,
    our intention is not to survey semantic technologies but to highlight the applicability
    of semantics in a context-aware domain from an IoT perspective. Comprehensive
    and extensive amounts of information on semantic technology are available in [130],
    [131], [132]. Khoo [134] has explained the evolution of the web in four stages:
    basic Internet as Web 1.0, social media and user generated content as web 2.0,
    semantic web as web 3.0 and IoT as web 4.0. In this identification, semantic web
    has been given a separate phase to show its importance and the significant changes
    that semantic technologies can bring to the web in general. TABLE X Comparison
    of Context Modelling and Representation Techniques Ontology is the main component
    in semantic technology that allows it to model data. Based on the previous approaches
    and survey [7], one of the most appropriate formats to manage context is ontologies.
    Ontologies offer an expressive language to represent the relationships and context.
    IT also provides comprehensive reasoning mechanisms as well. Ontologies also allow
    knowledge sharing and they decouple the knowledge from the application and program
    codes [119]. There are several reasons to develop and use ontologies in contrast
    to other modelling techniques. The most common reasons are to [135], [136] share
    a common understanding of the structure of information among people or software
    agents, analyse domain knowledge, separate domain knowledge from operational knowledge,
    enable reuse of domain knowledge, high-level knowledge inferring, and make domain
    assumptions explicit. Due to the dynamic nature, the IoT middleware solutions
    should support applications which are not even known at the middleware design-time.
    Ontologies allow the integration of knowledge on different domains into applications
    when necessary. Studer et al. [137] defined the concept of ontology as follows.
    “An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation.
    A conceptualisation refers to an abstract model of some phenomenon in the world
    by having identified the relevant concepts of that phenomenon. Explicit means
    that the type of concepts used, and the constraints on their use are explicitly
    defined. For example, in medical domains, the concepts are diseases and symptoms,
    the relations between them are causal and a constraint is that a disease cannot
    cause itself. Formal refers to the fact that the ontology should be machine readable,
    which excludes natural language. Shared reflects the notion that an ontology captures
    consensual knowledge, that is, it is not private to some individual, but accepted
    by a group.” Another acceptable definition has been presented by Noy and McGuinness
    [136]. Further ontologies are discussed extensively as principles, methods, and
    applications in perspective [138]. Some of the requirements and objectives behind
    designing an ontology are simplicity, flexibility and extensibility, generality,
    and expressiveness [139]. In addition, some of the general requirements in context
    modelling and representation are unique identification, validation, reuse, handling
    uncertainty, and incomplete information [11]. A further eight principles for developing
    ontologies are identified by Korpipaa and Mantyjarvi [140] as: domain, simplicity,
    practical access, flexibility and expandability, facilitate inference, genericity,
    efficiency, and expressiveness. Ontologies consists of several common key components
    [141], [142] such as individuals, classes, attributes, relations, function terms,
    restrictions, rules, axioms, and events. Furthermore, there are two steps in developing
    ontologies. First, the domain and scope need to be clearly defined. Then existing
    ontologies need to be reviewed to find the possibilities of leverage existing
    in ontologies. One of the main goals of ontologies is the reusability of shared
    knowledge. By the time this survey was prepared, there were several popular domains
    that design, develop, and use ontologies. Sensor domain is one of them. A survey
    of the semantic specification of sensors is presented in [143]. They have evaluated
    and compared a number of ontologies and their capabilities. There are several
    popular semantic web ontology languages that can be used to develop ontologies:
    RDF [144], RDFS [145], OWL [146]. The current recommendation is OWL 2 which is
    an extended version of OWL. A significant amount of OWL usage has been noticed
    in the context modelling ad reasoning domain [11]. It further emphasises the requirement
    of having the modelling language, reasoning engines, and mechanism to define rules
    as a bundle, rather than choosing different available options arbitrarily, to
    get the real power of semantic technologies. SWRL is one of the available solutions
    to add rules in OWL [12]. SWRL is not a hybrid approach as it is fully integrated
    into ontological reasoning. In contrast, when the amount of data becomes larger
    and structure becomes complex, ontologies can becomes exceedingly complex causing
    the reasoning process to be resource intensive and slow. However, some of the
    main reasons to choose OWL as the context modelling mechanism are [119], [142].
    W3C strongly supports the standardisation of OWL. Therefore, a variety of development
    tools are available for integrating and managing OWL ontologies, which makes it
    easier to develop and share. OWL allows interoperability among other context-aware
    systems. These features, such as classes, properties and constraints, and individuals
    are important for supporting ontology reuse, mapping and interoperability. OWL
    supports a high-level of inference / reasoning support. OWL is more expressive.
    For example, it provides cardinality constraints, which enables imposing additional
    restrictions on the classes. We compare the two most popular web ontology languages,
    RDF(S) and OWL(2) in Table IX, to highlight the fundamental differences. After
    evaluating several context modelling techniques, it was revealed that incorporating
    multiple modelling techniques is the best way to produce efficient and effective
    results, which will mitigate each other''s weaknesses. Therefore, no single modelling
    technique is ideal to be used in a standalone fashion. There is a strong relationship
    between context modelling and reasoning. For example, some reasoning techniques
    prefer some modelling techniques. However, it should not limit the employability
    of different context reasoning and modelling techniques together. In the next
    section we discuss reasoning context-aware computing. C. Context Reasoning Decision
    Models Context reasoning can be defined as a method of deducing new knowledge,
    and understanding better, based on the available context [147]. It can also be
    explained as a process of giving high-level context deductions from a set of contexts
    [97]. The requirement of reasoning also emerged due to two characteristics of
    raw context: imperfection (i.e. unknown, ambiguous, imprecise, or erroneous) and
    uncertainty. Reasoning performance can be measured using efficiency, soundness,
    completeness, and interoperability [11]. Reasoning is also called inferencing.
    Contest reasoning comprises several steps. Broadly we can divide them into three
    phases [148]. Context pre-processing: This phase cleans the collected sensor data.
    Due to inefficiencies in sensor hardware and network communication, collected
    data may be not accurate or missing. Therefore, data needs to be cleaned by filling
    missing values, removing outliers, validating context via multiple sources, and
    many more. These tasks have been extensively researched by database, data mining,
    and sensor network research communities over many years. Sensor data fusion: It
    is a method of combining sensor data from multiple sensors to produce more accurate,
    more complete, and more dependable information that could not be achieve through
    a single sensor [149]. In the IoT, fusion is extremely important, because there
    will be billions of sensors available. As a result, a large number of alternative
    sources will exist to provide the same information. Context inference: Generation
    of high-level context information using lower-level context. The inferencing can
    be done in a single interaction or in multiple interactions. Revisiting an example
    from a different perspective, W4 Diary [123] represented context as tuples (e.g.
    Who: John, What: walking:4km/h, Where: ANU, Canberra, When: 2013–01-05:9.30am).
    This low-level context can be inferred through a number of reasoning mechanisms
    to generate the final results. For example, in the first iteration, longitude
    and latitude values of a GPS sensor may be inferred as PurplePickle cafe in canberra.
    In the next iteration PurplePickle cafe in canberra may be inferred as John''s
    favourite cafe. Each iteration gives more accurate and meaningful information.
    There are a large number of different context reasoning decision models, such
    as decision tree, naive Bayes, hidden Markov models, support vector machines,
    k-nearest neighbour, artificial neural networks, Dempster-Shafer, ontology-based,
    rule-based, fuzzy reasoning and many more. Most of the models originated and are
    employed in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Therefore,
    these models are not specific to context-reasoning but commonly used across many
    different fields in computing and engineering. Fig. 7. (a) counts of model types
    used in 109 of 114 reviewed context-aware applications. (b) Counts for 50 recognition
    applications; classifiers are used most often for applications that do recognition
    [108]. Show All We present the results of a survey conducted by Lim and Dey [108]
    in Figure 7. They have investigated the popularity of context reasoning decision
    models. The survey is based on literature from three major conferences over five
    years: Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) 2003–2009, Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp)
    2004–2009, and Pervasive 2004–2009. In the IoT paradigm, there are many sensors
    that sense and produce context information. The amount of information that will
    be collected by over 50 billion sensors is enormous. Therefore, using all this
    context for reasoning in not feasible for many reasons, such as processing time,
    power, storage, etc. Furthermore, Guan et al. [97] has proved that using more
    context will not necessarily improve the accuracy of the inference in a considerable
    manner. They have used two reasoning models in their research: back-propagation
    neural networks and k-nearest neighbours. According to the results, 93% accuracy
    has been achieved by using ten raw context. Adding 30 more raw context to the
    reasoning model has increased the accuracy by only 1.63%. Therefore, selecting
    the appropriate raw context for reasoning is critical to infer high-level context
    with high accuracy. Context reasoning has been researched over many years. The
    most popular context reasoning techniques (also called decision models) are surveyed
    in [11], [12], [147]. Our intention in this paper is not to survey context reasoning
    techniques but to briefly introduce them so it will help to understand and appreciate
    the role of context reasoning in the IoT paradigm. We classify context reasoning
    techniques broadly into six categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
    rules, fuzzy logic, ontological reasoning and probabilistic reasoning. A comparison
    of these techniques is presented in Table XI 1) Supervised learning In this category
    of techniques, we first collect training examples. Then we label them according
    to the results we expect. Then we derive a function that can generate the expected
    results using the training data. This technique is widely used in mobile phone
    sensing [150] and activity recognition [151]. Decision tree is a supervised learning
    technique where it builds a tree from a dataset that can be used to classify data.
    This technique has been used to develop a student assessment system in [152].
    Bayesian Networks is a technique based on probabilistic reasoning concepts. It
    uses directed acyclic graphs to represent events and relationships among them.
    It is a widely used technique in statistical reasoning. Example applications are
    presented in [141], [153]. Bayesian networks are commonly used in combining uncertain
    information from a large number of sources and deducing higher-level contexts.
    Artificial neural networks is a technique that attempts to mimic the biological
    neuron system. They are typically used to model complex relationships between
    inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data. Body sensor networks domain has
    employed this technique for pervasive healthcare monitoring in [154]. Support
    vector machines are widely used for pattern recognition in context-aware computing.
    It has been used to detect activity recognition of patients in the healthcare
    domain [155] and to learn situations in a smart home environment [156]. 2) Unsupervised
    learning This category of techniques can find hidden structures in unlabelled
    data. Due to the use of no training data, there is no error or reward signal to
    evaluate a potential solution. Clustering techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbour
    is popularly used in context-aware reasoning. Specifically, clustering is used
    in low-level (sensor hardware level) sensor network operations such as routing
    and high level tasks such as indoor and outdoor positioning and location [157].
    Unsupervised neural network techniques such as Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (KSOM)
    are used to classify incoming sensor data in a real-time fashion [158]. Noise
    detection and outlier detection are other applications in context-aware computing.
    Applications of unsupervised learning techniques in relation to body sensor networks
    are surveyed in [154]. The unsupervised clustering method has been employed to
    capturing user contexts by dynamic profiling in [159]. 3) Rules This is the simplest
    and most straightforward methods of reasoning out of all of them. Rules are usually
    structure in an IF-THEN-ELSE format. This is the most popular method of reasoning
    according to Figure 7. It allows the generation of high level context information
    using low level context. Recently, rules have been heavily used when combined
    with ontological reasoning [160], [161], [162]. MiRE [163] is a minimal rule engine
    for context-aware mobile devices. Most of the user preferences are encoded using
    rules. Rules are also used in event detection [164], [165]. Rules are expected
    to play a significant role in the IoT, where they are the easiest and simplest
    way to model human thinking and reasoning in machines. PRIAMOS [166] has used
    semantic rules to annotate sensor data with context information. Application of
    rule based reasoning is clearly explained in relation to context-aware I/O control
    in [167]. TABLE XI Comparison of Context Reasoning Decision Modelling Techniques
    4) Fuzzy logic This allows approximate reasoning instead of fixed and crisp reasoning.
    Fuzzy logic is similar to probabilistic reasoning but confidence values represent
    degrees of membership rather than probability [168]. In traditional logic theory,
    acceptable truth values are 0 or 1. In fuzzy logic partial truth values are acceptable.
    It allows real world scenarios to be represented more naturally; as most real
    world facts are not crisp. It further allows the use of natural language (e.g.
    temperature: slightly warm, fairly cold) definitions rather than exact numerical
    values (e.g. temperature: 10 degrees Celsius). In other words it allows imprecise
    notions such as tall, short, dark, trustworthy and confidence to be captured,
    which is critical in context information processing. In most cases, fuzzy reasoning
    cannot be used as a standalone reasoning technique. It is usually used to complement
    another techniques such as rules based, probabilistic or ontological reasoning.
    Gaia [169] has used fuzzy logic in context providers to handle uncertainty. Several
    examples of applying fuzzy logic to represent context information are presented
    in [170], [171]. 5) Ontology based It is based on description logic, which is
    a family of logic based knowledge representations of formalisms. Ontological reasoning
    is mainly supported by two common representations of semantic web languages: RDF(S)
    [144] and OWL(2) [146]. We discussed ontology based modelling in Section IV-B6.
    Semantic web languages are also complemented by several semantic query languages:
    RDQL, RQL, TRIPLE and number of reasoning engines: FACT [172], RACER, Pellet [173].
    Rules such as SWRL [160] are increasingly popular in ontological reasoning. The
    advantage of ontological reasoning is that it integrates well with ontology modelling.
    In contrast, a disadvantage is that ontological reasoning is not capable of finding
    missing values or ambiguous information where statistical reasoning techniques
    are good at that. Rules can be used to minimise this weakness by generating new
    context information based on low-level context. Missing values can also be tackled
    by having rules that enable missing values to be replaced with suitable predefined
    values. However, these mechanism will not perform accurately in highly dynamic
    and uncertain domains. Ontological reasoning is heavily used in a wide range of
    applications, such as activity recognition [151], hybrid reasoning [151], and
    event detection [165]. A survey on semantic based reasoning is presented in [147].
    It also compares a number of context aware frameworks based on modelling technique,
    reasoning techniques, and architectures used in their systems. Comprehensive and
    extensive amounts of information on semantic technology are available in [130],
    [131], [132]. In addition, a semantic based architecture for sensor data fusion
    is presented in [174], [175], [176]. 6) Probabilistic logic This category of techniques
    allows decisions to be made based on probabilities attached to the facts related
    to the problem. It can be used to combine sensor data from two different sources.
    Further, it can be used to identify resolutions to conflicts among context. Most
    often these techniques are used to understand occurrence of events. Probabilistic
    logic has been used in [168] to encode access control policies. Dempster-Shafer,
    which is based on probabilistic logic, allows different evidence to be combined
    to calculate the probability of an event. Dempster-Shafer is commonly used in
    sensor data fusion for activity recognition. In [171], [177], it has been used
    to understand whether there is a meeting in the room. Other example applications
    are presented in [178], [179]. hidden Markov Models [180] are also a probabilistic
    technique that allows state to be represented using observable evidence without
    directly reading the state. For example, it provides a method to bridge the gap
    between raw GPS sensor measurements and high level information such as a user
    destination, mode of transportation, calendar based observable evidence such as
    user calendar, weather, etc. hidden Markov Models are commonly used in activity
    recognition in context-aware domains. For example, it has been used to learn situation
    models in a smart home [156]. Up to now, we have presented and discussed a number
    of context modelling and reasoning techniques. However, it is clear that each
    technique has its own strengths and weakness. No single technique can be used
    to accomplish perfect results. Therefore, the best method to tackle the problem
    of context awareness it to combine multiple models in such a way that, as a whole,
    they reduce weaknesses by complementing each other. For example, Alternative Context
    Construction Trees (ACCT) [181] is an approach that enables the concurrent evaluation
    and consolidation of different reasoning models such as logic rules, Bayesian
    networks and CoCoGraphs [182]. There are two reasons that context information
    can become uncertain, as discussed in V-A16. Therefore, employing or incorporating
    strategies that can reason under uncertainty such as Bayesian networks, Dempster-Shafer
    or fuzzy logic is essential in such situations. The process of how the multiple
    techniques can be combined together is presented in [12], [183]. We briefly explain
    the hybrid context modelling and reasoning approach as follows. At the lowest
    level, statistical techniques can be used to fuse sensor data. Then, fuzzy logic
    can be employed to convert fixed data in to more natural terms. In the future,
    Dempster-Shafer can be used to combine sensor data from different sources. In
    addition, machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines and artificial
    neural networks, can be used for further reasoning. After completing statistical
    reasoning, the high level data can be modelled using semantic technologies such
    as ontologies. Ontological reasoning can be applied to infer additional context
    information using domain knowledge at the higher level. A similar process is explained
    in detail in [183]. D. Context Distribution Context distribution is a fairly straightforward
    task. It provides methods to deliver context to the consumers. From the consumer
    perspective this task can be called context acquisition, where the discussion
    we presented in Section IV-A is completely applicable. Therefore all the factors
    we discussed under context acquisition need to be considered for context distribution
    as well. Other than that there are two other methods to that are used commonly
    in context distribution: Query: Context consumer makes a request in terms of a
    query, so the context management system can use that query to produce results.
    Subscription (also called publish / subscribe): Context consumer can be allowed
    to subscribe with a context management system by describing the requirements.
    The system will then return the results periodically or when an event occurs (threshold
    violation). In other terms, consumers can subscribe for a specific sensor or to
    an event. However, in underline implementations, queries may also use to define
    subscriptions. Further, this method is typically use in real time processing.
    SECTION V. Existing Research Prototypes and Systems In this section, first we
    present our evaluation framework and then we briefly discuss some of the most
    significant projects and highlight their significance. Later, we identify the
    lessons we can learn from them towards context-aware development in the IoT paradigm
    in Section VI. The projects are discussed in the same order as in Table XIII.
    Our taxonomy is summarized in Table XII. A. Evaluation Framework We used abbreviations
    as much as possible to make sure that the structure allowed all 50 projects to
    be presented in a single page, which enables the readers to analyse and identify
    positive and negative patterns that we have not explicitly discussed. In Table
    XIII, we use a dash (-) symbol across all columns to denote that the functionality
    is either missing or not mentioned in related publications that are available.
    In order to increase the readability, we have numbered the columns of the Table
    XIII corresponding to the taxonomy numbered below. Our taxonomy and several other
    features that will provide additional value in IoT solutions are visually illustrated
    in Figure 8. 1) Project Name This is the name given to the project by the authors
    of the related publications. Most of the project names are abbreviations that
    are used to refer to the project. However, some project do not have an explicit
    project name, here we used a dash (-) symbol. 2) Citation We provide only one
    citation due to space limitations. Other citations are listed under each project''s
    descriptions and highlights in Section V. 3) Year Table XIII is ordered according
    to chronological order (i.e. from oldest to newest) based on the year of publication.
    4) Project Focus Based on our evaluation, each project has its own focus on whether
    to build a system, a toolkit, or a middleware solution. The following abbreviations
    are used to denote the focus: system (S), toolkit (T), and middleware (M). Systems
    focus on developing an end-to-end solution where it involves hardware, software
    and application layer. Systems cannot be used as middleware. It is designed to
    provide one or a few tasks. Building different functionalities on top of the system
    is not an option. Systems are designed and developed for a use by the end users.
    Toolkits are not designed to be used by the end users. They are employed by system,
    application, and middleware developers. They provide very specific functionalities.
    Toolkits are usually designed according to well-known design principles and standards
    and always released with proper documentation that shows how to use them at programming
    code level. Middleware [58] can be explained as a software layer that lies between
    the hardware and application layers. It provides reusable functionalities that
    are required by the application to meet complex customer requirements. They are
    usually built to address common issues in application development such as heterogeneity,
    interoperability, security, and dependability. A goal of middleware is to provide
    a set of programming abstractions to help software development where heterogeneous
    components need to be connected and communicate together. Middleware is designed
    to be used by application developers, where the middleware solution handles most
    of the common functionalities leaving more time and effort for the application
    developers to deal with application functionalities. 5) Modelling This has been
    discussed in detail in Section IV-B. We use the following abbreviations to denote
    the context modelling techniques employed by the project: key-value modelling
    (K), markup Schemes (M), graphical modelling (G), object oriented modelling (Ob),
    logic-based modelling (L), and ontology-based modelling (On). 6) Reasoning This
    has been discussed in detail in Section IV-C. We use the following abbreviations
    to denote the context reasoning techniques employed by the project: supervised
    learning (S), un-supervised learning (D), rules (R), fuzzy logic (F), ontology-based
    (O), and probabilistic reasoning (P). The symbol (✓) is used where reasoning functionality
    is provided but the specific technique is not mentioned. 7) Distribution This
    has been discussed in detail in Section IV-D. We use the following abbreviations
    to denote the context distribution techniques employed by the project: publish/subscribe
    (P) and query (Q). 8) Architecture This varied widely from one solution to another.
    Architecture can be classified into different categories based on different perspectives.
    Therefore, there is no common classification scheme that can be used for all situations.
    We consider the most significant architectural characteristics to classify the
    solution. Different architectural styles are numbered as follows. (1) Component
    based architecture where the entire solution is based on loosely coupled major
    components, which interact each other. For example, Context Toolkit [72] has three
    major components which perform the most critical functionalities of the system.
    (2) Distributed architecture enables peer-to-peer interaction in a distributed
    fashion, such as in Solar [184]. (3) Service based architecture where the entire
    solution consists of several services working together. However, individual access
    to each service may not be provided in solutions such as Gaia [168]. (4) Node
    based architecture allows to deployment of pieces of software with similar or
    different capabilities, which communicate and collectively process data in sensor
    networks [85]. (5) Centralised architecture which acts as a complete stack (e.g.
    middleware) and provides applications to be developed on top of that, but provides
    no communication between different instances of the solution. (6) Client-server
    architecture separates sensing and processing from each other, such as in CaSP
    [185]. 9) History and Storage Storing context history is critical [186] in both
    traditional context-aware computing and the IoT. Historic data allows sensor data
    to be better understood. Even though most of the IoT solutions and applications
    are focused on real time interaction, historic data has its own role to play.
    Specifically, it allows user behaviours, preferences, patterns, trends, needs,
    and many more to be understood. In contrast, due to the scale of the IoT, storing
    all the context for the long term may not feasible. However, storage devices are
    getting more and more powerful and cheap. Therefore, it would be a tradeoff between
    cost and understanding. The symbol (âœ“) is used denote that context history functionality
    is facilitated and employed by the project. 10) Knowledge Management This functionality
    is broader than any others. Most of the tasks that are performed by IoT middleware
    solutions require knowledge in different perspectives, such as knowledge on sensors,
    domains, users, activities, and many more. One of the most popular techniques
    to represent knowledge in context-aware computing is using ontologies. However,
    several other techniques are also available such as rules. Knowledge can be used
    for tasks such as automated configuration of sensors to IoT middleware, automatic
    sensor data annotation, reasoning, and event detection. The symbol (✓) is used
    to denote that knowledge management functionality is facilitated and employed
    by the project in some perspective. 11) Event Detection This is one of the most
    important functionalities in IoT solutions. IoT envisions machine-to-machine (M2M)
    and machine-to-person communication. Most of these interactions are likely to
    occur based on an event. Events can referred to many things, such as an observable
    occurrence, phenomenon, or an extraordinary occurrence. We define one or more
    conditions and identify it as an occurrence of an event once all the defined conditions
    are satisfied. In the IoT, sensors collect data and compare it with conditions
    to decide whether the data satisfies the conditions. An occurrence event is also
    called a event trigger. Once an event has been triggered, a notification or action
    may be executed. For example, detecting current activity of a person or detecting
    a meeting status in a room, can be considered as events. Mostly, event detection
    needs to be done in real-time. However, events such as trends may be detected
    using historic data. The symbol (✓) is used to denote that event detection functionality
    is facilitated and employed by the project in some perspective. 12) Context Discovery
    and Annotation We use the following abbreviations to denote context discovery
    and annotation facilitated and employed by the project: context discovery (D)
    and context annotation (A). Context annotation allows context related information
    and raw sensors data to be attached, modelled, and stored. Some of the most common
    and basic information that needs to be captured in relation to context are context
    type, context value, time stamp, source, and confidence. Context-aware geographical
    information retrieval approach [162] has proposed a mechanism to map raw sensor
    data to semantic ontologies using SWRL. This is critical in all types of systems.
    Even though, statistical reasoning systems can use raw sensor data directly, semantic
    mapping before the reasoning allows more information to be extracted. Context
    information only becomes meaningful when it is interpreted with respect to the
    user. This can be achieved by knowledge base integration and reasoning using ontologies.
    Another application is discussed in [161]. Ontologies and other context modelling
    techniques allow structure data to be more meaningful which express relationships
    among data. End-users in the IoT paradigm are more interested in high-level information
    compared to low-level raw sensor data [50]. The following examples explain the
    difference between high-level information and low-level raw sensor data. It is
    raining (high-level information) can be derived from humidity is 80% (low-level
    sensor data). Further, high-level sensor data can be explained as semantic information
    as it provides more meaning to the end users. Challenges of semantic sensor webs
    are identified and discussed in [187]. This is the most common form of discovery.
    13) Level of Context Awareness Context-awareness can be employed at two levels:
    low (hardware) level and high (software) level. At the hardware level, context-awareness
    is used to facilitate tasks such as efficient routing, modelling, reasoning, storage
    and event detection (considering energy consumption and availability) [188]. At
    the hardware level, data and knowledge available for decision making is less.
    Further, sensors are resource constraint devices, so complex processing cannot
    be performed at the hardware level. However, applying context-aware technologies
    in the hardware level allows resources to be saved, such as network communication
    costs by preliminary filtering. The software level has access to a broader range
    of data and knowledge as well as more resources, which enables more complex reasoning
    to be performed. We use the following abbreviations to denote the level of context
    awareness facilitated and employed by the project: high level (H) and low level
    (L). 14) Security and Privacy This is a major concern in context-aware computing
    in all paradigms. However, the IoT paradigm will intensify the challenges in security
    and privacy. In the IoT, sensors are expected to collect more information about
    users (i.e. people) in all aspects. This includes both physical and conceptual
    data, such as location, preferences, calendar data, and medical information to
    name a few. As a result, utmost care needs to be taken when collecting, modelling,
    reasoning, and with persistent storage. Security and privacy need to be handled
    at different levels in the IoT. At the lowest level, the hardware layer should
    ensure security and privacy during collecting and temporary storage within the
    device. Secure protocols need to ensure communication is well protected. Once
    the data is received, application level protection needs to be in placed to monitor
    and control who can see or use context and so on. Different projects use different
    techniques such as policies, rules, and profiles to provide security and privacy.
    The symbol (✓) denoted the presence of security and privacy related functionality
    in the project, in some form. 15) Data Source Support There are different sources
    that are capable of providing context. Broadly we call them sensors. We discussed
    different types of sensors in Section III. Based on the popularity of the data
    sources supported by each solution, we selected the following classification.
    (P) denotes that the solution supports only physical sensors. Software sensors
    (S) denotes that the solution supports either virtual sensors, logical sensors
    or both. (A) denotes that the solution supports all kinds of data sources (i.e.
    physical, virtual, and logical). (M) denotes that the solution supports mobile
    devices. 16) Quality of Context We denote the presence of conflict resolution
    functionality using (C) and context validation functionality using (V). Conflict
    resolution is critical in the context management domain [189]. There has to be
    a consistency in collecting, aggregating, modelling, and reasoning. In the IoT
    paradigm, context may not be accurate. There are two reasons for context information
    not to be certain. First is that the sensor technology is not capable of producing
    100% accurate sensor data due to various technical and environmental challenges.
    Secondly, even with sensors that produce 100% accurate sensor data, reasoning
    models are not 100% accurate. In summary, problems in sensor technology and problems
    in reasoning techniques contribute to context conflicts. There are two types of
    context conflicts that can occurred and they are defined in [189]: Internal context
    conflict: Fusing two or more context elements that characterises the situation
    from different dimensions of the same observed entity in a given moment may lead
    to internal context conflict. (e.g. motion sensor detects that a user is in the
    kitchen and calendar shows that the user is supposed to be in a meeting. Therefore,
    it is unable to correctly deduce the current location by fusing two data sources:
    calendar and motion sensor.) External context conflicts: The context conflict/inconsistency
    that may occur between two or more bits of context that describe the situation
    of an observed entity from the same point of view. (e.g. two motion sensors located
    in the same area provide two completely different readings, where one sensor detects
    a person and other sensor detects three people.) Context validation ensures that
    collected data is correct and meaningful. Possible validations are checks for
    range, limit, logic, data type, cross-system consistency, uniqueness, cardinality,
    consistency, data source quality, security, and privacy. TABLE XII Summarized
    Taxonomy Used in Table XIII 17) Data Processing We denote the presence of context
    aggregation functionality using (A) and context filter functionality using (F).
    Aggregation can be explained in different ways; for example, Context Toolkit [72]
    has a dedicated component called context aggregator to collect data related to
    a specific entity (e.g. person) from different context sources and act as a proxy
    to context applications. They do not perform any complex operations; just collect
    similar information together. This is one of the simplest forms of aggregation
    of context. Context filter functionality makes sure the reasoning engine processes
    only important data. Specially in IoT, processing all the data collected by all
    the sensors is not possible due to scale. Therefore, IoT solutions should process
    only selected amounts of data that allows it to understand context accurately.
    Filtering functionality can be presented in different solutions in different forms:
    filter data, filter context sources, or filter events. Filtering helps both at
    the low (hardware) level and software level. At the hardware level, it helps to
    reduce the network communication cost by transmitting only important data. At
    the high-level, filtering can save process energy by only processing important
    data. Context processing can be classified into three categories (also called
    layers) [11]. Typical methods and techniques used in each layer are also presented
    as follows: Activity and context recognition layer: Feature extraction, classification,
    clustering, fuzzy rules Context and representation layer: Conceptual models, logic
    programming, ontology based representation and reasoning, databases and query
    languages, rule based representation and reasoning, cased based representation
    and reasoning, representing uncertainty, procedural programming Application and
    adaptation layer: Rules, query languages, procedural programming Data fusion,
    which is also considered a data processing technique, is critical in understanding
    sensor data. In order to lay a solid foundation to our discussion, we adopt the
    definition provided by Hall and Llinas [149] on sensor data fusion. “Sensor data
    fusion is a method of combining sensor data from multiple sensors to produce more
    accurate, more complete, and more dependable information that could not be possible
    to achieve through a single sensor [149].“ For example, in positioning, GPS does
    not work indoors. In contrast, there are a variety of other indoor positioning
    schemes that can be used. Therefore, in order to continuously track the positioning
    regardless of indoor or outdoor, sensor data fusion is essential [78]. Data fusion
    methods, models, and classification techniques in the wireless sensor networks
    domain are comprehensively surveyed in [190]. In order to identify context, it
    is possible to combine data from different data sources. For example, consider
    a situation where we want to identify the location of a user. The possible sources
    that can be used to collect evidence regarding the location are GPS sensors, motion
    sensor, calendar, email, social networking services, chat clients, ambient sound
    (sound level, pattern), users nearby, camera sensors, etc. This long list shows
    the possible alternatives. It is always a tradeoff between required resource (e.g.
    processing power, response time) and accuracy. Processing and combining all the
    above sensor readings would produce a more accurate result; however, it would
    require more resources and time. There is a significant gap between low-level
    sensor readings and high-level ‘situation-awareness’ [123]. Collecting low-level
    sensor data is becoming significantly easier and cheaper than ever due to advances
    in sensing technology. As a result, enormous amounts of sensor data (e.g. big
    data [5]) is available. In order to understand big data, a variety of different
    reasoning techniques need to employed as we discussed in Section IV-C. 18) Dynamic
    Composition As explained in Solar [184], IoT solutions must have a programming
    model that allows dynamic composition without requiring the developer or user
    to identify specific sensors and devices. Dynamic organising is critical in environments
    like the IoT, because it is impossible to identify or plan possible interaction
    at the development stage. Software solutions should be able to understand the
    requirements and demands on each situation, then organise and structure its internal
    components according to them. Components such as reasoning models, data fusion
    operators, knowledge bases, and context discovery components can be dynamically
    composed according to the needs. The symbol (✓) denoted the presence of dynamic
    composition functionality in the project in some form. 19) Real Time Processing
    Most of the interactions are expected to be processed in real time in the IoT.
    This functionality has been rarely addressed by the research community in the
    context-aware computing domain. The most important real time processing task is
    event detection as we explained in Section V-A11. However, context reasoning,
    and query processing can also be considered as essential real time processing
    tasks. Real time processing solutions are focused on processing faster than traditional
    methods, which allows sensor stream data processing [211]. The symbol (✓) denoted
    the presence of real time processing functionality in some form. 20) Registry
    Maintenance and Lookup Services We use the (✓) symbol to denote the presence of
    registry maintenance and lookup services functionality in the project. This functionality
    allows different components such as context sources, data fusion operators, knowledge
    bases, and context consumers to be registered. This functionality is also closely
    related to dynamic composition where it needs to select relevant and matching
    components to be composed together. Registries need to be updated to reflect (dis)appearing
    components. B. Evaluation of Research Efforts Context Toolkit [72] aims to facilitating
    development and deployment of context-aware applications. This is one of the earliest
    efforts of providing framework support for context-aware application development.
    Context Toolkit contains a combination of features and abstractions to support
    context-aware application developers. It introduces three main abstractions: context
    widget (to retrieve data from sensors), context interpreter (to reason sensor
    data using different reasoning techniques), and context aggregator. The research
    around Context Toolkit is still active and a number of extensions have been developed
    to enhance its context-aware capabilities. Enactor [217] provides a context decision
    modelling facility to the Context Toolkit. Further, the Intelligibility Toolkit
    [108] extends the Enactor framework by supporting more decision models for context
    reasoning. Context Toolkit identifies the common features required by context-aware
    applications as capture and access of context, storage, distribution, and independent
    execution from applications. Aura [191] is a task oriented system based on distributed
    architecture which focuses on different computational devices used by human users
    every day. The objective is to run a set of applications called personal aura
    in all devices in order to manage user tasks in a context-aware fashion across
    all the devices smoothly. Aura addresses two major challenges. First, aura allows
    a user to preserve continuity in his/her work when moving between different environments.
    Second, it is capable of adapting to the on-going computation of a particular
    environment in the presence of dynamic resource variability. Aura consists of
    four major components: context observer (collects context and send it to task
    and environment managers), task manager (also called prism, four different kinds
    of changes: user moves to another environment, environment, task, and context),
    environment manager (handles context suppliers and related service), and context
    suppliers (provides context information). XML based markup schemes are used to
    describe services ‥ CARISMA [193] (Context-Aware Reflective middleware System
    for Mobile Applications) is focused on mobile systems where they are extremely
    dynamic. Adaptation (also called reflection) is the main focus of CARISMA. context
    is stored as application profiles (XML based), which allows each application to
    maintain meta-data under two categories: passive and active. The passive category
    defines actions that middleware would take when specific events occur using rules,
    such as shutting down if battery is low. However, conflicts could arise when two
    profiles defines rules that conflict each other. The active category allows relationships
    to be maintained between services used by the application, the policies, and context
    configurations. This information tells how to behave under different environmental
    and user conditions. A conflict resolution mechanism is also introduced in CARISMA
    based on macroeconomic techniques. An auction protocol is used to handle the resolution
    as they support greater degrees of heterogeneity over other alternatives. In simple
    terms, rules are used in auctions with different constraints imposed on the bidding
    by different agents (also called applications). Final decisions are made in order
    to maximise the social welfare among the agents. CoBrA [119] (Context Broker Architecture)
    is a broker-centric agent architecture that provides knowledge sharing and context
    reasoning for smart spaces. It is specially focused on smart meeting places. CoBrA
    addresses two major issues: supporting resource-limited mobile computing devices
    and addressing concerns over user privacy. Context information is modelled using
    OWL ontologies. Context brokers are the main elements of CoBrA. A context broker
    comprises the following four functional components: context knowledge base (provides
    persistent storage for context information), context reasoning engine (performs
    reasoning over context information stored in storage), context acquisition module
    (retrieve context from context sources), and policy management module (manages
    policies, such as who has access to what data). Even though the architecture is
    centralised, several brokers can work together through a broker federation. Context
    knowledge is represented in Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples using
    Jena. Gaia [168] is a distributed context infrastructure uncertainty based reasoning.
    Ontologies are used to represented context information. Gaia has employed a Prolog
    based probabilistic reasoning framework. The architecture of Gaia consists of
    six key components: context provider (data acquisition from sensors or other data
    sources), context consumer (different parties who are interest in context), context
    synthesiser (generate high-level context information using raw low-level context),
    context provider lookup service (maintains a detailed registry of context providers
    so the appropriate context providers can be found based on their capabilities
    when required), context history service (stores history of context), and ontology
    server (maintains different ontologies). SOCAM [194] (Service Oriented Context-Aware
    Middleware) is an ontology based context-aware middleware. It separates the ontologies
    into two levels: upper level ontology for general concepts and lower level ontologies
    domain specific descriptions. SOCAM architecture comprises several key components:
    context provider (acquires data from sensors and other internal and external data
    sources and converts the context in to OWL representation), context interpreter
    (performs reasoning using reasoning engine and stores the processed context information
    in the knowledge base), context-aware services (context consumers), and services
    locating service (context providers and interpreter are allowed to register so
    other components can search for appropriates providers and interpreters based
    on their capabilities). TABLE XIII Evaluation of Surveyed Research Prototypes,
    Systems, and Approaches e-SENSE [44] enables ambient intelligence using wireless
    multi-sensor networks for making context-rich information available to applications
    and services. e-SENSE combines body sensor networks (BSN), object sensor networks
    (OSN), and environment sensor networks (ESN) to capture context in the IoT paradigm.
    The features required by context-aware IoT middleware solutions are identified
    as sensor data capturing, data pre-filtering, context abstraction data source
    integration, context extraction, rule engine, and adaptation. HCoM [198] (Hybrid
    Context Management) is a hybrid approach which combines semantic ontology and
    relational schemas. This approach claims that standard database management systems
    alone cannot be used to manage context. In contrast, semantic ontologies may not
    perform well in terms of efficiency and query processing with large volumes of
    data. So the hybrid approach is required. HCoM architecture consists of five layers:
    acquisition layer, pre-processing layer, data modelling and storage layer, management
    modelling layer, and utilising layer. HCoM has identified several key requirements
    that a context management solution should have that are encapsulated in several
    components: context manager (aggregates the results and sends the data to reasoning
    engine), collaboration manager (if context selector decides the existing context
    information is not sufficient to perform reasoning, the collaboration manager
    attempts to gather more data from other possible context sources), context filter
    (once the context is received, it validates and decide whether it needs to be
    stored in RCDB), context selector (based on the user request, it decides what
    context should be used in reasoning processing based on the accuracy, time, and
    required computational resources), context-onto (manages the ontologies and acts
    as a repository), rules and policy (users are allowed to add rules to the system),
    RCDB (stores the captured context in a standard database management system), rule-mining
    (a data base that consists of rules that tell what actions to perform when), and
    interfaces (provides interface to the context consumers). MoCA [199] is a service
    based distributed middleware that employs ontologies to model and manage context.
    The primary conceptual component is context domain. The context management node
    (CMN) is infrastructure that is responsible for managing the context domain. Similar
    to most of the other context management solutions, the three key components in
    MoCA are: context providers (responsible for generating or retrieving context
    from other sources available to be used by the context management system), context
    consumers (consume the context gathered and processed by the system), and context
    service (responsible for receiving, storing, and disseminating context information).
    MoCA uses an object oriented model for context handling, instead of an ontology-based
    model due to the weaknesses posed by ontologies in terms of scalability and performance.
    XML is used to model context. The XML files are fed into the context tool in order
    to check validation. Then the program codes are generated automatically to acquire
    data. These program codes will acquire context and insert the data into context
    repositories. CaSP [185] (Context-aware Service Platform) is a context gathering
    framework for mobile solutions based on middleware architecture. The platform
    provides six different functionalities: context sensing, context modelling, context
    association, context storage, and retrieval. The paper also provides a comprehensive
    evaluation of existing context sensing solutions. CaSP consists of typical context
    management components which handle the mentioned functionalities. SIM [200] (Sensor
    Information Management) is focused on the smart home domain which addresses location
    tracking. SIM uses an agent based architecture according to the standard specifications
    provided in Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents. Its emphasis is on collecting
    sensor data from multiple sources and aggregating them together to analyse and
    derive more accurate information. SIM collects two types of information: node
    level and attribute level. In node level, node ID, location, and priority are
    collected. Attributes are stored in attribute information base comprising attribute
    and the corresponding measurement. A location tracking algorithm has been introduced
    using a mobile positioning device. A position manager handles tracking. SIM has
    the capability to resolve conflicts in sensor information based on sensor priority.
    Conflict resolution is handled by a context manager with the help of aggregation,
    classification, and decision components. Even though SIM is not focused on hardware
    level context management, the approach is closer to low-level instead of high-level
    compared to other projects. COSMOS [201] is middleware that enables the processing
    of context information in ubiquitous environments. COSMOS consists of three layers:
    context collector (collects information from the sensors), context processing
    (derives high level information from raw sensor data), and context adaptation
    (provides access to the processed context for the applications). In contrast to
    the other context solutions, the components of COSMOS are context nodes. In COSMOS,
    each piece of context information is defined as a context node. COSMOS can support
    any number of context nodes which are organised into hierarchies. Context node
    is an independently operated module that consists of its own activity manager,
    context processor, context reasoner, context configurator, and message managers.
    Therefore, COSMOS follows distributed architecture which increases the scalability
    of the middleware. DMS-CA [202] (Data Management System-Context Architecture)
    is based on smart building domain. XML is used to define rules, contexts, and
    services. Further, an event driven rule checking technique is used to reason context.
    Rules can be configured by mobile devices and push them to the server to be used
    by the rule checking engine. Providing a mobile interface to build rules and queries
    is important in a dynamic and mobile environment such as the IoT. ACoMS [88] (Autonomic
    Context Management System) can dynamically configure and reconfigure its context
    information acquisition and pre-processing functionality to perform fault tolerant
    provisioning of context information. ACoMS architecture comprises application
    context subscription manager stores (manages context information requests from
    the applications using a subscribe mechanism), context source manager (performs
    actions such as low-level communication with context sources, context source discovery,
    registration, and configuration), and reconfiguration manager (performs monitoring
    tasks such as mapping context sources to context information). CROCO [118] (CROss
    application COntext management) is an ontology based context modelling and management
    service. CROCO identifies several requirements to be a cross application, such
    as application plug-in capability. CROCO has three responsibilities where they
    are distributed among three separate layers: data management (perform operations
    such as storing inferred data for historic use, develop and maintain fact database),
    consistency checking and reasoning (consistency manager is responsible for checking
    the consistency, such as data types, and cardinality when sensor data arrives
    before it is feed in to reasoning or storage; reasoning manager performs reasoning
    based on the facts stored in the fact data base), and context update and provision
    (allows context consumers to register themselves, retrieve context from context
    sources, and provide query interface to the consumers). EMoCASN [205] (Environment
    Monitoring Oriented Context Aware Sensor Networks) proposes a context-aware model
    for sensor networks (CASN). This modelling approach is narrowly focused on managing
    sensor networks using low level context such as node context, task context, and
    data context. For example, CASN uses low level context such as remaining energy
    of a node, location of the sensor, and orientation of the sensor to decide energy
    efficient routing. Hydra 3 [61] is an IoT middleware that aims to integrate wireless
    devices and sensors into ambient intelligence systems. Hydra comprises a Context
    Aware Framework (CAF). CAF provides the capabilities of both high-level, powerful
    reasoning, based on the use of ontologies and lower-level semantic processing
    based on object-oriented/key-value approach. CAF consists of two main components:
    Data Acquisition Component (DAqC) and the Context Manager (CM). DAqC is responsible
    for connecting and retrieving data from sensors. CM is responsible for context
    management, context awareness, and context interpretation. A rule engine called
    Drools platform [218] has been employed as the core context reasoning mechanism.
    CAF models three distinct types of context: device contexts (e.g. data source),
    semantic contexts (e.g. location, environment, and entity), and application contexts
    (e.g. domain specific). Hydra identifies context reasoning rule engine, context
    storage, context querying, and event/action management as the key components of
    a context-aware framework. C-Cast [207] is middleware that integrates WSN into
    context-aware systems by addressing context acquisition, dissemination, representation,
    recognising, and reasoning about context and situations. C-Cast lays its architecture
    on four layers: sensor, context detection, context acquisition, and application.
    In C-Cast, context providers (CP) are the main components. Each context provider
    handles one task. For example, WeatherCP collects weather information and Address-bookCP
    collects related addresses. Any amount of CPs can be added to the system to extend
    the system wide functionality. Each context provider independently handles data
    acquisition, context processing (e.g. filter and aggregate context), context provider
    management (e.g. handles subscriptions), and context access and dissemination
    (e.g. handles queries). C-Cast claims that complex reasoning and intuitive reasoning
    can only be achieved by using rich representation models. In contrast, C-CAST
    avoids using ontologies to model context claiming ontologies are too resource
    intensive. SALES [210] (Scalable context-Aware middleware for mobiLe EnviromentS)
    is a context-aware middleware that achieves scalability in context dissemination.
    The main components of this middleware are nodes. These nodes are not sensor nodes
    but servers, computers, laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones. SALES consists of four
    types of nodes. XML schemes are used to store and transfer context. MidSen [52]
    is context-aware middleware for WSN. The system is based on Event-Condition-Action
    (ECA) rules. It highlights the importance of efficient event detection by processing
    two algorithms: event detection algorithm (EDA) and context-aware service discovery
    algorithm (CASDA). MidSen has proposed a complete architecture to enable context
    awareness in WSN. It consists of the following key components: knowledge manager,
    application notifiers, knowledge base, inference engine, working memory, application
    interface, and network interface. Feel@Home [212] is a context management framework
    that supports interaction between different domains. The proposed approach is
    demonstrated using three domains: smart home, smart office, and mobile. The context
    information is stored using OWL [146]. Feel@Home supports two different interactions:
    intra-domain and cross domain. The cross domain interaction is essential in the
    IoT paradigm. Further, this is one of the major differences between sensor networks
    and the IoT. Sensor networks usually only deal with one domain. However, IoT demands
    the capability of dealing with multiple domains. In addition, context management
    frameworks should not be limited to a specific number of domains. Feel@Home consists
    of three parts: user queries, global administration server (GAS), and domain context
    manager (DCM). User queries are first received by GAS. It decides what the relevant
    domain needs to be contacted to answer the user query. Then, GAS redirects the
    user query to the relevant domain context managers. Two components reside in GAS,
    context entry manager (CEM) and context entry engine (CEE), which performs the
    above task. DCM consists of typical context management components such as context
    wrapper (gathers context from sensors and other sources), context aggregator (triggers
    context reasoning), context reasoning, knowledge base (stores context), and several
    other components to manage user queries, publish/subscribe mechanism. The answers
    to the user query will return by using the same path as when received. CoMiHoc
    [213] (Context Middleware for ad-HoC network) is a middleware framework that supports
    context management and situation reasoning. CoMiHoc proposes a CoMoS (Context
    Mobile Spaces), a context modeling, and situation reasoning mechanism that extends
    the context spaces [219]. CoMiHoc uses Java Dempster-Shafer library [220]. CoMiHoc
    architecture comprises six components: context provisioner, request manager, situation
    reasoner, location reasoner, communication manager, and On-Demand Multicast Routing
    Protocol (ODMRP). ezContext [105] is a framework that provides automatic context
    life cycle management. ezContext comprises several components: context source
    (any source that provides context, either physical sensors, databases or web service),
    context provider (retrieves context from various sources whether in push (passive)
    or pull (active) method, context manager (manages context modelling, storage and
    producing high-level context using low-level context), context wrapper (encapsulate
    retrieved context into correct format, in this approach, key-value pairs), and
    providers'' registry (maintains list of context providers and their capabilities).
    JavaBeans are used as the main data format. Octopus [50] is an open-source, dynamically
    extensible system that supports data management and fusion for IoT applications.
    Octopus develops middleware abstractions and programming models for the IoT. It
    enables non-specialised developers to deploy sensors and applications without
    detailed knowledge of the underlying technologies and network. Octopus is focused
    on the smart home/office domain and its main component is solver. Solver is a
    module that performs sensor data fusion operations. Solvers can be added and removed
    from the system at any time based on requirements. Further solvers can be combined
    together dynamically to build complex operations. SECTION VI. Lessons Learned
    1) Development Aids and Practices Toolkits in general are suitable for limited
    scale application. Managing context in the IoT paradigm requires middleware solutions
    that can provide more functionality towards managing data. Applications should
    be able to be built on top of the middleware so they can request context from
    the middleware. Context Toolkit [72] has introduced the notion of having common
    standard interfaces. For example, context widget component encapsulate the communication
    between context sources and the toolkit. Standardisation makes it easier to learn,
    use, and extend the toolkit. Standardisation is important in the IoT paradigm,
    because it increases interoperability and extendibility. For example, standardising
    context modelling components will help to employ the different techniques we discussed
    in Section IV-B despite the differences in inner-workings. It also enables the
    addition of different components when necessary. In such a situation, standard
    interfaces and structures will guarantee a smooth interaction between new and
    old components. Further, Intelligibility Toolkit [108] provides explanations to
    the users to improve the trust between users and the context-aware applications
    which helps in faster adaptation of the users towards IoT. Making correct design
    decisions is a critical task in IoT. For example, data modelling and communication
    can be done using different techniques as follows where each method has its own
    advantages and disadvantages [184]. 1) Binary is smaller in size than the other
    three formats and also portable due to its small size. In contrast, binary makes
    it difficult to extend and modify later. 2) Objects method allows complex data
    structures. 3) Attribute-value pairs method provides more limited complexity than
    an object representation. In contrast, simpler representation allows language-and
    platform-independent applications. 4) XML method provides more opportunities for
    complex data structures. XML adds a substantial overhead in term of network communications
    and processing. CoOL [192] shows how extensions (e.g. context modelling and reasoning)
    can be developed to support general purpose service models. CoOL allows context
    management functionality to be added to any model using context management access
    point, which is responsible for handle communication between CoOL and the rest
    of the general purpose architecture. Security and privacy issues in context-aware
    computing are not researched and seriously considered in many solutions. CoBrA
    [119] shows how an ontology based approach can be used to manage user privacy
    via policies which allow it to monitor and access contextual control context.
    As ontologies are getting popular and adopted in web related developments, such
    practice will makes IoT development much easier. Octopus [50] highlights the significance
    of designing programming models that enable non-technical people to deploy sensors.
    As we mentioned earlier, the majority of the sensor deployments are expected to
    be carried out by non-technical users. Kim and Choi [204] models context meta-data
    from an operational perspective as discussed in Section III-C, which allows it
    to understand operational parameters such as complexities, quality, up-to-dateness,
    and cost of acquisition. 2) Mobility, Validity, and Sharing Monitoring continuity,
    which is also called mobility, is an important task in the IoT. People move from
    one situation to another and IoT solutions need to track user movements and facilitate
    context-aware functionalities over different forms of devices. Aura [191] shows
    the requirement of having IoT middleware running over many platforms and devices
    under different resource limitations (i.e. from cloud server, computers, tablets,
    mobile phones to everyday objects) where different versions (with different capabilities)
    would fit on different devices. CARISMA [193] shows how conflict resolution can
    be done using profiles and rules where it stress the importance of making decisions
    to optimize the return for every party involved. In the IoT, there will be many
    data sources that will provide similar information that can be used to derive
    the same knowledge where conflict resolution will help to make accurate actions.
    MoCA [199] also emphasizes validation of context which has an impact on the accuracy
    of the reasoning. Further, it shows how context can be modelled in formats such
    as XML and then inserted into any programming language via binding techniques
    (e.g. data binding in Java). In CROCO [118], validation (e.g. consistency), conflict
    resolution, and privacy concerns are given attention where they are rarely addressed
    by many other solutions. Sharing context information allows mobility and smooth
    transition from device to device or situation to situation. Park et al. [153]
    highlight the importance of context sharing using mobile devices, which allows
    more comprehensive and accurate reasoning and high level context recognition.
    3) On Demand Data Modelling Due to unpredictability and broadness of IoT, data
    models need to be extensible on demand. For example, IoT solutions may need to
    be expand its knowledge-base towards different domains. SOCAM [194] shows how
    knowledge can be separated among different levels of ontologies: upper ontology
    and domain specific ontology. In SOCAM, upper ontology models general purpose
    data while domain specific ontologies model domain specific data, which is allowed
    to extend to both levels independently. As an IoT solution will be used in many
    different domains, the ability to add ontologies (i.e. knowledge) when necessary
    is critical for wider adaptation. SCK [142], Zhan et al. [208], and BIONETS [197]
    use different ontologies for each context category. As we discussed in Section
    III-C, there are many different types of context categories which model context
    in different perspectives. Therefore, in the IoT it is important to store different
    types of context as they can help in a variety of situations. They also stresses
    the requirement of having domain specific and domain independent ontologies. 4)
    Hybrid Reasoning Gaia [168], Ko and Sim [141], CDMS [203], and HCoM [198] highlight
    the importance of employing multiple reasoning techniques such as Bayesian networks,
    probabilistic and fuzzy logic, where each technique performs well in different
    situations. Incorporation of multiple modelling and reasoning techniques can mitigate
    individual weaknesses using each other''s strengths. COSAR [151] combines statistical
    reasoning and ontological reasoning techniques to achieve more accurate results.
    5) Hardware Layer Support EMoCASN [205], TRAIL-BLAZER [196] and CASN [188] shows
    the importance of embedding context-aware capabilities in low (hardware) layer
    communication. Context awareness allows sensors to act more intelligently and
    save energy. In the IoT a majority of the communications are expected to happened
    between machines. In such situations, context awareness becomes critical for each
    individual object to optimize their actions. Further, in order to build a fully
    context-aware solution, we have to embed context-aware capabilities in both software
    and hardware layers. In an environment such as the IoT where billions of objects
    communicate with each other, significant amounts of energy can be saved by following
    fairly simple optimisation techniques as presented in PROCON [86]. SALES [210]
    shows how context can be managed using distributed architecture with a variety
    of different devices with different resource constraints in the hardware level.
    6) Dynamic Configuration and Extensions Hydra [61] is one of the early efforts
    at building IoT middleware which focuses on connecting embedded devices to applications.
    It shows how the context modelling needs to be done in order to model device information.
    Hydra also highlights the importance of pluggable rules that allow insertions
    when necessary as it is a major requirement in IoT middleware applications, where
    domains and required knowledge cannot be predicted during the development stage.
    A complementary technology has proposed by ACoMS [88]. It has proposed a technique
    that allows it to automatically connect sensors to an IoT solution using Transducer
    Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) [221] and Sensor Markup Languages (SensorML) [133].
    UPnP FRAMEWORK [206] is strongly related to a vision of the IoT where machine-to-machine
    communication play a significant role. This approach is applicable to devices
    such as cameras, web cams, and microwaves; but, not for low end temperature or
    humidity sensors. UPnP approach is a key technology that enables automated configuration.
    Solar [184], CMF (MAGNET) [85], and COSMOS [201] promote the notion of dynamic
    composition which is critical in IoT solutions where possible interactions cannot
    be identified at the design and development stage. ezContext [105] shares a common
    notion of context providers similar to C-Cast [207] uses them to decouple context
    sources from the system. Different types of context providers, which are dedicated
    to communicating and retrieving data related to a specific domain, can be employed
    when necessary. In line with above solutions, COPAL [215] demonstrates the essential
    features IoT middleware should have, such as loosely coupled plug-in architecture
    and automated code generation via abstracts which stimulates extendibility and
    usability. 7) Distributed Processing This is a one of the most commons tasks need
    to be performed by IoT solutions. UbiQuSE [214] shows how real time query processing
    can be done incorporating live streaming data and historic context in repositories.
    Similarly, SCONSTREAM [211] highlights the challenges in real-time context stream
    processing where real time processing is a significant component to be successful
    in the IoT. Most event detections need to be performed in real time. Further,
    Feel@Home [212] shows how cross domain context can be queried in order to answer
    complex user requirements. As we mentioned earlier, there is not a central point
    of management in the IoT paradigm. Therefore communicating, sharing, and querying
    context managed in a distributed fashion by different managers is essential. 8)
    Other Aspects CARS [195] introduces a technique that can be used to evaluate,
    test, and improve IoT solutions in social and user point of view. As we mentioned
    earlier, success of IoT depends on the user adaptation. CARS evaluates the process
    of deriving high level information using low level sensor data where users will
    appreciate the work done by the software systems. Cloud computing offers significant
    amounts of processing and storage capabilities. With the three services models,
    Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service
    (SaaS), context management can largely benefit from cloud computing in many ways
    in the IoT paradigm. In the IoT, sensors will be attached to almost every object
    around us. Further, these sensors will be deployed by ordinary users, governments,
    or business organisations. Cloud computing allows all parties to share sensor
    data based on a financial model. Sensor owners will advertise their sensors in
    the cloud. The consumers who want to access those sensors will pay the owners
    and acquire the sensor readings. Therefore, the cloud model perfectly matches
    with the IoT paradigm. In addition, cloud resources can be used to reason and
    store large volumes of context where significant amounts of processing power and
    storage are required. The cloud brings added scalability to context management
    in the IoT. Further, interoperability among different IoT solution can be achieved
    by following approaches such as CDA [209]. Data matching is the process to identify
    and matching records in diverse database that refer to the same real-world entities
    in situations where no entity identifiers are available, and therefore the available
    attributes have to be used to conduct the matching [222]. Context information
    plays a critical in data matching where sensors can be considered as entities
    in the sensing as a service model [5]. SECTION VII. Challenges and Future Research
    Directions As we mentioned earlier, one of our goal in this survey is to understand
    how context-aware computing can be applied in the IoT paradigm based on past experience.
    Specifically, we evaluated fifty context-aware projects and highlighted the lessons
    we can learn from them in the IoT perspective. In this section our objective is
    to discuss six unique challenges in the IoT where novel techniques and solution
    may need to be employed. 1) Automated configuration of sensors In traditional
    pervasive/ubiquitous computing, we connect only a limited number of sensors to
    the applications (e.g. smart farm, smart home). In contrast, the IoT envisions
    billions of sensors to be connected together over the Internet. As a result, a
    unique challenge would arise on connection and configuration of sensors to applications.
    Due to the scale, it is not feasible to connect sensors manually to an application
    or to a middleware [223]. There has to be an automated or at least semi-automated
    process to connect sensors to applications. In order to accomplish this task,
    applications should be able to understand the sensors (e.g. sensors'' capabilities,
    data structures they produce, hardware/driver level configuration details). Recent
    developments such as Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) [221], Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement related standards such as Sensor Markup
    Languages (SensorML) [133], sensor ontologies [143], and immature but promising
    efforts such as Sensor Device Definitions [224] show future directions to carry
    out the research work further, in order to tackle this challenge. 2) Context discovery
    Once we connect sensors to a software solution, as mentioned above, there has
    to be a method to understand the sensor data produced by the sensors and the related
    context automatically. We discussed context categorisation techniques comprehensively
    in Section III-C. There are many types of context that can be used to enrich sensor
    data. However, understanding sensor data and appropriately annotating it automatically
    in a paradigm such as the IoT, where application domains vary widely, is a challenging
    task. Recent developments in semantic technologies [135], [143], [225] and linked
    data [226], [227] show future directions to carry out further research work. Semantic
    technology is popularly used to encode domain knowledge. 3) Acquisition, modelling,
    reasoning, and distribution After analysing acquisition, modelling, and reasoning
    in different perspectives, it is evident that no single technique would serve
    the requirements of the IoT. Incorporating and integrating multiple techniques
    has shown promising success in the field. Some of the early work such as [12],
    [183] have discussed the process in detail. However, due to the immaturity of
    the field of IoT, it is difficult to predict when and where to employ each technique.
    Therefore, it is important to define and follow a standard specification so different
    techniques can be added to the solutions without significant effort. Several design
    principles have been proposed by [72], [108] as a step towards standardisation
    of components and techniques. The inner-workings of each technique can be different
    from one solution to another. However, common standard interfaces will insure
    the interoperability among techniques. 4) Selection of sensors in sensing-as-a-service
    model This is going to be one of the toughest challenges in the IoT. It is clear
    that we are going to have access to billions of sensors. In such an environment,
    there could be many different alternative sensors to be used. For example, let
    us consider a situation where an environmental scientist wants to measure environmental
    pollution in New York city. There are two main problems: (1) ‘what sensors provide
    information about pollution?’ [228] (2) when there are multiple sensors that can
    measure the same parameter (e.g. pH concentration in a lake), ‘what sensor should
    be used?’ [229] In order to answer question (1), domain knowledge needs to be
    incorporate with the IoT solution. Manually selecting the sensors that will provide
    information about environmental pollution is not feasible in the IoT due to its
    scale. In order to answer question (2), quality frameworks need to be defined
    and employed. Such a framework should be able to rank the sensors based on factors
    such as accuracy, relevancy, user feedback, reliability, cost, and completeness.
    Similar challenges have been addressed in the web service domain during the last
    decade [230], [231] where we can learn from those efforts. 5) Security, privacy,
    and trust This has been a challenge for context-aware computing since the beginning.
    The advantage of context is that it provides more meaningful information that
    will help us understand a situation or data. At the same time, it increases the
    security threats due to possible misuse of the context (e.g. identity, location,
    activity, and behaviour). However, the IoT will increase this challenge significantly.
    Even though security and privacy issues are addressed at the context-aware application
    level, it is largely unattended at the context-aware middleware level. In the
    IoT, security and privacy need to be protected in several layers: sensor hardware
    layer, sensor data communication (protocol) layer, context annotation and context
    discovery layer, context modelling layer, and the context distribution layer.
    IoT is a community based approach where the acceptance of the users (e.g. general
    public) is essential. Therefore, security and privacy protection requirements
    need to be carefully addressed in order to win the trust of the users. 6) Context
    sharing This is largely neglected in the context-aware middleware domain. Most
    of the middleware solutions or architectures are designed to facilitate applications
    in isolated factions. Inter-middleware communication is not considered to be a
    critical requirement. However, in the IoT, there would be no central point of
    control. Different middleware solutions developed by different parties will be
    employed to connect to sensors, collect, model, and reason context. Therefore,
    sharing context information between different kinds of middleware solutions or
    different instances of the same middleware solution is important. Sensor data
    stream processing middleware solutions such as GSN [67] have employed this capability
    to share sensor data among different instances (e.g. installed and configured
    in different computers and locations) where context is not the focus. However,
    in contrast to sensor data, context information has strong relationships between
    each other (e.g. context modelled using RDF). Therefore, relationship models also
    need to be transferred and shared among different solutions, which enables the
    receiver to understand and model the context accurately at the receivers end.

    and systems); Conceptual framework (value added features that need to be supported
    by ideal context-aware IoT middleware solution) Show All SECTION VIII. Conclusions
    The IoT has gained significant attention over the last few years. With the advances
    in sensor hardware technology and cheap materials, sensors are expected to be
    attached to all the objects around us, so these can communicate with each other
    with minimum human intervention. Understanding sensor data is one of the main
    challenges that the IoT would face. This vision has been supported and heavily
    invested by governments, interest groups, companies, and research institutes.
    For example, context awareness has been identified as an important IoT research
    need by the Cluster of European Research Projects on the IoT (CERP-IoT) [21] funded
    by the European Union. The EU has allocated a time frame for research and development
    into context-aware computing focused on the IoT to be carried out during 2015–2020.
    In this survey paper, we analysed and evaluated context-aware computing research
    efforts to understand how the challenges in the field of context-aware computing
    have been tackled in desktop, web, mobile, sensor networks, and pervasive computing
    paradigms. A large number of solutions exist in terms of systems, middleware,
    applications, techniques, and models proposed by researchers to solve different
    challenges in context-aware computing. We also discussed some of the trends in
    the field that were identified during the survey. The results clearly show the
    importance of context awareness in the IoT paradigm. Our ultimate goal is to build
    a foundation that helps us to understand what has happened in the past so we can
    plan for the future more efficiently and effectively. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Authors

    1997 PDF Split View Cite Permissions Share Abstract The FlowMetrixTM System is
    a multiplexed data acquisition and analysis platform for flow cytometric analysis
    of microsphere-based assays that performs simultaneous measurement of up to 64
    different analytes. The system consists of 64 distinct sets of fluorescent microspheres
    and a standard benchtop flow cytometer interfaced with a personal computer containing
    a digital signal processing board and Windows95®-based software. Individual sets
    of microspheres can be modified with reactive components such as antigens, antibodies,
    or oligonucleotides, and then mixed to form a multiplexed assay set. The digital
    signal-processing hardware and Windows95-based software provide complete control
    of the flow cytometer and perform real-time data processing, allowing multiple
    independent reactions to be analyzed simultaneously. The system has been used
    to perform qualitative and quantitative immunoassays for multiple serum proteins
    in both capture and competitive inhibition assay formats. The system has also
    been used to perform DNA sequence analysis by multiplexed competitive hybridization
    with 16 different sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. Issue Section: Oak
    Ridge Conference The first use of flow cytometry for analysis of microsphere-based
    immunoassays was published in 1977 (1), and recently reviewed by McHugh (2). Because
    a flow cytometer has the ability to discriminate different particles on the basis
    of size or color, the possibility of multiplexed analysis with different microsphere
    populations is suggested. Multiplexed analysis is the ability to perform multiple
    discrete assays in a single tube with the same sample at the same time. The use
    of different-sized microspheres for simultaneous analysis of different analytes
    was originally proposed by Horan et al. (3). Two distinct sizes of microspheres
    were used for simultaneous detection of two different antibodies by flow cytometry,
    and subsequently expanded to the use of four different sizes of microspheres to
    detect four different specificities of anti-HIV antibodies (4)(5). Size discrimination
    of microspheres allows simultaneous detection of small numbers of analytes, but
    the inability to distinguish aggregates of smaller microspheres from larger microspheres
    severely limits the extent of multiplexing that can be achieved. In contrast,
    differential dyeing of identically sized microspheres with two different dyes,
    emitting in two different wavelengths, allows aggregates to be distinguished and
    permits discrimination of at least 64 different sets of microspheres. The FlowMetrixTM
    system (Luminex Corp.) performs multiplexed analysis of up to 64 different reactions
    simultaneously by using a flow cytometer and digital signal processor to perform
    real-time analysis of multiple microsphere-based assays. The three major components
    of the system are a benchtop flow cytometer, microspheres, and computer hardware
    and software. The flow cytometer analyzes individual microspheres by size and
    fluorescence, distinguishing three fluorescent colors—green (530 nm), orange (585
    nm), and red (>650 nm)—simultaneously. Microsphere size, determined by 90-degree
    light scatter, is used to eliminate microsphere aggregates from the analysis.
    Orange and red fluorescence are used for microsphere classification, and green
    fluorescence is used for analyte measurement. The FlowMetrix system is currently
    configured for the Becton Dickinson FACScan®, a multiparameter flow cytometer
    that is based on a single 488-nm excitation laser (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry
    Systems). Microspheres serve as the vehicles for molecular reactions. The microspheres
    are 5.5-μm polystyrene microspheres that bear carboxylate functional groups on
    the surface. The microspheres are available in 64 distinct sets that are classified
    by the flow cytometer by virtue of the unique orange/red emission profile of each
    set as shown in Fig. 1 . The microspheres can be covalently coupled to virtually
    any amine-containing “target” molecule through surface carboxylate groups; alternatively,
    avidin-coupled microspheres can be used for binding biotinylated molecules. Microspheres
    of this size provide sufficient surface area for covalent coupling of 1–2 × 106
    target molecules per microsphere. In addition, the small size allows the microspheres
    to remain in suspension for several hours, which is more than sufficient for assay
    setup and analysis, and also provides near-fluid-phase reaction kinetics. FlowMetrix
    hardware and software provide complete control of the flow cytometer and perform
    real-time classification of the microspheres and analysis of the microsphere-based
    reactions simultaneously. The hardware is a personal computer interface card that
    provides communication between the computer and the FACScan. The interface card
    has an on-board, high-speed digital signal processor that is capable of performing
    >30 million mathematical functions per second. The interface card connects to
    the computer interface of the FACScan through a switch, allowing alternate use
    of the FlowMetrix system or the standard computer system. The software is a Windows95®-based
    32-bit application that provides a “multiplexed mode” for automated multiplexed
    analysis, as well as a “data acquisition mode” for nonautomated gating and data
    acquisition. Both modes automatically record captured data to flow cytometry standard,
    FCS 2.0, data files for use with third-party data analysis tools. In addition,
    statistical analysis generated by the software is recorded to comma-separated-value
    files that can be read by third-party spreadsheet programs. Fluorescent antibodies,
    antigens, or nucleic acid probes provide specific signals for each reaction in
    a multiplexed assay. Because each fluorescent reactant binds specifically to a
    target that is present on only one bead set in a multiplexed assay, the soluble
    reactants do not need to be differentially labeled. All fluorescent molecules
    are labeled with a green-emitting fluorophore such as Bodipy® (Molecular Probes)
    or fluorescein isothiocyanate. Any green-emitting fluorochrome can be use as a
    reporter; however, each fluorochrome has a characteristic emission spectrum, requiring
    a unique compensation setting for spillover into the orange fluorescence channel.
    To prepare a multiplexed assay, individual sets of microspheres are conjugated
    with the target molecules required for each reaction. Target molecules may be
    antigens, antibodies, oligonucleotides, receptors, peptides, enzyme substrates,
    etc. A fluorescent reactant is prepared for each target molecule. Fluorescent
    reactants may be oligonucleotides, antigens, antibodies, receptors, etc., i.e.,
    any molecule that will bind to the target molecule. After optimizing the parameters
    of each assay separately in a nonmultiplexed format, the assays can be multiplexed
    by simply mixing the different sets of microspheres. The fluorescent reactants
    also are mixed to form a cocktail for the multiplexed reactions. The microspheres
    are then reacted with a mixture of analytes, such as a serum sample, followed
    by the cocktail of fluorescent reactants. After a short incubation period, the
    mixture of microspheres, now containing various amounts of green fluorescence
    on their surfaces, are analyzed with the flow cytometer. Data acquisition, analysis,
    and reporting are performed in real time on all microsphere sets included in the
    multiplex. As each microsphere is analyzed by the flow cytometer, the microsphere
    is classified into its distinct set on the basis of orange and red fluorescence,
    and the green fluorescence value is recorded. One hundred individual microspheres
    of each set are analyzed and the mean value of the green fluorescence is reported.
    In the present report, an immunoassay for allergen-specific IgE and IgG testing,
    and DNA hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotides for genetic testing
    are presented. Both assay systems take advantage of the multiplexing capabilities
    of the system by performing 16 simultaneous analyses in the same reaction. Materials
    and Methods Microspheres. Carboxylate-modified polystyrene microspheres (5.5 μm
    diameter) were dyed with various amounts of orange-emitting and red-emitting fluorochromes
    (Luminex Corp.). Eight different concentrations of each of the two fluorochromes
    were mixed in all 64 possible combinations and the mixtures were used to prepare
    64 microsphere sets with unique orange-red emission profiles (Fig. 1 ). Thus,
    the flow cytometer measures both the color, or emission wavelength, and the intensity
    of each dye. The first 16 microsphere sets produced were used in this study. Reagents.
    Grass allergen extracts, canine sera, and affinity-purified goat anti-canine IgE
    were kindly provided by Bill Mandy, BioMedical Services. Rabbit anti-goat IgG–fluorescein
    isothiocyanate (FITC), goat anti-canine IgG-FITC, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
    acid (MES), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical
    Co.1 1-Ethyl-3-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
    (sulfo-NHS) were purchased from Pierce Chemicals. Synthetic oligonucleotides.
    Sixteen oligonucleotides corresponding to allelic sequences within the second
    exon of the HLA-DQA1 gene and their corresponding complementary sequences were
    synthesized with standard automated synthesis techniques (Oligos, Etc.). The oligonucleotides
    were modified at the 5′ end during synthesis with an amino-linker. The amino-linker
    consists of an amino group attached to a chain of six carbon–carbon linkages.
    Before the addition of the amino-linker, a chain comprising nine carbon–carbon
    and aliphatic ether linkages was introduced as a spacer. Double-stranded (ds)
    oligonucleotides used as competitors in hybridization experiments were prepared
    by annealing equal amounts of unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides. Allergen-coated
    microsphere preparation. Sixteen different grass allergens were conjugated to
    16 different microsphere sets through their surface carboxylate groups with a
    carbodiimide coupling method. Twenty microliters of 4 g/L microspheres (∼8 × 106
    microspheres) were activated in 100 μL of 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer, pH
    7.0, containing 500 μg of EDC and 500 μg of sulfo-NHS. Microspheres were washed
    twice with 100 μL of PBS, pH 7.4, with centrifugation at 13 400g for 30 s to harvest
    the microspheres. Activated, washed microspheres were suspended in 50 μL of diluted
    allergen extract (1:100 in PBS, pH 7.4). After 2 h, allergen-coated microspheres
    were washed twice with 100 μL of 0.2 mL/L Tween 20, 1 g/L BSA in PBS pH 7.4 (PBSTB),
    suspended in 1 mL of PBSTB, and counted on a hemocytometer. The concentration
    of microspheres was adjusted with PBSTB to 3 × 109/L and the suspensions stored
    at 2–8 °C. Multiplexed assay for grass allergen-specific IgE. Equivalent amounts
    of each of the 16 grass allergen-loaded microspheres were mixed. Twenty microliters
    of the mixture (∼60 000 microspheres total) were mixed with 60 μL of a 1:3 dilution
    of canine serum in PBSTB, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min. Microspheres
    were washed in 200 μL of PBSTB and suspended in 40 μL of a 50 mg/L solution of
    goat anti-canine IgE. After incubation for 30 min, beads were washed in 200 μL
    of PBSTB and treated with 40 μL of rabbit anti-goat IgG–FITC at 20 mg/L in PBSTB.
    After 30 min, the assay was diluted to 300 μL with PBSTB and assayed with the
    FlowMetrix system. Negative controls included the microspheres with canine serum,
    without the goat anti-canine IgE and with the rabbit anti-goat IgG–FITC. Allergen-specific
    canine IgE was determined by subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
    of the green channel for the negative controls for each grass allergen from the
    MFI for the tubes including the goat anti-canine IgE. Multiplexed assay for grass
    allergen-specific IgG. Twenty microliters (60 000 microspheres) of the microsphere
    mixture were reacted with 20 μL of a 1:10 dilution of canine serum in PBSTB, and
    the mixture was incubated for 30 min. Microspheres were washed in 200 μL of PBSTB
    and suspended in 25 μL of a 50 mg/L solution of goat anti-canine IgG–FITC. After
    30 min, the mixture was diluted to 300 μL in PBSTB and assayed with the FlowMetrix
    system. Negative controls included the microspheres with no canine serum and with
    the goat anti-canine IgG–FITC. Allergen-specific canine IgG was determined by
    subtracting the MFI for the negative control for each grass allergen from the
    MFI for the tubes including canine serum. Coupling of oligonucleotides to microspheres.
    HLA-DQA1 allele-specific oligonucleotides corresponding to the noncoding strand
    [denoted by (−)] were covalently coupled to unique sets of carboxylate-modified
    polystyrene microspheres by using water-soluble carbodiimide (EDC). Briefly, 100
    μL of a 0.001 mol/L solution of oligonucleotide in 0.1 mol/L MES buffer (pH 4.5)
    was added to 1.0 mL of microspheres (1% solids) in 0.1 mol/L MES buffer (pH 4.5).
    Fifty microliters of a 10 g/L solution of EDC were added to this mixture, and
    the solution was mixed vigorously. After incubation at room temperature for 30
    min, the same amount of EDC was added again and the solution was mixed. Incubation
    at room temperature was continued for another 30 min and then the microspheres
    were pelleted by centrifugation at 11 750g for 4 min. Microspheres were washed
    one time in PBS containing 0.2 mL/L Tween 20, and two times in PBS containing
    1 g/L sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) by resuspending the microsphere pellet in the
    solution and then pelleting the microspheres by centrifugation as described. The
    final microsphere pellet was resuspended in 400 μL of 0.1 mol/L MES buffer (pH
    4.5) and stored at 4°C. Fluorescent labeling of oligonucleotides. HLA-DQA1 allele-specific
    oligonucleotides corresponding to the coding strand [denoted by (+)] were fluorescently
    labeled with Bodipy FL-X {6-[(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionyl)amino]hexanoic
    acid, succinimidyl ester} (Molecular Probes). Briefly, a 400-μL solution containing
    0.000002 mol/L oligonucleotide in 0.1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate and 50 g/L dimethyl
    sulfoxide (DMSO) (pH 8.2) was mixed with 30 μL of Bodipy FL-X (10 g/L in DMSO)
    at room temperature for 16–18 h. The mixture was desalted on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia
    Biotech) equilibrated in TE (0.010 mol/L Tris-HCl + 0.001 mol/L EDTA, pH 8.0)
    to remove unreacted dye, and stored at 4 °C. Competitive hybridization assay.
    Forty femtomoles of each fluorescent oligonucleotide and 24 μg of fragmented salmon
    sperm carrier DNA were mixed with 500 fmol of ds oligonucleotide in a total volume
    of 26.7 μL of reaction buffer (0.050 mol/L KCl, 0.020 mol/L Tris-HCl pH 8.4, and
    0.003 mol/L MgCl2), and the mixture was heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Twenty-five
    microliters of 55 °C-equilibrated 2× hybridization buffer (1× hybridization buffer
    consists of 2.25 mol/L tetramethylammonium chloride, 1.13 g/L SDS, 0.00225 mol/L
    EDTA, and 0.056 mol/L Tris-HCl pH 8.0) were then mixed with the solution, and
    the mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 15–30 min. After this incubation, 2.5 μL
    of the microsphere mixture, containing 8000 microspheres of each of the 16 sets
    (128 000 microspheres total) in 2× hybridization buffer, were added to the mixture
    and the solution was vortex-mixed. The hybridization mixtures were incubated for
    an additional 15 min at 55 °C. Without washing, samples were diluted to 250 μL
    with 55 °C-equilibrated hybridization buffer. Dilutions were performed immediately
    before analysis. Simultaneously, competitive hybridizations in the absence of
    competitor were performed to determine maximal hybridized oligonucleotide values.
    Flow cytometric analysis. Assays were performed in a volume of 50 to 100 μL; however,
    before analysis each reaction was diluted to ∼300 μL to provide sufficient sample
    volume for the flow cytometer. Immediately after dilution, samples were analyzed
    on a FACScan benchtop flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) with FlowMetrix hardware
    and software for operational control of the flow cytometer and for data acquisition
    and analysis (Luminex Corp.). At least 100 microspheres were analyzed for each
    microsphere set. Analysis times averaged ∼20 s. The software allows rapid classification
    of microsphere sets on the basis of the simultaneous gating on orange and red
    fluorescence. Separate histograms of logarithmic green fluorescence intensity
    representing each microsphere set were acquired. The MFI of a logarithmic green
    fluorescence histogram was taken as a measure of the fluorescence associated with
    the corresponding microsphere set and defined as the value of hybridized oligonucleotide.
    Percent inhibition of hybridization on a microsphere set was determined with the
    formula: %  Inhibition  = MFI  in  the  absence  of  competitor  −  MFI  in  the  presence  of  competitor
    MFI  in  the  absence  of  competitor × 100 Results and Discussion To establish
    the utility of the FlowMetrix system for multiplexed analysis, assays have been
    developed representing both immunoassays for analysis of serum proteins and DNA
    hybridization-based assays for genetic analysis. Immunoassays. An area of clinical
    immunology that is suited particularly well to panel-based analysis is determination
    of the serum concentrations of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. In many instances,
    allergic individuals are tested for serum IgE and IgG concentrations specific
    for a related series of allergens, such as grasses, trees, or bee venoms; in other
    cases, panels of geographically related allergens are examined. Fig. 2 depicts
    the results of a multiplexed assay for canine IgE and IgG antibodies specific
    for 16 different grass allergens. The entire analysis of each serum sample was
    performed in two tubes, one for IgE and one for IgG. Each reaction contained 16
    different microsphere sets, each set coated with a different allergen. After incubation
    with serum samples and fluorescent antibodies, the reactions were analyzed with
    the FlowMetrix system. Removal of excess fluorescent antibodies is not required
    because of the extremely small sensing volume of the flow cytometer. The analysis
    time on the flow cytometer is ∼15 s for each sample, and the results are reported,
    instantaneously, in a spreadsheet format. The green fluorescent signal for each
    microsphere set, reported as MFI, is proportional to the amount of bound antibodies;
    thus, appropriate calibrators can be used to perform quantitative assays. The
    data shown in Fig. 2 represent the measurement of allergen-specific antibodies
    in canine sera; similar principles would apply to measurement of human antibodies.
    Serum A96326 demonstrated low IgE reactivity to most of the grass allergens as
    compared with serum A96323. In contrast, serum A96326 contained high concentrations
    of allergen-specific IgG, compared with allergen-specific IgG in serum A96323
    for several of the grass allergens. Perhaps the most important point to be gleaned
    from these data is that 64 individual measurements were performed, analyzed, and
    reported from only four reaction tubes. Genetic analysis. A widely used method
    for ascertaining the presence of particular sequences in target nucleic acids
    is hybridization with short, synthetic oligonucleotide probes of known sequence
    (6). Short oligonucleotides of eight to 20 bp are used because they display a
    high degree of hybridization specificity (7)(8)(9). Molecular hybridization with
    short oligonucleotides has been applied to numerous problems in research and medicine
    that require DNA sequence analysis. These include detection of mutations for diagnosis
    of genetic and malignant diseases (6)(10)(11) and for classification of HLA alleles
    for tissue typing (12). The experiments described here involved a series of 16
    oligonucleotide probes representing allelic sequences of the human HLA-DQA1 gene
    (Fig. 3 ). Hybridization properties of microsphere-attached oligonucleotides.
    Parallel hybridization assays necessitate that a single reaction condition is
    used for hybridization of the oligonucleotide probes to the target nucleic acid.
    Hybridization solutions containing tetramethylammonium chloride are useful for
    this purpose since tetramethylammonium chloride minimizes the effects of base
    composition on duplex association and disassociation rates (13)(14). The stringency
    of hybridization is then controlled strictly as a function of the length of contiguous
    complementarity. All hybridization experiments reported here were performed in
    the presence of 2.25 mol/L tetramethylammonium chloride. Before attempting to
    multiplex the 16 oligonucleotide-substituted microspheres, the basic parameters
    of microsphere-attached oligonucleotide hybridization were examined with a single
    microsphere–oligonucleotide. A constant number (8000) of one oligonucleotide-coated
    microsphere set, 3403−, was hybridized to increasing quantities of complementary
    (3403+) or unrelated (5501+) fluorescent oligonucleotide at 55 °C for 15 min,
    and the green fluorescence associated with the microspheres was measured with
    the FlowMetrix system (Fig. 4 A). Microsphere-bound fluorescence increased in
    a linear manner up to 40 fmol of input complementary fluorescent probe. Identical
    quantities of input noncomplementary fluorescent oligonucleotide showed little
    or no hybridization. Each of the 16 DQA1 oligonucleotide pairs showed similar
    hybridization properties (data not shown), and all future experiments were performed
    with 8000 of each microsphere and 40 fmol of each fluorescent oligonucleotide.
    The kinetics of hybridization of microsphere-bound DQA3403− oligonucleotide to
    complementary (DQA3403+) and unrelated (DQA5501+) fluorescent oligonucleotides
    is shown in Fig. 4B . Hybridization of the microsphere-bound DQA3403− oligonucleotide
    with its complementary probe is rapid, requiring no more than 15 min to reach
    completion. During this time period, there is little or no hybridization of the
    unrelated fluorescent probe. Therefore, a period of 15 min was used routinely
    for hybridization of the microsphere-attached oligonucleotides to the fluorescent
    oligonucleotide probes To confirm that hybridization at 55 °C in 2.25 mol/L tetramethylammonium
    chloride allowed discrimination between complementary and closely related 18-bp
    sequences, hybridization reactions were performed at various temperatures with
    fluorescent probes representing complementary, single, and double mutants, and
    unrelated sequences. The DQA3403− microsphere set was selected for analysis because
    the DQA3403 sequence differs from DQA3402 by only a single base and this mismatch
    is positioned such that the oligonucleotides have 13 contiguous identical bp,
    the longest stretch of identity between any of the 16 oligonucleotides in the
    HLA-DQA1 panel. As shown in Fig. 4C , hybridization temperatures <55 °C did not
    allow discrimination of the point mutant DQA3402 oligonucleotide from the complementary
    sequence. At 55 °C, the point mutant hybridized with ∼50% lower efficiency than
    the complementary sequence, and the double mutant and unrelated oligonucleotides
    did not hybridize. No hybridization of any oligonucleotides occurred at 65 °C.
    Thus, hybridization at 55 °C in 2.25 mol/L tetramethylammonium chloride should
    allow detection and discrimination of perfectly complementary oligonucleotide
    duplexes from mismatched ones. DNA sequence analysis by competitive hybridization.
    The purpose of these experiments was to establish a general system for multiplexed
    hybridization analysis of DNA sequences that uses unlabeled, ds target DNA, such
    as a standard PCR product, as the test material. The assay system contains 16
    different microspheres coupled to the 16 different DQA1 oligonucleotide target
    probes, and the 16 complementary fluorescent DQA1 probes (Fig. 3 ). In the presence
    of a complementary competitor sequence, hybridization between the complementary
    fluorescent probe and its complementary microsphere target will be reduced. To
    test the specificity of this system for DNA sequence analysis by competitive hybridization
    with unlabeled DNA targets, unlabeled oligonucleotides were used as model competitors.
    Preliminary experiments demonstrated that 500 fmol of ds oligonucleotide resulted
    in maximal inhibition of fluorescent probe hybridization and that the hybridization
    was complete within 15 min (data not shown). Each unlabeled ds HLA-DQA1 oligonucleotide
    was denatured and hybridized to the mixture of the 16 HLA-DQA1 fluorescent oligonucleotides.
    Then, the mixture was hybridized to the mixture of 16 HLA-DQA1 microspheres. Competition
    of oligonucleotide duplex formation on microsphere sets with the HLA-DQA1 oligonucleotide
    competitors was very effective and specific (Table 1 ). Denatured ds HLA-DQA1
    oligonucleotides inhibited hybridization on complementary microsphere sets 62–93%,
    and inhibited highly homologous or unrelated microsphere sets <21%. Thus, the
    HLA-DQA1 competitive hybridization test performed accurately with denatured ds
    oligonucleotide competitors. This multiplexed hybridization assay has been used
    to perform HLA-DQA1 tissue typing of PCR-amplified human genomic DNA (P. Smith
    et al., submitted for publication). The assay types DQA1 alleles in both homozygous
    and heterozygous samples, and the entire analysis is accomplished in 30 min after
    PCR amplification. These studies have demonstrated the ability of the FlowMetrix
    system to perform highly multiplexed assays for analysis of specific protein–protein
    interactions, such as immunoassays, and for analysis of specific DNA sequences.
    The system provides several advantages for analysis of biologically and medically
    relevant molecules, including speed, economy, and advanced analytical capabilities.
    The system reduces assay time by performing multiple analyses simultaneously rather
    than sequentially. The no-wash format of many microsphere-based assays, particularly
    in the final detection step, is considerably faster than microtiter-based assays
    that require multiple washing steps to remove excess reagents. In addition, the
    rapid kinetics of microsphere-based assays allow shorter incubation times than
    conventional solid-phase assays. The reduced assay time also reduces labor costs
    for performing multiple analyses. Reagent usage for microsphere-based assays is
    10- to 1000-fold less than microtiter-based assays. Multiplexing allows unique
    analysis of molecular interactions that can only be performed in a multiplexed
    format. For example, direct comparison of receptor binding avidity for related
    ligands could be performed under truly competitive conditions where the receptor
    and all ligand variants are present in the same reaction at the same time. Most,
    if not all, assays for biomolecules can be adapted to the FlowMetrix system. Immunoassays
    have been developed with all assay formats available with microtiter-based technology,
    including direct binding assays, immunometric or capture/sandwich assays, and
    competitive inhibition assays. In addition, receptor/ligand analysis and epitope
    mapping are well suited for the multiplexed format. Multiplexed hybridization
    of nucleic acids can be used for tissue typing, diagnosis of genetic disease,
    paternity/forensic testing, tests for oncogenes, tests for foreign pathogens,
    and tests for mRNA/cDNA expression. Because of the real-time analysis, no-wash
    format, and solution-phase kinetics of microsphere-based assays, multiplexed enzyme
    assays also can be performed to analyze both substrate specificity and kinetic
    data for multiple enzymes or multiple substrates simultaneously. For example,
    multiple microsphere sets could be prepared, each bearing a different fluorescent
    peptide sequence. These microsphere sets could then be mixed and used to examine
    the specificity or relative activity of an endopeptidase for the different substrate
    sequences. In this case, enzymatic activity would be measured as the loss of fluorescence
    from the microspheres. The FlowMetrix system represents a revolutionary new technology
    that can be applied to virtually any application that requires analysis of molecular
    interactions, including basic research, clinical diagnostic testing, high-throughput
    drug screening, environmental testing, and agricultural testing. This system is
    unique in its ability to provide multiplexed, high-throughput analysis coupled
    with real-time data analysis. The system offers excellent sensitivity, precision,
    speed, and economy. Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX 78727. 1 Nonstandard abbreviations:

    This critical review summarizes developments in microﬂuidic platforms that enable\
    \ the miniaturization, integration,\nautomation and parallelization of (bio-)chemical\
    \ assays (see S. Haeberle and R. Zengerle, Lab Chip, 2007, 7,\n1094–1110, for\
    \ an earlier review). In contrast to isolated application-speciﬁc solutions, a\
    \ microﬂuidic platform provides\na set of ﬂuidic unit operations, which are designed\
    \ for easy combination within a well-deﬁned fabrication technology.\nThis allows\
    \ the easy, fast, and cost-eﬃcient implementation of diﬀerent application-speciﬁc\
    \ (bio-)chemical processes.\nIn our review we focus on recent developments from\
    \ the last decade (2000s). We start with a brief introduction into\ntechnical\
    \ advances, major market segments and promising applications. We continue with\
    \ a detailed characterization\nof diﬀerent microﬂuidic platforms, comprising a\
    \ short deﬁnition, the functional principle, microﬂuidic unit operations,\napplication\
    \ examples as well as strengths and limitations of every platform. The microﬂuidic\
    \ platforms in focus are\nlateral ﬂow tests, linear actuated devices, pressure\
    \ driven laminar ﬂow, microﬂuidic large scale integration, segmented\nﬂow microﬂuidics,\
    \ centrifugal microﬂuidics, electrokinetics, electrowetting, surface acoustic\
    \ waves, and dedicated\nsystems for massively parallel analysis. This review concludes\
    \ with the attempt to provide a selection scheme for\nmicroﬂuidic platforms which\
    \ is based on their characteristics according to key requirements of diﬀerent\
    \ applications\nand market segments. Applied selection criteria comprise portability,\
    \ costs of instrument and disposability, sample\nthroughput, number of parameters\
    \ per sample, reagent consumption, precision, diversity of microﬂuidic unit\n\
    operations and the ﬂexibility in programming diﬀerent liquid handling protocols\
    \ (295 references).\nIntroduction\nAlmost 10 000 papers have been published over\
    \ the last\n10 years on the topic of microﬂuidics1 and the annual numbers\nof\

    \ products based on microﬂuidics is,\nwith few exceptions, still quite low. The\
    \ question is: will\nmicroﬂuidics remain a toy for academic and industrial re-\n\
    search or will it ﬁnally make the transition to an end-user\nproduct?\nLooking\
    \ into the past, the ﬁrst microﬂuidic technology was\ndeveloped in the early 1950s\
    \ when eﬀorts to dispense small\namounts of liquids in the nanolitre and picolitre\
    \ range were\nmade, providing the basis for today’s ink-jet technology.3 In\n\
    terms\nof\nﬂuid\npropulsion\nwithin\nmicrochannels\nwith\nsub-millimetre cross\
    \ sections, the year 1979 set a milestone\nwhen a miniaturized gas chromatograph\
    \ (GC) was realized by\nTerry et al. on a silicon (Si) wafer.4 The ﬁrst high-pressure\n\
    liquid chromatography (HPLC) column microﬂuidic device,\nfabricated using Si-Pyrex\
    \ technology, was published in 1990\nby Manz et al.5 By the end of the 1980s and\
    \ the beginning of\nthe 1990s, several microﬂuidic structures, such as microvalves6\n\
    and micropumps7,8 had been realized by silicon micromachining,\nproviding the\
    \ basis for automation of complex liquid handling\nprotocols by microﬂuidic integration.9,10\
    \ This was the advent of\nthe newly emerging ﬁeld of ‘‘micro total analysis systems’’\n\
    (mTAS11), also called ‘‘lab-on-a-chip’’.12\nFig. 1\nGrowth of publications (a)\

    \ much simpler yet very successful\nmicroﬂuidic\nanalysis\nsystems\nbased\non\n\
    capillary\nliquid\ntransport in wettable ﬂeeces emerged: First very simple\n‘‘dipsticks’’\
    \ for e.g. pH measurement based on a single ﬂeece\npaved the way for more complex\
    \ ‘‘test strips’’ that have\nbeen sold as ‘‘lateral-ﬂow tests’’ since the late\
    \ 80s.13 Examples\nthat are still on the market today are test strips for\npregnancy,14\
    \ drug abuse,15–17 cardiac markers18 and also\nupcoming bio-warfare protection.19\
    \ Among the devices that\ncompletely automated a biochemical analysis by microﬂuidic\n\
    integration into one miniature piece of hardware, the test\nstrips became the\
    \ ﬁrst devices that obtained a remarkable\nmarket share with billions of units\
    \ sold per year. Yet they\nremain one of the few microﬂuidic systems which are\
    \ sold in\nhigh numbers.\nUntil today, in many cases, the revenue in the ﬁeld\
    \ of\nlab-on-a-chip is created on a business-to-business, rather\nthan a business-to-consumer\
    \ basis,20 as the vast majority of\nresearch in the ﬁeld only approaches the stage\
    \ of demonstrations\nand is not followed up by the development of products for\n\
    end-users. Among the hurdles for market entry are high initial\ninvestments and\
    \ running fabrication costs.21 Regardless of the\n10 000 available publications,\
    \ oﬀering solutions for almost\nevery problem that might occur, the development\
    \ of a\nlab-on-a-chip product is still a risky adventure. Quite often\nthe existing\
    \ microﬂuidic building blocks are not compatible to\nor combinable with each other.\
    \ In addition, in some cases the\nfabrication technologies do not match or are\
    \ too expensive.\nTherefore implementing an application speciﬁc assay on a chip\n\
    is still a very complex and cumbersome task bearing technical\nrisks and with\
    \ it also ﬁnancial risks.\nInstead of the development of individual and isolated\n\
    lab-on-a-chip solutions, the constraint of using building blocks\nto form well-deﬁned\
    \ microﬂuidic platforms enables the\nimplementation of biochemical assays in a\
    \ much better,\nforeseeable and less risky manner. A microﬂuidic platform\ncomprises\
    \ an easily combinable set of microﬂuidic unit-operations\nthat allows assay miniaturization\
    \ within a consistent fabrica-\ntion technology. Hence, the intention of this\
    \ review is to\nprovide an overview and classiﬁcation of existing micro-\nﬂuidic\
    \ platforms that enable the miniaturization, integration,\nautomation and parallelization\
    \ of (bio-)chemical assays in an\neasy, consistent and therefore less risky manner.\
    \ This classiﬁcation\nalso enables us to categorize the huge amount of literature\n\
    available in the ﬁeld of microﬂuidics into solutions that are\ncompatible to each\
    \ other and therefore can be combined\nwithin a given microﬂuidic platform.\n\
    According to their dominating main liquid propulsion\nprinciple, we subdivide\
    \ microﬂuidic platforms into 5 groups,\nnamely: capillary, pressure driven, centrifugal,\
    \ electrokinetic\nand acoustic systems, as depicted in Fig. 2. Each listed\nplatform\
    \ within these groups will be discussed. As a guide,\nwe provide a characterization\
    \ of the respective platforms in\nTable 1. After providing a short general introduction\
    \ to the\nunique properties, requirements, and applications for micro-\nﬂuidic\
    \ platforms, this review focuses on a detailed discussion\nof the microﬂuidic\
    \ platforms listed in Fig. 2. For each\nplatform, the characterization and the\
    \ general principle is\npresented ﬁrst. After that the microﬂuidic unit operations\
    \ as\nwell as application examples are brieﬂy discussed. Finally,\neach platform\
    \ is characterized by providing an overview of its\nstrengths and limitations.\
    \ We conclude by an attempt to\nprovide\na\nselection\nscheme\nfor\nmicroﬂuidic\n\
    platforms\nwhich is based on platform characteristics and application\nrequirements.\n\
    This review does not claim completeness. It contains\nexamples of microﬂuidic\
    \ platforms which were selected as\nﬁtting to our platform deﬁnition. The review\
    \ should, however,\nprovide the reader with some orientation in the ﬁeld and the\n\
    ability to select platforms with appropriate characteristics on\nthe basis of\
    \ application-speciﬁc requirements.\nThe framework for microﬂuidic platforms:\
    \ unique\nproperties, requirements and applications\nMicroﬂuidics as an enabling\
    \ technology: from classical liquid\nhandling to single-cell handling\nA number\
    \ of classical, macroscopic liquid handling systems\nfor performing analytical\
    \ and diagnostic assays have been in\nuse for many decades. Examples are petri\
    \ dishes, culture bottles\nand microtitre plates (also called microplates). Petri\
    \ dishes\nwere ﬁrst described in 188722 and culture bottles23 have been\nin use\
    \ since around 1850. Since roughly 60 years ago, they\nhave been manufactured\
    \ as plastic disposables. In comparison,\nmicrotiter plates are quite ‘‘modern,’’\
    \ having ﬁrst been de-\nscribed in 1951.24 Based on these standards, highly automated\n\
    liquid handling solutions have been developed within the last\nFig. 2\nMicroﬂuidic\

    standard’’ for automated sample processing in pharma and\ndiagnostics. They oﬀer\
    \ a huge potential for many applications\nsince they are very ﬂexible as well\
    \ as freely programmable.\nMicroﬂuidic platforms have to compete against these\
    \ established\nsystems by oﬀering new opportunities. Expectations often\nquoted\
    \ in this context are:25\n\x03 Portability/wearability\n\x03 Higher sensitivity\n\
    \x03 Lower cost per test\nTable 1\nThe table provides a deﬁnition of a microﬂuidic\
    \ platform in general, followed by a short characterization of every microﬂuidic\
    \ platform\npresented in the following chapters of this review\nMicroﬂuidic platform\n\
    Characterization\nDeﬁnition of a microﬂuidic platform A microﬂuidic platform provides\
    \ a set of ﬂuidic unit operations, which are designed for easy combination\nwithin\
    \ a well-deﬁned fabrication technology. A microﬂuidic platform paves a generic\
    \ and consistent way for\nminiaturization, integration, automation and parallelization\
    \ of (bio-)chemical processes.\nLateral ﬂow tests\nIn lateral ﬂow tests, also\
    \ known as test strips (e.g. pregnancy test strip), the liquids are driven by\
    \ capillary\nforces. Liquid movement is controlled by the wettability and feature\
    \ size of the porous or microstructured\nsubstrate. All required chemicals are\
    \ pre-stored within the strip. The readout of a test is typically\ndone optically\
    \ and is quite often implemented as color change of the detection area that can\
    \ be seen by the\nnaked eye.\nLinear actuated devices\nLinear actuated devices\
    \ control liquid movement by mechanical displacement of liquid e.g. by a plunger.\n\
    Liquid control is mostly limited to a one-dimensional liquid ﬂow in a linear fashion\
    \ without branches or\nalternative liquid pathways. Typically liquid calibrants\
    \ and reaction buﬀers are pre-stored in pouches.\nPressure driven laminar ﬂow\n\
    A pressure driven laminar ﬂow platform is characterized by liquid transport mechanisms\
    \ based on pressure\ngradients. Typically this leads to hydrodynamically stable\
    \ laminar ﬂow proﬁles in microchannels. There is a\nbroad range of diﬀerent implementations\
    \ in terms of using external or internal pressure sources such as using\nsyringes,\
    \ pumps or micropumps, gas expansion principles, pneumatic displacement of membranes,\
    \ etc. The\nsamples and reagents are processed by injecting them into the chip\
    \ inlets either batch-wise or in a continuous\nmode.\nMicroﬂuidic large scale\
    \ integration\nMicroﬂuidic large scale integration describes a microﬂuidic channel\
    \ circuitry with chip-integrated microvalves\nbased on ﬂexible membranes between\
    \ a liquid-guiding layer and a pneumatic control-channel layer. The\nmicrovalves\
    \ are closed or open corresponding to the pneumatic pressure applied to the control-channels.\
    \ Just\nby combining several microvalves more complex units like micropumps, mixers,\
    \ multiplexers, etc. can be built\nup with hundreds of units on one single chip.\n\
    Segmented ﬂow microﬂuidics\nSegmented ﬂow microﬂuidics describes the principle\
    \ of using small liquid plugs and/or droplets immersed in a\nsecond immiscible\
    \ continuous phase (gas or liquid) as stable micro-conﬁnements within closed microﬂuidic\n\
    channels. Those micro-conﬁnements are in the picolitre to microlitre volume range.\
    \ They can be transported by\npressure gradients and can be merged, split, sorted,\
    \ and processed without any dispersion in microﬂuidic channels.\nCentrifugal microﬂuidics\n\
    In centrifugal microﬂuidics all processes are controlled by the frequency protocol\
    \ of a rotating microstructured\nsubstrate. The relevant forces for liquid transport\
    \ are centrifugal force, Euler force, Coriolis force and capillary\nforce. Assays\
    \ are implemented as a sequence of liquid operations arranged from radially inward\
    \ positions to\nradially outward positions. Microﬂuidic unit operations include\
    \ metering, switching, aliquoting, etc.\nElectrokinetics\nIn electrokinetics platforms\
    \ microﬂuidic unit operations are controlled by electric ﬁelds acting on electric\n\
    charges, or electric ﬁeld gradients acting on electric dipoles. Depending on buﬀers\
    \ and/or sample, several\nelectrokinetic eﬀects such as electroosmosis, electrophoresis,\
    \ dielectrophoresis, and polarization superimpose\neach other. Electroosmosis\
    \ can be used to transport the whole liquid bulk while the other eﬀects can be\
    \ used\nto separate diﬀerent types of molecules or particles within the bulk liquid.\n\
    Electrowetting\nElectrowetting platforms use droplets immersed in a second immiscible\
    \ continuous phase (gas or liquid) as\nstable micro-conﬁnements. The droplets\
    \ reside on a hydrophobic surface that contains a one- or two-\ndimensional array\
    \ of individually addressable electrodes. The voltage between a droplet and the\
    \ electrode\nunderneath the droplet deﬁnes its wetting behavior. By changing voltages\
    \ between neighboring electrodes,\ndroplets can be generated, transported, split,\
    \ merged, and processed. These unit operations are freely pro-\ngrammable for\
    \ each individual droplet by the end-user enabling online control of an assay.\n\
    Surface acoustic waves\nThe surface acoustic waves platform uses droplets residing\
    \ on a hydrophobic surface in a gaseous environ-\nment (air). The microﬂuidic\
    \ unit operations are mainly controlled by acoustic shock waves travelling on\
    \ the\nsurface of the solid support. The shock waves are generated by an arrangement\
    \ of surrounding sonotrodes,\ndeﬁning the droplet manipulation area. Most of the\
    \ unit operations such as droplet generation, transport,\nmixing, etc. are freely\
    \ programmable.\nDedicated systems for massively\nparallel analysis\nWithin the\
    \ category of dedicated systems for massively parallel analysis we discuss speciﬁc\
    \ platforms that do\nnot comply with our deﬁnition of a generic microﬂuidic platform.\
    \ The characteristics of those platforms are\nnot given by the implementation\
    \ of the ﬂuidic functions but by the speciﬁc way to process up to millions of\n\
    assays in parallel. Prominent examples are platforms used for gene expression\
    \ and sequencing such as mi-\ncroarrays, bead-based assays and pyro-sequencing\
    \ in picowell-plates.\n1156 | Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 1153–1182\nThis journal\

    \x03 Less laboratory space consumption\nAdditionally, scaling eﬀects lead to new\
    \ phenomena and\npermit entirely new applications that are not accessible to\n\
    classical liquid handling platforms, such as:\n\x03 Well-deﬁned, laminar ﬂow\n\
    \x03 Controllable diﬀusion enabling deﬁned concentration\ngradients on the length\
    \ scales of single-cells\n\x03 Surface forces dominate over gravitational forces\n\
    \x03 Liquid compartments of the size of a single cell or smaller\n\x03 High-speed\
    \ serial processing (at single cell level)\n\x03 High degree of parallelization\
    \ (up to around 106)\nIn the following, the eﬀects and phenomena leading to\n\
    the above-mentioned expectations and the potential for new\napplications will\
    \ be outlined brieﬂy.\nIt is obvious that the amount of reagent consumption can\
    \ be\ndecreased signiﬁcantly by scaling down the assay volume.\nAdditionally,\
    \ by reducing the footprint of each individual test,\na higher degree of parallelization\
    \ can be achieved in a limited\nlaboratory space. A prime example for microﬂuidic\
    \ tests with\nminimal reagent consumption are parallel reactions in hundreds\n\
    of thousands of individual wells with picolitre-volumes,26 which\ntook genome\
    \ sequencing to a new level27 hardly achievable by\nclassical liquid handling\
    \ platforms.\nWith decreasing length scales, surface phenomena (e.g. capillary\n\
    forces, surface charges, etc.) become increasingly dominant over\nvolume phenomena.\
    \ This permits purely passive liquid actuation\nbased on capillary forces used\
    \ in the popular lateral ﬂow assays\nalso know as capillary test strips. Another\
    \ eﬀect is the onset of\nlaminar ﬂow at low Reynolds numbers in small channels.\
    \ This\nenables the creation of well-deﬁned and stable liquid–liquid\ninterfaces\
    \ down to cellular dimensions. Therefore, large con-\ncentration gradients can\
    \ be applied and the eﬀects monitored at\nthe single cell level28 (Fig. 3). In\
    \ summary, laminar ﬂow con-\nditions and controlled diﬀusion enable temporally\
    \ and spatially\nhighly resolved reactions with little reagent consumption.\n\
    A diﬀerent paradigm using the possibility of controlling\ninterfaces in microﬂuidic\
    \ applications is the concept of droplet-\nbased microﬂuidics, also called ‘‘digital\
    \ microﬂuidics’’.29 The\non-demand generation of liquid micro-cavities either\

    assay volumes are fast thermal relaxation and low power\nconsumption for liquid\
    \ manipulation and thermal control. This\ncan speed up assays that require thermocycling,\
    \ such as PCR,\nwhich was realized in numerous microﬂuidic applications.32\nThis\
    \ short summary shows that there is the potential for\nmany novel applications\
    \ and improvements over the state-\nof-the-art within the above-mentioned criteria\
    \ of sensitivity,\ncost, time, and size. However, despite a myriad of publications\n\
    about microﬂuidic components, principles and applications,\nonly a limited number\
    \ of successful products with a relevant\nmarket share have emerged from this\
    \ ﬁeld so far. In the\nnext chapter, we will outline hurdles and present emerging\n\
    paradigm changes that will inﬂuence future research in\nmicroﬂuidics.\nThe need\
    \ for the microﬂuidic platform approach\nDeﬁnition of a microﬂuidic platform:\
    \ A microﬂuidic platform\nprovides a set of ﬂuidic unit operations, which are\
    \ designed for\neasy combination within a well-deﬁned fabrication techno-\nlogy.\
    \ A microﬂuidic platform paves a generic and con-\nsistent way for miniaturization,\
    \ integration, automation and\nparallelization of (bio-)chemical processes.\n\
    In the last two decades, thousands of researchers spent a\nhuge amount of time\
    \ to develop micropumps,33–36 micro-\nvalves,37 micromixers,38,39 and microﬂuidic\
    \ liquid handling\ndevices in general. However, a consistent fabrication and\n\
    interfacing technology as one prerequisite for the eﬃcient\ndevelopment of lab-on-a-chip\
    \ systems is very often still\nmissing. This missing link can only be closed by\
    \ establishing\na microﬂuidic platform approach which allows the fast and\neasy\
    \ implementation of (bio-)chemical protocols based on\ncommon building blocks.\
    \ The idea follows the tremendous\nimpact of platforms in the application-speciﬁc\
    \ integrated\ncircuit (ASIC) industry in microelectronics, where validated\nelements\
    \ and processes enabled faster design and cheaper\nfabrication of electronic circuitries.\n\
    Conveying this to the microﬂuidic platform approach, a set\nof validated microﬂuidic\
    \ elements is required, each able to\nperform a certain basic ﬂuid handling step\
    \ or unit operation.\nSuch basic unit operations are building blocks of laboratory\n\
    protocols and comprise ﬂuid transport, ﬂuid metering, ﬂuid\nmixing, valving, separation\
    \ or concentration of molecules or\nparticles (see Table 2) and others. Every\
    \ microﬂuidic plat-\nform should oﬀer an adequate number of microﬂuidic unit\n\
    operations that can be easily combined and thereby enable\neasy implementation\
    \ of application-speciﬁc assays within that\ngiven platform.\nFig. 3\nConcept\

    This concept, however, does not imply that every micro-\nﬂuidic platform needs\
    \ to provide a complete set of all the unit\noperations listed in Table 2. It\
    \ is much more important that\nthe diﬀerent elements are connectable, ideally\
    \ in a monolithically\nintegrated way or at least by a well deﬁned, ready-to-use\n\
    interconnection and packaging process. Therefore at least\none validated fabrication\
    \ technology is required to realize\ncomplete microﬂuidic solutions from the individual\
    \ elements\nwithin a microﬂuidic platform.\nMarket requirements and platform selection\
    \ criteria\nThe requirements on microﬂuidic platforms diﬀer greatly between\n\
    diﬀerent market segments. Following a roadmap on microﬂuidics\nfor life sciences,40\
    \ the four key market segments for microﬂuidic\nlab-on-a-chip applications are,\
    \ according to their market size:\nin vitro diagnostics, drug discovery, biotechnology,\
    \ and ecology.\nThe largest market segment, in vitro diagnostics, can be\nsubdivided\
    \ into point-of-care testing (e.g. for self-testing in\ndiabetes monitoring or\
    \ cardiac marker testing in emergency\nmedicine) and central laboratory-based\
    \ testing (e.g. core\nlaboratory in a hospital). Especially the self- and point-of-care\n\
    testing segments oﬀer huge potential for microﬂuidics, since\nportability and/or\
    \ wearability is an important requirement.\nDrug discovery in the pharmaceutical\
    \ industry is the second\nlargest segment. Here, enormous eﬀort is undertaken\
    \ to\nidentify new promising drug candidates in so called high-\nthroughput screening\
    \ (HTS) or massively parallel analysis.41\nAfter screening promising candidates,\
    \ so-called hits have to be\nvalidated and characterized (hit characterization).\
    \ In this\ncontext cell-based assays have received increasing interest over\n\
    recent years.42,43 These assays often require the handling of\nsingle cells, which\
    \ becomes possible using microﬂuidic approaches.\nThis market segment requires\
    \ high sample throughput and low\ncosts per test.\nThe third segment is the biotech\
    \ market with fermentation-\nbased production (e.g. for biopharmaceuticals or\
    \ food). This\nindustry shows a great demand for on-line process monitoring\n\
    and analyses in the ﬁeld of process development. Here,\nlow sample volumes and\
    \ ﬂexibility (programmability) are\nimportant factors.\nEcology is another market\
    \ segment, comprising the ﬁeld\nof agricultural- and water-analysis, either as\
    \ on-site spot\ntests or as continuous monitoring. Included are also applica-\n\
    tions related to homeland security, e.g. the detection of\nagents that pose biological\
    \ threats. This market beneﬁts\nfrom\nportable\nsystems\nwith\npreferably\nmulti-parameter\n\
    capabilities.\nThese diverse ﬁelds of applications are associated with a\nnumber\
    \ of analytical and diagnostic tasks. This outlines the\nﬁeld for the microﬂuidic\
    \ technology, which has to measure\nitself against the state-of-the-art in performance\
    \ and costs.\nTable 3 gives an overview on some important requirements of\nthe\
    \ diﬀerent market segments and application examples, with\nrespect to the following\
    \ selection criteria:\n\x03 Portability/wearability: miniaturized, hand-held device\n\
    with low energy consumption\n\x03 Throughput: number of samples/assays per day\n\
    \x03 Cost of instrument: investment costs of the instrument\n(‘‘reader’’)\n\x03\
    \ Cost of disposables: deﬁning the costs per assay (together\nwith reagent consumption)\n\
    \x03 Number of parameters per sample: number of diﬀerent\nparameters to be analyzed\
    \ per sample\n\x03 Low reagent consumption: amount of sample and/or\nreagents\
    \ required per assay\n\x03 Diversity of unit operations: the variety/completeness\
    \ of\nlaboratory operations that can be realized\n\x03 Precision: the volume and\
    \ time resolution that is possible\n\x03 Programmability: the ﬂexibility to adapt\
    \ liquid handling\nprotocols without fabricating a new chip\nThese criteria will\
    \ be discussed for each of the platforms\ndescribed in this review.\nBiochemical\
    \ applications for microﬂuidic platforms\nHere, a short overview of the ﬁelds\
    \ of applications that are\ntypically addressed by microﬂuidic platforms is presented.\n\
    A ﬁrst ﬁeld of application is biotransformation, the break-\ndown and generation\
    \ of molecules and products by the help of\nenzymes, bacteria, or eukaryotic cell\
    \ cultures. This comprises\nfermentation, the break down and re-assembly of molecules\n\
    (e.g. fermentation of sugar to alcohol), and (bio)synthesis the\nbuild-up of complex\
    \ molecules (e.g. antibiotics, insulin, inter-\nferon, steroids). Especially in\
    \ the ﬁeld of process development\nchallenges are to handle a large number of\
    \ diﬀerent liquids\nunder controlled conditions such as temperature or pH, in\n\
    combination with precise liquid control down to nL or even\npL volumes. Some examples\
    \ of microﬂuidic liquid handling\nplatforms are given for fermentation in micro\
    \ bioreactors,44–51\nthe biosynthesis of radiopharmaceuticals,52 and antibody\n\
    screening, phage- and ribosome-display technologies.53,54\nAnother major ﬁeld\
    \ of application is analytics. The analysed\nmolecule (analyte) can be from a\
    \ variety of biomolecules,\nincluding proteins and nucleic acids. Here, the main\
    \ require-\nments are eﬀective mixing strategies and highly precise liquid\nmetering\
    \ and liquid handling which are needed to get accurate\nquantitative\nresults.\n\
    Also,\nautomation\nand\nportability/\nwearability combined with a large set of\
    \ unit operations for the\nimplementation of complex analytical protocols are\
    \ required.\nAs an emerging ﬁeld, cellular assays are the most challenging\nformat,\
    \ since the cells have to be constantly kept in an\nadequate surrounding to maintain\
    \ their viability and activity\n(control of pH, O2, CO2, nutrition, etc.). Cellular\
    \ tests are\nuseful to assess the eﬀect of new pharmaceutical entities at\nTable\

    \ high-\nthroughput solutions as well as a low reagent consumption\nper test.\n\
    After this short overview, the next chapter will summarize\nthe liquid handling\
    \ challenges that arise from the diﬀerent\nliquids associated with these ﬁelds\
    \ of applications.\nRequirements on microﬂuidic platforms related to liquids with\n\
    biochemical content\nPerforming microﬂuidics with pure water cannot be compared\n\
    to the challenge of developing a microﬂuidic platform for\nhandling of liquids\
    \ with biochemical content. Here, a large\nvariety of changing liquid properties\
    \ needs to be considered,\nranging from surface tension, non-Newtonian viscosities\
    \ and\nthe contact angle on a certain surface. In addition, when\nhandling biological\
    \ samples, such as blood, an inter-sample\nvariation,\ne.g.\ndue\nto\nphysiological\n\
    diﬀerences\nbetween\npatients, has to be managed by the microﬂuidic system. In\n\
    the following, a short summary of typical sample materials\nand their interactions\
    \ with the microﬂuidic substrate is\nprovided. Also, strategies to prevent unfavorable\
    \ interactions\nare outlined.\nIn general, microﬂuidic substrates should be inert\
    \ against\nthe expected sample and assay reagents which might comprise\norganic\
    \ or inorganic solvents or extreme pH values.57 Like-\nwise, the sample must not\
    \ be aﬀected by the microﬂuidic\nsubstrate in any way that could inﬂuence the\
    \ analytical result.\nFor example, nucleic acids are critical molecules because\
    \ of\ntheir negative charge and tendency to adhere to charged\nsurfaces such as\
    \ metal oxides. Similar problems occur with\nproteins or peptides which exist\
    \ in a variety of electrical\ncharges, molecular sizes, and physical properties.\
    \ In addition\nto possible adsorption onto the surfaces, the catalytic activity\n\
    of enzymatic proteins can be reduced by interaction with the\nsubstrate.58–61\
    \ A general counter-measure against the inter-\naction of biomolecules and microﬂuidic\
    \ substrates is to block\nthe substrates with another suitable biomolecule which\
    \ is\nadded in excess. For instance, bovine serum albumin (BSA)\nadsorbs to nearly\
    \ any surface thus passivating it.62,63 Another\nsigniﬁcant challenge in microﬂuidic\
    \ production technology is\nto maintain the activity of proteins during processes\
    \ such as\nthermal bonding64,65 or UV curing steps. In addition, the long-\nterm\
    \ stability of pre-stored dry reagents is required, hence\nmaterials with low\
    \ vapor transition rates have to be selected.\nExperience shows that this set\
    \ of challenges needs to be\nconsidered at the very beginning of a ﬂuidic design,\
    \ since the\nlisted problems can jeopardize the functionality of the whole\nsystem\
    \ if addressed too late.\nTable 3\nMarket segments for microﬂuidic lab-on-a-chip\

    Lateral ﬂow tests\nCharacterization of lateral ﬂow tests\nIn lateral ﬂow tests,\
    \ also known as test strips (e.g. pregnancy\ntest strip), the liquids are driven\
    \ by capillary forces. Liquid\nmovement is controlled by the wettability and feature\
    \ size of\nthe porous or microstructured substrate. All required chemicals\nare\
    \ pre-stored within the strip. The readout of a test is typically\ndone optically\
    \ and is quite often implemented as a color change\nin the detection area that\
    \ can be seen by the naked eye.\nGeneral principle\nThe ﬁrst immunoassay performed\
    \ in a capillary driven system\nwas reported in 1978.66 Based on this technique,\
    \ the commonly\nknown ‘‘over-the-counter pregnancy test’’ was introduced into\n\
    the market in the middle of the ‘80s. Today, this microﬂuidic\nplatform is commonly\
    \ designated as a ‘‘lateral ﬂow test\n(LAT)’’.13 Other terms are ‘‘test strip’’,\
    \ ‘‘immunochromato-\ngraphic strip’’, ‘‘immunocapillary tests’’ or ‘‘sol particle\
    \ immuno-\nassay (SPIA)’’.67 Astonishingly, hardly any publications from\na microﬂuidic\
    \ point of view or in terms of material classiﬁ-\ncation exist, and apparently\
    \ many ‘‘company secrets’’ are kept\nunpublished.68\nThe ‘‘standard LAT’’ consists\
    \ of an inlet port and a detec-\ntion window (Fig. 4(a)). The core comprises several\
    \ wettable\nmaterials providing all biochemicals for the test and enough\ncapillary\
    \ capacity to wick the sample through the whole strip.\nThe sample is introduced\
    \ into the device through the inlet into\na sample pad (Fig. 4(b)), which holds\
    \ back contaminations\nand dust. Through capillary action, the sample is transported\n\
    into the conjugate pad, where antibodies conjugated onto a\nsignal-generating\
    \ particle are rehydrated and bind to the\nantigens in the sample (Fig. 4(c)).\
    \ This binding reaction\ncontinues as the sample ﬂows in the incubation and detection\n\
    pad. On the test line a second type of antibody catches the\nparticles coated\
    \ with antigens, while a third type of antibody\ncatches particles which did not\
    \ bind to an analyte on the\ncontrol line. The control line shows a successfully\
    \ processed\ntest while the detection line shows the presence or absence of a\n\
    speciﬁc analyte (Fig. 4(d)). Typically the result becomes visible\nafter 2 to\
    \ 15 min.\nOver the last decades, LAT transformed from a simply\nconstructed device\
    \ into a more and more sophisticated\nhigh-tech platform with internal calibrations\
    \ and quantitative\nreadout by a hand-held reader (Fig. 5).69\nUnit operations\n\
    The diﬀerent pads in the test strip represent diﬀerent functions\nsuch as loading,\
    \ reagent pre-storage, reaction, detection,\nabsorption and liquid actuation.\
    \ The characteristic unit operation\nof LATs is the passive liquid transport via\
    \ capillary forces,\nacting in the capillaries of a ﬂeece, a microstructured surface,\n\
    or a single capillary. The absorption volume of an absorption\npad deﬁnes how\
    \ much sample is wicked through the strip and\nprovides metering of the sample.68\
    \ The sample pad usually\nconsists of cellulose or cross-linked silica and is\
    \ used for\nﬁltering of particles and cells as well as separating the analyte\n\
    from undesired or interfering molecules, which is absorbed in\nthe pad.70 The\
    \ conjugation pad is made of cross-linked silica\nand is used as dry-reagent storage\
    \ for antibodies speciﬁc to the\nantigen conjugated to the signal generating particle.\
    \ The\nconjugates are typically colored or ﬂuorescent nanoparticles\nwith sizes\
    \ up to 800 nm, which ﬂow without obstruction\nthrough the ﬂeeces together with\
    \ the sample. Most often\ncolloidal gold19 or latex71 and more rarely carbon,\
    \ selenium,\nquantum dots, or liposomes72 are the choice of nanoparticles.\nThe\
    \ length, material (mainly nitro-cellulose) and pore-size\n(50 nm to 12 mm, depending\
    \ on the applied nanoparticles) of\nthe detection and incubation pad deﬁne the\
    \ incubation time.68\nThe detection and enrichment of the conjugates is achieved\n\
    on the antibody-bearing lines. Analyte detection is performed\non the test line\
    \ and proof of assay validity on the control\nline. The readout is typically done\
    \ by naked eye for absence\n(1 colored line) or presence (2 colored lines) of\
    \ a minimum\nanalyte amount. A readout with a reader enables quantitative\nanalyte\
    \ detection.69,73 For multi-analyte detection68 or semi-\nquantitative setups74\
    \ several test lines are applied.\nWithin the last few years, new LAT designs\
    \ have been\ndeveloped in combination with the device-based readout in\nhand-held\
    \ systems. Here a complex capillary channel network\nprovides the liquid actuation\
    \ (Fig. 5). Antibodies conjugated\nto nanoparticles or special enzymes are pre-stored\
    \ at the inlet.\nThe incubation time is deﬁned by the ﬁlling time of the\ncapillary\
    \ network. Typically, readout is done quantitatively\nby ﬂuorescence or electrochemical\
    \ detection. The time-to-\nresult is usually several seconds. Blood glucose or\
    \ coagulation\nmonitoring are the most common applications for such quan-\ntitative\
    \ readouts.69 To accommodate aging, batch-to-batch\nvariations and sample diﬀerences,\
    \ and also to achieve higher\nprecision and yield of the assay, several internal\
    \ controls and\nFig. 4\nSchematic design of a lateral ﬂow test (according to ref.\

    \ performed during analysis by\nthe readout device.\nApplication examples\nLateral\
    \ ﬂow tests were among the ﬁrst successfully com-\nmercialized microﬂuidic products.\
    \ A huge amount of assays\nhave been developed on the capillary test strip platform\
    \ during\nthe past 30 years.75 Today, they serve a wide ﬁeld of applications,\n\
    including health biomarkers (pregnancy,13,76 heart attack,70\nblood glucose,77\
    \ metabolic disorders78), small molecules (drug\nabuse,16 toxins,79 antibiotics80),\
    \ infectious agents (anthrax,81\nsalmonella,82 viruses83), immunodiagnostics,84\
    \ RNA applications,81\nand even whole bacteria.85 Some of the more recent designs\n\
    and publications even show the detection of DNA83 without\nthe need of ampliﬁcation\
    \ by PCR, which would open yet\nanother vast ﬁeld of new applications. The ﬁrst\
    \ trials for\nmassively parallel screening in combination with microarrays\nwere\
    \ made in lateral ﬂow tests.70,81\nStrengths and limitations\nThe fact that 6\
    \ billion glucose test strips were sold in 200786\nalready indicates that the\
    \ LAT may be seen as a gold-standard\nmicroﬂuidic platform in terms of cost, handling\
    \ simplicity,\nrobustness, market presence and the number of implemented\nlab-on-a-chip\
    \ applications.68 The amount of sample and\nreagent consumption are moderate,\
    \ and the concept is mainly\nused for qualitative or semi-quantitative assays.\
    \ Especially the\ncomplete disposable test carriers with direct visual readout,\n\
    easy handling, and a time-to-result between seconds and\nseveral minutes are predestined\
    \ for untrained users.\nThe simplicity of the test strip is also its major drawback.\n\
    Assay protocols within capillary driven systems follow a ﬁxed\nprocess scheme\
    \ with a limited number of unit operations,\nimprinted in the microﬂuidic channel\
    \ design itself. Highly\nprecise liquid handling and metering is also extremely\n\
    challenging.68 The dependency of the purely capillary liquid\nactuation on the\
    \ sample properties can also be a major\nproblem, leading to false positive or\
    \ negative results14 or\ndecreased precision. New designs allow applications with\n\
    quantitative analysis, but require a readout device (mainly\nhand-held).69,73\
    \ High-throughput or screening applications\nare possible, but quite diﬃcult to\
    \ implement.\nIn total, the lateral ﬂow test is a well established platform\n\
    with a large but limited ﬁeld of applications and consequently\na benchmark for\
    \ the home-care and in vitro diagnostics (IVD)\nsector in terms of cost per assay\
    \ and simplicity.\nLinear actuated devices\nCharacterization of linear actuated\
    \ devices\nLinear actuated devices control liquid movement by mechanical\ndisplacement\
    \ of liquid e.g. by a plunger. Liquid control is\nmostly limited to a one-dimensional\
    \ liquid ﬂow in a linear\nfashion without branches or alternative liquid pathways.\n\
    Typically liquid calibrants and reaction buﬀers are pre-stored\nin pouches.\n\
    General principle\nOne of the ﬁrst examples of a linear actuated device was the\n\
    i-STATs for quantitative bedside testing, introduced in the\nearly 1990s by Abbott\
    \ Point of Care Inc., NJ, USA. It relied\non active liquid actuation by displacement.87\
    \ Compared to\nlateral ﬂow tests, this principle was one step ahead in result\n\
    quantiﬁcation and possible applications, but also in complexity\nof the processing\
    \ device and disposable test carrier.\nThe characteristic actuation principle\
    \ of the linear actuated\nplatform is the mechanical linear propulsion of liquids\
    \ with no\nbranching. Normally, the liquid actuation is performed by a\nplunger\
    \ which presses on a ﬂexible pouch, displacing its\ncontent. Another common attribute\
    \ is the pre-storage of all\nrequired reagents (liquid and dry) on the disposable\
    \ test\ncarrier (cartridge). Systems based on this platform thus oﬀer\nfully integrated\
    \ sample-to-result processing in a relatively\nshort time.\nUnit operations\n\
    Basically, the linear actuated platform relies on only two unit\noperations: liquid\
    \ transport and reagent storage. Liquid\ntransport is achieved by mechanical displacement\
    \ (e.g. with\na plunger). By pressing on ﬂexible compartments of the\nFig. 5\n\

    \ with according electrodes.\nA Ag/AgCl electrode is used as standard electrode\
    \ for calibration and analysis. Finally the analyte gets quantiﬁed by optical\
    \ or electrochemical\ndetection.\nThis journal is \x02c The Royal Society of Chemistry\

    \ by integrating pouches into the cartridge.\nMixing can also be realized on the\

    Application examples\nOne example of a linear actuated device is of course\nthe\
    \ previously mentioned i-STATs analyzer from Abbott\nPoint-of-Care.89 Using diﬀerent\
    \ disposable cartridges, several\nblood parameters (blood gases, electrolytes,\
    \ coagulation,\ncardiac markers, and hematology) can be determined with\nthe same\
    \ portable hand-held analyzer for automated sample\nprocessing and readout (Fig.\
    \ 6(a)). Since only the disposable\npolymer cartridge is contaminated with the\
    \ blood sample and\nthus has to be disposed after performing the diagnostic assay,\n\
    the analyzer device itself is reusable. Typical response times of\nthe system\
    \ are in the order of a few minutes.\nThe system features an integrated calibration\
    \ solution that\nis pre-stored in the disposable. The analysis process takes only\n\
    a few steps: As depicted in Fig. 6, the blood sample (a few\ndrops) is ﬁlled into\
    \ the cartridge by capillary forces (b), and\nplaced into the analyzer (c). First,\
    \ the calibrant solution is\nreleased and provides the baseline for an array of\
    \ thin-ﬁlm\nelectrodes integrated in the disposable. Then the sample is\npushed\
    \ into the measuring chamber and displaces the calibrant.\nThereby, the blood\
    \ parameters which can be determined by\nthe sensor array of the speciﬁc disposable\
    \ are measured and\npresented at the integrated display of the hand-held analyzer.\n\
    Several studies showed good agreement between laboratory\nresults and this POC-system.87,90,91\n\
    A second example is the lab-in-a-tube (Liatt) analyzer from\nIQuum.92 This bench-top\
    \ device with disposable test tubes\ncontains all necessary reagents for ampliﬁcation-based\
    \ nucleic\nacid tests. It integrates sample preparation, ampliﬁcation and\ndetection\
    \ and is a fully integrated sample-to-result platform\nwith response times between\
    \ 30 and 60 min. Handling of the\nplatform requires only a few steps: The sample\
    \ (e.g. 10 mL of\nwhole blood) is collected in the collection tube that is integrated\n\
    into the disposable, the barcode on the disposable is scanned,\nand the tube is\
    \ then inserted into the analyzer. The disposable\nfeatures compartmentalized\
    \ chambers in a tube which contain\ndiﬀerent reagents and can be connected via\
    \ peelable seals\n(Fig. 7). Liquid control is performed by actuators that com-\n\
    press the compartments, displacing the liquid into adjacent\nchambers.88 Sample\
    \ preparation includes a nucleic acid puri-\nﬁcation step: magnetic beads serve\
    \ as solid nucleic acid\nbinding phase and are controlled by a built-in magnet.\
    \ For\nnucleic acid ampliﬁcation, compartments can be heated and\nthe liquid is\
    \ transferred between two diﬀerent temperature\nzones thus cycling the sample.\
    \ The system is capable of\nreal-time ﬂuorescence readout.\nStrengths and limitations\n\
    The presented commercially available examples show that\nautomation and time-reduction\
    \ by microﬂuidic systems with\nactive processing devices can indeed be achieved\
    \ in a market-\nrelevant context. The potential of the linear actuated device\n\
    platform certainly lies in its simplicity and the ability for long-\nterm liquid\
    \ reagent storage. The presented application exam-\nples are portable and show\
    \ a high degree of assay integration,\nrequiring no external sample pre- or post-processing\
    \ steps.\nTypical liquid (sample) volumes handled on the platform are\nin the\
    \ range of 10–100 mL, which is adequate for point-of-care\ndiagnostic applications\
    \ (capillary blood from ﬁnger tip).\nWhile disposables can generally be mass-produced,\
    \ these\ncan become somewhat expensive due to the integration of\nsensors (i-STATs)\
    \ and liquid reagents (i-STATs and Liatt).\nFig. 6\nImages and handling procedure\

    tions is somewhat limited, in particular separation, switching,\nand aliquoting\
    \ as well as precise metering are diﬃcult to\nrealize. This hinders the implementation\
    \ of more complex\nassays and laboratory protocols in linear actuated systems,\n\
    such as integrated genotyping with a plurality of genetic\nmarkers or multiparameter\
    \ assays.\nPressure driven laminar ﬂow\nCharacterization of pressure driven laminar\
    \ ﬂow\nA pressure driven laminar ﬂow platform is characterized by\nliquid transport\
    \ mechanisms based on pressure gradients.\nTypically this leads to hydrodynamically\
    \ stable laminar ﬂow\nproﬁles in microchannels. There are a broad range of diﬀerent\n\
    implementations in terms of using external or internal pressure\nsources such\
    \ as using syringes, pumps or micropumps, gas\nexpansion principles, pneumatic\
    \ displacement of membranes,\netc. The samples and reagents are processed by injecting\n\
    them into the chip inlets either batch-wise or in a continuous\nmode.\nGeneral\
    \ principle\nAs mentioned earlier, liquid ﬂow in microchannels is typically\n\
    strictly laminar over a wide range of ﬂow rates and channel\ndimensions. Pressure\
    \ driven laminar ﬂow oﬀers several\nopportunities for assay implementation:\n\x03\
    \ Predictable velocity proﬁles\n\x03 Controllable diﬀusion mixing\n\x03 Stable\
    \ phase arrangements, e.g. in co-ﬂowing streams\nThese advantages have been utilized\
    \ for several lab-on-a-\nchip applications in the past. Probably the oldest example\
    \ is\nthe so-called ‘‘hydrodynamic focusing’’ technology,93 used to\nalign cells\
    \ in continuous ﬂow for analysis and sorting in ﬂow\ncytometry.94,95 Today, many\
    \ technologies still use laminar\nﬂow eﬀects for particle counting96 or separation.97–101\
    \ However,\npressure driven laminar ﬂow can also be utilized to implement\nother\
    \ (bio-)chemical assays for lab-on-a-chip applications\nas described within this\
    \ section. In particular, nucleic acid-\nbased diagnostic systems received a great\
    \ deal of interest in\nthe last decade, since the ﬁrst introduction of a combined\n\
    microﬂuidic PCR and capillary electrophoresis in 1996 by\nWoolley et al.102\n\
    Unit operations\nThe basic unit operation on the pressure driven laminar ﬂow\n\
    platform is the contacting of at least two liquid streams at a\nmicroﬂuidic channel\
    \ junction (see Fig. 8). This leads to con-\ntrolled diﬀusional mixing at the\
    \ phase interface, e.g. for\ninitiation of a (bio-)chemical reaction.103 It can\
    \ also be applied\nfor the lateral focusing of micro-objects like particles or\
    \ cells in\nthe channel.93 The required ‘‘ﬂow focusing’’ channel network\nconsists\
    \ of one central and two symmetric side channels,\nconnected at a junction to\
    \ form a common outlet channel.\nBy varying the ratio of the ﬂow rates, the lateral\
    \ width of the\ncentral streamline within the common outlet channel can be\nadjusted\n\
    very\naccurately.\nConsequently,\nmicro-objects\nsuspended in the liquid ﬂowing\
    \ through the central channel\nare focused and aligned to this well-deﬁned streamline\
    \ position.\nIf the available duration for a (bio-)chemical reaction needs to\n\
    be limited, the contacted liquid streams can again be separated\nfurther downstream\
    \ as shown in ref. 103.\nFor the separation of micro-objects like living cells\
    \ or micro-\nbeads from a liquid stream, several technologies have been\npresented\
    \ relying either on geometrical barriers,103 or magnetic\nforces.104,105 Sorting\
    \ of micro-objects, i.e. the selective separation\nbased on size or any other\
    \ feature, was implemented using\nmagnetic forces,106,107 acoustic principles,108\
    \ dielectrophoresis,109\nor hydrodynamic principles97–99,110 on the pressure driven\
    \ lami-\nnar ﬂow platform. The common principle of all these techno-\nlogies is\
    \ a force acting selectively on the suspended micro-objects\n(particles or cells),\
    \ while the liquid stream stays more or less\nunaﬀected.\nA great number of valving\
    \ principles exist on the pressure\ndriven laminar ﬂow platform, summarized in\
    \ a review by Oh\nand Ahn.37 Active as well as passive solutions have been\npresented.\
    \ However, no standards have emerged so far, so\nthe choice and implementation\
    \ of valves remains a diﬃculty\non this platform. A possible approach is to transfer\
    \ the valving\nfunctionality oﬀ-chip,111 thus decreasing the complexity and\n\
    cost of the disposable.\nApplication examples\nOne recently established technology\
    \ on the pressure driven\nlaminar ﬂow platform is so called ‘‘phase transfer magneto-\n\
    phoresis (PTM)’’.104 Magnetic microparticles ﬂowing through\na microﬂuidic channel\
    \ network are attracted by a rotating oﬀ-\nchip permanent magnet, and can consequently\
    \ be transferred\nbetween diﬀerent co-ﬂowing liquid streams. As a ﬁrst applica-\n\
    tion, DNA puriﬁcation with magnetic beads was success-\nfully demonstrated with\
    \ a yield of approximately 25%104\n(ﬁrst prototype). Thus, this system provides\
    \ continuous\nDNA-extraction capability which could serve as an automated\nsample\
    \ preparation step for ﬂow-through PCR, in e.g. bio-\nprocess monitoring (of fermentation)\
    \ applications.\nOther microﬂuidic applications based on the manipulation of\n\
    magnetic microparticles with external permanent magnets have\nbeen shown. One\
    \ example is the free-ﬂow magnetophoresis,106,107\nwhich can be utilized to sort\
    \ magnetic microparticles by size.\nFig. 8\nContacting on the laminar ﬂow platform.\
    \ Three diﬀerent\nliquid streams are symmetrically contacted at an intersection\

    \ However, a totally integrated\nsystem remains a challenge, since the integration\

    \ min.114 The assay was performed on a pressure\ndriven four layer glass/PDMS\
    \ chip with elastomeric valves.\nTemperature cycling for PCR was achieved by IR\
    \ radiation.\nOnly the sample lysis step was not integrated in the micro-\nﬂuidic\
    \ chip. Detection of Bacillus anthracis from infected mice\nand Bordetella pertussis\
    \ from a clinical sample was successfully\ndemonstrated.\nAn integrated mTAS system\

    integrated\nporous\npolymer\nmonoliths\nand silica particles for lysis and nucleic\
    \ acid isolation\nwas used for detection (Fig. 9). A custom-made base device\n\
    provided liquid actuation and oﬀ-chip valving by stopping\nliquid ﬂow from the\
    \ exits of the chip, utilizing the incompressi-\nbility of liquids. Detection\
    \ of 1.25 \x04 106 cells of Bacillus\nsubtilis was demonstrated with all assay\
    \ steps performed\non-chip.\nStrengths and limitations\nOne strength of the platform\
    \ lies in its potential for continuous\nprocessing of samples. Continuous sample\
    \ processing is of\nutmost importance for online monitoring of clinical para-\n\
    meters, process control in fermentation, water quality control\nor cell sorting.\
    \ Typically one or a few parameters are\nmonitored. The application examples showed\

    \ The platform is in principle\ncompatible\nwith\npolymer\nmass-production\ntechnologies\n\
    such as injection molding, enabling inexpensive disposable\nmicroﬂuidic chips.\n\
    A diﬃculty of the platform is the necessity to connect the\npressure source to\
    \ the (disposable) chip, which decreases the\nportability and requires additional\
    \ manual steps. Another\nchallenge is the Taylor dispersion115 of streamwise dispersed\n\
    samples which can make it hard to accurately track analyte\nconcentrations. Unit\
    \ operations on the platform are optimized\nfor mixing and separation processes\
    \ and somewhat limited in\nother aspects such as aliquoting.\nMicroﬂuidic large\
    \ scale integration\nCharacterization of microﬂuidic large scale integration\n\
    Microﬂuidic large scale integration describes a microﬂuidic\nchannel circuitry\
    \ with chip-integrated microvalves based on\nﬂexible membranes between a liquid-guiding\
    \ layer and a\npneumatic control-channel layer. The microvalves are closed\nor\
    \ open corresponding to the pneumatic pressure applied to\nthe control-channels.\
    \ Just by combining several microvalves\nmore complex units like micropumps, mixers,\
    \ multiplexers,\netc. can be built up with hundreds of units on one single\nchip.\n\
    General principle\nThe microﬂuidic large scale integration (LSI) platform arose\
    \ in\n1993.116 At the same time, a novel fabrication technology for\nmicroﬂuidic\
    \ channels, called soft lithography made its appearance.\nSoft lithography is\
    \ based on the use of elastomeric stamps,\nmolds and conformable photomasks to\
    \ fabricate and replicate\nmicrostructures.117 Using this technology, the monolithic\n\
    fabrication of all necessary ﬂuidic components within one\nsingle\nelastomer\n\
    material\n(polydimethylsiloxane,\nPDMS)\nbecame possible, similar to the silicon-based\
    \ technology in\nmicroelectronics. PDMS, also known as silicone elastomer, is\n\
    an inexpensive material oﬀering several advantages compared\nto silicon or glass.\
    \ It is a cheap, rubber-like elastomer with\ngood optical transparency and biocompatibility.\
    \ A detailed\nreview on the use of PDMS for diﬀerent ﬁelds of applications\ncan\
    \ be found in ref. 118.\nThe strength of the technology became obvious, when\n\
    Stephen Quake’s group expanded the technology towards\nFig. 9\nChip for integrated\

    \ process, MSL.119 With this\ntechnology, several layers of PDMS can be hermetically\n\
    bonded on top of each other resulting in a monolithic,\nmultilayer PDMS structure.\
    \ This enables the fabrication of\nmicroﬂuidic chips with densely integrated microvalves,\
    \ pumps\nand other functional elements. Today, this technology is\npushed forward\
    \ by the company Fluidigm Corp., CA, USA.\nUnit operations\nBased on the high\
    \ elasticity of PDMS, the elementary micro-\nﬂuidic unit operation is a valve\
    \ which is typically made of a\nplanar glass substrate and two layers of PDMS\
    \ on top of each\nother. One of the two elastomer layers contains the ﬂuidic\n\
    ducts while the other elastomer layer features pneumatic\ncontrol channels. To\
    \ realize a microﬂuidic valve, a pneumatic\ncontrol channel crosses a ﬂuidic duct\
    \ as depicted in Fig. 10(a).\nA pressure p applied to the control channel squeezes\
    \ the\nelastomer into the lower layer, where it blocks the liquid\nﬂow. Because\
    \ of the small size of this valve, on the order\nof 100 \x04 100 mm2, a single\
    \ integrated ﬂuidic circuit can\naccommodate thousands of valves. Comparable to\
    \ developments\nin microelectronics, this approach is called ‘‘microﬂuidic large\n\
    scale integration’’ (LSI).120\nThe valve technology called NanoFlext (Fluidigm)\
    \ is the\ncore technology of the complete platform. For example, by\nplacing two\
    \ such valves at the two arms of a T-shaped channel\na ﬂuidic switch for the routing\
    \ of liquid ﬂows between several\nadjacent channels can be realized. Liquid transport\
    \ within the\nﬂuid channels can be accomplished by external pumps\nwhile the PDMS\
    \ multilayer device merely works passively as\nintegrated valves, or an integrated\
    \ pumping mechanism can be\nachieved by combining several micro-valves and actuating\n\
    them in a peristaltic sequence (Fig. 10(d)).\nMetering of liquid volumes can be\
    \ achieved by crossed ﬂuid\nchannels and a set of microvalves. Therefore, the\
    \ liquid is\ninitially loaded into a certain ﬂuid channel and afterwards\nsegmented\
    \ into separated liquid compartments by pressurizing\nthe control channel.\nAlso\
    \ mixing can be realized using the above described\npumping mechanism by the subsequent\
    \ injection of the liquids\ninto a ﬂuidic loop (Fig. 10(e)) through the left inlet\
    \ (right outlet\nvalve is closed). Afterwards, the inlet and outlet valves are\n\
    closed and the three control channels on the orbit of the mixing\nloop are displaced\
    \ with a peristaltic actuation scheme leading to\na circulation of the mixture\
    \ within the loop.122 Thereby the\nliquids are mixed and can be ﬂushed out of\
    \ the mixer by a\nwashing liquid afterwards. Using this mixing scheme, the\nincrease\
    \ of reaction kinetics by nearly two orders of magnitude\nhas been demonstrated\
    \ in surface binding assays.123\nHowever, the key feature to tap the full potential\
    \ of the\nlarge scale integration approach is the multiplexing technology\nallowing\
    \ for the control of N ﬂuid channels with only 2 log2 N\ncontrol channels. Based\
    \ on this principle, a microﬂuidic\nstorage device with 1000 independent compartments\
    \ of\napproximately 250 pL volume and 3574 microvalves has been\ndemonstrated.120\n\
    Application examples\nOne application example on the microﬂuidic LSI platform\
    \ is\nthe extraction of nucleic acids (NA) from a small amount of\ncells124,125\
    \ for cell-based assays. For the extraction of NA from\na cell suspension, the\
    \ cell membrane has to be destroyed ﬁrst\n(chemical lysis of the cell). Afterwards,\
    \ the NA are speciﬁcally\nseparated from the residual cell components using a\
    \ solid\nphase extraction method based on a NA aﬃnity column\n(paramagnetic beads).\
    \ This extraction protocol is completely\nimplemented on the microﬂuidic platform\
    \ using the basic unit\noperations for valving, metering, mixing and switching\
    \ of\nliquids. Measurable amounts of mRNA were extracted in an\nautomated fashion\
    \ from as little as a single mammalian cell\nand recovered from the chip.124 Based\
    \ on this technology, the\ndevelopment of a nucleic acid processor for complete\
    \ single\ncell analysis is under way.126–128\nAlso many other applications have\
    \ been implemented on the\nLSI platform over the last few years: protein crystallization,129\n\
    immunoassays,130 automated culturing of cells131 or multi-\ncellular organisms132\
    \ and DNA synthesizing.133\nFrom a commercial perspective, Fluidigm\nCorp. has\n\
    launched three diﬀerent products based on the large scale\nintegration platform\
    \ within the last years: the BioMarkTM\ntechnology for molecular biology (e.g.\
    \ TaqMans assay), the\nTOPAZs\nsystem\nfor\nprotein\ncrystallography,\nand\nthe\n\
    Fluidigms EP1 system for genetic analysis. The EP1 system\nin particular, bears\
    \ great potential for high-throughput screening\napplications such as sequencing.134\
    \ multiparallel PCR,135\nsingle-cell analysis,136 siRNA-137 or antibody-screening,138\n\
    kinase-139 or expression-proﬁling.140\nStrengths and limitations\nThe microﬂuidic\
    \ LSI platform certainly has the potential to\nbecome one of the most versatile\
    \ microﬂuidic platforms\nespecially for high-throughput applications. It is a\
    \ ﬂexible\nand conﬁgurable technology which stands out by its suitability\nfor\
    \ large scale integration. The PDMS fabrication technology\nis comparably cheap\
    \ and robust, and thus suitable to fabricate\ndisposables. Reconﬁgured layouts\
    \ can be assembled from a\nsmall set of validated unit operations and design iteration\n\
    periods for new chips are in the order of days. Some of the\nsystem functions\
    \ are hardware deﬁned by the ﬂuidic circuitry\nbut others like process sequences\
    \ can easily be programmed\nexternally.\nLimitations of the platform are related\
    \ to the material\nproperties of PDMS: for example, chemicals which the\nelastomer\
    \ is not inert to cannot be processed, and elevated\ntemperatures such as in micro-reaction\
    \ technology are not\nFig. 10\nRealization of the main unit operations on the\

    \ in the\nﬁeld of point-of-care diagnostics, where a hand-held device is\noften\
    \ required, the LSI platform seems not to be beneﬁcial at\nthe moment. Thereto\

    \ footprint, which is\nof course technically feasible, but the costs would be\
    \ higher in\ncomparison to other platform concepts. However, as a ﬁrst\nstep towards\
    \ downsizing the liquid control equipment, the use\nof a Braille system was successfully\
    \ demonstrated.141\nSegmented ﬂow microﬂuidics\nCharacterization of segmented\
    \ ﬂow microﬂuidics\nSegmented ﬂow microﬂuidics describes the principle of using\n\
    small liquid plugs and/or droplets immersed in a second\nimmiscible continuous\
    \ phase (gas or liquid) as stable micro-\nconﬁnements within closed microﬂuidic\
    \ channels. Those\nmicro-conﬁnements are in the picolitre to microlitre volume\n\
    range. They can be transported by pressure gradients and can\nbe merged, split,\
    \ sorted, and processed without any dispersion\nin microﬂuidic channels.\nGeneral\
    \ principle\nThe segmented ﬂow microﬂuidic platform relies on a multiphase\nﬂuid\
    \ ﬂow through microchannels. Generally, the applied\ntechnologies can be divided\
    \ into the following categories:\n\x03 2-phase gas–liquid\n\x03 2-phase liquid–liquid\n\
    \x03 3-phase liquid–liquid\nIn principal, droplets of a dispersed liquid phase\
    \ are immersed\nin a second continuous gas (2-phase gas–liquid) or liquid\n(2-phase\
    \ liquid–liquid) phase within a microchannel. Thereby,\nthe inner liquid droplets\
    \ are separated by the continuous\ncarrier liquid along the channel. If the size\
    \ of the inner phase\nexceeds the cross sectional dimensions of the channel, the\n\
    droplets are squeezed to form non-spherical segments, also\ncalled ‘‘plugs’’.\
    \ Following this ﬂow scheme, the platform is\ncalled segmented ﬂow microﬂuidics.\n\
    In some applications, the stability of the phase-arrangement\nis increased by\
    \ additional surfactants as the third phase,\nstabilizing the plug interface (3-phase\
    \ liquid–liquid).142 An\nexternal pressure is applied for the transport of the\
    \ plugs. A\ncomprehensive general discussion of the platform can also be\nfound\
    \ in recent review papers.29,143,144\nUnit operations\nThe most elementary unit\
    \ operation on the segmented ﬂow\nplatform is the initial generation of the droplets\
    \ (see Table 4).\nThis step can also be considered a metering, since the liquid\n\
    volumes involved in the subsequent reaction within the droplet\nare deﬁned during\
    \ the droplet formation process. Generally,\ntwo diﬀerent microﬂuidic structures\
    \ have been reported for a\ncontrolled and continuous generation of droplets:\
    \ the ﬂow\nfocusing structure as depicted in Fig. 8145,146 and the T-shaped\n\
    junction,147,148 respectively. The size of the droplet is inﬂuenced\nby the strength\
    \ of the shear forces at the channel junction\n(higher shear forces lead to smaller\
    \ droplets) for both droplet\nformation mechanisms.\nTo use droplets inside channels\
    \ as reaction conﬁnements,\nthe diﬀerent reactants have to be loaded into the\
    \ droplet.\nTherefore, a method to combine 3 diﬀerent sample liquid\nstreams by\
    \ a sheath ﬂow arrangement with subsequent injection\nas a common droplet into\
    \ the carrier ﬂuid has been shown by\nthe group of Rustem F. Ismagilov at the\
    \ University of Chicago,\nIL, USA149 (see Fig. 11). Diﬀerent concentrations and\
    \ ratios of\ntwo reagent sub-streams plus a dilution buﬀer merge into one\ndroplet\
    \ and perform a so called on-chip dilution.150 The mixing\nratios can be adjusted\
    \ by the volume ﬂow ratio of the three\nstreams.\nUsing\na\ncombination\nof\n\
    two\nopposing\nT-junctions\nconnected to the same channel, the formation of droplets\
    \ of\nalternating composition has been demonstrated.151 Using a\nsimilar technique,\
    \ the injection of an additional reactant into a\nliquid plug moving through the\
    \ channel at an additional\ndownstream T-junction has been demonstrated.152 Not\
    \ only\nliquid chemical reagents but also other components like cells\nhave been\
    \ loaded into droplets.153\nThe merging of diﬀerent sized droplets showing diﬀerent\n\
    velocities to single droplets has been demonstrated successfully.149\nIn the same\
    \ work, the controlled splitting of droplets at a channel\nbranching point has\
    \ been shown. Using a similar method, the\nformation of droplet emulsions with\
    \ controlled volume fractions\nand drop sizes has been realized.154\nMixing inside\
    \ the droplets can be accelerated by a recirculating\nﬂow due to shear forces\
    \ induced by the motion along the\nstationary channel wall.155 This eﬀect is even\
    \ more pro-\nnounced if two liquids of diﬀering viscosities are mixed within\n\

    serpentine\nmicrochannels.157\nWithin\neach\nchannel\ncurvature the orientation\
    \ between the phase pattern in the\ndroplet and the direction of motion is changed\
    \ so that\nthe inner recirculation leads to stretching and folding of the\nphases.\
    \ Under favorable conditions, sub-millisecond mixing\ncan be achieved and has\
    \ been employed for multi-step syn-\nthesis of nanoparticles.152 A detailed and\
    \ theoretical description\nof this mixing eﬀect is given in ref. 158.\nBesides\
    \ the mixing within liquid droplets dispersed into\nanother liquid carrier phase,\
    \ mixing within the carrier phase\ncan also be accelerated by a segmented ﬂow.\
    \ The injection of\ngas-bubbles into a continuous liquid stream forming a\nsegmented\
    \ gas–liquid ﬂow has been described by Klavs Jensen\nand his group at MIT.159,160\
    \ The gas bubbles are introduced\ninto the liquid ﬂow and initiate recirculation\
    \ ﬂows within the\nliquid segments in between due to the motion along the\nchannel\
    \ wall. The gas bubbles can be completely separated\nfrom the liquid stream using\
    \ a planar capillary separator after\nthe reaction is ﬁnished. Using that technology,\
    \ the synthesis of\ncolloidal silica particles has been demonstrated.161 Another\n\
    microﬂuidic mixing scheme based on a gas–liquid segmented\nﬂow uses an additional\
    \ repeated separation and re-combining\nof the channel.162\nThe incubation time\
    \ of the reagents combined inside a droplet\nat the injection position can easily\
    \ be calculated at a certain point\nof observation from the travelling distance\
    \ of the droplet divided\nby the droplet velocity. Thus, the incubation time can\
    \ be\ntemporally monitored by simply scanning along the channel\nfrom the injection\
    \ point to positions farther downstream. This\nis a unique feature of the platform\
    \ and enables the investigation\nof chemical reaction kinetics on the order of\
    \ only a few milli-\nseconds.150 On the other hand, also stable incubation times\
    \ on\nthe order of a week have been demonstrated.163 This is enabled by\nseparating\
    \ the droplet compartments with a carrier ﬂuid that\nprevents evaporation and\
    \ diﬀusion. Using this approach, several\n60 nL liquid droplets containing one\
    \ or a few cells were generated\nwithin a microﬂuidic chip and afterwards ﬂushed\
    \ into a Teﬂon\ncapillary tube for cultivation. The cell densities were still\
    \ as high as\nin conventional systems after 144 h of growth within the droplets.\n\
    Additional unit operations based on charged droplets and\nelectric ﬁelds have\
    \ been added to the segmented ﬂow platform\nby David A. Weitz and co-workers.164\
    \ Using dielectro-\nphoresis, the sorting of single droplets out of a droplet\
    \ train\n(switching) at rates up to 4 kHz has been shown.165 The\nsegmented ﬂow\
    \ technology augmented with electric ﬁeld-based\nunit operations is currently\
    \ commercialized by the company\nRaindance Technologies, MA, USA.\nApplication\
    \ examples\nTable 4 gives an overview of the microﬂuidic unit operations\nand\
    \ applications that have been already implemented on the\nsegmented ﬂow platform.\
    \ They all take advantage of the\nenclosed reaction conﬁnement within the droplets,\
    \ either for\nanalytical applications (cell analysis, single organism analysis,\n\
    DNA assays, drug screening, protein crystallization) or\nchemical synthesis.\n\
    Protein crystallization, for example, is realized on the\nsegmented ﬂow platform\
    \ by forming droplets out of three liquids,\nnamely the protein solution, a buﬀer\
    \ and the precipitant\nwithin oil as the carrier phase.174,180 The precipitant\
    \ con-\ncentration inside the droplet is adjusted via the buﬀer and\nprecipitant\n\
    ﬂow\nrates,\nrespectively.\nTherewith,\ndiﬀerent\nconcentrations are generated\
    \ and transferred into a glass\ncapillary for later X-ray analysis.175 The eﬀect\
    \ of mixing on\nthe nucleation of protein crystallization has been investigated\n\
    by combining the described crystallization structure with a\nserpentine mixing\
    \ channel.179 Fast mixing has been found to\nbe favorable for the formation of\
    \ well-crystallized proteins\nwithin the droplets.178\nRecently, a chip for rapid\
    \ detection and drug susceptibility\nscreening of bacteria has also been presented167\
    \ as one example\nof a high-throughput screening application. The channel\ndesign\
    \ is depicted in Fig. 11. Plugs of the bacterial solution,\na ﬂuorescent viability\
    \ indicator, and the drugs to be screened\nare injected into the carrier ﬂuid.\
    \ The diﬀerent drug solutions\n(antibiotics: vancomycin (VCM), levoﬂoxixin (LVF),\
    \ ampicillin\n(AMP), cefoxitin (CFX), oxicillin (OXA), and erythromycin\n(ERT))\
    \ are separated by an air spacer plug within the drug\ntrial channel. Plugs containing\
    \ VCM were used as baseline,\nbecause VCM inhibited this Staphylococcus aureus\
    \ strain in\nmacro-scale experiments. No plugs containing VCM or LVF\nhad a ﬂuorescence\
    \ increase greater than three times the base-\nline, indicating that MRSA was\
    \ sensitive to these antibiotics.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe main advantages\
    \ of the segmented ﬂow microﬂuidic\nplatform are the small volume liquid segments\
    \ (controllable\nwith high precision in the nanolitre range), acting as reaction\n\
    conﬁnements. This leads to little reagent consumption as well as\na high number\
    \ of diﬀerent experiments that can be performed\nwithin a short period of time,\
    \ which makes the platform a\npromising candidate for high-throughput screening\
    \ applications,\ne.g. in the pharmaceutical industry. The quasi-batch-mode\noperation\
    \ scheme within nanolitre to microlitre-sized droplets\nis beneﬁcial since it\
    \ represents a consistent further development\nof classic assay protocols in e.g.\
    \ well plates. The large number of\nexisting unit operations enables the eﬀective\
    \ manipulation of the\nliquid segments. Furthermore, the completely enclosed liquid\n\
    droplets allow the incubation and storage of liquid assay results\nover a long\
    \ period of time without evaporation.\nHowever, a limitation of the platform is\
    \ that handling of\nsmall overall sample volumes is not possible due to the volume\n\
    consumption during the run-in phase of the ﬂow within the\nmicrochannels. This\
    \ and the manual connection to external\npumps renders the platform less suitable\
    \ for point-of-care\napplications. Another drawback is the need for surfactants\n\
    that are required for high stability of the plugs. They some-\ntimes interfere\
    \ with the (bio-)chemical reaction within the\nplugs and thus can limit the number\
    \ of possible applications\non the platform.\nCentrifugal microﬂuidics\nCharacterization\

    \ centrifugal\nforce, Euler force, Coriolis force and capillary force. Assays\n\
    are implemented as a sequence of liquid operations arranged\nfrom radially inward\
    \ positions to radially outward positions.\nMicroﬂuidic unit operations include\
    \ metering, switching,\naliquoting, etc.\nGeneral principle\nThe approach of using\
    \ centrifugal forces to automate sample\nprocessing dates back to the end of the\
    \ 1960s.181 At that time,\ncentrifugal analyzers were ﬁrst used to transfer and\
    \ mix a\nseries of samples and reagents in the volume range from 1 mL\nto 110\
    \ mL into several cuvettes, followed by spectrometric\nmonitoring\nof\nreactions\n\
    and\nreal-time\ndata\nprocessing.\nControlling microﬂuidic networks by just one\
    \ rotary axis has\nan obvious charm to it, since no connections to the macro-\n\
    world, such as pumps, are required. Moreover, the required\ncentrifugal base devices\
    \ can be simple and therefore robust.\nRotational frequencies can be controlled\
    \ very well and a\nradially constant centrifugal pseudo-force guarantees pulse-\n\
    free liquid ﬂow. Scientiﬁc work and applications based on\ncentrifugal microﬂuidics\
    \ have continuously been published\nsince these early beginnings, although most\
    \ attention to the\ntopic arose again in the last two decades, as summarized in\n\
    several reviews.121,182–184 However, the concept is still some-\nwhat exotic compared\
    \ to the large number of pressure driven\nsystems existing today, possibly attributed\
    \ to the diﬃculty of\nmonitoring liquid ﬂow under rotation and the dependency\
    \ of\nliquid ﬂow on microchannel surface quality.185 This results in\nhigh initial\
    \ investment in monitoring equipment and proto-\ntyping lines. Nevertheless, considerable\
    \ advances towards\nintegrated systems have been made in the last few decades.\n\
    In the beginning of the 1990s, the company Abaxis186\ndeveloped the portable clinical\
    \ chemistry analyzer.187 This\nsystem consists of a plastic disposable rotating\
    \ cartridge for\nprocessing of the specimen, preloading of dried reagents on\n\
    the cartridge, and an analyzer instrument for actuation and\nreadout.\nA next\
    \ generation of centrifugal devices emerged from the\ntechnical capabilities oﬀered\
    \ by microfabrication and micro-\nﬂuidic technologies.188–191 Length scales of\
    \ the ﬂuidic structures\nin the range of a few hundred micrometres allow parallel\n\
    processing of up to a hundred units assembled on a single\ndisk. This enables\
    \ high throughput by highly parallel and\nautomated liquid handling. In addition,\
    \ assay volumes can\nbe reduced to less than 1 mL. Particular ﬁelds such as drug\n\
    screening,189 where precious samples are analyzed, beneﬁt\nfrom these low assay\
    \ volumes.\nToday, many basic unit operations for liquid control on the\ncentrifugal\
    \ microﬂuidic platform are known and new ones are\ncontinuously being developed,\
    \ enabling a number of applications\nin the ﬁelds of point-of-care testing, research,\
    \ and security.\nUnit operations\nLiquid transport is initiated by the centrifugal\
    \ force, fx, directed\noutwards in the radial direction. The centrifugal force\
    \ can be\nscaled over a wide range by the frequency of rotation o.\nTogether with\
    \ a tunable ﬂow resistance of the ﬂuidic channels,\nsmall ﬂow rates in the order\
    \ of nL s\x051 as well as high\nthroughput continuous ﬂows up to 1 mL s\x051\n\
    192 can be\ngenerated. Therefore, scaling of ﬂow rates over 6 orders of\nmagnitude\
    \ independent of the chemical composition, ionic\nstrength, conductivity or pH\
    \ value of the liquid can be\naccomplished, opening a wide ﬁeld of possible applications.\n\
    Also, liquid transport at rest can be achieved by capillary\nforces, depending\
    \ on the channel geometry and the wetting\nproperties of the liquid.\nLiquid valves\
    \ can be realized by several diﬀerent micro-\nﬂuidic structures on the centrifugal\
    \ platform. In general, they\ncan be purely passive, as depicted in Fig. 12, or\
    \ require an\nactive component outside the microﬂuidic substrate. First, the\n\
    passive valves will be summarized: A very simple valve arises at\nthe sudden expansion\
    \ of a microﬂuidic channel, e.g. into a\nbigger reservoir: the geometric capillary\
    \ valve (Fig. 12(a)). The\nvalving mechanism of this capillary valve is based\
    \ on the\nenergy barrier for the proceeding of the meniscus, which is\npinned\
    \ at the sharp corner. This barrier can be overcome\nunder rotation due to the\
    \ centrifugal pressure load of the\noverlying liquid plug.189,193,194 For a given\
    \ liquid plug\nposition, length, liquid surface tension and contact angle, the\n\
    valve is inﬂuenced by only the frequency of rotation, and a\ncritical burst frequency\
    \ oc can be attributed to every valve\nstructure. Another possibility to stop\
    \ the liquid ﬂow within a\nchannel is the local hydrophobic coating of the channel\
    \ walls\n(hydrophobic valve) (Fig. 12(b)).183,195–197 This valve is opened\nas\
    \ soon as the rotational frequency exceeds the critical burst\nfrequency oc for\
    \ this geometry and surface properties. A third\nmethod (Fig. 12(c)) utilizes\
    \ the stopping eﬀect of compressed\nair in an unvented receiving chamber. This\
    \ centrifugo-\npneumatic valve stops liquid up to much higher pressures\nthan\
    \ capillary valves for small receiving chamber volumes\n(r40 mL). The air counter-pressure\
    \ in the unvented receiving\nchamber can be overcome at high centrifugal frequencies,\
    \ at\nwhich the liquid–air interface becomes unstable and enables a\nphase exchange,\
    \ permitting liquid ﬂow.198,199 Another method\nis based on a hydrophilic S-shaped\
    \ siphon channel (hydrophilic\nsiphon valve), wherein the two liquid–gas interfaces\
    \ are lever-\naged at high frequencies of rotation183 (Fig. 12(d)). Below\na critical\
    \ frequency oc however, the right-hand meniscus\nproceeds beyond the bend, thus\
    \ allowing the centrifugal force\nto drain the complete liquid from the siphon.\n\

    \ on 25 January 2010. Downloaded on 3/26/2024 5:46:27 PM. \nOne example of an\
    \ active valve is an irradiation-triggered\n‘‘sacriﬁcial’’ valve published by\
    \ Samsung Advanced Institute of\nTechnology (Laser Irradiated Ferrowax Microvalve,\
    \ LIFM).200 A\nferrowax plug is used to close channels oﬀ during the fabrication\n\
    of the microﬂuidic network. A laser source in the processing\ndevice can be utilized\
    \ to melt the ferrowax plug and thus allow\nliquid passage (normally-closed valve).\
    \ A modiﬁcation of this\ntechnique also allows closing channels oﬀ by illuminating\
    \ a\nferrowax reservoir that expands into a channel and seals it\n(normally-open\
    \ valve). An advantage of this valve is that it\nallows liquid control depending\
    \ solely on the moment of the\nlaser actuation, so it does not depend on the rotational\
    \ speed or\nliquid properties. This comes at the cost of a more complex\nproduction\
    \ process and base device. An alternative approach for\nthe active control of\
    \ liquid ﬂows on the centrifugal platform is\nfollowed by the company Spin-X technologies,\
    \ Switzerland. A\nlaser beam individually opens ﬂuidic interconnects between\n\
    diﬀerent channel layers on a plastic substrate (Virtual Laser\nValve, VLV). This\
    \ enables online control of the liquid handling\nprocess on the rotating module\
    \ for adjusting metered volumes\nand incubation times within a wide range. Due\
    \ to this, the\nSpin-X platform works with a standardized ﬂuidic cartridge that\n\
    is not custom made for each speciﬁc application, but can be\nprogrammed online\
    \ during a running process.\nCombining one of the above-mentioned valve principles\
    \ at\nthe radially outward end of a chamber with an overﬂow\nchannel at the radially\
    \ inward end results in a metering\nstructure.201 The metered liquid portion is\
    \ directly set by\nthe volume capacity of the chamber. With highly precise\nmicro-fabrication\
    \ technologies, small coeﬃcients of variations\n(CV, standard deviation divided\
    \ by mean value), e.g. a\nCV o 5% for a volume of 300 nL202 and also metered volumes\n\
    of as little as 5 nL have been achieved.196 By arranging\nseveral metering structures\
    \ interconnected via an appropriate\ndistribution channel, simple aliquoting structures\
    \ can be\nrealized.198,203 These structures split a sample into several\ndeﬁned\
    \ volumes, enabling the conduction of several assays\nfrom the same sample in\
    \ parallel.\nDiﬀerent mixing schemes have been proposed on the\ncentrifugal\n\
    platform.\nConsidering\nmixing\nof\ncontinuous\nliquid ﬂows within a radially\
    \ directed rotating channel, the\nperpendicular Coriolis force automatically generates\
    \ a transverse\nliquid ﬂow.192 A continuous centrifugal micromixer, utilizing\n\
    the Coriolis stirring eﬀect, showed an increasing mixing\nquality towards very\
    \ high volume throughputs of up to\n1 mL s\x051 per channel192 (Coriolis mixer).\
    \ Besides the mixing\nof continuous liquid ﬂows, also the homogenization of discrete\n\
    and small liquid volumes located in chambers is of importance\nespecially when\
    \ analyzing small sample volumes (batch-mode\nmixing), since homogenous mixing\
    \ obviously speeds up diﬀusion-\nlimited chemical and biological reactions due\
    \ to the close\nproximity between analytes. One possibility to enhance the mixing\n\
    is the active agitation of the liquid within a mixing chamber by\ninertia related\
    \ shear forces (Euler force), induced by a fast change\nof the sense of rotation\
    \ (shake-mode-mixing)201 or change of\nrotational\nfrequency\n(unidirectional\n\
    shake-mode-mixing).204\nShake-mode mixing leads to reduced mixing times on the\
    \ order\nof several seconds compared to several minutes for pure diﬀusion-\nbased\
    \ mixing. A further downscaling of mixing times below one\nsecond using magnetic\
    \ microparticles, located in the mixing\nchamber, has also been demonstrated.205\
    \ Accelerated mixing\ncan also be achieved by an interplay of capillary and intermittent\n\
    centrifugal forces.206\nFor routing (switching) of liquids, a switch utilizing\
    \ the\ntransversal Coriolis force to guide liquid ﬂows between two\noutlets at\
    \ the bifurcation of an inverse Y-shaped channel207 or\nat a nozzle leading into\
    \ a chamber208 has been presented.\nDepending on the sense of rotation, the Coriolis\
    \ force is either\ndirected to the left or to the right, guiding the liquid stream\n\
    into one of two downstream reservoirs at the bifurcation.\nAnother method for\
    \ liquid routing based on diﬀerent wetting\nproperties of the connected channels\
    \ has been reported by\nGyros AB, Sweden.209 The liquid stream is initially guided\n\
    towards a radial channel, exhibiting a hydrophobic patch at\nthe beginning. Therefore,\
    \ the liquid is deﬂected into a branching\nnon-hydrophobic channel next to the\
    \ radial one. For high\nfrequencies of rotation, the approaching liquid possesses\n\
    enough energy to overcome the hydrophobic patch and is\ntherefore routed into\
    \ the radial channel.210 A further possibility\nto switch liquid ﬂows is to utilize\
    \ an ‘‘air cushion’’ between an\ninitial ﬁrst liquid entering a downstream chamber\
    \ and a\nsubsequent liquid. The centrifugally generated pressure of\nthe ﬁrst\
    \ liquid is transmitted via the air cushion to the\nsubsequent liquid and forces\
    \ it via an alternative route into a\nchamber placed to the side of the main channel.211\n\
    The separation of plasma from a whole blood sample is the\nprevalent ﬁrst step\
    \ within a complete analytical protocol for\nthe analysis of whole blood. Since\
    \ blood plasma has lower\ndensity compared to the white and red blood cells it\
    \ can be\nfound in the upper phase after sedimentation in the artiﬁcial\ngravity\
    \ ﬁeld under rotation. The spatial separation of the\nobtained plasma from the\
    \ cellular pellet can be achieved via\na capillary channel that branches from\
    \ the sedimentation\nchamber at a radial position where only plasma is expected.187\n\
    Another method uses pre-separation of the cellular and\nplasma phase during the\
    \ sample ﬂow through an azimuthally\naligned channel of 300 mm radial width.197\
    \ The obtained\nplasma fraction is thereafter split from the cellular com-\nponents\
    \ by a decanting process. Another concept enables\nplasma separation of varying\
    \ blood sample volumes in a\ncontinuous process. The sedimentation occurs in an\
    \ azimuthally\ncurved channel due to centrifugal and Coriolis forces, enabling\n\
    up to 99% separation eﬃciency between two outlets for\na diluted sample with 6%\
    \ hematocrit.212 An overview of\ncentrifugal microﬂuidic unit operations and related\
    \ applications\ncan be found in Table 5.\nApplication examples\nTable 5 shows\
    \ some applications that have been realized\non the centrifugal microﬂuidic platform.\

    on the microﬂuidic disk are below 20%.195 The assays are\ncarried out within 50\
    \ min with sample volumes of 200 nL. In\ncomparison, the traditional ELISA performed\
    \ in a 96-well\nplate typically takes several hours and requires sample volumes\n\
    of several hundred microlitres.\nA fully integrated colorimetric assay for determination\
    \ of\nalcohol concentrations in human whole blood has been shown\non the centrifugal\
    \ Bio-Disk platform.202 After loading the\nreagents into the reagents reservoir,\
    \ a droplet of untreated\nhuman blood taken from a ﬁnger tip is loaded into the\
    \ inlet\nport of the microstructure. By mixing the blood sample with\nthe reagents,\
    \ an enzymatic reaction is initiated, changing the\ncolor of the mixture depending\
    \ on the alcohol concentration.\nAfter sedimentation of the residual blood cells,\
    \ the absorbance\nis monitored in a real-time manner via a laser beam that\nis\
    \ reﬂected into the disk plane on integrated V-grooves.229\nUsing\nthis\nautomated\n\
    assay\nand\nreadout\nprotocol\nthe\nconcentration\nof\nalcohol\nin\nhuman\nwhole\n\
    blood\nwas\ndetermined within only 150 s. The results were comparable\nto common\
    \ point-of-care tests and required a minute blood\nvolume of just 500 nL.\nAlso\
    \ a protein crystallization assay has been demonstrated\non the centrifugal microﬂuidic\
    \ platform.196 First, a deﬁned\nvolume of the protein solution is dispensed into\
    \ the protein\ninlet and transported into the crystallization chamber. After-\n\
    wards, the pre-loaded precipitant is metered under rotation\nand transferred into\
    \ the crystallization chamber as soon as a\nhydrophobic valve breaks. In the last\
    \ step, the pre-loaded oil is\nreleased at yet a higher frequency and placed on\
    \ top of the\nliquid stack within the crystallization chamber, to prevent\nevaporation.\
    \ The successful crystallization of proteinase K\nand catalase was demonstrated.\n\

    \ PM. \nStrengths and limitations\nTwo major advantages of the centrifugal microﬂuidic\
    \ platform\nare the modular setup of the system with disposable and easily\nexchangeable\
    \ plastic cartridges and the many existing unit\noperations, which allow highly\
    \ precise liquid handling. The\nfabrication costs of the disposables are governed\
    \ by the\nspeciﬁc implementation of unit operations. Necessary global\nor local\
    \ surface modiﬁcation or the integration of active\n(ferrowax) valves, post-replication\
    \ treatment, assembly and\nreagent pre-storage steps can increase the cost of\
    \ the dis-\nposables. Mostly, they are made out of plastic and thus\nsuitable\
    \ for mass-production. The presented unit operations\nallow the automation of\
    \ complex assay protocols. The cost for\nthe base instrument depends heavily on\
    \ readout and temperature\ncontrol modules. The motor required for liquid control\
    \ is\ngenerally required to be able to achieve very stable and deﬁned\nrotational\
    \ speed and acceleration, also adding to the costs.\nHowever, compared to (several)\
    \ high-precision syringe pumps,\nthis solution is generally cheaper and allows\
    \ a higher degree of\nintegration. Due to the rotational symmetry of the disks,\n\
    optionally some degree of parallelization can be achieved.\nAlso, the rotational\
    \ symmetry is beneﬁcial for fast readout\nand temperature uniformity between cavities\
    \ at the same\nradial position.\nHowever, as soon as any additional actuation\
    \ or sensing\nfunction is required on the module during rotation and if a\ncontact\
    \ free interfacing is not applicable, things become\nchallenging from a technical\
    \ point of view. Especially inter-\nfacing to electric readout modules on the\
    \ disk is diﬃcult, since\nthe rotating setup does not allow for wire connections\
    \ between\nthe disposable and the base instrument. The platform\nalso lacks ﬂexibility\
    \ compared to others that allow online\nprogramming of ﬂuidic networks within\
    \ one piece of hardware\nthat ﬁts all, since most of the logic functions as well\
    \ as\ntheir critical frequencies are permanently imprinted into\nthe channel network.\
    \ However, the Virtual Laser Valve\ntechnology is an exception in this respect\
    \ and allows online\nprogramming in a centrifugal system. Space restrictions are\n\
    also an issue, since the required footprint (disk surface)\nincreases quadratically\
    \ with the number of connected unit\noperations (radial length). The low centrifugal\
    \ forces near\nthe center of rotation and the diﬃculty of transporting liquids\n\
    radially inward are other challenges in the ﬂuidic design\nprocess. Also, completely\
    \ portable solutions are currently still\nonly a vision.\nElectrokinetics\nCharacterization\
    \ of electrokinetics\nIn electrokinetics platforms microﬂuidic unit operations\
    \ are con-\ntrolled by electric ﬁelds acting on electric charges, or electric\
    \ ﬁeld\ngradients acting on electric dipoles. Depending on buﬀers and/or\nsample,\
    \ several electrokinetic eﬀects such as electroosmosis,\nelectrophoresis, dielectrophoresis,\
    \ and polarization superimpose\neach other. Electroosmosis can be used to transport\
    \ the whole\nliquid bulk while the other eﬀects can be used to separate diﬀerent\n\
    types of molecules or particles within the bulk liquid.\nGeneral principle\nOne\
    \ of the ﬁrst applications for electrokinetics was the analysis\nof chemical compounds\
    \ via electrophoretic separation within\ncapillaries in 1967,238 long before the\
    \ term ‘‘microﬂuidics’’\nemerged. In the beginning, glass capillaries made from\
    \ drawn\nglass tubes were used, whereas today well deﬁned micro-\nchannels are\
    \ established and commonly used. The actuation\nprinciple of the electrokinetic\
    \ platform relies on the movement\nof liquid in an induced electric double layer\
    \ and charged\nparticles (ions) in an electric ﬁeld applied along a microﬂuidic\n\
    channel. The simple setup of electrokinetic systems consisting\nof microﬂuidic\
    \ channels and electrodes without moving\nparts explains the early advent of electrokinetic\
    \ platforms\nfor microﬂuidic lab-on-a-chip applications.\nUnit operations\nIn\
    \ a microﬂuidic channel, a charged solid surface induces an\nopposite net charge\
    \ in the adjacent liquid layer (electric double\nlayer). As soon as an electric\
    \ potential is applied along the\nchannel, the positively charged liquid molecules\
    \ are attracted\nby electrostatic forces and thus move towards a corresponding\n\
    electrode (Fig. 14(a)). Due to viscous coupling, the bulk liquid\nis dragged along\
    \ by the moving layer and liquid actuation with\na planar velocity proﬁle is generated\
    \ (electroosmotic ﬂow\n(EOF)239). The velocity proﬁle is constant and dispersion\
    \ only\noccurs by molecular diﬀusion. This motion is superimposed by\nthe movement\
    \ of ions and charged molecules, which are\nattracted or repelled by the electrodes\
    \ depending on their\ncharge (Fig. 14(b)). The velocity of the molecule depends\
    \ on\nits charge and hydrodynamic radius and enables the distinction\nbetween\
    \ diﬀerent molecular entities. This eﬀect is used for\nseparation of charged molecules\
    \ and is called electrophoresis.\nBased on the electroosmotic ﬂow, metering of\
    \ volumes down\nto the picolitre range can be achieved. While the sample liquid\n\
    is injected and crosses an intersection point of two perpendi-\ncular channels,\
    \ the electrodes and therefore the ﬂow along the\nmain channel is switched oﬀ.\
    \ Then, the electrodes in the side\nchannel are activated. This displaces a small\
    \ plug at the\nintersection into the side channel, resulting in metering of a\n\
    sample volume depending on the geometry of the intersection\narea. The mixing\
    \ of two co-ﬂowing streams was shown on the\nelectrokinetic platform by applying\
    \ an AC voltage.238 A\n20-fold reduction in mixing time compared to molecular\n\
    diﬀusion has been reported. Also complete biological assays\ncomprising cell lysis,\
    \ mixing, and DNA ampliﬁcation have\nbeen presented.240\nA\nmodiﬁcation to electrophoresis\n\
    is free-ﬂow\nelectro-\nphoresis, which enables the continuous separation of a\
    \ mixture\nFig.\n14\nBasic\nelectrokinetic\neﬀects\n(according\nto\nAtkins239).\n\

    \ collection of the sample\nband of interest.241 For this, an transverse electric\
    \ ﬁeld\nis applied in pressure driven ﬂow within a broad and ﬂat\nmicrochamber.\
    \ While passing this extraction chamber, the\nspecies contained in the sample\
    \ ﬂow are deﬂected depending\non their charge and thus exit the chamber through\
    \ one of\nseveral outlets.\nAnother electrokinetic eﬀect is based on polarization\
    \ of\nparticles within an oscillating electrical ﬁeld or ﬁeld gradient\n(dielectrophoresis),\
    \ as depicted in Fig. 14(c). Dielectrophoresis is\napplied in many ﬁelds, e.g.\
    \ for the controlled separation and\ntrapping of submicron bioparticles,242 for\
    \ the fusion and transport\nof cells,243 gene transfection244 or the separation\
    \ of metallic from\nsemiconducting carbon nanotubes.12,245,246 Other applications\
    \ are\ncell sorting247,248 and apoptosis of cells.249,250\nApplication examples\n\
    Capillary electrophoresis systems were the ﬁrst micro total\nanalysis systems\
    \ and emerged as single chip solutions from the\nanalytical chemistry ﬁeld in\
    \ the 1990s.251 Several companies\nutilize microﬂuidic capillary electrophoretic\
    \ chips for chemical\nanalysis, with capillaries of typically 10 to 100 mm diameter.252\n\
    Today, Caliper Life Sciences, MA, USA252 and Agilent\nTechnologies, CA, USA253\
    \ oﬀer microﬂuidic chips for DNA\nand protein analysis. Liquid propulsion is provided\
    \ via\nelectroosmosis and combined with capillary electrophoretic\nseparation.\
    \ The sample is electroosmotically transported and\nmetered inside the chip, then\
    \ separated via capillary electro-\nphoresis and analysed by ﬂuorescence detection.\
    \ (Fig. 15).\nThe whole assay is performed within minutes, instead of hours\n\
    or days.\nThe ﬁrst combinations of microﬂuidic integrated electro-\nphoresis with\
    \ microarrays were published in 1998 by Nanogen\nInc., CA, USA.254 This approach\
    \ resulted in a 20-fold faster\nhybridization and more speciﬁc binding of DNA\
    \ onto the\nmicroarray. This was the ﬁrst step in the direction of a\nplatform\
    \ for massively parallel analysis.\nStrengths and limitations\nElectroosmotic\
    \ actuation of liquids enables pulse-free pumping\nwithout any moving parts. Liquid\
    \ manipulation at high\nprecision can be achieved by the existing unit operations.\n\
    In addition, electroosmotic ﬂow does not lead to Taylor\ndispersion115 as in pressure\
    \ driven systems and thus enables\nhigh eﬃciency separations. The seamless integration\
    \ with\nelectrophoresis, an established technology in use for 100 years,255\n\
    is another obvious strength. In microﬂuidic systems, applications\ncan beneﬁt\
    \ from faster heat dissipation, better resolution,\nand\nfaster\nseparation.\n\
    Miniaturization\nof\nelectrophoretic\nanalysis enables the automation and parallelization\
    \ of tests with\nsmall dead volumes, thus reducing the required amount of\nsample.\n\
    A technical problem in capillary electrophoresis systems is\nthe changing pH-gradient\
    \ due to electrolysis or electrophoresis\nitself. Also streaming currents which\
    \ counteract the external\nelectric ﬁeld or gas bubbles as a result of electrolysis\
    \ at the\nelectrodes are problematic. Also a massively parallel setup is\nproblematic\
    \ due to the heat generated by the electrophoresis\nitself. In addition, the realization\
    \ of hand-held devices is\nchallenging due to the necessity of high voltages in\
    \ com-\nbination with high energy consumption. Overall, miniaturized\nelectrophoresis\
    \ is established as a fast and eﬃcient method for\nthe separation and analysis\
    \ of bio-molecules.\nElectrowetting\nCharacterization of electrowetting\nElectrowetting\
    \ platforms use droplets immersed in a second\nimmiscible continuous phase (gas\
    \ or liquid) as stable micro-\nconﬁnements. The droplets reside on a hydrophobic\
    \ surface\nthat contains a one- or two-dimensional array of individually\naddressable\
    \ electrodes. The voltage between a droplet and the\nelectrode underneath the\
    \ droplet deﬁnes its wetting behavior.\nBy changing voltages between neighboring\
    \ electrodes, droplets\ncan be generated, transported, split, merged, and processed.\n\
    These unit operations are freely programmable for each\nindividual droplet by\
    \ the end-user enabling online control of\nan assay.\nGeneral principle\nThe electrowetting\
    \ eﬀect was ﬁrst described by Lippmann in\n1875.256 Interest in this eﬀect was\
    \ spurred again in the 1990s,\nwhen researchers started placing thin insulating\
    \ layers on the\nmetallic electrodes to separate it from the often conductive\n\
    liquids in order to eliminate electrolysis.257 The basic electro-\nwetting eﬀect\
    \ is depicted in Fig. 16(a). The wettability of a\nsolid surface increases due\
    \ to polarization and electric ﬁelds as\nsoon as a voltage is applied between\
    \ the electrode and the\nliquid droplet above (separated by the dielectric insulating\n\
    layer).257\nThis\nso-called\n‘‘electrowetting-on-dielectric’’\n(EWOD)258 eﬀect\
    \ is therefore a tool to control the contact\nangle of liquids on surfaces.\n\

    \ 25 January 2010. Downloaded on 3/26/2024 5:46:27 PM. \nThis invention paved\
    \ the way for the application of the\nelectrowetting eﬀect as a liquid propulsion\
    \ principle for\nlab-on-a-chip systems.259,260 To utilize the EWOD technology\n\
    for programmable liquid actuation, a liquid droplet is placed\nbetween two electrodes\
    \ covered with insulating, preferably\nhydrophobic, dielectric layers (Fig. 16(b)).\
    \ The liquid droplet\nis steered by the electrode array on one side and by a large\n\
    planar ground electrode on the opposite side. Activating\nselected electrodes\
    \ allows programming of a path which the\ndroplet follows. The droplet needs to\
    \ be large enough to cover\nparts of at least four addressable electrodes at all\
    \ times,\nallowing two-dimensional movement. If a voltage is applied\nto one of\
    \ the control electrodes covered by the droplet, it\nmoves onto the activated\
    \ electrode pad. Successive activation\nof one electrode after the other will\
    \ drag the droplet along a\ndeﬁned path. This freedom to program the liquid movement\n\
    enables\nthe\nimplementation\nof\ndiﬀerent\nassays\non\nthe\nsame chip.\nThe universal\
    \ applicability of moving droplets by EWOD\nwas shown with several media such\
    \ as ionic liquids, aqueous\nsurfactant solutions,261 and also biological ﬂuids\
    \ like whole\nblood, serum, plasma, urine, saliva, sweat, and tear ﬂuid.262\n\
    Unit operations\nThe droplet formation, i.e. initial metering, is the elementary\n\
    unit operation of the platform. Metered droplets can be\nproduced from an on-chip\
    \ reservoir in three steps.262 First, a\nliquid column is extruded from the reservoir\
    \ by activating a\nseries of adjacent electrodes. Second, once the column over-\n\
    laps the electrode on which the droplet is to be formed, all the\nremaining electrodes\
    \ are turned oﬀ, forming a neck in the\ncolumn. The reservoir electrode is then\
    \ activated during\nthe third and last step, pulling back the liquid and breaking\n\
    the neck, leaving a droplet behind on the metering electrode.\nUsing this droplet\
    \ metering structure, droplets down to 20 nL\nvolume can be generated with a standard\
    \ deviation of less than\n2%.262 A similar technology can be used for the splitting\
    \ of a\ndroplet into several smaller droplets.31 Since the droplet\nvolume is\
    \ of great importance for the accuracy of all assays,\nadditional volume control\
    \ mechanisms such as on-chip\ncapacitance volume control263 or the use of numerical\
    \ methods\nfor the design of EWOD metering structures264 have been\nproposed.\
    \ Once the droplets are formed, their actuation is\naccomplished by the EWOD eﬀect\
    \ as described above.\nAlso the merging of droplets can be achieved easily with\n\
    the use of three electrodes. Two droplets are individually\nguided to electrodes\
    \ separated from each other by a third\none. Deactivating these two electrodes\
    \ and activating the third\nseparation electrode pulls the droplets together.265\
    \ The most\nbasic type of mixing within droplets on the EWOD platform is\nan oscillation,\
    \ forwards and backwards, between at least two\nelectrodes. Another mixing scheme\
    \ is the repetitive movement\nof the droplet on a rectangular path. The shortest\
    \ mixing time\nfor two 1.3 mL droplets in linear oscillation on 4 electrodes was\n\
    about 4.6 s.266 In another work, the mixing times of 1.4 mL\ndroplets could be\
    \ further reduced to less than 3 s using\ntwo-dimensional arrays.267\nApplication\
    \ examples\nApplications based on EWOD are in the development phase\nand quite\
    \ close to market products. For example, an enzymatic\ncolorimetric assay for\
    \ (point-of-care) diagnostic applications\nhas been successfully implemented,\
    \ and glucose concentration\nin several biological liquids (serum, plasma, urine,\
    \ and saliva)\nwas determined with comparable results to standard methods.262\n\
    The microﬂuidic chip layout for the colorimetric glucose assay\nis depicted in\
    \ Fig. 17. It features reservoirs, injection structures\n(metering) and a network\
    \ of electrodes for droplet transport,\nsplitting and detection.\nAlso the use\
    \ of an EWOD system for the automated sample\npreparation of peptides and proteins\
    \ for matrix-assisted laser\ndesorption-ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS)\
    \ was\nreported. In that work, standard MALDI-MS reagents,\nanalytes, concentrations,\
    \ and recipes have been demonstrated\nto be compatible with the EWOD technology,\
    \ and mass\nspectra\ncomparable\nto\nthose\ncollected\nby\nconventional\nmethods\
    \ were obtained.268 Also a PCR assay has been realized\non the platform by temperature\
    \ cycling of a droplet at rest.269\nAdditional information about the EWOD platform\
    \ can be\nfound in a comprehensive review.270\nStrengths and limitations\nThe\
    \ strengths of the platform are the very small liquid volumes\nin the nanolitre\
    \ range that can be handled with high precision,\nand the freedom to program the\
    \ droplet movement. This cuts\ndown sample and reagent consumption and allows\
    \ a maximum\nof ﬂexibility for the implementation of diﬀerent assay protocols.\n\

    \ PM. \nThe simple setup without any moving parts can be fabricated\nusing standard\
    \ lithographic processes. The programmable con-\ntrol of small droplets has its\
    \ particular potential in assay\noptimization, since it allows the protocol to\
    \ be varied over a\ncertain range on the same chip.\nHowever, although the sample\
    \ and reagent consumption is\nlow, portable systems for e.g. point-of-care applications\n\
    have not yet been demonstrated due to the bulky electronic\ninstrumentation required\
    \ to operate the platform. Another\ndrawback is the inﬂuence of the liquid properties\
    \ on the\ndroplet transport behaviour, i.e. diﬀerent patient materials\nwill show\
    \ diﬀerent wetting abilities and thus lead to diﬀerences\nin volume or movement\

    \ the contamination risk\nis problematic, since every droplet can potentially\
    \ contaminate\nthe surface and thus lead to false results and also change the\n\
    contact angle for the successor droplets. Another issue is the\npossible electrolysis\

    \ residing\non a hydrophobic surface in a gaseous environment (air).\nThe microﬂuidic\
    \ unit operations are mainly controlled by\nacoustic shock waves travelling on\
    \ the surface of the solid\nsupport. The shock waves are generated by an arrangement\
    \ of\nsurrounding sonotrodes, deﬁning the droplet manipulation\narea. Most of\
    \ the unit operations such as droplet generation,\ntransport, mixing, etc. are\
    \ freely programmable.\nGeneral principle\nAn alternative to the electrowetting-based\
    \ transportation of\ndroplets on a plane surface has been proposed by the group\
    \ of\nAchim Wixforth at the University of Augsburg, Germany.271\nThe approach\
    \ is based on surface acoustic waves (SAW),\nwhich are mechanical waves with amplitudes\
    \ of typically only\na few nanometres. The surface acoustic waves are generated\
    \ by\na piezoelectric transducer chip (e.g. quartz) fabricated by\nplacing interdigital\
    \ electrodes (interdigital transducer, IDT)\non top of a piezoelectric layer.\
    \ Liquid droplets situated on the\nhydrophobic surface of the chip can be moved\
    \ by the SAWs if\nthe acoustic pressure exerted on the liquid droplet is high\n\
    enough (Fig. 18).272 The actuation of small amounts of liquids\nwith viscosities\
    \ extending over a large range (from 1 to 1000 mPa s)\nhas been shown.273 This\
    \ approach is also sometimes referred to as\n‘‘ﬂat ﬂuidics’’, because no cover\
    \ or slit is required as in the EWOD\napproach.\nUnit operations\nMetering is\
    \ accomplished by moving a liquid droplet over a\nsmall hydrophilic ‘‘metering\
    \ spot’’ via surface acoustic waves,\nleaving behind a small metered liquid portion\
    \ due to\nthe interplay between the surface tension force (keeping the\ndroplet\
    \ on the spot) and the acoustic force (pushing the\ndroplet forward). Since those\
    \ two forces scale diﬀerently over\nthe droplet size, the splitting of the initial\
    \ droplet into two\ndroplets (one sitting on the metering spot and the other\n\
    propagating forward) occurs. The smaller droplet is not\ntransported since it\
    \ stays unaﬀected by the acoustic wave.\nAlso aliquoting has been shown by moving\
    \ the initial droplet\nover a hydrophobic/hydrophilic checkerboard pattern.271\n\
    Mixing is an intrinsic unit operation of the SAW platform.\nA droplet which is\
    \ placed on the substrate and is inﬂuenced by\na SAW shows internal liquid circulation\
    \ due to the vibrating\nforces of the wave. This internal circulation leads to\
    \ mixing.271\nApplication examples\nA PCR protocol has been implemented on the\
    \ SAW platform,\nbased on 200 nL droplets and an additional heating element\n\
    placed underneath the substrate surface for temperature\ncycling while the droplet\
    \ is at rest.275 However, since the\nnanolitre-sized droplet possesses a high\
    \ surface-to-volume\nratio, the liquid volume would decrease rapidly due to\n\
    evaporation at the elevated temperatures required for the\nPCR reaction. Therefore,\
    \ the aqueous liquid droplet is covered\nwith a droplet of immiscible mineral\
    \ oil with a smaller contact\nangle. This droplet-in-droplet conﬁguration can\
    \ still be\nmoved via surface acoustic waves on the substrate surface.\nThe concentration\
    \ of DNA could be monitored by online\nﬂuorescent measurement providing a sensitivity\
    \ of 0.1 ng.275\nStrengths and limitations\nAs in the EWOD platform, the SAW platform\
    \ also allows the\nhandling of small nanolitre-sized liquid volumes in droplets\
    \ on\nplanar surfaces. The transport mechanism using surface\nacoustic waves though\
    \ is more ﬂexible since it depends only\non the viscosity and surface tension\
    \ of the liquid.\nHowever, the programmability is in turn limited since\nthe position\
    \ of the interdigital electrodes and especially\nthe hydrophobic/hydrophilic areas\
    \ determine the possible\nliquid handling processes. Another disadvantage is the\
    \ long-\nterm stability and the complexity of these hydrophobic and\nhydrophilic\
    \ surface coatings, and thus costs of the disposable\nchip as well as the instrument.\n\

    \ 5:46:27 PM. \nDedicated systems for massively parallel analysis\nCharacterization\
    \ of massively parallel analysis\nWithin the category of dedicated systems for\
    \ massively parallel\nanalysis we discuss speciﬁc platforms that do not comply\n\
    with our deﬁnition of a generic microﬂuidic platform.\nThe characteristics of\
    \ those platforms is not given by the\nimplementation of the ﬂuidic functions\
    \ but by the speciﬁc\nway to process up to millions of assays in parallel. Prominent\n\
    examples are platforms used for gene expression and sequencing\nsuch as microarrays,\
    \ bead-based assays and pyro-sequencing\nin picowell-plates.\nGeneral principle\n\
    In this chapter, solutions for highly parallel assay processing\nare presented.\
    \ These are not per se microﬂuidic platforms by\nour deﬁnition, since they do\
    \ not oﬀer a set of easily combined\nunit operations and are quite inﬂexible in\
    \ terms of assay\nlayout. They are nevertheless presented here, since the small\n\
    reaction volumes per assay and partly the liquid control\nsystems are based on\
    \ microﬂuidic platforms. The signiﬁcant\nmarket for repetitive analyses, which\
    \ allows high development\ncosts for proprietary, optimized systems, does not\
    \ necessarily\nrequire a platform approach, but can beneﬁt from microﬂuidic\n\
    production technologies and liquid handling systems.\nThe massively parallel assay\
    \ systems are a result of the\nincreasing demand of the pharmaceutical industry\
    \ for repetitive\nassays276,277 to cover the following objectives:\n\x03 Screening\n\
    of\nchemical\nlibraries\nwith\nmillions\nof\ncompounds278\n\x03 Screening of known\
    \ drugs against new targets, diﬀerent\ncell lines or patient material279,280\n\
    \x03 Multiparameter analysis of cell signaling and single cell\nanalysis281\n\x03\
    \ All -omic analyses such as genomics, transcriptomics,\nproteomics, glucomics,\
    \ metabolomics. . .282\nWith every newly discovered receptor or protein, all known\n\
    drugs, pre-drugs, and chemical compounds should be tested\nfor interaction by\
    \ means of binding, activity change, or\nenzymatic activity. Also the analysis\
    \ of gene activity or gene\nsequencing requires new and massively parallel testing\
    \ in\nnumbers of hundred thousands to billions. These tests con-\nsume a lot of\
    \ time, material, eﬀort, and money, but could lead\nto precious results (e.g.\
    \ in case of a new blockbuster drug).283\nThe challenging task to monitor millions\
    \ of diﬀerent binding\nreactions is partially solved by microarrays284 (mainly\
    \ in the\ncase of DNA and RNA) or bead-based assays in combination\nwith picowell\
    \ plates.\nMicroarrays284 are matrices with spots of diﬀerent chemical\ncompounds\
    \ on a surface (Fig. 19(a)). The number of spots ranges\nfrom a few dozen to up\
    \ to several millions. The microarray is\nincubated with the sample and each spot\
    \ interacts with the\nsample in parallel, leading to as many parallel assays as\
    \ there\nare spots on the microarray. Typically a microarray is read out\nby ﬂuorescence\
    \ and used for nucleic acid or protein analysis.\nPicowell plates285,286 consist\
    \ of millions of small wells (o50 mm\nin diameter) (Fig. 19(c)). In each well,\
    \ either one chemical\ncompound or one single cell is deposited. After the deposition,\n\
    the picowell plate acts as a ‘‘microarray’’ with each position\nbearing a unique\
    \ chemical compound or cell. Afterwards, all\nassays are performed similar to\
    \ a microarray.\nIn\nbead-based\nassays278,287\nsmall\nsolid\nphase\nspheres\n\
    (Fig. 19(b)) or particles are used. Each bead bears one unique\nchemical compound.\
    \ Such a bead library can consist of\nbillions of diﬀerent beads. For screening,\
    \ the beads are mixed\nand incubated with the sample and consecutively with the\
    \ assay\nbuﬀers, performing one assay on each bead in parallel. The\nreadout is\
    \ commonly ﬂuorescence based and the positive beads\nare sorted out and analysed\
    \ one by one in series. Typically this\ntechnique is used for binding assays or\
    \ DNA analysis.\nThe pioneers of each ﬁeld who introduced this system to\nthe\
    \ market are: Microarrays by Aﬀymetrix, CA, USA,288\nbead-based arrays by Luminex\
    \ Corp., TX, USA289,290 and\nIllumina Inc., CA, USA,291,292 and picowell plates\

    Here, the microﬂuidic actuation principles that are utilized in\nmassively parallel\
    \ analysis are outlined brieﬂy. This is followed\nby some commercial application\
    \ examples. Due to the similar\nFig. 19\nImages of the diﬀerent systems for massively\

    \ and picowell plates are presented\ntogether, followed by bead-based assays.\n\
    Micorarrays/picowell plates\nFor micorarrays/picowell plates, liquid actuation\
    \ and metering\ncan be achieved by diﬀerent actuation principles. Mainly\ncapillary\
    \ ﬁlling of a cartridge,288 or pressure driven systems\nare used.283,284 In other\
    \ cases, the liquid actuation is achieved\nby centrifugal systems, electrophoresis,\
    \ surface acoustic waves,\nelectrowetting, and several other principles. Incubation\
    \ and\nmixing is realized by diﬀusion and in some cases enhanced by\nsonication,\
    \ surface acoustic waves, or electric ﬁelds. Washing\nis achieved by displacing\
    \ the sample with the consecutive\nliquid. The classical (parallel) readout of\
    \ binding or inter-\naction between the molecules is performed by ﬂuorescence\n\
    (Fig. 19(a) and (c)).288 An interesting feature is that some of\nthe picowell\
    \ plates are made from glass ﬁber bundles and thus\npresent a perfect interface\
    \ between the light generating bead\nand the detector, often a CCD camera.286,291,292\n\
    Today, the company Aﬀymetrix oﬀers microarrays with\n>2 000 000 unique compounds.\
    \ The ﬂuidic system is quite\nsimple. The sample is manually loaded with a pipette\
    \ into the\nchip, and capillary forces transfer the sample to the incubation\n\
    chamber. Incubation and mixing is enhanced by a moving air\nbubble actuated by\
    \ slow rotation.\nThe company 454 Life Sciences oﬀers picowell plate systems\n\
    for the performance of massively parallel gene sequencing.286\nBeads containing\
    \ roughly 10 million identical DNA copies are\nloaded into the picowell plate\
    \ with a pressure driven system,\nwhere each bead sediments into one cavity. Diﬀerent\
    \ bio-\nmolecules are washed over the wells, interacting with the beads\ninside.\
    \ In the case of a positive reaction, a quantitative\nenzymatic reaction, the\
    \ pyro-sequencing,293 results in the\nemission of light. This system allows for\
    \ parallel sequencing\nof 106 beads in a single run.\nBead-based assays\nFor bead-based\
    \ assays, liquid actuation and metering is most\noften pressure driven or performed\
    \ with a pipetting robot in a\nmicrotiter plate. Mixing can be performed by any\
    \ kind of\nmixing process according to the diﬀerent actuation principles\n(diﬀusion,\
    \ sonication, SAW, shaking, electrokinetic, electro-\nphoretic, pressure driven\
    \ pumping through microchannels,\netc.). The beads are separated from the liquid\
    \ by centrifugation\nor with the help of magnetic ﬁelds and can then be transferred\n\
    into another liquid. Typically, detection and readout are en-\nabled with a ﬂuorescent\
    \ marker. The beads are then analyzed\neither sequentially or in parallel. For\
    \ sequential analysis the\nbeads are transferred into a capillary and cross several\
    \ laser\nbeams and detectors one after the other. In that case, the beads\nbear\
    \ a coding to identify them.289,290 For the massively parallel\nanalysis the beads\
    \ are transferred onto a planar surface or into a\npicowell plate (Fig. 19(b)\
    \ and (c)).\nBead-based assays have been commercialized by Luminex\nsince 1997.289\
    \ A microtiter plate is used for incubation and a\ncapillary for bead transfer\
    \ into the reader. Illumina291,292\nexpanded this concept radically by the use\
    \ of 3 mm silica\nspheres, each bearing a unique DNA strand. The spheres are\n\
    deposited on one end of a glass ﬁber connected to a detector.\nThe spheres are\
    \ incubated with a DNA sample, and in the case\nof a binding event, the according\
    \ sphere emits a light signal\ninto the glass ﬁber. The current system allows\
    \ handling of\nmillions of unique compounds.294\nStrengths and limitations\nToday,\
    \ many manual steps and skilled personnel are required\nfor the described systems\
    \ and a ‘‘real’’ microﬂuidic platform is\nstill not reached. However, microarrays,\
    \ picowell plates and\nbead-based assays are a very useful combination of solid\
    \ phase\nand liquid handling for massively parallel assays in the number\nof millions.\
    \ The material consumption per assay is quite low and\nthe reaction time quite\
    \ fast. The time-to-result is longer com-\npared to a single assay, but several\
    \ orders of magnitude faster\ncompared to serially performing the same number\
    \ of assays.\nA signiﬁcant limitation of these systems is the reliability,\nreproducibility,\
    \ and identiﬁcation of artefacts. Therefore a\npositive binding event in these\
    \ systems is always counter-\nchecked in a microtiter plate experiment to verify\
    \ the binding\nevent. The whole system itself cannot be designed as hand-held\n\
    and is quite expensive (several 10 000 h per run for sequencing),\nbut is inexpensive\
    \ in terms of cost-per-assay and material\nconsumption (less than a cent per sequenced\
    \ base).295\nCriteria for the selection of a microﬂuidic platform\nAfter the previous\
    \ discussion of the platform approach and\nthe presentation of some prominent\
    \ examples for microﬂuidic\nplatforms, this section will attempt to summarize\
    \ the strengths\nand limitations of each platform presented in Fig. 2. This\n\
    should provide the reader with some guidance to select\nplatforms\nbased\non\n\
    the\nselection\ncriteria\npresented\nin\nTable 3. The given platform characteristics\
    \ are based on the\nreviewed literature and the experience of the authors, taking\n\
    into consideration properties such as the material of the\ndisposable,\nnecessary\n\
    processing\nequipment,\nproduction\ntechnologies, published variety of unit operations,\
    \ published data\nconcerning precision, throughput, or multiparameter testing.\n\
    Beneﬁcial platforms can be selected by identifying imperative\nrequirements of\
    \ a certain application, e.g. portability, low\nreagent consumption and high precision\
    \ for point-of-care\ndiagnostics, which are then compared to the characteristics\n\
    of the available platforms. The platform characteristics are\ncompiled to the\
    \ best of our knowledge in Table 6. Nevertheless\nthe performance of certain platforms\
    \ according to some of the\ncriteria is still debatable and could easily change\
    \ in the\nfuture with upcoming innovations in this fast developing ﬁeld.\nNevertheless\
    \ the strong position of classical liquid handling\ntechnologies using pipetting\
    \ robots can clearly be seen.\nIt is obvious that some of the microﬂuidic platform\n\
    approaches are dedicated to certain ﬁelds of application. For\nexample, the classical\
    \ liquid handling technology enables high\nsample throughput and is programmable\
    \ with high ﬂexibility,\nbut the main drawback is the lack of portability/wearability\n\
    and the high equipment costs for complex automated work-\nstations. These properties\
    \ limit its use to large laboratories.\nThe lateral ﬂow test platform fulﬁls the\
    \ requirements for\npoint-of-care diagnostic applications quite well (moderate\n\

    \ low\ncosts). However, as soon as the diagnostic assay requires\nhigher precision\
    \ or exceeds a certain level of complexity\n(e.g. if an exact metering of the\
    \ sample volume or sample\naliquoting is required), new approaches like linear\
    \ actuated\ndevices and centrifugal microﬂuidics become advantageous for\npoint-of-care\
    \ applications. They enable more sophisticated\nliquid handling functions, which\
    \ is for instance required for\nnucleic acid-based tests.\nThe pressure driven\
    \ laminar ﬂow platform is especially\ninteresting for online monitoring applications,\
    \ since it enables\ncontinuous ﬂows compared to the merely ‘‘batch-wise’’ operation\n\
    of most of the other microﬂuidic platforms (i.e. handling discrete\nliquid volumes).\n\
    Some of the platforms can also be considered as ‘‘multi-\napplication’’ platforms,\
    \ which is of special interest in the\nﬁeld of research instrumentation. Here,\
    \ portability is of less\nimportance, and the number of multiple parameters per\n\
    sample as well as programmability (potentially also during\nan assay run) gains\
    \ impact. The microﬂuidic large scale\nintegration and the droplet-based electrowetting\
    \ and surface\nacoustic waves platforms are such versatile examples.\nFor high-throughput\
    \ screening applications, on the contrary,\na high number of assays need to be\
    \ performed within an\nacceptable period of time at a minimum consumption of\n\
    reagents per test. Consequently ﬂexibility is less important,\nand throughput\
    \ and costs are the main\nissues. Thus,\napproaches like segmented ﬂow and dedicated\
    \ systems for\nmassively parallel analysis are interesting candidates for these\n\
    applications.\nAn increasing number of application examples beneﬁts from\nthe\
    \ transfer of unit operations and fabrication technologies\nbetween research groups\
    \ by literature, collaboration or com-\nmercial supply (e.g. foundries). This\
    \ shows the advance of the\nplatform approach in the research community. We strongly\n\
    believe that this trend of platform-based development will\ncontinue and speed\
    \ up the variety of assay implementations\nin the ﬁeld of microﬂuidics. If research\
    \ time and development\ncosts of microﬂuidic applications can be reduced signiﬁcantly\n\
    by this approach, and the spectrum of applications increases\ncorrespondingly,\
    \ this could ﬁnally lead to the commercial\nbreakthrough of microﬂuidic products.\n\

    \ of renewable energy and optimization of energy use are key enablers of\nsustainable\
    \ energy transitions and mitigating climate change. Modern technologies such the\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) offer a wide number of applications in the energy\
    \ sector, i.e, in energy supply,\ntransmission and distribution, and demand. IoT\
    \ can be employed for improving energy efﬁciency,\nincreasing the share of renewable\
    \ energy, and reducing environmental impacts of the energy use.\nThis paper reviews\
    \ the existing literature on the application of IoT in in energy systems, in general,\n\
    and in the context of smart grids particularly. Furthermore, we discuss enabling\
    \ technologies of\nIoT, including cloud computing and different platforms for\
    \ data analysis. Furthermore, we review\nchallenges of deploying IoT in the energy\
    \ sector, including privacy and security, with some solutions\nto these challenges\
    \ such as blockchain technology. This survey provides energy policy-makers, energy\n\
    economists, and managers with an overview of the role of IoT in optimization of\
    \ energy systems.\nKeywords: internet of things; IoT applications; energy efﬁciency;\
    \ energy in buildings; smart energy\nsystems; smart grid; ﬂexible demand; energy\
    \ storage\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Concepts\nIndustrial revolutions can be divided\
    \ into four phases. In the ﬁrst revolution, new sources\nof energy were discovered\
    \ to run the machines. The mass extraction of coal and the invention of\nsteam\
    \ power plants were signiﬁcant development stages in this phase [1]. The second\
    \ revolution\nknown as mass production and electricity generation was a period\
    \ of rapid development in industry,\ndistinguished by large-scale iron and steel\
    \ production. During this phase, many large-scale factories\nwith their assembly\
    \ lines were established and formed new businesses [2]. The third revolution\n\
    introduced computer and the ﬁrst generation of communication technologies, e.g.,\
    \ telephony system,\nwhich enabled automation in supply chains [3].\nA wide variety\
    \ of modern technologies such as communication systems (e.g., 5G), intelligent\n\
    robots, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to empower the fourth industrial\
    \ revolution [4–6].\nIoT interconnects a number of devices, people, data, and\
    \ processes, by allowing them to communicate\nwith each other seamlessly. Hence,\
    \ IoT can help improving different processes to be more quantiﬁable\nand measurable\
    \ by collecting and processing large amount of data [7]. IoT can potentially enhance\n\
    the quality of life in different areas including medical services, smart cities,\
    \ construction industry,\nagriculture, water management, and the energy sector\
    \ [8]. This is enabled by providing an increased\nautomated decision making in\
    \ real-time and facilitating tools for optimizing such decisions.\nEnergies 2020,\
    \ 13, 494; doi:10.3390/en13020494\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/energies\nEnergies 2020,\
    \ 13, 494\n2 of 27\n1.2. Motivation\nThe global energy demand rose by 2.3% in\
    \ 2018 compared to 2017, which is the highest increase\nsince 2010 [9]. As a result,\
    \ CO2 emissions from the energy sector hit a new record in 2018. Compared\nto\
    \ the pre-industrial temperature level, global warming is approaching 1.5 ◦C,\
    \ most likely before the\nmiddle of the 21 Century [10]. If this trend prevails,\
    \ the global warming will exceed the 2 ◦C target,\nwhich will have a severe impact\
    \ on the planet and human life. The environmental concerns, such\nas global warming\
    \ and local air pollution, scarcity of water resources for thermal power generation,\n\
    and the limitation of depleting fossil energy resources, raise an urgent need\
    \ for more efﬁcient use of\nenergy and the use of renewable energy sources (RESs).\
    \ Different studies have shown that a non-fossil\nenergy system is almost impossible\
    \ without efﬁcient use of energy and/or reduction of energy demand,\nand a high\
    \ level integration of RESs, both at a country level [11], regional [12], or globally\
    \ [13].\nBased on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals agenda [14],\
    \ energy efﬁciency is one\nof the key drivers of sustainable development. Moreover,\
    \ energy efﬁciency offers economic beneﬁts in\nlong-term by reducing the cost\
    \ of fuel imports/supply, energy generation, and reducing emissions\nfrom the\
    \ energy sector. For enhancing energy efﬁciency and a more optimal energy management,\n\
    an effective analysis of the real-time data in the energy supply chain plays a\
    \ key role [15]. The energy\nsupply chain, from resource extraction to delivering\
    \ it in a useful form to the end users, includes\nthree major parts: (i) energy\
    \ supply including upstream reﬁnery processes; (ii) energy transformation\nprocesses\
    \ including transmission and distribution (T&D) of energy carriers; and (iii)\
    \ energy demand\nside, which includes the use of energy in buildings, transportation\
    \ sector, and the industry [16].\nFigure 1 shows these three parts with their\
    \ relevant components. Under the scope of this paper, we\ndiscuss the role of\
    \ IoT in all different segments of the energy supply chain. Our aim is to show\
    \ the\npotential contribution of IoT to efﬁcient use of energy, reduction of energy\
    \ demand, and increasing the\nshare of RESs.\nFigure 1. Energy supply chain.\n\
    IoT employs sensors and communication technologies for sensing and transmitting\
    \ real-time data,\nwhich enables fast computations and optimal decision-making\
    \ [17]. Moreover, IoT can help the energy\nsector to transform from a centralized\
    \ to a distributed, smart, and integrated energy system. This is\na key requirement\
    \ in deploying local, distributed RESs, such as wind and solar energy [18], as\
    \ well\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n3 of 27\nas turning many small-scale end users\
    \ of energy into prosumers by aggregating their generation and\noptimizing their\
    \ demand whenever useful for the grid. IoT-based systems automate, integrate,\
    \ and\ncontrol processes through sensors and communication technologies. Large\
    \ data collection and use of\nintelligent algorithms for real-time data analysis\
    \ can help to monitor energy consumption patterns of\ndifferent users and devices\
    \ in different time scales and control that consumption more efﬁciently [19].\n\
    1.3. Methodology\nThe application of IoT in different sectors and industries has\
    \ been widely discussed and reviewed\nin the literature (for example [20–22].\
    \ Moreover, challenges and opportunities with respect to the\ndeployment of one\
    \ or a group of IoT technologies have received a high level of technical assessment,\n\
    e.g., sensors [23] or 5G network [24]. With respect to the energy sector, most\
    \ of survey studies have\nfocused on one speciﬁc subsector, e.g., buildings or\
    \ the technical potential of a certain IoT technology\nin the energy sector. For\
    \ example, Stojkoska et al. [25] reviews smart home applications of IoT and the\n\
    prospect of integrating those applications into an IoT enabled environment. In\
    \ a study by Hui et al. [26],\nthe methods, recent advances, and implementation\
    \ of 5G are studied only with focusing on the energy\ndemand side. The role of\
    \ IoT in improving energy efﬁciency in buildings and public transport has\nbeen\
    \ discussed in [27,28], respectively. Khatua et al. [29] reviews the key challenges\
    \ in the suitability\nof IoT data transfer and communication protocols for deployment\
    \ in smart grids.\nHowever, unlike the reviewed literature where the focus is\
    \ commonly either on a speciﬁc subsector\nin the energy sector or certain IoT\
    \ technologies, this paper reviews the application of IoT in the energy\nsector,\
    \ from energy generation to transmission and distribution (T&D) and demand side.\
    \ As such,\nthe main contribution of this paper is to extend the existing body\
    \ of literature by providing energy\npolicy-makers, economists, energy experts,\
    \ and managers with a general overview of the opportunities\nand challenges of\
    \ applying IoT in different parts of the entire energy sector. In this respect,\
    \ we brieﬂy\nintroduce the IoT framework and its enabling technologies to form\
    \ a basis for discussing their role in\nthe energy sector.\nTo conduct this survey,\
    \ a systematic search was carried out to collect and review the recent\nbody of\
    \ literature on the role of IoT in the energy sector. First, we searched the terms\
    \ “Internet of\nThings” and “Energy”, case non-speciﬁc, in the title, abstract,\
    \ and keywords of publications stored\nin SCOPUS, IEEE, Hindawi, and Google Scholar\
    \ databases. Then, we limited the scope of search\nresults to engineering, economics\
    \ and management branches where possible. Next, papers published\nbefore 2012\
    \ and most of conference papers with no information on the peer-review process\
    \ were\nexcluded. Finally, we clustered the relevant papers in sub-categories\
    \ of energy generation (including\npower plants, ancillary services, and centralized\
    \ renewable energy), T&D systems (including electricity,\ngas and district heating\
    \ networks, and smart grids), and the demand side (including energy use in\nbuildings,\
    \ transportation, and the industry sector). We focus on the IoT applications that\
    \ can be\ngenerally applicable to most of energy systems without discussing speciﬁc\
    \ cases and their boundary\nconditions. For example, we discuss the role of IoT\
    \ in smart buildings, without falling into the details\nof building typology,\
    \ building material, occupants’ energy consumption pattern, type and number of\n\
    home appliances, etc.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Sections\
    \ 2 and 3 introduces IoT and enabling\ntechnologies, including sensors and communication\
    \ technologies, cloud computing, and data analytic\nplatforms. Section 4 reviews\
    \ the role of IoT in the energy sector. Section 5 discusses the opportunities\n\
    and challenges of deploying IoT, while Section 6 portrays future trends.\nThe\
    \ paper concludes\nin Section 7.\n2. Internet of Things (IoT)\nIoT is an emerging\
    \ technology that uses the Internet and aims to provide connectivity between\n\
    physical devices or “things” [30]. Examples of physical devices include home appliances\
    \ and industrial\nequipment. Using appropriate sensors and communication networks,\
    \ these devices can provide\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n4 of 27\nvaluable data and\
    \ enable offering diverse services for people. For instance, controlling energy\n\
    consumption of buildings in an smart fashion enables reducing the energy costs\
    \ [31]. IoT has a wide\nrange of applications, such as in manufacturing, logistics\
    \ and construction industry [32]. IoT is also\nwidely applied in environmental\
    \ monitoring, healthcare systems and services, efﬁcient management\nof energy\
    \ in buildings, and drone-based services [33–36].\nWhen planning an IoT application\
    \ which is the ﬁrst step in designing IoT systems, the selection\nof components\
    \ of IoT such as sensor device, communication protocol, data storage and computation\n\
    needs to be appropriate for the intended application. For example, an IoT platform\
    \ planned to control\nheating, cooling, and air conditioning (HVAC) in a building,\
    \ requires utilizing relevant environmental\nsensors and using suitable communication\
    \ technology [37]. Figure 2 shows the different components\nof an IoT platform\
    \ [38]. IoT devices which are the second components of the IoT platforms, could\
    \ be\nin the form of sensors, actuators, IoT gateways or any device that joins\
    \ the cycle of data collection,\ntransmission, and processing. For example, an\
    \ IoT gateway device enables routing the data into\nthe IoT system and establishing\
    \ bi-directional communications between the device-to-gateway and\ngateway-to-cloud.\n\
    Figure 2. Diagram describing the components of an IoT platform.\nThe communication\
    \ protocols that are the third component of the IoT platform, enable the\ndifferent\
    \ devices to communicate and share their data with the controllers or the decision\
    \ making\ncenters. IoT platforms offer the ﬂexibility to select the type of the\
    \ communication technologies (each\nhaving speciﬁc features), according to the\
    \ needs of the application. The examples of these technologies\ninclude Wi-Fi,\
    \ Bluetooth, ZigBee [39] and cellular technology such as LTE-4G and 5G networks\
    \ [40].\nThe data storage is the fourth component of the IoT platform which enables\
    \ management of collected\ndata from the sensors.\nIn principle, the data collected\
    \ from the devices is very large. This necessitates planning an\nefﬁcient data\
    \ storage that can be in cloud servers or at the edge of an IoT network. The stored\
    \ data\nwhich is used for analytical purposes, forms the ﬁfth component of the\
    \ IoT platforms. The data\nanalytics can be performed off-line after storing the\
    \ data or it can be in form of real-time analytics.\nThe data analytic is performed\
    \ for decision making about the operation of the application. Based on\nthe need,\
    \ the data analytics can be performed off-line or real-time. In off-line analytics,\
    \ the stored\ndata is ﬁrst collected and then visualized on premises using visualization\
    \ tools. In case of real-time\nanalytics, the cloud or edge servers are used to\
    \ provide visualization, e.g. stream analytics [41].\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n\
    5 of 27\n3. Enabling Technologies\nIoT is a paradigm in which objects and elements\
    \ of a system that are equipped with sensors,\nactuators, and processors can communicate\
    \ with each other to provide meaningful services. In IoT\nsystems, sensors are\
    \ used to sense and collect data, and through gateways route the collected data\
    \ to\ncontrol centers or the cloud for further storage, processing, analytics,\
    \ and decision-making. After the\ndecision is made, a corresponding command is\
    \ then sent back to the actuator installed on the system\nin response to the sensed\
    \ data. As there are variety of sensor and actuator devices, communication\ntechnologies,\
    \ and data computing approached, in this section, we explain the existing technologies\n\
    which enable IoT. Then, we provide examples from the literature how these technologies\
    \ are used in\nthe energy sector.\n3.1. Sensor Devices\nSensors are the key drivers\
    \ of IoT [42]. They are employed to collect and transmit data in real-time.\n\
    The use of sensors enhances effectiveness, functionality, and plays a critical\
    \ role in success of IoT [43].\nDifferent types of sensors exist that are developed\
    \ for various application purposes. The examples\nof these applications include\
    \ agriculture industry, environmental monitoring, healthcare systems\nand services,\
    \ and public safety [44]. In practice, in the energy sector including energy production,\n\
    transmission and distribution, and production, many these sensors are used. In\
    \ the energy sector,\nsensors are used to create savings in both cost and energy.\
    \ Sensors enable smart energy management\nsystem and provide real-time energy\
    \ optimization and facilitate new approaches for energy load\nmanagement. The\
    \ research and future trends of the sensor devices are also aims at development\n\
    of sensor applications to improve load shaping and consumers’ awareness as well\
    \ as development\nof speciﬁc facilities to enhance production of renewable energies\
    \ [45]. In nutshell, the use of sensor\ndevices within IoT, in the energy sector\
    \ largely improves diagnostics, decision-making, analytics,\noptimization processes\
    \ and integrated performance metrics. Due to the large number of sensors used\n\
    in the energy sector, in the following we explain few examples of commonly applied\
    \ sensor devices in\nenergy production and consumption.\nTemperature sensors are\
    \ used to detect the ﬂuctuations in heating and cooling a system [46].\nTemperature\
    \ is an important and common environmental parameter. In the energy sector, the\
    \ basic\nprinciple of power generation is the process of changing mechanical energy\
    \ into electrical energy,\nwhereas mechanical energy is achieved from heat energy,\
    \ e.g., thermal power plants, wind, water ﬂow,\nand solar power plants. These\
    \ energy conversions are obtained using thermal, i.e., temperature. In the\nenergy\
    \ consumption side, the temperature sensors are used to maximize the performance\
    \ of a system\nwhen temperature changes during normal operations. For example,\
    \ in residential areas the best time\nfor turning on or off the ventilation and\
    \ cooling systems is recognized by temperature sensors; thus,\nthe energy can\
    \ be managed correctly in order to save energy [42].\nHumidity sensors are used\
    \ to distinguish the amount moisture and air’s humidity. The ratio of\nmoisture\
    \ in the air to the highest amount of moisture at a particular air temperature\
    \ is called relative\nhumidity [47]. The applications of humidity sensors in the\
    \ energy sector are wide. For example, they\nare generally used in wind energy\
    \ production. The use of humidity sensors on wind turbines are\neven vital, if\
    \ the turbines are located offshore (due to the high level of moisture in the\
    \ air). Humidity\nsensors can be placed in the nacelle and in the bottom of wind\
    \ turbines and offer continuous moisture\nmonitoring. This enables the operators\
    \ to take actions to changes or deviations in the turbine operation\nconditions,\
    \ leading to more consistent operations, optimized performance, and lower costs\
    \ of energy.\nLight sensors are used to measure luminance (ambient light level)\
    \ or the brightness of a light.\nIn energy consumption, light sensors have several\
    \ uses in industrial and everyday consumer\napplications.\nAs a main source of\
    \ energy consumption in buildings relates to lighting, which,\nrespectively, account\
    \ for nearly 15% of total electricity usage [48]. On global scale, approximately\
    \ 20%\nof electricity is consumed for lighting [49]. Therefore, light sensors\
    \ can be utilized to automatically\ncontrol lighting levels indoors and outdoors\
    \ by turning on-and-off or dimming the light levels, such\nEnergies 2020, 13,\
    \ 494\n6 of 27\nthat the electric light levels automatically can be adjusted in\
    \ response to changes in ambient light.\nIn this fashion, the energy required\
    \ for the lighting for the indoor environments can be reduced [19].\nPassive Infrared\
    \ (PIR) sensors, also known as motion sensors, are used for measuring the infrared\n\
    light radiation emitted from objects in their surroundings. In energy consumption,\
    \ these sensors are\nused to reduce the energy consumption in buildings. For example,\
    \ by using PIR sensors, the presence\nof humans inside spaces can be detected.\
    \ If there is no movement detected in the space then the light\ncontrol of the\
    \ space turns off the light, i.e., smart control of lighting. In this fashion,\
    \ the electricity\nconsumption of the buildings are reduced [50]. Similarly, this\
    \ can be applied for air conditioning\nsystems which consume nearly 40% of the\
    \ energy in buildings [48].\nProximity sensors are utilized to detect the presence\
    \ of nearby objects without any physical\ncontact [51]. The example application\
    \ of proximity sensors is in wind energy production. These sensors\nprovide longevity\
    \ and reliable position sensing performance in wind turbines. In wind turbines,\n\
    the applications of proximity sensors include blade pitch control, yaw position,\
    \ rotor, and yaw brake\nposition; brake wear monitoring; and rotor speed monitoring\
    \ [52].\n3.2. Actuators\nActuators are devices that transform a certain form of\
    \ energy into motion. They take electrical\ninput from the automation systems,\
    \ transform the input into action, and act on the devices and\nmachines within\
    \ the IoT systems [53]. Actuators produce different motion patterns such as linear,\n\
    oscillatory, or rotating motions. Based on the energy sources, actuators categorized\
    \ as the following\ntypes [54].\nPneumatic actuators use compressed air for generating\
    \ motion. Pneumatic actuators are composed\nof a piston or a diaphragm in order\
    \ to generate the motive power. These actuators are used to control\nprocesses\
    \ which require quick and accurate response, as these processes do not need a\
    \ large amount of\nmotive force.\nHydraulic actuators utilize the liquid for generating\
    \ motion. Hydraulic actuators consist of cylinder\nor ﬂuid motor that uses hydraulic\
    \ power to provide mechanical operation. The mechanical motion\ngives an output\
    \ in terms of linear, rotatory, or oscillatory motion. These actuators are used\
    \ in industrial\nprocess control where high speed and large forces are required.\n\
    Thermal actuators use a heat source for generating the physical action. Thermal\
    \ actuators convert\nthermal energy into kinetic energy, or motion. Generally,\
    \ thermostatic actuators are composed of a\ntemperature-sensing material sealed\
    \ by a diaphragm which pushes against a plug for moving a piston.\nThe temperature-sensing\
    \ material can be any type of liquid, gas, wax-like substance, or any material\n\
    that changes volume based on temperature.\nElectric actuators apply external energy\
    \ sources, e.g., batteries to generate motion. Electric actuators\nare mechanical\
    \ devices capable of converting electricity into kinetic energy in either a single\
    \ linear or\nrotary motion. The designs of these actuators are based on the intended\
    \ tasks within the processes.\nIn the energy sector, for example, in power plants,\
    \ pneumatic actuators are traditionally\napplied to control valves.\nElectric\
    \ control-valve actuator technology enables achieving energy\nefﬁciency.\nThey\
    \ are also often used as the ﬁnal control element in the operation of a power\n\
    plant [55]. In addition, there are variety of actuators developed for energy industry,\
    \ e.g., LINAK\nelectric actuator (https://www.linak.com/business-areas/energy/)\
    \ that offer solutions for example\nfor minimizing the energy waste when opening\
    \ hatches and locking brakes in wind turbines and\ncreating motion in solar tracking\
    \ panels. In the literature there are also many studies aimed to illustrate\n\
    the applications of the actuators within IoT. For instance, the research in [56]\
    \ proposes a wireless sensor\nand actuator network to provide an IoT-based automatic\
    \ intelligent system. Whereas, by optimizing\nthe operation of devices and machines\
    \ in the IoT, the proposed system achieves reduction in their\noverall energy\
    \ consumption at a given time.\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n7 of 27\n3.3. Communication\
    \ Technologies\nWireless communication systems play the major role in activating\
    \ IoT. Wireless systems connect\nthe sensor devices to IoT gateways and perform\
    \ end-to-end data communications between these\nelements of IoT. Wireless systems\
    \ are developed based on different wireless standards and the use of\neach one\
    \ depends on the requirement of the application such as communication range, bandwidth,\n\
    and power consumption requirements. For example, often renewable sources of energy,\
    \ including\nwind and solar power plants are mostly located in very remote areas.\
    \ Therefore, ensuring a reliable\nIoT communications in remote places is challenging.\
    \ Employing IoT systems on these sites requires\nselection of suitable communication\
    \ technology that can guarantee a continues connection link and\nsupport real-time\
    \ data transfer in an energy efﬁcient manner. Due to the importance of communication\n\
    technologies in IoT, in this subsection we review some of these technologies.\
    \ We also indicate to few\nexamples to show their role in the energy sector. Then,\
    \ we provide a comparison in Table 1 to show\nthe difference of each of the technologies\
    \ when applied with IoT.\nThe short range wireless technologies, e.g., Wireless\
    \ Fidelity (Wi-Fi) (https://www.wi-ﬁ.org/) for\nIoT applications in the energy\
    \ sector has been widely studies. In the energy sector, the obvious cases of\n\
    using Wi-Fi include energy metering and building energy management [57–61]. However,\
    \ due to high\npower requirements of Wi-Fi, this technology is not the best solution\
    \ in the energy sector. Low power\nwide area network (LPWAN) communication technologies\
    \ such as narrowband IoT (NB-IoT); ZigBee;\nBluetooth low energy (BLE) technologies;\
    \ as well as the emerging LPWAN technologies such as LoRa,\nSigfox, and LTE-M\
    \ operating in unlicensed band [62] are better solutions to be used in the energy\
    \ sector.\nBecause, these emerging LPWAN technologies enable establishing a reliable,\
    \ low-cost, low-power,\nlong-range, last-mile technology for smart energy management\
    \ solutions [63]. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe explain the short range and emerging\
    \ LPWAN technologies and review some examples for their\napplied cases in the\
    \ energy sector. We also explain the satellite technology which plays an important\n\
    role in providing global IoT connectivity for industrial sectors located remote\
    \ areas. In addition,\nin Table 1, we illustrate the different features of these\
    \ technologies.\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a short range wireless communication\
    \ technology for IoT that\nenables exchanging data using short radio wavelengths\
    \ (https://www.bluetooth.com/). BLE is less\ncostly to deploy, with a typical\
    \ range of 0 to 30 m, which enables creating an instant personal area\nnetwork\
    \ [64]. BLE targets small-scale IoT applications that require devices to communicate\
    \ small\nvolumes of data consuming minimal power. Industries in the energy sector\
    \ with a well-designed IoT\nstrategy can create new forms of machine-to-machine\
    \ and machine-to-human communication using\nthis technology. In the energy sector,\
    \ BLE is widely used on the energy consumption in residential and\ncommercial\
    \ buildings. For instance, the authors of [65] describe a smart ofﬁce energy management\n\
    system that reduces the energy consumption of PCs, monitors, and lights using\
    \ BLE. Another study\nproposes an energy management system for smart homes that\
    \ utilizes BLE for communication among\nhome appliances aiming at decreasing the\
    \ energy at homes [66]. Similarly, using BLE the research\nin [67] introduces\
    \ a fuzzy-based solution for smart energy management in a home automation, aiming\n\
    improving home energy management scheme.\nZigbee is a communication technology,\
    \ which is designed to create personal area network and\ntargets small scale applications\
    \ (https://zigbee.org/). Zigbee is easy to implement and planned to\nprovide low-cost,\
    \ low-data rate, and highly reliable networks for low-power applications [68,69].\n\
    Zigbee also utilizes a mesh network speciﬁcation where devices are connected with\
    \ many\ninterconnections. Using the mesh networking feature of Zigbee, the maximum\
    \ communication range,\nwhich is up to 100 m, is extended signiﬁcantly. In the\
    \ energy sector, the example IoT applications of\nZigbee include lighting systems\
    \ (buildings and street lighting), smart grids, e.g., smart electric meters,\n\
    home automation systems and industrial automation. These applications aim to provide\
    \ approaches\nfor consuming energy in an efﬁcient way. In literature, aiming to\
    \ minimize the energy expenses of the\nconsumers, the research in [70] evaluates\
    \ the performance of home energy management application\nthrough establishing\
    \ a wireless sensor network using Zigbee. The authors of [71] also introduce smart\n\
    Energies 2020, 13, 494\n8 of 27\nhome interfaces to allow interoperability among\
    \ ZigBee devices, electrical equipment, and smart\nmeters to utilize the energy\
    \ more efﬁciently. The work in [72] presents a ZigBee-based monitoring\nsystem\
    \ which is used to measure and transfer the energy of home appliances at the outlets\
    \ and the\nlights, aiming at reducing the energy consumption. Another study [73]\
    \ presents ﬁeld tests using\nZigBee technologies for monitoring photovoltaic and\
    \ wind energy systems. The results of the study\ndemonstrate the proﬁciency of\
    \ ZigBee devices applied in distributed renewable generation and smart\nmetering\
    \ systems.\nLong Range (LoRa) LoRa is a wireless communication technology designed\
    \ for IoT (https://lora-\nalliance.org/). LoRA is a cost-effective communication\
    \ technology for large deployment of IoT, it can\nadd many years to battery life.\
    \ LoRa is also used to establish long-distance broadcasts (more than\n10 km in\
    \ rural areas) with very low power consumption [74]. The features of this technology\
    \ make it\na suitable communication technology to be used in the energy sector\
    \ mainly in smart cities, such as\nsmart grids and building automation systems,\
    \ e.g., smart metering.\nIn literature, the work in [75] aims at optimizing energy\
    \ consumption by deploying building\nenergy management system using LoRa. The\
    \ work proposes a platform by integrating multiple\nsystems, such as air-conditioning,\
    \ lighting, and energy monitoring to perform building energy\noptimization. The\
    \ outcome of platform resulted in a 20% energy saving. In [76], the authors developed\n\
    a machine-learning-based smart controller for a commercial buildings HVAC utilizing\
    \ LoRa. The smart\ncontroller identiﬁes when a room is not unoccupied and turns\
    \ off the HVAC, reducing its energy\nconsumption up to 19.8%. Using LoRa technology,\
    \ another study [77] presents implementation of\nan electronic platform for energy\
    \ management in public buildings. Through a test, the developed\nplatform allows\
    \ saving the energy for a lighting system by 40%.\nSigfox is a wide area network\
    \ technology which uses an ultra narrow band (https://www.sigfox.\ncom/). Sigfox\
    \ allows devices to communicate with low power for enabling IoT applications [78].\n\
    For the appropriateness of this technology in the energy sector for example, the\
    \ study in [79] reviews\nthe technological advances and presents Sigfox as one\
    \ of the best low power candidates for smart\nmetering for enabling real-time\
    \ energy services for households. In addition, the study in [80] compare\ndifferent\
    \ low power wide area network technologies and conclude that Sigfox is a suitable\
    \ solution to\nbe used with electric plugs sensors alert in smart buildings.\n\
    Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is a LPWAN communication technology that supports large\
    \ number of\nIoT devices and services with a high data rate with very low latency\
    \ (https://www.3gpp.org/news-\nevents/1733-niot/). NB-IoT is a low-cost solution\
    \ that has long battery life and provides enhanced\ncoverage. According to the\
    \ authors of [81], due to the latency features of NB-IoT, this technology is a\n\
    potential solution for smart energy distribution networks by providing low-cost\
    \ communications for\nsmart meters. In addition, the study in [82] demonstrates\
    \ the NB-IoT technology for smart metering.\nAs another application of NB-IoT\
    \ in the energy sector, the work in [83] introduces NB-IoT as a potential\nsolution\
    \ for smart grid communications by comparing NB-IoT with other communication technologies\n\
    in terms of data rate, latency, and communication range.\nLong Term Evolution\
    \ for Machine-Type Communications (LTE-M) is the 3GPP (the third-generation\n\
    partnership project) standardization, which is designed to reduce the device complexity\
    \ for\nmachine-type communication (MTC) [84].\nLTE-M supports secure communication,\
    \ provides\nubiquitous coverage, and offers high system capacity. LTE-M also offers\
    \ services of lower latency and\nhigher throughput than NB-IoT [85]. In addition,\
    \ this technology offers energy efﬁciency resource\nallocation for small powered\
    \ devices, making it to be a potential solution for smart meter [86] and\nsmart\
    \ grid communications [87].\nWeightless is LPWAN open wireless standard that is\
    \ developed to establish communication among\ngreat number of IoT devices and\
    \ machines (http://www.weightless.org/). Weightless is a potential\nsolution for\
    \ smart metering in the energy sector [88]. Based on the study in [89], Weightless\
    \ is a\nsuitable wireless technology can be used in smart home IoT applications\
    \ for smart metering and smart\ngrid communications.\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n\
    9 of 27\nSatellite is another communication technology that has a very wide-area\
    \ coverage and can support\nlow data rate applications in machine-to-machine (M2M)\
    \ fashion [90]. Satellite technology is suitable\nfor supporting IoT devices and\
    \ machines in remote places. The study in [91] presents an IoT-based\nmachine-to-machine\
    \ satellite communication that is applicable to the smart grid, particularly for\n\
    the transmission and distribution (T&D) sector. A similar study highlights the\
    \ importance of using\nsatellite-based IoT communications in energy domain such\
    \ as solar and wind power plants [92].\nTable 1. Comparison between different\

    Computing and analyzing the data generated by IoT allows gaining deeper insight,\
    \ accurate\nresponse to the system, and helps making suitable decisions on energy\
    \ consumption of the systems [99].\nHowever, computing IoT data is a challenging\
    \ issue. Because, IoT data known as Big data refers to\nhuge amount of structured\
    \ and unstructured data, generated from various elements of IoT systems\nsuch\
    \ as sensors, software applications, smart or intelligent devices, and communication\
    \ networks.\nDue to the characteristics of Big data, which are big volume, high\
    \ velocity, and high variety [100],\nit needs to be efﬁciently processed and analyzed\
    \ [101]. Processing the Big data is beyond the capacity\nof traditional methods,\
    \ i.e., storing it on local hard drives, computing, and analyzing them afterwards.\n\
    Advanced computing and analytic methods are needed to manage the Big data [102,103].\
    \ In the\nfollowings, we explain cloud computing and fog computing, which are\
    \ widely used for processing\nand computing the Big data.\n3.4.1. Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud computing is a data processing approach that offers services, applications,\
    \ storage,\nand computing through the internet and allows computation of data\
    \ streamed from IoT devices.\nIn cloud computing, cloud refers to the “Internet”\
    \ and computing refers to computation and processing\nservices offered by this\
    \ approach [104]. Cloud computing consists of both application services that are\n\
    accessed via the Internet and the hardware systems, which are located in data\
    \ centers [105]. Using these\ncharacteristics, cloud computing enables processing\
    \ the big data, and provides complex computation\ncapabilities [106]. The main\
    \ beneﬁts of using cloud systems relies on [107] (i) signiﬁcantly reducing\nthe\
    \ cost of hardware; (ii) enhancing the computing power and storage capacity; and\
    \ (iii) having\nmulti-core architectures, which eases the data management.\nMoreover,\
    \ cloud computing is a\nsecured system, which provides resources, computing power,\
    \ and storage that is needed from a\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n10 of 27\ngeographical\
    \ location [108]. These features of cloud computing enables the big data resulted\
    \ from the\ngrowing applications of IoT to be easily analyzed, controlled and\
    \ sorted efﬁciently [109]. In addition,\ncloud computing eliminates the costs\
    \ needed for purchasing hardware and software and running the\nalgorithms for\
    \ processing the IoT data, resulting in considerably minimization of electricity\
    \ needed for\nlocal data computation.\n3.4.2. Fog Computing\nAlthough cloud computing\
    \ is one of the best computing paradigms for data processing for IoT\napplications.\
    \ Due to the delay and bandwidth limitation of centralized resources that are\
    \ used for\ndata processing, more efﬁcient ways are required. Fog computing is\
    \ a distributed paradigm and an\nextension of the cloud, which moves the computing\
    \ and analytic services near to the edge of the\nnetwork. Fog computing is a paradigm\
    \ that expands the cloud at a greater scale and can support\nlarger workload [110].\
    \ In fog computing, any device with computing, storage, and network connection\n\
    capability works as fog node. The examples of these devices include, but are not\
    \ limited to, personal\ncomputers, industrial controllers, switches, routers,\
    \ and embedded servers [111]. In this computing\nparadigm, fog provides IoT data\
    \ processing and storage locally at IoT devices instead of sending them\nto the\
    \ cloud. The advantages of this approach include enhanced secure services required\
    \ for many IoT\napplications as well as reducing network trafﬁc and latency [112].\
    \ Therefore, in contrast to the cloud\ncomputing, fog offers processing and computing\
    \ services with faster response with higher security.\nThis enables faster decision-making\
    \ and taking appropriate actions.\n4. IoT in the Energy Sector\nToday, the energy\
    \ sector is highly dependent on fossil fuels, constituting nearly 80 % of ﬁnal\n\
    energy globally. Excessive extraction and combustion of fossil fuels has adverse\
    \ environmental, health,\nand economic impacts due to air pollution and climate\
    \ change to name a few. Energy efﬁciency,\ni.e., consuming less energy for delivering\
    \ the same service, and the deployment of renewable energy\nsources are two main\
    \ alternatives to diminish the adverse impacts of fossil fuel use [12,13].\nIn\
    \ this section, we discuss the role of IoT in the energy sector, from fuel extraction,\
    \ operation,\nand maintenance (O&M) of energy generating assets, to T&D and end\
    \ use of energy IoT can play a\ncrucial role in reducing energy losses and lowering\
    \ CO2 emissions. An energy management system\nbased on IoT can monitor real-time\
    \ energy consumption and increase the level of awareness about the\nenergy performance\
    \ at any level of the supply chain [15,113]. This section discusses the application\
    \ of\nIoT in energy generation stages ﬁrst. Then, we continue with the concept\
    \ of smart cities, which is an\numbrella term for many IoT-based subsystems such\
    \ as smart grids, smart buildings, smart factories,\nand intelligent transportation.\
    \ Next, we discuss each of the above-mentioned components separately.\nFinally,\
    \ we summarize the ﬁndings of this section in Tables 2 and 3.\n4.1. IoT and Energy\
    \ Generation\nAutomating industrial processes and supervisory control and data\
    \ acquisition systems became\npopular in the power sector in 1990s [37]. By monitoring\
    \ and controlling equipment and processes,\nearly stages of IoT started to contribute\
    \ to the power sector by alleviating the risk of loss of production\nor blackout.\
    \ Reliability, efﬁciency, environmental impacts, and maintenance issues are the\
    \ main\nchallenges of old power plants. The age of equipment in the power sector\
    \ and poor maintenance\nproblems can lead to high level of energy losses and unreliability.\
    \ Assets are sometimes more than\n40 years old, very expensive, and cannot be\
    \ replaced easily. IoT can contribute to reducing some of\nthese challenges in\
    \ the management of power plants [37]. By applying IoT sensors, Internet-connected\n\
    devices are able to distinguish any failure in the operation or abnormal decrease\
    \ in energy efﬁciency,\nalarming the need for maintenance. This increases reliability\
    \ and efﬁciency of the system, in addition\nto reducing the cost of maintenance\
    \ [114]. According to [115], a new IoT-based power plant can save\nEnergies 2020,\
    \ 13, 494\n11 of 27\n230 million USD during the lifetime and an existing plant\
    \ with the same size can save 50 million USD\nif equipped with the IoT platform.\n\

    \ local energy resources, many countries are promoting\nRESs. Weather-dependent\
    \ or variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as wind and solar energy,\n\
    pose new challenges to the energy system known as “the intermittency challenge”.\
    \ In an energy\nsystem with a high share of VRE, matching generation of energy\
    \ with demand is a big challenge due to\nvariability of supply and demand resulting\
    \ in mismatch in different time scales. IoT systems offer the\nﬂexibility in balancing\
    \ generation with demand, which in turn can reduce the challenges of deploying\n\
    VRE, resulting in higher integration shares of clean energy and less GHG emissions\
    \ [116]. In addition,\nby employing IoT, a more efﬁcient use of energy can be\
    \ achieved by using machine-learning algorithms\nthat help determine an optimal\
    \ balance of different supply and demand technologies [37]. For instance,\nthe\
    \ use of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms can balance the power output of a thermal\
    \ power plant with\nthe sources of in-house power generation, e.g., aggregating\
    \ many small-scale solar PV panels [117].\nTable 2 summarizes the applications\

    generation and storage systems.\n4.2. Smart Cities\nNowadays, the staggering rate\
    \ of urbanization as well as overpopulation has brought many\nglobal concerns,\
    \ such as air and water pollution [118], energy access, and environmental concerns.\n\
    In this line, one of the main challenges is to provide the cities with clean,\
    \ affordable and reliable\nenergy sources. The recent developments in digital\
    \ technologies have provided a driving force to\napply smart, IoT based solutions\
    \ for the existing problems in a smart city context [119]. Smart factories,\n\
    smart homes, power plants, and farms in a city can be connected and the data about\
    \ their energy\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n13 of 27\nconsumption in different hours\
    \ of the day can be gathered. If it is found that a section, e.g., residential\n\
    areas, consumes the most energy in the afternoon, then automatically energy devoted\
    \ to other sections,\ne.g., factories, can be minimized to balance the whole system\
    \ at a minimum cost and risk of congestion\nor blackout.\nIn a smart city, different\
    \ processes, i.e., information transmission and communication, intelligent\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ location determination, tracing, monitoring, pollution control, and identity\
    \ management\ncan be managed perfectly by the aid of IoT technology [120]. IoT\
    \ technologies can help to monitor\nevery object in a city. Buildings, urban infrastructure,\
    \ transport, energy networks, and utilities could\nbe connected to sensors. These\
    \ connections can ensure an energy-efﬁcient smart city by constant\nmonitoring\
    \ of data gathered from sensors. For example, by monitoring vehicles with IoT,\
    \ street lights\ncan be controlled for optimal use of energy. In addition, the\
    \ authorities can have access to the\ngathered information and can make more informed\
    \ decisions on transportation choices and their\nenergy demand.\n4.3. Smart Grid\n\
    Smart grids are modern grids deploying the most secure and dependable ICT technology\
    \ to\ncontrol and optimize energy generation, T&D grids, and end usage. By connecting\
    \ many smart\nmeters, a smart grid develops a multi-directional ﬂow of information,\
    \ which can be used for optimal\nmanagement of the system and efﬁcient energy\
    \ distribution [121]. The application of smart grid can be\nhighlighted in different\
    \ subsectors of the energy system individually, e.g., energy generation, buildings,\n\
    or transportation, or they can be considered altogether.\nIn traditional grids,\
    \ batteries were recharged by adapters through electricity cables and AC/DC\n\
    inverter [121]. These batteries can be charged wirelessly in a smart grid, using\
    \ an inductive charging\ntechnology. In addition, in a smart grid, the energy\
    \ demand pattern of end users can be analyzed\nby collecting data through an IoT\
    \ platform, for example, the time of charging of mobile phones or\nelectric cars.\
    \ Then, the nearest wireless battery charge station can allocate the right time-slot\
    \ and that\ndevice/vehicle can be charged. Another advantage is that the use of\
    \ IoT will lead to better control\nand monitoring of the battery equipped devices,\
    \ and therefore, ﬁrst, the energy distribution can be\nadjusted, and second, the\
    \ delivery of electricity to these vehicles can be guaranteed. This will reduce\n\
    unnecessary energy consumption considerably.\nMoreover, IoT can be applied in\
    \ isolated and microgrids for some islands or organizations,\nespecially when\
    \ energy is required every single moment with no exception, e.g., in databases.\
    \ In such\nsystems, all the assets connected to the grid can interact with each\
    \ other. Also, the data on energy\ndemand of any asset is accessible. This interaction\
    \ can assure the perfect management of the energy\ndistribution whenever and everywhere\
    \ needed. In terms of collaborative impact of smart grids, as it is\nshown in\
    \ Figure 3, in a smart city equipped with IoT-based smart grids, different sections\
    \ of the city\ncan be connected together [121].\nDuring the collaborative communication\
    \ between different sectors, the smart grid can alert\noperators through smart\
    \ appliances before any acute problem occurs [113,122]. For example, through\n\
    constant monitoring, it can be detected if energy demand exceeds the capacity\
    \ of the grid. Therefore,\nby acquiring real-time data, different strategies can\
    \ be adopted by authorities and energy consumption\ncan be rescheduled to a different\
    \ time when there is lower expected demand. In some regions, smart (or\ndynamic)\
    \ pricing tariffs have been considered for variable energy prices in this regard\
    \ [123]. Real-time\npricing (RTP) tariffs as well as the energy price will be\
    \ higher at a certain time when the consumption\nof energy is likely to be higher.\
    \ Through the data gathered from the components of the smart grid,\nenergy consumption\
    \ and generation can be perfectly optimized and managed by far-sighted strategies.\n\
    Reduction of transmission losses in T&D networks through active voltage management\
    \ or reduction\nof non-technical losses using a network of smart meters are other\
    \ examples of applying IoT [37].\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n14 of 27\nFigure 3.\
    \ A centralized data connectivity in a smart city concept.\n4.4. Smart Buildings\n\
    The energy consumption in cities can be divided into different parts; residential\
    \ buildings\n(domestic); and commercial (services), including shops, ofﬁces, and\
    \ schools, and transport.\nThe domestic energy consumption in the residential\
    \ sector includes lighting, equipment (appliances),\ndomestic hot water, cooking,\
    \ refrigerating, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) (Figure 4).\n\
    HVAC energy consumption typically accounts for half of energy consumption in buildings\
    \ [124].\nTherefore, the management of HVAC systems is important in reducing electricity\
    \ consumption.\nWith the advancement of technology in the industry, IoT devices\
    \ can play an important role to control\nthe energy losses in HVAC systems. For\
    \ example, by locating some wireless thermostats based on\noccupancy, unoccupied\
    \ places can be realized. Once an unoccupied zone is detected, some actions can\n\
    be taken to lower energy consumption. For instance, HVAC systems can reduce the\
    \ operation in the\nunoccupied zone, which will lead to signiﬁcant reduction in\
    \ energy consumption and losses.\nFigure 4. Share of residential energy consumption.\n\
    IoT can also be applied to manage the energy losses of lighting systems. For example,\
    \ through\napplying IoT-based lighting systems, the customers will be alerted\
    \ when the energy consumption\ngoes beyond the standard level. Furthermore, by\
    \ an efﬁcient analysis of the real-time data, load from\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n\
    15 of 27\nhigh-peak will be shifted to low-peak levels. This makes a signiﬁcant\
    \ contribution to optimal use of\nelectrical energy [119,125] and reducing related\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions. Using IoT, the demand\nresponse will be more agile\
    \ and ﬂexible, and the monitoring and demand side management will\nbecome more\
    \ efﬁcient.\n4.5. Smart Use of Energy in Industry\nIoT can be employed to design\
    \ a fully connected and ﬂexible system in the industry to reduce\nenergy consumption\
    \ while optimizing production. In traditional factories, a lot of energy is spent\n\
    to produce the end product and control the quality of the end product. Moreover,\
    \ monitoring every\nsingle process requires human resources to be involved. However,\
    \ using an agile and ﬂexible system in\nsmart factories helps to recognize failures\
    \ at the same time rather than recognizing them by monitoring\nthe products at\
    \ the end of production line. Therefore, a suitable action can be taken promptly\
    \ to avert\nwasteful production and associated waste energy.\nIn terms of monitoring\
    \ processes during manufacturing, IoT, and its enabling technology play\na crucial\
    \ role. Gateway devices, IoT hub networks, web servers, and cloud platforms, which\
    \ are\naccessible with smart mobile devices (e.g., smart phones or personal computers)\
    \ can be examples\nof monitoring equipment. Wireless communications such as Wi-Fi,\
    \ Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-wave,\nor wired communications, such as Local Area Network\
    \ (LAN) can be used to connect all pieces\nof equipment [126]. Moreover, to use\
    \ IoT more efﬁciently, by installing sensors on each component of\nan industrial\
    \ site, the components that consume more energy than their nominal energy level\
    \ can be\ndetected. Thus, every single component can be easily managed, the faults\
    \ of components can be ﬁxed,\nand the energy consumption of each component can\
    \ be optimized. This eminently results in reducing\nthe energy losses in smart\
    \ factories.\nIn a smart factory, data processing is the key element in the whole\
    \ system, through which data in\nthe cloud platform (acts as a brain) will be\
    \ analyzed to help managers making more efﬁcient decisions\nin time [127]. In\
    \ terms of monitoring and maintaining assets of manufacturing, the big problem\
    \ in\nfactories is the depreciation of machines and mechanical devices. With an\
    \ appropriate IoT platform and\ntools, the proper device size can be selected\
    \ to reduce wear and tear and the associated maintenance\ncosts. IoT-based conditional\
    \ monitoring ensures the mechanical device never reaches its threshold\nlimit.\
    \ This simply means the device lasts longer and suffers fewer failures. Moreover,\
    \ the failures that\ncause energy loss can be anticipated to be tackled.\nIoT-based\
    \ agile systems can provide a smart system for collaboration between customers,\n\
    manufactures, and companies. Therefore, a speciﬁc product will be manufactured\
    \ directly according\nto customers’ order. Therefore, energy consumed during the\
    \ process of storing spare parts as well\nas the energy wasted in warehouses to\
    \ keep the spare parts will be dwindled signiﬁcantly. Only a\ncertain number of\
    \ products in various kinds will be manufactured and stored, which enhances the\n\
    management of energy consumption and production efﬁciency [126].\n4.6. Intelligent\
    \ Transportation\nOne of the major causes of air pollution and energy losses in\
    \ big cities is overuse of private vehicles\ninstead of public transportation.\
    \ As opposed to a traditional transportation system where each system\nworks independently,\
    \ applying IoT technologies in transportation, so called “smart transportation”,\n\
    offers a global management system. Also, the real-time data processing plays a\
    \ signiﬁcant role in trafﬁc\nmanagement. All the components of the transportation\
    \ system can be connected together, and their\ndata can be processed together.\
    \ Congestion control and smart parking systems using online maps\nare some applications\
    \ of smart transportation. Smart use of transportation enables passengers to\n\
    select a more cost-saving option with shorter distance and the fastest route,\
    \ which saves a signiﬁcant\namount of time and energy [120]. Citizens will be\
    \ able to determine their arrival time and manage\ntheir schedule more efﬁciently\
    \ [125]. Therefore, time of city trips will be shortened, and the energy\nEnergies\
    \ 2020, 13, 494\n16 of 27\nlosses will be reduced signiﬁcantly. This can remarkably\
    \ reduce CO2 emissions and other air polluting\ngases from transportation [119].\n\
    Table 3 summarizes the applications of IoT in the energy sector, from smart energy\
    \ grids to the\nend use of energy. The IoT-based digitalization transforms an\
    \ energy system from a unidirectional\ndirection, i.e., from generation through\
    \ energy grids to consumers, to an integrated energy system.\nDifferent parts\
    \ of such an integrated smart energy system are depicted in Figure 5.\nFigure\
    \ 5. Applications of IoT in an integrated smart energy system.\n5. Challenges\
    \ of Applying IoT\nBesides all the beneﬁts of IoT for energy saving, deploying\
    \ IoT in the energy sector represents\nchallenges that need to be addressed. This\
    \ section addresses the challenges and existing solutions for\napplying IoT-based\
    \ energy systems. In addition, in Table 4, we summarize the challenges and current\n\
    solutions of using IoT in the energy sector.\n5.1. Energy Consumption\nIn the\
    \ energy systems, the major effort of IoT platforms are saving the energy. In\
    \ energy systems\nto enable communication using IoT, massive number of IoT devices\
    \ transmit data. To run the IoT\nsystem and transmit huge amount of data generated\
    \ from the IoT devices considerable amount of\nenergy is needed [128]. Therefore,\
    \ the energy consumption of IoT systems remains as an important\nchallenge. However,\
    \ various approaches have tried to reduce the power consumption of IoT systems.\n\
    For example, by setting the sensors to go to sleep mode and just work when necessary.\
    \ Designing\nefﬁcient communication protocols which allow distributed computing\
    \ techniques that enables energy\nefﬁcient communications has been studied greatly.\
    \ Applying radio optimization techniques such as\nmodulation optimization and\
    \ cooperative communication has been considered as a solution. Moreover,\nenergy-efﬁcient\
    \ routing techniques such as cluster architectures and employing multi-path routing\n\
    techniques was understood as another solution [129–131].\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n\

    decision-making\n5.2. Integration of IoT with Subsystems\nA main challenge includes\
    \ the integration of an IoT system in subsystems of the energy system.\nBecause\
    \ subsystems of the energy sector are unique employing various sensor and data\
    \ communication\ntechnologies. Therefore, solutions are needed for managing the\
    \ data exchange among subsystems\nof a IoT-enabled energy system [132–134]. An\
    \ approach for ﬁnding solutions for the integration\nchallenge, taking into account\
    \ the IoT requirements of a subsystem, pertains to modeling an integrated\nframework\
    \ for the energy system [132]. Other solutions propose designing co-simulation\
    \ models\nfor energy systems to integrate the system and minimize synchronization\
    \ delay error between the\nsubsystems [135,136].\n5.3. User Privacy\nPrivacy refers\
    \ to the right of individual or cooperative energy consumers to maintain\nconﬁdentiality\
    \ of their personal information when it is shared with an organization [137,138].\
    \ Therefore,\naccessing to proper data such as the number of energy users as well\
    \ as the number and types of\nappliances which use energy become impossible. Indeed,\
    \ these types of data which can be gathered\nusing IoT enables better decision-making\
    \ that can inﬂuence the energy production, distribution and\nconsumption [139].\
    \ However, to decrease the violation of users’ privacy, it is recommended that\
    \ the\nenergy providers ask for user permission to use their information [140],\
    \ guaranteeing that the users’\ninformation will not be shared with other parties.\
    \ Another solution would also be a trusted privacy\nmanagement system where energy\
    \ consumers have control over their information and privacy is\nsuggested [141].\n\
    5.4. Security Challenge\nThe use of IoT and integration of communication technologies\
    \ in energy systems enhances the\nthreat and cyber-attacks to information of users\
    \ and the energy systems from production, transmission,\nand distribution to consumption\
    \ [142,143]. These threads deﬁne the security challenge in the energy\nsector\
    \ [144]. Moreover, IoT-based energy systems are widely deployed in large geographical\
    \ areas\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n18 of 27\nwithin the energy sector to offer services.\
    \ The large deployment of IoT systems puts them in more\nrisk of being under cyberattacks.\
    \ To overcome the challenge, a study introduces an encryption scheme\nto secure\
    \ energy information from the cyberattacks [145]. In addition, distributed control\
    \ systems\nwhich enable control at different IoT system level are suggested to\
    \ reduce the risk of cyberattack and\nincreasing the security of system [146].\n\
    5.5. IoT Standards\nIoT uses a variety of technologies with different standards\
    \ to connect from a single device to a large\nnumber of devices. The inconsistency\
    \ among IoT devices that utilize different standards forms a new\nchallenge [147].\
    \ In IoT-enabled systems, there are two types of standards, including network\
    \ protocols,\ncommunication protocols, and data-aggregation standards as well\
    \ as regulatory standards related\nto security and privacy of data. The challenges\
    \ facing the adoption of standards within IoT include\nthe standards for handling\
    \ unstructured data, security and privacy issues in addition to regulatory\nstandards\
    \ for data markets [148]. An approach for overcoming the challenge of standardization\
    \ of\nIoT-based energy system is to deﬁne a system of systems with a common sense\
    \ of understanding to\nallow all actors to equally access and use. Another solution\
    \ pertains to developing open information\nmodels and protocols of the standards\
    \ by the cooperating parties. This shall result in standards which\nare freely\
    \ and publicly available [149].\n5.6. Architecture Design\nIoT-enabled systems\
    \ are composed of variety of technologies with increasing number of\nsmart interconnected\
    \ devices and sensors. IoT is expected to enable communications at anytime,\n\
    anywhere for any related services, generally, in an autonomic and ad hoc fashion.\
    \ This means\nthat the IoT systems based on their application purposes are designed\
    \ by complex, decentralized,\nand mobile characteristics [149].\nTaking into account\
    \ the characteristics and needs of an IoT\napplication, a reference architecture\
    \ cannot be a unique solution for all of these applications.\nTherefore, for IoT\
    \ systems, heterogeneous reference architectures are needed which are open and\n\
    follow standards. The architectures also should not limit the users to use ﬁxed\
    \ and end-to-end IoT\ncommunications [149,150].\n6. Future Trends\nApplying current\
    \ IoT systems for providing energy efﬁcient solutions in the energy sector has\n\
    many advantages highlighted in previous sections. However, for deploying IoT in\
    \ the energy domain,\nnew solutions and trends are needed to improve the performance\
    \ of IoT and overcome the associated\nchallenges. In this section, we present\
    \ the Blockchain technology and Green-IoT as two approaches\nthat can help to\
    \ tackle some of the challenges.\n6.1. Blockchain and IoT\nCurrent IoT systems\
    \ mostly rely on centralized cloud systems [151,152]. In most IoT applications,\n\
    thousands of IoT devices and machines need to be connected, which is hard to synchronize.\
    \ Moreover,\ndue to the centralized and server-client nature of IoT when server\
    \ is vulnerable, all the connected\nobjects are easy to be hacked and compromised,\
    \ which result in security concerns for the system and\nprivacy issues for users\
    \ [153]. Fortunately, Blockchain can be a solution for this challenge [154].\n\
    Blockchain provides a decentralized and democratized platform with no need for\
    \ third party’s\nintervention. The consensus platform of blockchain requires every\
    \ IoT node proves that it pursues the\nsame goal as others. Veriﬁed transactions\
    \ is also stored in the form of a block, which is linked\nto the previous one\
    \ in a way information can never be erased. Moreover, the history of every\nsingle\
    \ transaction at every node can be recorded and is accessible by everyone. Therefore,\
    \ any\nmember in blockchain becomes aware of any changes in each block immediately\
    \ [155–157]. Moreover,\ndue to the distributed ledger of blockchain, even thousands\
    \ of IoT devices can be synchronized\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n19 of 27\neasily.\
    \ The consensus algorithms of blockchain based on peer-to-peer networks can provide\
    \ a secure\ndistributed database [153]. Therefore, decentralized and private-by-design\
    \ IoT that can guarantee the\nprivacy can be promised by blockchain [158].\nMore\
    \ importantly, blockchain can store and share software updates between objects.\
    \ There are\ninnocuousness checking nodes that approve the accuracy of update\
    \ information as a new node and\nguarantee its protection from any threats, once\
    \ an update added to the blockchain as a valid block,\nit is impossible to erase\
    \ or change it. Therefore, IoT-based platforms can be provided with updates\n\
    availability and innocuousness through blockchain [159].\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ the application of blockchain will accelerate the IoT effectiveness by providing\n\
    a decentralized platform for distributed power generation and storage systems\
    \ enhancing energy\nsecurity and efﬁciency. Real and high-qualiﬁed data can be\
    \ exchanged freely between devices and\npeople can directly have access to energy\
    \ information without the involvement of any third party.\nNeighbors can simply\
    \ trade energy with one another. Therefore, without involvement of authorities,\n\
    not only trust will be enhanced among people, but also many costs of this connection\
    \ to the centralized\ngrids can be saved. Another advantage is that by monitoring\
    \ the usage statistics of an area, Blockchain\nenables the energy distribution\
    \ to remotely control energy ﬂow to that particular area. Furthermore,\nblockchain-based\
    \ IoT systems helps in the diagnosis and maintenance of equipment within smart\n\
    grid [154].\nCurrently, the direct application of blockchain technology in an\
    \ IoT-based system is impossible\ndue to lack of enough computational resources,\
    \ insufﬁcient bandwidth and the need to preserve power.\nHowever, cloud and fog\
    \ computing platforms can ease the way for blockchain services in IoT [160].\n\
    6.2. Green IoT\nThe energy consumption of IoT devices is an important challenge,\
    \ especially in large-scale\ndeployment of these technologies in near future.\
    \ To run billions of devices that will be connected\nto the Internet signiﬁcant\
    \ amount of energy is required. The big number of IoT devices will also\nproduce\
    \ a great deal of electronic waste [161]. To tackle these challenges, a low-carbon\
    \ and efﬁcient\ncommunication networks are needed. Fortunately, these necessities\
    \ has led to the appearance of\nthe green IoT (G-IoT) [162,163]. The key component\
    \ of G-IoT is its energy-efﬁcient characteristics\nthroughout the life cycle,\
    \ i.e., design, production, deployment, and ultimately disposal [129].\nG-IoT\
    \ cycle can be applied in different IoT technologies. For example, in radio frequency\n\
    identiﬁcation (RFID) tags. To decrease the amount of material in each RFID tag,\
    \ which is difﬁcult\nto be recycled, the size of RFID tags are reduced [161,164–168].\
    \ Green M2M communications is\nanother example, which enables adjusting power\
    \ transmission the minimum level, facilitates more\nefﬁcient communication protocols\
    \ using algorithmic and distributed computing techniques [129].\nIn wireless sensor\
    \ networks also the sensors nodes can be in the sleep mode and just work\nwhen\
    \ necessary. In addition, radio optimization techniques, such as, modulation optimization\
    \ or\ncooperative communication can be applied to reduce the power consumption\
    \ of the nodes. Moreover,\nenergy-efﬁcient routing techniques, such as, cluster\
    \ architectures or multi-path routing can provide\nefﬁcient solutions [130,131].\
    \ In conclusion, the above-mentioned approaches and examples can reduce\nthe energy\
    \ needs of IoT systems.\n7. Conclusions\nEnergy systems are on the threshold of\
    \ a new transition era. Large-scale deployment of VRE in\ndistributed energy systems\
    \ and the need for efﬁcient use of energy calls for system-wide, integrated\n\
    approaches to minimize the socio-economic-environmental impacts of energy systems.\
    \ In this respect,\nmodern technologies such as IoT can help the energy sector\
    \ transform from a central, hierarchical\nsupply chain to a decentralized, smart,\
    \ and optimized system. In this paper, we review the role of IoT\nin the energy\
    \ sector in general, and in the context of smart grids particularly.\nEnergies\

    management, connectivity issues and uncertainty, integration of subsystems, security\
    \ and privacy,\nenergy requirements of IoT systems, standardization, and architectural\

    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\
    \ yield via cloud dashboards for\nfarmers. A schematic of the digital twin concept\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\
    \ technology in crop \nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization\
    \ and has been drawing more at-\ntention in recent years. To optimize the robotic\
    \ application process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efficiency\
    \ of the product, the digital twin concepts can be used for \nvirtualization of\
    \ the robot environment by introducing a remote operating system [64]. By \nproviding\
    \ simulation and remote operation possibilities and modeling various interac-\n\
    tions between robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\
    \ \nand flexibility may enhance, and the final product cost may decline. Ref.\
    \ [65] analyzed the \nhuman-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform.\
    \ Their developed digital \ntwin helps to improve operational productivity and\
    \ comfort. In another study, a digital \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital\
    \ twin concept for crop production technology.\nDigital twin in design and manufacturing\
    \ of products (e.g., farm machinery) re-\nquires (I) geometric (e.g., size, shape)\
    \ and physical properties of an object, (II) in the\ndetailed information of the\
    \ product which can illustrate dynamic processing of the object,\n(III) integration\
    \ of geometric, physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin ap-\nproaches\
    \ make it possible to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery\n\
    that would yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efﬁciencies.\n\
    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be mod-\neled in digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors\
    \ on energy consumption can\nalso be explored there [62]. In the agricultural\
    \ context, ref. [40] reported that a commercially\navailable digital twin platform\
    \ for agricultural machinery is able to track the machines\nin real-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efﬁciency of crop management,\nand trajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the speciﬁc conditions of the farm. It has also\n\
    been reported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training of\
    \ unskilled\nharvester operators and lead to high macro-economic beneﬁts [63].\n\
    Within the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important technology\
    \ in crop\nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization and has\
    \ been drawing more\nattention in recent years. To optimize the robotic application\
    \ process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efﬁciency of the product,\
    \ the digital twin concepts can be used for\nvirtualization of the robot environment\
    \ by introducing a remote operating system [64].\nBy providing simulation and\
    \ remote operation possibilities and modeling various inter-\nactions between\
    \ robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\nand\
    \ ﬂexibility may enhance, and the ﬁnal product cost may decline. Ref. [65] analyzed\n\
    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    1\nIntroduction\nIn China, known for its robust agricultural sector, favorable\
    \ climatic conditions, abundant sunlight, and ample\nwater resources are recognized\
    \ as key factors promoting agricultural development [1, 2]. These conditions,\
    \ however,\nalso contribute to the proliferation of pests and diseases, positioning\
    \ pest and disease detection as a critical factor in\nadvancing agricultural practices.\
    \ Traditional approaches, which predominantly rely on experts or technicians for\
    \ the\nidentification of pests and diseases, are characterized by their low efficiency,\
    \ susceptibility to subjective biases, and\nhigh labor intensity, rendering them\
    \ inadequate for practical needs [3, 4].\nThe advent of machine vision, the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), and drone technologies has led to a significant\nexpansion\
    \ in the use of drones within the agricultural sector [5, 6]. Machine vision,\
    \ substituting human observation\nwith computerized systems, imitates human visual\
    \ capabilities to measure and evaluate the identified objects. This\nprocess involves\
    \ capturing images through imaging devices, which are then processed by a series\
    \ of algorithms within\nan image processing unit, ultimately yielding detection\
    \ results [7, 8]. The role of target detection is fundamental in\nthe machine\
    \ vision system. These technologies introduce innovative methods for detecting\
    \ agricultural pests and\ndiseases, thereby significantly enhancing detection\
    \ efficiency [9, 10].\nIn traditional drone-based pest and disease recognition\
    \ systems, machine vision plays a pivotal role, primarily\nprocessing extracted\
    \ images via algorithms to identify attributes such as texture, shape, and color.\
    \ These systems then\nemploy various algorithms for classification. Conventional\
    \ methods involved manual design of pest characteristics\nand classifiers, utilizing\
    \ techniques like threshold segmentation, edge detection with Sobel, Roberts,\
    \ Prewitt methods,\nhttps://doi.org/10.56578/ataiml030101\n1\nand feature extraction\
    \ methods including Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Histogram of Oriented\
    \ Gradients\n(HOG), as well as shape, color, and texture analysis. Classification\
    \ is typically performed using methods such as\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM),\
    \ Back Propagation (BP), Bayesian analysis, among others [11, 12]. The imaging\n\
    requirements for object detection in these systems are stringent, demanding a\
    \ stark contrast between pests and their\nsurrounding environment. However, the\
    \ diversity of pest types and their morphological changes during different\ngrowth\
    \ stages, along with the possibility of similar characteristics being displayed\
    \ by different pests at various stages,\npose significant challenges. These challenges\
    \ are compounded by the complexities of natural light and background\nsimilarities\
    \ in real-world detection scenarios, which can compromise the robustness and effectiveness\
    \ of traditional\nmachine vision recognition algorithms [13, 14].\nDeep learning\
    \ technology, which mimics the structure and functionality of human brain neural\
    \ networks,\noutperforms traditional machine learning by autonomously learning\
    \ from extensive datasets, thus exhibiting formidable\ncomputational capabilities.\
    \ Provided with ample learning data and high-performance computing units, deep\
    \ learning\ndemonstrates enhanced robustness, superior detection performance,\
    \ and greater recognition accuracy [15, 16]. The\nevolution of drone technology\
    \ has markedly advanced the deployment of agricultural drones for pest control.\
    \ The\napplication of these drones, particularly in pesticide spraying, not only\
    \ utilizes machine vision technology for efficient\nplanning of spray routes but\
    \ also significantly reduces human exposure to pesticides. This advancement facilitates\n\
    increased spray efficiency, uniformity, and the automation and precision of pesticide\
    \ application. The role of pest and\ndisease detection and control in agricultural\
    \ production is crucial, directly influencing crop yield. Therefore, the\nintegration\
    \ of deep learning in pest and disease recognition systems for agricultural drones\
    \ is vital for the advancement\nof agricultural practices.\nIn this study, the\
    \ has been selected as the deep learning model for the pest and disease recognition\
    \ system\ntailored to agricultural drones. CNN is meticulously designed to take\
    \ into account the spatial structure and local\ncorrelation of images, thereby\
    \ enhancing the efficiency of image data processing. These networks are adept\
    \ at\ntasks such as object detection, image classification, and image recognition,\
    \ excelling in the extraction of features\nfrom detected images, which equips\
    \ them with robust image recognition and analysis capabilities. Particularly\n\
    proficient in extracting deep features from images, CNN significantly bolsters\
    \ image recognition performance,\nexhibiting formidable robustness [17, 18]. This\
    \ research delves into the critical technologies integral to deep learning\nin\
    \ agricultural drone pest and disease recognition systems, encompassing deep learning\
    \ models, algorithms, and\nevaluation metrics for such systems. The deep learning-based\
    \ algorithms employed here are characterized by their\npotent feature extraction\
    \ ability, high detection precision, and recognition efficiency, surpassing traditional\
    \ algorithms\nand offering substantial guidance in identifying crop pests and\
    \ diseases.\nThe application of CNN in crop pest and disease recognition by various\
    \ researchers has yielded noteworthy results.\nHowever, challenges persist due\
    \ to the complex and variable backgrounds encountered in real crop pest and disease\n\
    scenarios, difficulties in acquiring agricultural disease image data, and the\
    \ constraints posed by limited data volume.\nEnhancing the accuracy and robustness\
    \ of recognition algorithms remains an ongoing focus of research. Striking a\n\
    balance between heightened recognition precision and maintaining processing speed\
    \ is an ongoing challenge in the\nfield.\n2 Methodology\n2.1 Overall System Design\n\
    In this research, a pest and disease recognition system designed for agricultural\
    \ drones is structured into a three-tier\narchitecture. This architecture encompasses\
    \ the sensing layer, transmission layer, and application layer. The structural\n\
    framework of the system is systematically represented in Figure 1.\nFigure 1.\
    \ Structural framework of the recognition system\n2\n2.1.1 Sensing layer\nThe\
    \ sensing layer forms the foundation of the recognition system, incorporating\
    \ the drone system, ground\nmonitoring station, and mobile client. This layer\
    \ is primarily dedicated to fulfilling the dynamic recognition demands\nof agricultural\
    \ drones.\nWithin the drone system, a series of components are coordinated to\
    \ control device rotation, movement, focus\nadjustment, and image acquisition.\
    \ Key components include a structural frame, a main processor of Digital Signal\n\
    Processor (DSP), a data collection module, a power supply module, a Charge Coupled\
    \ Device (CCD) camera, and a\npropulsion system. The drone system’s control framework\
    \ is comprehensively illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Control framework of\
    \ the drone system\nThe central processing unit of the drone system is a DM643\
    \ model, specifically engineered for digital multimedia\napplications. This unit\
    \ functions as the heart of the drone’s flight control system, managing tasks\
    \ such as receiving\nflight data, orchestrating trajectory planning, and processing\
    \ the images captured. The data collection module is\nintegral to this system,\
    \ tasked with the real-time acquisition of flight status data. This data is then\
    \ relayed to a\nmicrocontroller responsible for monitoring and controlling the\
    \ drone’s posture, thereby ensuring the safety of its flight.\nConstituting this\
    \ module are various components, including an altitude sensor, a Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS),\nangle sensor, angular velocity sensor, accelerometer, and airspeed\
    \ indicator. Proportion Integration Differentiation\n(PID) control technology\
    \ is implemented to precisely manage the drone’s flight posture while minimizing\
    \ systemic\nerrors. This control mechanism is detailed in Figure 3.\nThe propulsion\
    \ system of the drone, crucial for its operation, comprises a motor, an Electronic\
    \ Speed Controller\n(ESC), and a propeller. The motor selected, known for its\
    \ precise controllability, is of the brushless variety. The ESC,\nwith its 20A\
    \ rated current, is utilized to modulate the motor’s speed. The propeller, driven\
    \ by the motor, generates\nnecessary lift, ensuring that the motor’s operational\
    \ capacity is not exceeded.\nFor imaging purposes, a CCD camera, model DS-2DC4423IW-D,\
    \ is employed. This camera is characterized\nby its spherical shape and expansive\
    \ field of view. The GPS system plays a pivotal role in facilitating the drone’s\n\
    navigational accuracy.\nThe ground monitoring station serves as a control hub\
    \ for the drone, overseeing its flight status and missions. Its\nprimary components\
    \ include an imaging system and a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The imaging system\
    \ is tasked\nwith adjusting and controlling the CCD camera, modifying parameters\
    \ like resolution, shooting mode, and focal\nlength to suit various area characteristics,\
    \ thus ensuring optimal image acquisition.\n2.1.2 Transmission layer\nThe transmission\
    \ layer is designed with two essential functions. Firstly, it is responsible for\
    \ the secure and stable\ntransfer of flight data from the recognition drone and\
    \ the image data collected by the CCD camera. Secondly, it\nfacilitates the transmission\
    \ of commands from ground personnel to the drone. Wireless networking is employed\
    \ for\ndata transmission to accommodate the requirements of long-distance drone\
    \ operations, enhancing both the safety and\nstability of the data transmission\
    \ process. The wireless network operates on the Ubuntu system, utilizing SDCC,\n\
    EC2Tools, and MonoDeveloper as its primary development tools. Data transmission\
    \ is executed in packet form,\nensuring efficient and reliable delivery of information.\
    \ The sequential steps of data transmission within this wireless\nnetwork are\
    \ detailed in Figure 4.\n3\nFigure 3. Drone flight attitude control mechanism\n\
    Figure 4. Steps of data transmission in the wireless network\n2.1.3 Application\
    \ layer\nThe application layer’s primary role is the analysis and processing of\
    \ the information acquired. It employs deep\nlearning algorithms for the recognition\
    \ of diseases, yielding definitive results. To align with the functional demands\n\
    of this recognition system, the application layer is segregated into six distinct\
    \ modules: the image acquisition module,\n4\nstorage module, virus detection module,\
    \ disease recognition module, flight route planning module, and control\nmodule.\n\
    2.2 Core Algorithm Design of the System\nDeep learning integrates low-level features\
    \ to create abstract high-level features, representing categories or\ncharacteristics\
    \ of attributes, thereby enabling complex classification tasks to be performed\
    \ using simplified models.\nThis technique grants machines capabilities akin to\
    \ human analytical skills, advancing the development of artificial\nintelligence\
    \ [19, 20]. In the realm of deep learning, CNN stand out as a quintessential model,\
    \ automating the learning\nof image features and patterns. This automation is\
    \ realized through an amalgamation of convolutional layers, pooling\nlayers, and\
    \ fully connected layers, which collectively facilitate the automatic extraction\
    \ and classification of image\nfeatures. Central to the CNN is the convolutional\
    \ layer, comprised of multiple convolutional kernels. Each kernel\ninteracts with\
    \ the input image to extract local features, capturing edges, textures, and other\
    \ localized aspects of the\nimage. The pooling layer plays a pivotal role in reducing\
    \ the spatial dimensions of the output from the convolutional\nlayer, thereby\
    \ diminishing the number of parameters and highlighting the key features. CNN,\
    \ compared to other deep\nlearning algorithms, demands fewer parameters and demonstrate\
    \ superior generalization abilities [21]. Given their\nextensive application in\
    \ target detection within machine vision, CNN has been deemed appropriate for\
    \ this study.\nConsequently, CNN has been selected as the foundational deep learning\
    \ algorithm in the development of the pest and\ndisease recognition system for\
    \ agricultural drones.\n2.2.1 CNN design\nCNN is comprised of several layers:\
    \ convolutional layers, activation function layers, pooling layers, fully connected\n\
    layers, and output layers. At the heart of the CNN architecture lies the convolutional\
    \ layer, entrusted with the critical\ntask of extracting local features from images.\
    \ This layer is recognized as the most computationally demanding and\ntime-intensive\
    \ component, yet it is essential for the network’s functionality. The core principle\
    \ of the convolutional\nlayer involves sliding a window across the input image\
    \ data and performing calculations to extract image features.\nThe convolution\
    \ operation process is systematically illustrated in Figure 5.\nFigure 5. Illustration\
    \ of the convolution operation process\nIn the convolution operation, the input\
    \ pixels are summed with the corresponding data in the convolution kernel,\nalong\
    \ with an added bias term. The network algorithm design employs various convolution\
    \ kernels to achieve specific\nfunctionalities. The dimensions nout of the resulting\
    \ image are determined by the following equation:\nnout =\n\x14nin + 2q − f\n\
    s\n\x15\n+ 1\n(1)\nwhere, nin and f denote the number of convolution kernels and\
    \ their respective sizes, s represents the step size, and q\nis the padding number,\
    \ all classified as hyperparameters within the convolutional layer.\nThe activation\
    \ function layer is pivotal in addressing data non-linearities, thus equipping\
    \ the CNN to handle more\ncomplex tasks. Prominent activation functions utilized\
    \ include the Sigmoid, Tanh, and ReLU activation functions,\neach described by\
    \ their respective mathematical expressions:\nSigmoid(x) =\n1\n1 + e−x , Sigmoid′(x)\
    \ = Sigmoid(x)[1 − Sigmoid(x)]\n(2)\nTanh(x) = ex − e−x\nex + e−x , Tanh′(x) =\
    \ 1 − Tanh2(x)\n(3)\nReLu(x) = max(0, x)\n(4)\n5\nThe pooling layer, often referred\
    \ to as the subsampling layer, employs mathematical methods to process data\n\
    derived from the convolutional and activation function layers, ultimately producing\
    \ a feature map. This layer plays a\ncrucial role in data and parameter compression\
    \ by reducing the feature map’s size, which consequently diminishes the\nconsumption\
    \ of computational resources and aids in preventing overfitting. The size of the\
    \ output feature map is\ndetermined by the formula provided below:\nnout =\n\x14\
    nin − f\ns\n\x15\n+ 1\n(5)\nFor the augmentation of image classification, recognition,\
    \ and detection accuracy, the network architecture may\nbe further enhanced by\
    \ incorporating additional layers, such as fully connected layers and loss function\
    \ layers. These\nlayers are instrumental in classifying the features extracted\
    \ from the images, thereby yielding a quantitative description\nof the input feature\
    \ map.\nFigure 6. PR curve\n2.2.2 Design of evaluation metrics for the recognition\
    \ system\nUpon the extraction of image features and completion of localization\
    \ via the CNN, establishing evaluation metrics\nfor the system becomes imperative\
    \ to assess whether the output aligns with the specified criteria. In instances\
    \ where\nthe results adhere to the predefined range, they are considered valid\
    \ outputs; otherwise, a further assessment of image\nfeatures is necessitated.\
    \ Key evaluation metrics adopted include the Intersection over Union (IoU), precision,\
    \ recall,\nF-measure, and the precision-recall (PR) curve.\nThe IoU metric quantitatively\
    \ assesses the extent of overlap between the predicted outcomes and the actual\
    \ results.\nIt is computed using the following formula:\nIoU = SOverlap\nSUnion\n\
    (6)\nHere, IoU is expressed as the proportion of the intersection SOverlap compared\
    \ to the union SUnion of the\npredicted and actual results.\nPrecision in this\
    \ context is defined as the system’s accuracy in identifying image features and\
    \ is calculated as:\nPrecision = TP\nZP\n(7)\nwhere, TP denotes the count of samples\
    \ accurately identified as positive by the system, and ZP represents the total\n\
    number of samples the system classifies as positive. Recall is the measure of\
    \ the system’s ability to re-identify,\ncomputed using:\nRecall = TP\nZN\n(8)\n\
    6\nwhere, ZN signifies the actual count of positive samples. For practical application,\
    \ a balance between precision and\nrecall is sought, achieved through the F-measure,\
    \ which is articulated as:\nF = (1 + β) · Precision · Recall\nβ2 · Precision +\
    \ Recall\n(9)\nwhere, β is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\nIn the\
    \ PR curve, precision and recall are delineated as the x and y coordinates, respectively.\
    \ This curve illustrates\nthe relationship between precision and recall at varying\
    \ threshold values, as demonstrated in Figure 6.\nWithin this curve, the comparative\
    \ analysis of feature curves is conducted, where larger features are indicative\
    \ of\nenhanced performance. As depicted in Figure 6, the performance denoted by\
    \ Curves A and B is observed to surpass\nthat of Curve C. The equilibrium point\
    \ of the curve serves as an additional comparative metric; a higher equilibrium\n\
    point suggests more favorable features. Utilizing these analytical methods enables\
    \ the determination of image feature\nvalues and the achievement of accurate localization.\n\
    3 Experiments\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the pest and disease recognition\
    \ system developed for agricultural drones, a\ncomprehensive series of experiments\
    \ was undertaken. Initially, the system required training with a specific dataset,\n\
    followed by a testing phase. Additionally, an emphasis was placed on the system’s\
    \ portability, namely its capability to\nadapt to entirely new datasets. Consequently,\
    \ the experimental design encompassed both training and testing trials, as\nwell\
    \ as the application of the model to alternative datasets.\n3.1 Training and Testing\
    \ Experiments\nFor the training and testing phase, grape leaves, characterized\
    \ by their distinct pest features, were selected as\nthe primary subject. Although\
    \ the Plant Village dataset is extensively utilized in the domain of plant leaf\
    \ pest and\ndisease visual detection, it predominantly comprises images acquired\
    \ under laboratory conditions rather than natural\nenvironments. Therefore, in\
    \ this study, images captured by agricultural drones, representing pest and disease\
    \ instances\nin actual natural settings, were employed. To resolve issues related\
    \ to dataset accessibility and nomenclature, the\ndownloaded data files were meticulously\
    \ processed and renamed, facilitating the formation of a dataset suitable for\n\
    subsequent training. The selected pest images underwent preprocessing and data\
    \ augmentation procedures, including\nrotation, flipping, scaling, and translation.\
    \ These processes were essential to conform to the size requirements of\nthe chosen\
    \ model and to mitigate the limitations posed by a smaller dataset size, which\
    \ could potentially impact the\nefficacy of model training. This methodology also\
    \ aimed to enhance the generalization capability of the model trained\non this\
    \ dataset. Post preprocessing, pest image samples were inputted for model training,\
    \ which was conducted in\nalignment with the target detection recognition algorithm.\
    \ Following the completion of the model training, pest and\ndisease recognition\
    \ and detection were executed using the obtained model weight files. The dataset\
    \ utilized in the\nsystem included 1000 grape leaf images, encompassing 184 images\
    \ of healthy leaves, 328 images of brown spot\ndisease leaves, 301 images of black\
    \ rot disease leaves, and 187 images of ring spot disease leaves. A random selection\n\
    of 70% of these images served as the training data, while the remaining 30% were\
    \ used for testing purposes. The\noutcomes of these experiments are detailed in\
    \ Table 1.\nTable 1. Results of training and testing experiments\nHealthy Leaves\n\

    \ the challenges of manual pest and disease identification in agriculture, characterized\
    \ by low\naccuracy, slow speed, and high labor costs, by exploring a deep learning-based\
    \ recognition system for agricultural\ndrones. Deep learning, a leading technology\
    \ in image detection, has been effectively applied to agricultural drones,\nenabling\
    \ intelligent, automated detection and identification of pests and diseases. This\
    \ approach significantly surpasses\ntraditional image processing methods by autonomously\
    \ extracting image features, thereby enhancing the accuracy\nin identifying characteristics\
    \ of pests and diseases. Such advancements contribute a novel methodology to the\n\
    prevention and treatment of crop pests and diseases, holding substantial value\
    \ for the advancement of intelligent and\nprecision agriculture. The developed\
    \ recognition system encompasses a three-tier architecture: the sensing layer,\n\
    transmission layer, and application layer. Deep learning algorithms were instrumental\
    \ in the artificial intelligence\nrecognition process, with specific focus on\
    \ designing both the CNN and the recognition system’s evaluation metrics.\nComprehensive\
    \ training and testing trials were conducted on the system, supplemented by testing\
    \ on various datasets.\nThe findings reveal that the system not only possesses\
    \ a high recognition rate for viruses but also demonstrates\ncommendable portability,\
    \ effectively addressing the challenges associated with detecting crop pests and\
    \ diseases\nusing agricultural drones. The system’s potential for broad application\
    \ signifies a significant step towards the further\nintelligent evolution of agriculture.\
    \ Additionally, the integration of drone technology and deep learning presents\n\
    expansive possibilities, such as in the detection and analysis of environmental\
    \ elements like land surfaces and water\nquality, thus enhancing the efficiency\
    \ and precision in areas like environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and\n\
    land use planning.\nThe methodologies employed in this research were constrained\
    \ by limited datasets, presenting significant challenges\nfor future studies.\
    \ In real-world agricultural settings, the diversity of crop types and the plethora\
    \ of pest and disease\nspecies necessitate the recognition and detection of a\
    \ wider array of crops and their afflictions, marking a critical\ndirection for\
    \ future research endeavors. The dataset utilized in this study, while pivotal,\
    \ was not exhaustive, and\nthere is a noticeable scarcity of images depicting\
    \ crop pests and diseases under varied environmental conditions.\nFuture research\
    \ should focus on continuously augmenting and developing these datasets, expanding\
    \ their scope to\nsurmount the limitations inherent in current research methodologies,\
    \ thereby enhancing the stability and adaptability\nof the algorithms. Investigating\
    \ the states of crops prior to the onset of pests and diseases, with the aim of\
    \ achieving\npreventative measures, emerges as a prospective trend in this field.\
    \ Moreover, a paramount task in the evolution of the\npest and disease recognition\
    \ system for agricultural drones is the refinement of algorithms. The objective\
    \ is to achieve\nan optimal balance between recognition accuracy and processing\
    \ speed, which remains a pivotal area of focus for\nupcoming research initiatives.\n\

    chapter PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture, the cornerstone of human civilization,
    has been on a remarkable journey of transformation throughout history. From the
    earliest days of manual cultivation to the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution,
    farming has consistently evolved to meet the demands of a growing global population.
    In the twenty-first century, a new and pivotal chapter is being written in the
    annals of agriculture, and at the heart of this transformation lies a technological
    marvel—edge computing. The story of agriculture has not been without its challenges.
    Traditional farming practices, deeply rooted in centuries-old traditions, have
    often struggled to keep pace with the complexities of modern society. Challenges
    such as labor-intensive practices, uncertainty in decision-making, environmental
    sustainability, and vulnerability to climate change have tested the resilience
    of the agriculture sector. Traditional farming methods, which relied heavily on
    manual labor and were often guided by historical knowledge, have been challenged
    to keep up with the ever-increasing demands for food production. Farmers faced
    the daunting task of optimizing resource allocation while contending with the
    unpredictability of weather, soil conditions, and pest infestations. The environmental
    consequences of excessive water use, overuse of fertilizers, and pesticide application
    have raised concerns about sustainability. Furthermore, the specter of climate
    change, with its erratic weather patterns and extreme events, has added an element
    of unpredictability to farming, making it increasingly difficult for farmers to
    safeguard their livelihoods. In response to these challenges, the agriculture
    sector has embarked on a technological revolution that is reshaping every facet
    of the industry. This revolution is powered by a convergence of cutting-edge technologies,
    including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics,
    and automation. At the heart of this transformation is edge computing—an innovation
    that is redefining the way farming is conducted, known as “smart farming”(Bolan,
    S, et al., 2015). Edge computing is a paradigm shift in the world of technology.
    It brings computational power closer to the data source, allowing real-time data
    processing and decision-making. In the context of agriculture, this means that
    data collected on the farm, whether it be soil moisture [71] levels, crop health
    indicators, or even livestock behavior, can be processed and acted upon immediately,
    without the need for data to travel to distant cloud servers. This immediacy has
    profound implications for farming operations. With the advent of edge computing,
    the agriculture sector has entered a new era—one characterized by data-driven,
    precision agriculture. IoT sensors and devices, strategically placed across farms,
    continuously collect data and transmit it to edge computing devices. These devices,
    equipped with AI and machine learning algorithms (Tiwari, S et al., 2018) [8],
    analyze the data and provide actionable insights to farmers in real-time. The
    implications of this technological leap are far-reaching: Precision Agriculture:
    Edge computing empowers farmers to practice precision agriculture with unparalleled
    accuracy. Every action on the farm, from planting and irrigation to pest control
    and harvesting, is guided by precise data and analysis. This precision minimizes
    resource use, reduces waste, and maximizes crop yields, ultimately leading to
    higher profitability for farmers. Resource Optimization: The ability to process
    data at the edge allows for precise resource allocation. Farmers can make real-time
    decisions on water usage, fertilizer application, and energy consumption. This
    optimization not only reduces operational costs but also contributes to sustainable
    farming practices. Environmental Sustainability: Edge computing plays a pivotal
    role in promoting sustainable agriculture. By optimizing resource use, minimizing
    environmental impact, and reducing the reliance on chemicals, farmers can transition
    to eco-friendly and regenerative farming practices that are beneficial for both
    the environment and consumers. Early Disease Detection: Edge devices equipped
    with AI models are capable of detecting signs of disease or pest infestations
    in crops or livestock at an early stage. This early detection enables farmers
    to take prompt and targeted action, reducing crop losses and the need for chemical
    interventions. Risk Mitigation: The real-time data and predictive analytics made
    possible by edge computing empower farmers to better mitigate risks associated
    with climate change, disease outbreaks, and market fluctuations. This enhanced
    ability to adapt to changing conditions leads to more resilient and sustainable
    farming practices. As we embark on this exploration of the revolution of edge
    computing in smart farming(Rai, P.K., 2009) [10], we will journey deeper into
    the applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions of this transformative
    technology. Edge computing is not merely a tool; it is a catalyst for change in
    an industry that sustains us all. It represents the embodiment of the farming
    adage, “Make hay while the sun shines,” in a world where technology and data are
    the new suns that illuminate the path to a brighter, more sustainable future for
    agriculture and food production. 2 Smart Farming and Agricultural Transformation
    The agricultural sector is undergoing a remarkable transformation, driven by a
    convergence of cutting-edge technologies. This transformation, often referred
    to as “smart farming” or “precision agriculture,” is reshaping traditional farming
    practices and revolutionizing the way we produce food. In this era of smart farming,
    data-driven decision-making, automation, and sustainability are at the forefront
    of agricultural innovation. Data-Driven Insights One of the pillars of smart farming
    is data. From Fig. 1, modern farms are increasingly equipped with sensors and
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices that continuously collect data on soil conditions,
    weather patterns, crop health, and livestock behavior. This wealth of data is
    processed and analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
    (Tiwari, S et al., 2018) [8] algorithms to provide farmers with real-time insights.
    Farmers can make informed decisions about resource allocation, pest control, and
    irrigation, leading to optimized crop yields and reduced environmental impact.
    Fig. 1 Edge computing architecture Full size image Precision Agriculture Precision
    agriculture is a hallmark of the smart farming revolution. It involves the precise
    management of farming practices based on data analytics. For example, GPS-guided
    tractors and machinery can plant seeds and apply fertilizers with centimeter-level
    accuracy, reducing resource wastage and enhancing productivity. This precision
    extends to all aspects of farming, from soil management to harvesting techniques.
    Resource Efficiency Smart farming (Kim, S.W, et al., 2015) is synonymous with
    resource efficiency. With the ability to monitor soil moisture levels [71], weather
    forecasts, and crop health in real-time, farmers can tailor their resource usage
    to specific needs. This results in reduced water consumption, minimized chemical
    use, and optimized energy usage, all of which contribute to cost savings and environmental
    sustainability. Environmental Sustainability Sustainability is a central focus
    of smart farming. The reduction of chemical inputs, the adoption of organic practices,
    and the promotion of regenerative agriculture are all made possible by data-driven
    insights. Farmers can implement practices that not only protect the environment
    but also regenerate soil health and enhance biodiversity. Automation and Robotics
    Automation and robotics are transforming labor-intensive farming tasks. Drones
    equipped with cameras and sensors can monitor large fields, identifying areas
    that require attention. Autonomous robots (Acosta, J.A, et al., 2011) [15] can
    perform tasks such as weeding and harvesting with precision and efficiency. These
    technologies reduce the need for manual labor, address labor shortages, and improve
    farm productivity. Early Disease Detection Smart farming technologies, including
    AI-powered image recognition systems, enable early disease detection in crops

    In the past few years, (IoT) in towns, buildings, universities, \nwarehouses,\
    \ businesses, poultry, hospitals, and health centers \nhave penetrated most human\
    \ living areas.  [1, 2]. The network \nof (IoT) physical devices, vehicles, home\
    \ equipment, and other \ncomponents are embedded into electronics, software, sensors,\
    \ \ndrives, and communication networks that allow these objects to \ncollect and\
    \ exchange data [3, 4]. Everything can be identified \nuniquely by its incorporated\
    \ machine but interact with the \nexisting internet infrastructure  [5]. The IoT\
    \ enables objects to \nbe detected or operated directly via existing network \n\
    technology, enabling a closer connection between the real \nworld \nand \ncomputer-based\
    \ \nnetworks \nand \nenhancing \nperformance [6, 7]. \n IoT is applicable in a\
    \ large field of science and technology [8]. \nThey are used in computing, big\
    \ data, smart cities, mobile \ncharging networks, smart monitoring, smart power\
    \ systems, \nwater supply, environmental security, smart retail, smart supply\
    \ \nchain, online shopping [9-11]. The new IoT concept provides \nan open door\
    \ for creative applications that organize the \nrenowned conventional computer\
    \ advances. IoT attempts to \ncommunicate with these self-governing gadgets in\
    \ order to \ncreate related information without human mediation. The IoT \nhappens\
    \ when every day, recognizable objects are linked to \nmicrochips [12, 13]. \n\
    In the last 5-10 years, IoT platforms and services have changed \nwith open-source\
    \ hardware availability. The progress of this \nnew technology is expected to\
    \ begin. Students would have to be \ntaught IoT principles and best accessible\
    \ technologies, which \nfreely incorporate new technology into their work later\
    \ on [14]. \nThe LoRa WAN Standards-dependent middleware is a core \ncomponent\
    \ of this IoT scheme [15]. The technology of Lora is \nused to link sensors beyond\
    \ the internet spectrum to access \npoints. The software is then chosen as opposed\
    \ to the hardware \nused. Moreover, data vary from system to system, so a \"data\
    \ \nrepository\" is necessary if posted earlier rather than later for \nreliability\
    \   [16-18]. \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of Applied Science and Technology\

    \ long-term economic gains by \ndecreasing import/supply costs for fuel, generating\
    \ energy, and \nreducing renewable emissions. Effective monitoring of real-\n\

    \ THEORY  \nA.  IoT Applications \nIoT technology uses are different because they\
    \ can be \napplied to almost any technology and can provide knowledge \nabout\
    \ the intervention process, operation performance, and the \nenvironmental variables\
    \ that must be controlled and monitored \nfrom a distance[28]. Today, several\
    \ organizations in different \nsectors and industries use this technology to minimize,\
    \ create, \nautomate, and track several processes [29]. The figure below \nshows\
    \ some IoT use in different sectors [30]. \nFig. 1.  Internet of Things Applications\
    \ [30] \nB. The architectural design of IoT  \nAn open architecture that uses\
    \ open protocols to support \nmany existing network applications to provide scalability,\
    \ \nsecurity, and semantic middleware to facilitate worldwide \nInternet data\
    \ convergence should provide an IoT architecture. \nIoT should then be a five-layer\
    \ system as shown in fig 2 [31-33]: \nSensing and control layer: the basis for\
    \ the design and \ndeployment, including RFID readers, smart sensor nodes, and\
    \ \nentry gateways [34]. A group of sensor nodes sensor the \nassociated ambient\
    \ information, pass it to the nearest gateway \nand then transmit data from the\
    \ internet to the network. The \nenergy supply system consists of three primary\
    \ parts: the energy \nsources included in upstream refining processes, (II) energy\
    \ \ntransfer processes, and (III) the energy demand within buildings \nand transport.\
    \ Energy supply chains; distribution. Processing \nlayer: Reasoning, semantic\
    \ analysis of sensing data, data query, \ndata collection, analytical data, mining.\
    \ Cloud computing could \nprovide a powerful tool for data processing and sensing.\
    \ It is an \nintegral part of the knowledge set. Application layer: The \napplication\
    \ layer uses this data to provide users with various \nservices after data collection\
    \ and analysis. The IoT software can \nbe classified, Into network monitoring\
    \ (logistics, regulation of \nemissions), control form (smart transport, intelligent\
    \ home), \nscanning type (motor bag, highway, no parking costs). \nFig. 2. Internet\
    \ of Things Architecture [31-33] \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of Applied Science\
    \ and Technology Trends Vol. 02, No. 02, pp. 80 –92 (2021) \n \n82 \nC. Resources\
    \ and IoT  \nAutomation of industrial processes, data acquisition, and \ncontrol\
    \ systems have been standard in the power industry. The \nearly steps of IoT started\
    \ by monitoring and controlling \ninstallations and procedures to minimize the\
    \ risk of a power \nsupply breakdown or failure. Sustainability, performance,\
    \ \nenvironmental impacts, and maintenance are critical problems \nfor old power\
    \ plants. The age and general maintenance problems \nof the electrical equipment\
    \ contribute to high energy losses and \nunreliability. Suppose we use our IoT\
    \ sensors to calculate power \nplant efficiencies. In that case, the data transmitted\
    \ will allow us \nto understand how the systems are working by detecting errors\
    \ \nor declines in energy performance [35, 36]. The compatibility of \nintermittent\
    \ renewable energy sources such as wind and solar \nhelps reduce the impacts of\
    \ coal energy consumption [19]. \nD.  Consumption of electricity  \nPrevious studies\
    \ found that renewable energy production and \nuse significantly contribute to\
    \ countries' economic and \nenvironmental activities. Green Energy's importance\
    \ lies in its \necologically favourable nature and is considered a more \nproductive\
    \ natural resource for healthy commercial, human and \necological development.\
    \ With countries strongly inclined to \nconserve the environment, environmental\
    \ policy needs to \nexplore the causal connection between clean energy and \n\
    economic development. The long-term link between sustainable \nenergy usage and\
    \ economic growth has been researched.  in \nprevious studies. Therefore, the\
    \ causal relationship between \nrenewable energy and environmental destruction\
    \ is essential in \ncountries that spend tremendous capital on renewing renewables\
    \ \nfor better economic and environmental conditions [37]. \nFig. 3. Final Electricity\
    \ consumption, World 1990-2018 [38] \nE.  Green IoT \nEnergy utilization of IoT\
    \ equipment is a big concern, \nunbelievably, shortly in the wide-scale use of\
    \ these technologies \nhas been expected.  Millions of wired networks are in operation;\
    \ \nfor the internet, a great deal of energy is needed. The vast \nnumber of IoT\
    \ equipment will also produce a great deal of \nelectronic waste. Low carbon and\
    \ efficient communication \nnetworks are needed. These factors luckily led to\
    \ the emergence \nof (G-IoT). G-energy compelling IoT features are essential \n\
    components in the lifecycle, including design, development, \nimplementation,\
    \ and ultimate disposal. In different IoT \ntechnology, the G-IoT cycle can be\
    \ used, like RFID tags. The \nsensor nodes can also be used in wireless sensor\
    \ networks in \nsleeping mode and can only run when necessary. Methods for \n\
    radio optimization can reduce node uses, such as modulation \noptimization or\
    \ mutual collaboration. Besides, practical, energy-\nefficient routing technologies\
    \ may provide efficient solutions \nsuch as multi-track routing or cluster architectures.\
    \ Finally, the \nabove methods and examples Reduce energy consumption for \nthe\
    \ IoT [19, 39, 40]. \nF. Smart Cities \nToday, the vast population increase and\
    \ overcrowding have \ncreated many global challenges, including air and water,\
    \ access \nto power, and the atmosphere. One of the big problems is to \nprovide\
    \ safe, sustainable, and secure energy sources for \ncommunities. Recent advances\
    \ in emerging technology have \ncontributed to mobile, IoT-based applications\
    \ to current \nchallenges in a smart city climate. Smart factories, smart houses,\
    \ \npower plants, and farms can be linked in a city, and data on their \nenergy\
    \ usage can be obtained at various hours a day [41]. In \nmultiple processes,\
    \ smart cities, transmitting and connectivity of \ninformation, intelligent recognition,\
    \ deciding the location, \nmapping, security, emission control, and identity protection\
    \ will \nbe handled using IoT technologies [42]. IoT technology can \nassist in\
    \ the tracking of any object in a region. Sensors may be \nlinked to homes, urban\
    \ infrastructure, transport, electricity \nnetworks, and services. This will support\
    \ a smart city based on \ncontinuous monitoring of data acquired from sensors.\
    \ For \nexample, street lights can be regulated for saving energy by \ntracking\
    \ vehicles with IoT. [43]. \nG. Intelligent Grid \nModern grids that use the safest\
    \ and most efficient ICT to \ntrack and optimize energy production, T&D, and use\
    \ [44].  A \nsmart grid creates a cross-directional data flow for optimum \nsystem\
    \ monitoring and efficient energy supply by linking \nmultiple smart meters. In\
    \ different sub-sectors of the energy \nsystem, such as energy storage, home,\
    \ transport, or careful \nconsideration, the intelligent grid operation should\
    \ be \nemphasized separately. Batteries are recharged in conventional \ngrids,\
    \ adapters and power cables, and AC/DC inverters. These \nbatteries can be wirelessly\
    \ charged in an intelligent grid via \ninductive charging technology [43]. In\
    \ an intelligent grid, end \nusers can determine the latest demand pattern by\
    \ collecting data, \nsuch as phones or electric cars, via an IoT network. The\
    \ nearest \nwireless battery charging station then assigns the necessary \ncharging\
    \ time for the device/car. IoT can also improve battery \nmanagement and monitoring.\
    \ So the electricity supply can be \nchanged first and secondly the power supply\
    \ for These vehicles \nare excellent and reliable. [45]. It will significantly\
    \ minimize \nunnecessary waste demand. Besides that, IoT may be applied in \n\
    individual islands or entities in different or microgrids, \nparticularly where\
    \ energy is required at any time, without \nexception in databases. Both grid-related\
    \ properties connect in \nthese networks. Energy demand data are also available\
    \ for any \ncommodity. This relationship means that every time and \nanywhere,\
    \ the energy flow is fully regulated  [46]. \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of\

    \ \n83 \nH. Distributed Systems and Cloud computing \nDistributed structures should\
    \ be flexible, involving \ntopography, organization or scale [47, 48]. The distributed\
    \ \nsystem may face some problems and challenges because of the \nprotection,\
    \ which is a big concern for the system [49, 50]. When \nan unstable asset supplies\
    \ a distributed system, fault tolerance \nis another issue in the distributed\
    \ model [50]. Without due \nprocesses and procedures, the incorporation and deployment\
    \ of \nservices become a problem [51]. Providing processing power \nover a network\
    \ (internet) is advantageous for cloud computing \n[52-54]. For clients to transact\
    \ business, they do not need the \nservices of massive, complex computers; rather,\
    \ they may \naccess cloud storage services depending upon their needs [55] \n\
    [56]. The basic equipment is routinely facilitated in vastly \ndistributed systems\
    \ using various virtualization practices to \nachieve high scalability, availability,\
    \ and agility [57]. However, \ncloud computing services' allocation serves as\
    \ a study subject \nthat led to groundbreaking algorithms and methods [58]. Cloud\
    \ \ncomputing \nis \nthe \nfield \nof \nhighest \ninterest \nfor \ntelecommunications\
    \ professionals, with potential uses in mind \n[59]. The resource-assigning technique\
    \ is important to consider \nmind-boggling communications among persons interested\
    \ in \nusing the ready-programs [60]. Conveyed in the various server \n[61]. The\
    \ key principles for running the ready programs inside \nthe system are the tools\
    \ required for computations [62]. The \nclient interpreted the operation, and\
    \ this way prepared them to \nexecute it [63]. When a client provides the customer\
    \ with a \nservice, it is an activity that leads to the development of a \nprocedure\
    \ [64]. This sets the customer up to perform their \noperations correctly. The\
    \ CPU uses this resource to access the \ncomputer's memory [65].  \nIII. ENERGY\
    \ MANAGEMENT SURVEY  \nMany scholars have discussed Energy Management and its\
    \ \nimplementation frameworks in the last few years. In this section, \nthe critical\
    \ points of some of the latest research are discussed. \nShen, Ruyin Zhang, et\
    \ al., [20] Considered both IoT and \nedge server systems. The edge server contains\
    \ code blocks for \nthe IoT platform and alleviates its minimal memory power by\
    \ \nloading the IoT device blocks. Moreover, the IoT system can \nextract electricity\
    \ from environmental sources in order to \naccomplish a sustainable process. One\
    \ solution to the complex \nelectrical issues suggested by the author is a block\
    \ prefetching \nframework (BPF) to optimize user-friendly delays. The coalition\
    \ \nsupports the intelligent pre-historically cloud intelligent \ntelecommunications\
    \ infrastructure systems. The BPF contains a \nprediction module, a pre-precipitation\
    \ module, and a dual \nlearning module. The module requests blocks from the edge\
    \ \nserver depending on available memory and energy. The dual \nlearning module\
    \ tries to make the shift happen much faster. The \nsimulations are performed\
    \ to test the ability of the proposed \nsystem.   \nGarg, Ritu Garg, Neha[27]\
    \ suggested a scheduling algorithm \nto equilibrium the energy produced by SEH\
    \ and the IoT node \nenergy consumption by the IoT node resulting in the balanced\
    \ \nmethod. The proposed SWEH device's performance is superior \nto that of a\
    \ single solar panel or wind turbine. These results show \nthat the algorithm\
    \ should leave the device in an energy-neutral \nstate at the end of a particular\
    \ period.   \nKrishnamoorthy et al. [66] Proposed an IoT method that \ntracks\
    \ load power usage and effectively saved electricity. IoT \ncould be used for\
    \ various purposes, from home automation to \nsectors where real things are connected\
    \ to a network from \neverywhere. The proposed project implements the Internet\
    \ of \nThings (IoT) based energy management system, whereby \ninformation is obtained\
    \ from an IoT automated meter and \ndisplayed on an IT website. This device can\
    \ be used to measure \nthe environmental load data and store it in the IoT network.\
    \  \nBedi, Guneet, et al., [67] Created Elman's recurring neural \nnetwork model\
    \ and an exponential electrical power prediction \nmodel in a building environment\
    \ powered by IoT. The models \nforecast the usage of electrical energy by an electrical\
    \ load (1) in \nwhich a relationship occurs between the net consumption of \n\
    energy by the electrical loads in the building and the atmospheric \ntemperature\
    \ and the building's occupancy; and (2) in which \nelectrical energy consumption\
    \ is predicted using the forecast \ntemperature and schedule. The construction\
    \ area under \nconsideration is the Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems \n\
    Laboratory (RTPIS) combined with IoT devices and technology \nfor intelligent\
    \ monitoring and control. Heating, ventilation, and \nair conditioning (HVAC)\
    \ units and light panels are considered \nelectric loads. Comparisons are also\
    \ rendered for the Elman \nRNN and exponential models. These forecast capabilities\
    \ help \naddress electricity consumption variabilities by delivering \nelectricity\
    \ to meet electricity demands, reducing electricity loss, \ndecreased carbon emissions,\
    \ and cost savings. \nLasso-Lopez et al. [68] Presented the development and \n\
    deployment of an IoT prototype for energy monitoring, \nestablished by a group\
    \ of undergraduates studying the challenge-\nbased learning paradigm to strengthen\
    \ their disciplinary and \ninterdisciplinary competence. This instructional approach\
    \ helps \nstudents address a relevant challenge by applying new \ntechnologies\
    \ and effective methodologies. The users tested the \nbuilt prototype for six\
    \ months. The findings demonstrate that by \nrecognizing energy efficiency problems\
    \ in the laboratories, the \nprototype has brought advantages relative to the\
    \ students who \nused the conventional learning model even from a theoretical\
    \ \nperspective. \nAlmonacid-Olleros, et al., [69] There have been multiple \n\
    machine learning models tested to determine a photovoltaic \n(PV) system's behaviour\
    \ and energy efficiency. The author also \nutilized several types of estimates\
    \ for power to test \ncomputational models of solar panel systems. This is operated\
    \ \ndata from a photovoltaic device installed to monitor the energy \nutilization\
    \ (Spain). Computer models may be more effective \nthan analytical ones because\
    \ learning time can vary, and it can \nbe faster. Temporary windows are an effective\
    \ method to \nquantify time variation characteristics to enhance performance.\
    \   \nAvancini, Danielly BRodrigues, et al., [70] Built and actual \nverified\
    \ a low-cost smart meter solution for internet-based \nenergy monitoring. It forwards\
    \ the data collected by \nsmartphones via Wi-Fi and collects them using an IoT\
    \ \nmiddleware equipped with energy-management ability. The \nintelligent meter\
    \ is automatically regulated as well as \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of Applied\

    electronically collected. To that end, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and \n6LowPAN protocols\
    \ (or 6LoWPAN RF4CE) will be enabled. \nThe Wi-Fi was used to understand the smart\
    \ meter and the IoT's \ncommunication capability, then verify this. It can be\
    \ automated \nin an intelligent environment that requires control, such as a \n\
    home automation system.  \nFilios, Gabriel Katsidimas, et al. [71] Demonstrated\
    \ the \nplatform and fueling protocol that allows energy accumulation, \nstorage\
    \ capital, and load system usage to be controlled and \ncompletely regulate the\
    \ system energy inputs and outputs. As the \nenergy management framework can be\
    \ adapted remotely, based \non tracking features, the author generates various\
    \ harvest \nprofiles to forecast the energy harvested. Similarly, the author \n\
    makes a charging device profile to forecast potential uses and to \napproximate\
    \ energy autonomy. The data method aims to balance \ncurrent resources in terms\
    \ of charge cycles and load \nsustainability and export an energy model that the\
    \ load device \ncan accept and manage. Drawing on the architecture parameters\
    \ \nmentioned, two energy harvesting ICs were simulated to decide \nwhether they\
    \ could be used with intelligent functions about \npotential energy and power\
    \ usage forecasts for the proposed \nenergy storage and power supply device. \
    \ \nHan, Tao Muhammad, et al., [72] Concentrated on the needs \nof today's smart\
    \ grids, homes, and businesses to build a deep, \nintelligent learning system\
    \ for energy management. For short \nperiods, the author forecasts potential energy\
    \ usage and provides \ngood coordination between producers and customers. Key\
    \ \ncontributions \ninclude \nsophisticated, \nreal-time \nenergy \nmanagement-based\
    \ devices via widespread cloud-based data \nserver monitoring, optimum technological\
    \ standardization \ncollection, and a novel sequence-based energy-predicting \n\
    mechanism with reduced time complexity and lowest error rates. \nThe suggested\
    \ systems apply to a typical cloud server in an IoT \nnetwork connecting with\
    \ the related smart grids to efficiently \ncontinue the phenomena of response\
    \ and energy demand. The \nauthor applies numerous preprocessing strategies to\
    \ resolve \nvarious electrical data characteristics, follows an appropriate \n\
    short-term forecast decision-making algorithm, and implements \nthem on dependable\
    \ resource-controlled instruments. Even for \nresidential and commercial data\
    \ sets, the author does detailed \nexperiments and witnesses 0.15 and 3.77 units\
    \ reduced MSE and \nRMSE.  \nKumar, N Komal Sikamani, et al., [73] Effective dynamic\
    \ \ncontrol of household consumables using IoT has been \nestablished. The full\
    \ set-up involves an electronic metering \ncomputer, a billing system, LCDs, a\
    \ base station control unit, a \nhousing station, and a GSM communication module.\
    \ The energy \nand amount used will be shown on the LCD screen and \ntransmitted\
    \ through the Household Station to the base station \nthrough GSM. Without the\
    \ individual having to check \nperiodically for meter readings, the machine also\
    \ warns them \nthrough the mobile device pay for electricity.  The device is \n\
    comfortable and practical to use in domestic areas where \nelectricity is healthy\
    \ and comfortable for the enterprise and the \nend-users.  \nYang, Ching-Cheng\
    \ Pandey, et al., [74] proposed a new kind \nof energy harvesting circuits. This\
    \ unsolicited electronic counter \nincludes an unsolicited electronic sensor to\
    \ power an IoT \nautomaton tag. The oscillator was intended to be driven by the\
    \ \ndischarged capacitances of the charge pump. The gated clock is \nself-tuned\
    \ to achieve a precise fit between its input and output \nimpedances to improve\
    \ circuit efficiency. The chip consists of \nan integrated circuit with areas\
    \ of 1.2 square meters \nimplemented using TSMC process T18. This experiment with\
    \ \nthe DSSC resulted in the maximum power conversion efficiency \n(PCE) of 77%\
    \ for converting electrical energy from the CFLs \ninto the lamp's power. PCE\
    \ of 70-100% can be met through a \nrange of lightness of 300 to 1300 lx. With\
    \ the achieved broad \ninput and output range and the maximum throughput of 200\

    \ efficiency ever reported in this research.   \nSedighiani, Shima Singh, et al.,\
    \ [75] Presented the concept \nand production of electromagnetic energy harvester\
    \ sensor \n(EHS) node and bicycle power control incorporated all-in-one \nkit.\
    \ An integrated coil within an IC package provides one to \nseven-and-a-half milliamps\
    \ of power at eight to forty kilometres \nper hour. Unlike standard EHS, the transceiver\
    \ and sensor \nmodules' power supply path is separately provided from 1.8V, \n\
    and the on-chip (MCU) of the MCU is operated below/below the \nthreshold. A low\
    \ power control unit is developed in partnership \nwith MCU to maximize the harvester's\
    \ capabilities (sense, \noperation, transmission). The simulation and study of\
    \ the \nelectromagnetic EHS proposed in response to a time-changing \nenergy source\
    \ indicate a major increase in our energy \navailability and the scalability of\
    \ our EHS compared with \ncutting-edge technologies. Lowering the size of the\
    \ processor \nrequires more energy storage capacitors than previous projects.\
    \   \nHaseeb, Khalid Ud Din, et al., [76] Proposed a system for \nIoT-based wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs) as a smart \nagriculture application comprising numerous\
    \ architecture \nstages. First, farm sensors gather data and evaluate a collection\
    \ \nof cluster heads based on several parameters' decision-making \nrole. The\
    \ signal's intensity is also calculated on the transmitting \nconnections by using\
    \ the SNR to achieve reliable and effective \ndata transmission. Second, data\
    \ transmission from agricultural \nsensors to base stations (BS) is assured using\
    \ linear congruent \ngenerator recurrence. The simulation findings show that the\
    \ \nsuggested system has dramatically increased connectivity \nefficiency in network\
    \ output by an average of 13.5%, a decrease \nof 38.5% in packets, a drop of 13.5%\
    \ for network latency, 16% \nfor energy usage, and 26% for smart agriculture routing\
    \ \noverhead in contrast with other strategies.  \nKiat, Wei-Pau Mok, et al. [77]\
    \ proposed implementing an \nenergy-efficient technique used in IoT applications\
    \ to support \nvarying performance and energy trade-offs utilizing a reduced \n\
    instruction set computing (RISC) processor. The processor can \nbe reconfigured\
    \ into pipeline mode and multi-cycle mode (high \ncomputer speed, at the cost\
    \ of high dynamic power). Switching \nbetween modes is done by taking advantage\
    \ of the partial \nreconfiguration (PR) function that modern FPGAs bring. A \n\
    RISC processor has been developed using the microarchitectural \nlevel methodology\
    \ and implemented as an IoT node on FPGA. \nExperimental \nfindings \nreveal \n\
    that \nreconfigurable \nmicroarchitecture enables IoT devices to consume less\
    \ energy.   \nSaid, Omar Al-Makhadmeh, et al., [78] Introduced an IoT \nEnergy\

    \ \n \n85 \nenergy-controlled nodes are considered in this framework. Three \n\
    techniques are used in the current EMS. The first approach \ndecreases the number\
    \ of data distributed through the IoT \nenvironment to a minimum. The second approach\
    \ software the \nfunction of the IoT nodes of critical energy. The third approach\
    \ \noffers a scenario of fault tolerance to fix imminent energy issues \nfacing\
    \ IoT nodes. Finally, the proposed EMS is tested by the \nNS2 network simulator\
    \ to construct an intense IoT environment \nsimulation. The simulation results\
    \ demonstrated the efficiency \nof the proposed EMS regarding the following performance\
    \ \nparameters overridden the conventional IoT system: energy \nusage, number\
    \ of failed nodes because of lack of energy, \nthroughput, and network life. \
    \ \nArshad, Junaid Azad, et al. [79] proposed an intrusion \ndetection framework\
    \ for energy-restricted IoT devices, which \nform the basis of an industrial IoT\
    \ (IIoT) ecosystem. The author \ndiscusses various topology designs' strategies\
    \ and feasibility, \ndepending on the degree of top-down and bottom-up control.\
    \ \nThe author inspected the architecture of the Contiki operating \nsystem and\
    \ validated the proposed architectural design. The \nresearch showed that the\
    \ proposed architecture would reduce \nenergy and coordination overheads while\
    \ ensuring successful \nintrusion detection for IIoT systems.   \nLork, Clement\
    \ Li, et al. [80] Built a data-driven and risk-\nbased approach to handling split-type\
    \ inverter AC that \nmaximizes efficiency in residential buildings. First, information\
    \ \nfrom related ACs and residential units is aggregated as a minimal \nimbalance\
    \ in the data. Then, the Bayesian-Convolutional-\nNeural-Networks (BCNNs) are\
    \ used to model the efficiency and \nvariability of the ACs from aggregated data.\
    \ Thus, this Q-\nLearning-based, reinforcement learning algorithm is dedicated\
    \ \nto set-point improvement. Second, a case study will be simulated \nbased on\
    \ such a system to prove that the uncertainty-aware \nagent's control behaviour\
    \ performs well in terms of relief from \nanxiety and profit optimization. The\
    \ auto construction design's \nefficiency can be changed by increasing and decreasing\
    \ the level \nof safety improvement.   \nLi, Wen-Tai Tushar, et al., [81] There\
    \ are already studies to \nachieve energy efficiency for the solar water heating\
    \ system \n(SWH) in a hospital building situated in Singapore. The author \nuses\
    \ the data we have acquired from IoT to gather information \non the system's different\
    \ environmental and operational aspects \nunder consideration, recognize opportunities\
    \ for optimizing \nvarious sub-systems' performance, and establish management\
    \ \nmechanisms for the system's effective operation as a whole. \nUsing data gathered\
    \ by IoT, we do an energy audit to evaluate \nsystem components' efficiency and\
    \ the entire system's \nperformance. Based on the organization's data, appropriate\
    \ \ncontrol strategies for the different sub-systems are employed to \nincrease\
    \ the overall system's performance and reduce the \nrunning costs of the SWH.\
    \ A control mechanism is demonstrated \nat the SWH site.   \nDey, Bishwajit, et\

    \ microgrid system for \ndistributed energy resources (DERs) is conducted. DERs\
    \ include \ncoal-fired power plants. Different legislated commandments are \n\
    considered in choosing dispatch units. Residential buildings \ncommonly sustain\
    \ their loads during working hours. This \nresearch will explore the effects of\
    \ power loads on the economic \nbenefit of solar microgrid systems. Hybrid solutions\
    \ involving \nGREW and SCA have been primarily considered efficient \ntechnology,\
    \ which reduces generation costs. The total cost of \ngenerating power was found\
    \ to increase by 50% when residential \nand non-residential loads were considered\
    \ together. Here, the \norganization's balanced presence saved 9–17% of generation\

    volume and type of waste. This method helps save resources and \nefficiency relative\
    \ to the community's current waste \nmanagement system and cleanliness.   \nAznavi,\
    \ Sima Fajri, et al., [84] Presented a new Energy Price \nTag (EPT) energy management\
    \ architecture with linked energy \nstore networks to solve the everyday energy\
    \ management issues \nin the presence of sporadic applications. The suggested\
    \ approach \ncompensates for the resultant energy imbalance when an \nunpredicted\
    \ intermittent occurs by spreading the stored energy \ndepending on the energy\
    \ storage systems' EPT. When \nintermission is over, the energy control system\
    \ changes its \npotential operating points on new terms. The suggested \nframework's\
    \ reliability is tested over a 24-hour cycle using an \nenergy management system\
    \ for the average intelligent building. \nThe findings contrast with a simple\
    \ approach, which does not \ntake EPT into account in managing intermittent systems.\
    \ The \nfindings comparison validates the suggested approach's \nfeasibility in\
    \ cost-efficient energy planning of intelligent \nbuilding components before and\

    \ The benefit models would \nthen be explored under the impact of energy storage.\
    \ This paper \nis the Stackelberg game model, where the SEH serves as the \nmaster\
    \ and users obey. To solve the problem, a double-layer \nalgorithm is proposed.\
    \ Finally, a case is analyzed to check if the \nprocedure is right. The findings\
    \ demonstrate that it can be used \nin the integrated energy system for efficient\

    Yu, Xiangbin Chu, [86] An energy efficiency (EE), \noptimization of IoT distributed\

    Ashiquzzaman, Akm Lee, et al., [87]  Reinforcement \nLearning (RL) is used to\

    \ Khuyen Sheng, et al., [88] The new \ndevelopments in the internet of things,\
    \ artificial intelligence, and \ndistributed ledger technology have been built\
    \ together to create \nmore efficient and intelligent energy storage and energy\
    \ trading \ninfrastructure in Australia. The platform involves cost-effective\
    \ \nIoT devices that can quickly be assimilated, such as smart \ninverters and\
    \ sockets connected to already installed devices or \nrenewable sources of power\
    \ in order to create a smartphone app \nfor intuitive energy consumers to evaluate,\
    \ program power and \nmonitor and exchange electricity in real-time to improve\
    \ energy \nefficiency.   \nSaxena et al. [89] presented a new type of IoT-based\
    \ \nagriculture system using a wireless sensor network (WSN). \nDifferent sensors\
    \ are disposed of irregularly in a given area. \nEvery sensor can sense the data\
    \ from the environment, collect it, \nand transfer it to the IoT server. This\
    \ new system is sound in \ncomparison to other systems because of its advantages.\
    \ With this \nsystem's help, task scheduling, agricultural system monitoring,\
    \ \nand watering program are now more efficacious because the \ncloud can schedule\
    \ all upcoming tasks and events to the system. \nThe system can automatically\
    \ schedule any event based on the \ncollected information. Agriculture can be\
    \ made more accurate \nand productive by adopting this agricultural production\
    \ system.  \nHossain, Md Liton Abu-Saida, et al., [90] Suggested a more \nstraightforward\
    \ Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation \n(SVPWM) for proportional integrals (PI)\
    \ to eliminate ripples of \nthe output waveform, overcome the problem of the voltage\
    \ \nbalance and produce improved output waveforms. Wind energy \nconversion system\
    \ (WECS), on the other hand, experiences \nvarious types of failures, particularly\
    \ in the dc-link condenser \nand power converter switching units. These errors\
    \ will lead to \ncatastrophic failures of the WECS and continuity of power \n\
    supply unless detected and rectified at the early stages. A new \nalgorithm in\
    \ the proposed PI-based SVPWM controller is \nproposed in this paper to locate\
    \ the fault position in the power \nconverter. Since several wind turbines are\
    \ installed in remote or \noffshore areas, the WECS system monitoring must be\
    \ \nestablished by IoT to ensure the system's efficiency. This work \npresented\
    \ to track the state of WECS in a real-time environment \nusing an industrial\
    \ IoT algorithm with an associated hardware \nprototype.  \nMokhtar, Charafeddine\
    \ Negrou, et al., [91] Presented an \ninnovative solution by merging demand and\
    \ supply management \n(DSM) to optimize the particulate swarm and use a traditional\
    \ \ndwelling to optimally develop an off-grid hybrid PV-solar \ndiesel-battery\
    \ system for electrification of residential buildings \ninto arid environments.\
    \ This proposed HRES would first be \nmodelled by a MATLAB in-house code based\
    \ on the multi-agent \nsystem principle and then adapted, according to the reliability\
    \ \nlevel and renewable energy penetration, by minimizing total net \npresent\
    \ cost (TNPC) costs. Following HOMER software \nvalidation, more techno-economic\
    \ analysis is carried out, \nincluding a sensitive review, taking various battery\
    \ technologies \ninto account. The findings revealed the following changes when\
    \ \nintegrating the planned DSM: RF = 100% decreases energy \ndemand and TNPC\
    \ by 7% and 18%, respectively, in contrast \nwith the single application of supply-side\
    \ control.  \nWang, Lu Jiang, Difei [92] proposed a concept scheme for \nintelligent\
    \ building thermal energy consumption control under \nIoT. The implementation\
    \ measures are as follows: (i) Create a \nstructural study and composition of\
    \ the smart monitoring \nframework for buildings' thermal energy consumption.\
    \ (ii) For \nthe acquisition of data and real-time data processing for \nbuildings'\
    \ thermal energy, the DSP integrated signal processor is \nused to complete the\
    \ acquisition and data conversion of thermal \nradiation information. (iii) Create\
    \ an IoT energy usage \ninformation control module and create a wireless sensor\
    \ network \nmodel for monitoring energy consumption to track buildings' \nconsumption\
    \ of thermal energy intelligently.  \nRaiker, Gautam A Umanand, et al., [93] Introduced\
    \ a \nframework that allows the user to track and manage his loads \nfrom a single\
    \ platform. The framework uses the Internet of \nThings (IoT) and Cloud Database\
    \ principles to make the \ndemand-side energy management platform more user-friendly\
    \ \nand intuitive. Non-intrusive Load Control (NILM) is used \ninstead of sensors\
    \ on each Power Socket Outlet for load \ndisaggregation. Disaggregated Load data\
    \ is saved in the \nRealtime Database of Google Firebase for quick access from\
    \ \nsmartphones or the internet. The consumers still have Load \nControl from\
    \ the same network, which completes the Load \nEnergy Management loop.  \nGolpîra,\
    \ et al., [94] In the presence of transferred loads, an \nefficient IoT energy\
    \ management (EM) platform has been \nimplemented for general delivery networks\
    \ in Smart Cities \n(SCs). The system's judgment is ideally communicated between\
    \ \nits two primary layers; a \"core cloud\" and the \"boundary clouds.\" \nThe\
    \ EM of a microgrid (MG), which is shielded by an edge \ncloud, is directly carried\
    \ out by its operator and is responsible \nfor optimizing the central cloud's\
    \ EM by the Distribution System \nOperator (DSO). The adjustment to the load usage\
    \ schedule for \nborders and their peak load hours, based on market energy \n\
    prices, leads to reduced cloud running costs. With MG \naggregators' maximal trade\
    \ capacity, the DSO optimizes the \noverall network running costs to optimize\
    \ power storage \nplanning by using input parameters for the core cloud \noptimization\
    \ issue. The energy storage costs are lower energy \nprices through consumer buying\
    \ power and discharged at high \nenergy prices to meet network requirements and\
    \ meet edge \nclouds' energy requirements. As a result, the DSO and the MGs \n\
    use the moving loads and energy storage to fulfil the energy \nbalance at a minimal\
    \ cost.  \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of Applied Science and Technology Trends\

    \ sensing, controlling, and actuating are \nconnected to the internet, and end-users\
    \ are ensured a remote \ninterface with the AC controller.  Besides, this is something\
    \ \ncommendable in Islam as, according to the legal rule, \n\"prevention is better\
    \ than cure\" and \"there should be neither \nharm nor reciprocating injury.\"\
    \ An Internet of Things based \ncontrol architecture is introduced and tested\
    \ in a proof-of-\nconcept building in the Polytechnic of Bari, Italy. The proposed\
    \ \ncontrol algorithm is tested in a real-life scenario testing both \nenergy\
    \ savings and thermal comfort.  \nAhrarinouri et al. [96] Explored a multi-agent\
    \ reinforcement \napproach to energy conservation in residential areas. Defining\
    \ \nthe multi-agent system not only raises the scope for independent \ncomponent\
    \ demand response systems but also accelerates \nestimates. We use Q-learning\
    \ to find the best solution for the \ngiven issue of residential energy management.\
    \ Besides, a \nscenario-based approach of actual data and correct density \nfunctions\
    \ are used to resolve uncertainties. Deterministic and \nstochastic numerical\
    \ simulations justified the feasibility and \nrobustness of the proposed approach.\
    \ The simulated findings \ndemonstrate that using the proposed strengthening approach\
    \ \ncontributes to lower prices for customers than traditional energy \nmanagement\
    \ systems focused on optimization.  \nLu, Qing Lü, et al., [97] Household energy\
    \ control focused \non a smart home energy hub (SREH) whose electricity and \n\
    natural gas inputs are designed for modern households. The \nphysical features\
    \ and household expectations suggest pertinent \nenergy-use equipment models as\
    \ well as management \ntechniques. To distribute energy supply in the SREH, there\
    \ is a \nmulti-objective optimization challenge, providing schedules for \nenergy-use\
    \ equipment in addition to categorized standard \nequipment. Six kinds of unknown\
    \ actions are modelled as sub-\nobjectives in a comfort deviation. The ultimate\
    \ aim is to \nminimize energy consumption and the deviation of comfort. \nFour\
    \ case studies are then provided to validate the proposed \nmodel's feasibility,\
    \ which increases the sub-objective meaning. \nThe real actions of household consumers\
    \ finally demonstrate the \nsolidity of the model. To optimize decision-making,\
    \ sensitivity \nanalysis on the starting time distribution, weighting variables,\
    \ \nand the number of unknown scenarios are carried out.  \nYu, Qingguang Jiang,\
    \ [98] Design and implementation of the \nIoT control strategy in smart microgrid\
    \ based on the NEZB were \nproposed. The framework of the intelligent supervisory\
    \ control \nand data acquisition (SCADA) system was planned for the \nonline control\
    \ of energy usage and climate parameters. The \npower management regulation strategy\
    \ was introduced. Finally, \nthe planned smart microgrid control strategy is implemented\
    \ in \nthe NEZB actual project. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nFrom the previous section,\
    \ it can be seen that researchers have \nemployed different types of techniques\
    \ in several fields. \nInvestors have issued a list of their recommendations upon\

    \ that some researcher depended \ndirectly on the Residential field. In contrast,\
    \ another work in the \nIndustry field, rather than the remaining researchers,\

    \ the \nresearcher uses an important technique. Another method is used, \nsuch\
    \ as the Challenge-based Learning Model, Energy \nmanagement via controllable\

    \ management methods to \nreduce energy consumption. The literature review indicated\
    \ that \nvarious active mechanisms contribute to energy management \nachievement.\
    \ These areas include residential, industrial, \nagricultural, \nsmart \ncity,\
    \ \nsmart \nbuildings, \nsmart \ngrid, \ncommunication, Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ devices, and Internet of \nThings environment. There are many tools in this\
    \ area, such as \nMATLAB, DSP integrated signal processor, real-time \ninformation\
    \ processing, intelligent wireless gateway, wireless \nsensor network model, microcontroller,\
    \ and other types of \ncomputing tools (MCU). To attain the goal, various techniques\
    \ \nhave been successfully used by the researchers (WSN). Today \nthe researchers\
    \ continue to focus on the residential, industry, \nagriculture, and smart city\
    \ aspects. Both solutions of Energy \nManagement Scheme (EMS) and IoT-based architecture\
    \ for \nHeating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) have been \ndeveloped\
    \ to incorporate SMART energy hub and smart energy \ndevices, respectively. Adding\
    \ to that, it can conclude that IoT is \nthe most suitable technique for energy\
    \ management and \nconsumption. Also, to control and monitor the distributed \n\
    building. \nREFERENCES \n[1] P. Asghari, A. M. Rahmani, and H. H. S. Javadi, \"\

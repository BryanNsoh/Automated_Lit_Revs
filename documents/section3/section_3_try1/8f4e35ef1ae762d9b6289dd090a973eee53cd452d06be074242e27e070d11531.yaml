    in the area of farming to enhance quality and productivity. In this paper, an
    intelligent edge based module with LoRa and IoT is proposed for smart farming.
    Smart farming consists of five layered architecture including edge computing to
    improve quality of data (QoD) and latency performance. For QoD, a Double selecting
    algorithm is used, and performance is measured using the following parameters:
    communications latency, data collecting time, energy consumption, and data quality.
    Quality of data is 100% for the implemented double selection approach and energy
    consumption, communication latency, data collection time parameters are also minimum
    compared to other approaches. A test-bed for smart farming and auto-irrigation
    is implemented using LoRa and cloud. The proposed test-bed is evaluated in real-time,
    with temperature, humidity, and soil moisture being relayed to the cloud on a
    regular basis using LoRa, and the results assessed. With improved QoD and latency
    performance, the suggested intelligent edge based smart farming test-bed with
    LoRa and IoT delivers good acceptable results for smart farming and auto-irrigation.

    Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Human resources required for farming may increase
    operational costs and the impact on productivity and quality may not improve.
    Integration of IoT with farming deploys remote management and monitoring systems
    and leads to the concept of smart farming. IoT for smart farming relies on wireless-sensor-networks
    (WSN). Further, the inclusion of intelligence and cloud computing along with IoT
    offer online analytics, real time monitoring and remote management. To support
    long distance communication with low power, LoRa technology can also be used in
    smart farming. Due to limitations and local regulations, LoRa does not support
    high data rates. In addition, the integration of Edge and Fog computing with LoRa
    into IoT systems can help to achieve a high level of energy efficiency for sensor
    nodes. When some abnormalities occur, Fog-assisted IoT systems can provide support
    for latency-critical applications. Lot of research is being done for smart farming
    to improve productivity and efficiency. Many researchers have proposed various
    algorithms and approaches to collect data from sensor nodes in wireless sensor
    networks meeting the current requirements (Xiong 2011; Pilloni 2013; Gao 2013;
    Rodríguez 2015; Tomovic 2016; Hassani 2017). Significance of internet of things,
    big data, cloud computing and fog computing, their opportunities and challenges
    are well described by various authors in (Wolfert 2017; Morota 2018; Schepers
    2018; Fleming 2018; Weersink 2018; Elijah 2018). Green house, smart farming effects
    are presented in (Trinh, 2018; Pathak, 2019; Dalezios 2019; Li 2019). In (Gia
    2019), author demonstrated edge AI based smart farming with IoT. The author, Xiaomin
    Li et. al. illustrated edge-computing enabled smart agriculture where double selection
    algorithm is used for multiple task data collection from sensor nodes in wireless
    sensor networks.This paper implements five layered architecture for smart farming
    using edge layer, LoRa and IoT. Double selection algorithm (Li, 2020) is used
    for the improvement of quality of data (QoD) and latency performance in wireless
    sensor networks. Because of its potential uses in a variety of fields, the Internet
    of Things has gained a great deal of interest. Some deployment environments, on
    the other hand, may be hostile, affecting the quality of data (QoD) and its accuracy.
    An IoT system should be able to clean its own sensed data by eliminating instances
    that are erroneous or incoherent in order to achieve a high level of reliability.
    Managing a vast volume of data produced by sensors is one of the most important
    difficulties for IoT. Latency, security, privacy, and excessive bandwidth use
    will all be issues if this large volume of data is sent directly to the cloud.
    Edge computing solves this problem (EC). In EC, data is processed at the network''s
    edge, close to the embedded devices. (Muthukumaran et al. 2021) discussed a thorough
    examination of smart systems based on IoT and EC. The study highlights the evolution
    of emerging technologies, the framework for EC-IoT-based smart farming, and the
    prerequisites for implementing the EC-IoT-based system. The framework for an EC-IoT-based
    smart agricultural system is investigated, and key prerequisites for implementing
    the system are specified. Further, test-bed is developed and smart farming parameters
    and auto-irrigation application are investigated and analyzed. The paper is organized
    as: Sect. 2 describes the five stage architecture for smart farming. Section 3
    illustrates the implementation of double selection algorithm in WSN for data collection
    and simulation results in comparison with traditional approaches are presented
    in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents test-bed model for smart farming and the results
    in cloud environment. Section 6 gives the conclusion of paper. 2 Edge based smart
    farming architecture For effective implementation of farming with improved productivity
    and quality, five layered smart farming architecture is proposed using edge layer,
    IoT and LoRa as represented in Fig. 1. Layer-1 is sensor layer that consists of
    several sensor node and actuator node clusters. This layer is connected with edge
    computing layer to send sensed data or to receive control commands from LoRa gateway.
    Fig. 1 Edge based smart farming architecture with IoT and LoRa Full size image
    Layer-2 is edge computing layer, an intermediate layer that reduces data transmitted
    over LoRa links. Egde gateways in edge computing layer receive and transmit data.
    Better security can be provided by including encryption algorithms like AES-128,
    256 or cryptography algorithms like ECDSA. Edge gateway can also use lossless
    or lossy data compression techniques to reduce traffic over LoRa gateway. Layer-3
    is a group of repeaters for the purpose of receiving data from edge layer and
    forwarding the data to next layer i.e. cloud layer. This layer consists of LoRa
    gateways. Layer-4 is cloud layer that offers big data analysis, data storage and
    complex algorithms based data processing. Application specific cloud services
    can be integrated in this layer. Layer-5 is end user layer which usually consists
    of web browser and mobile applications to have access to real time data and based
    on data to monitor or control the farm remotely. 3 Double selecting algorithm
    In this section, a suitable data collection technique is used in edge computing
    layer. This approach depends on data-type, nodes-position and other parameters.
    It also ensures high quality of data (QoD) and real time execution. This data
    acquisition method: Edge-Computing-Driven-for-Sensing-Control (ECDSC) using double
    selecting for QoD algorithm is implemented in simulation environment and the results:
    QoD, communication latency and energy consumption are investigated and compared
    with traditional approaches Periodically-Sensing-with-All-Nodes (PSAN) and Effective-Node-Sensing
    (ENS). Three performance parameters are used to investigate the performance of
    proposed architecture. (1) Quality of data (QoD): the ratio of suitable (valid)
    data to total sum of collected data. (2) Communication latency and data-collection-time
    (DCT): It is the time point where multi-sensor node sensed the data to the time
    when data server received all the data. (3) Energy-consumption (EC): It is the
    energy consumed for sensing, valid data transmission, and waiting. Quality of
    data (QoD): QoD index can be calculated mathematically as given in Eq. (1). $$
    \\theta_{j} = \\frac{{D_{v} \\left( {ta_{j} } \\right)}}{{D_{g} \\left( {ta_{j}
    } \\right)}} $$ (1) where, \\(\\theta_{j}\\) is QoD index for the task \\(ta_{j}\\).
    \\(D_{v} \\left( {ta_{j} } \\right)\\) = valid data of task \\(ta_{j}\\). \\(D_{g}
    \\left( {ta_{j} } \\right)\\) = sum of collected data of task \\(ta_{j}\\). The
    total QoD index for multi-task WSN with “m” number of tasks is presented as Eq.
    (2) $$ QoD\\left( {TA} \\right) = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{m} \\theta_{j}
    $$ (2) Maximum QoD can be calculated using Eq. (3) $$ \\begin{gathered} \\max
    QoD\\left( {TA} \\right) \\hfill \\\\ T_{g} \\left( {ta_{j} } \\right) \\le T_{{limit}}
    \\left( {ta_{j} } \\right) \\hfill \\\\ S_{i} \\cap S_{j} = \\phi \\left( {1 \\le
    i \\ne j \\le m} \\right)\\sum\\limits_{{i \\in m}} {S_{i} } \\le \\Delta \\hfill
    \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (3) Data communication time is the summation of node sensing
    time, queue waiting time and data transmission time. DCT of multiple tasks tg
    is presented in Eq. (4). $$ t_{g} = t_{s} + t_{c} + t_{w} $$ (4) where, ts is
    node sensing time, tc is data transmission time, and. tw is queue waiting time.
    For any sensor node vl, DCT can be calculated as formulated in Eq. (5) $$ T_{g}
    \\left( {ta_{j} ,v_{l} } \\right) \\leftarrow \\sum h_{i\\eta } t_{s} (v_{l} ,s_{\\eta
    } ,ta_{j} ) + k\\left( {v_{l} } \\right)\\left( {\\frac{{D\\left( {ta_{j} ,v_{l}
    } \\right)}}{{V_{c} }}} \\right) + t_{w} \\left( {ta_{j} ,v_{l} } \\right) $$
    (5) where, Vc is WSN communication speed, \\(k\\left({v}_{l}\\right)\\) is network
    route hop number. Energy consumption can be calculated by using Eq. (6) $$ E_{c}
    = \\sigma t_{s} + \\zeta t_{c} + \\tau t_{w} $$ (6) where, Ec is energy consumption,
    σ is power consumption of sensing time, ζ is power consumption of communication
    time, τ is power consumption of waiting time. Algorithm-1 gives double selecting
    algorithm implemented for enhancement of QoD and latency parameters. Algorithm-1.
    Double selecting for QoD algorithm. Flowchart implemented [18] in simulation environment
    is illustrated in Fig. 2. Simulation runs until the number of simulation count
    is reached and collects data. Once count is reached, results are obtained. Table
    1 tabulates the simulation parameters used to set-up simulation environment and
    to obtain results. Fig. 2 Flow chart implemented in simulation environment Full

    and discussions QoD with respect to various valid sensor numbers and included
    node numbers is illustrated in FigS. 3 and 4 respectively. These results show
    the comparative results of ECDSC (double selection algorithm) with traditional
    techniques PSAN and ESN. It can be observed from Fig. 3 that ECDSC achieved 100%
    QoD for different sensor numbers where as ESN obtained 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%
    QoD. However, ESN performs better than PSAN approach. As observed from Fig. 4,
    with increase in included node number, QoD of PSAN approach increases while QoD
    of ESN and ECDSC is at stable value of 40 and 100% respectively. Therefore, ECDSC
    collects more valid data compared to other approaches. Fig. 3 Quality of data
    for different sensor numbers Full size image Fig. 4 Quality of data for different
    cover node numbers Full size image To evaluate the latency of double selection
    algorithm, communication latency and data collection time (DCT) are used. Figure
    5 illustrates communication latency results at various data rates. It is observed
    that communication latency decreases with increase in data rate as higher data
    rates support less transmission time. Out of the three approaches ECDSC, ESN and
    PSAN, ECDSC outperforms and ESN performs better than PSAN. At low data rates,
    communication latency is very high in PSAN approach. Figure 6 shows the outcomes
    of three approaches in terms of data collecting time for different numbers of
    covering nodes. When compared to ESN and PSAN, ECDSC has a much lower DCT. Communication
    latency and DCT are expected to be as low as feasible to improve performance.
    As data is acquired from all, the PSAN approach depicts the highest DCT and communication
    latency. In ESN technique, data is collected only from selected sensor nodes and
    hence it exhibits better performance than PSAN in DCT and communication latency.
    ECDSC achieved minimum DCT and communication latency. Fig. 5 Communication latency
    at various data rates Full size image Fig. 6 DCT for different covering node numbers
    Full size image Figure 7 shows the energy consumption data for three techniques
    for varying valid sensor counts. The ECDSC approach uses a little amount of energy,
    which increases as the number of good sensors grows. The adopted double selection
    strategy produces the best results of the three possibilities. As PSAN and ESN
    do not consider suitable sensors in their respective techniques, ECDSC outperforms
    PSAN and ESN approaches in terms of energy consumption. The results (rounded values)
    obtained for three approaches: ECDSC, ESN and PSAN for the parameters QoD, communication
    latency, DCT and energy consumption are tabulated in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively.

    is implemented for smart farming application with five layered architecture. To
    enhance the parameters: quality of data, communication latency, energy consumption
    and data collection time double selecting algorithm is implemented. Quality of
    data is 100% for the implemented double selection approach and energy consumption,
    communication latency, data collection time parameters are also minimum compared
    to ESN and PSAN approaches. The LoRa gateway and cloud platform are used to create
    a test-bed for smart farming and auto-irrigation. In a cloud environment, farm
    characteristics like as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are measured
    and results are obtained. The proposed test-bed with five layered architecture
    shows good results in agreement for smart farming applications. Edge computing
    layer reduces latency and energy consumption and achieved 100% QoD. References

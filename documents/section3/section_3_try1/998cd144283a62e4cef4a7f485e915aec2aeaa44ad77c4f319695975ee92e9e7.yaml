    Abstract 1. Introduction Agriculture, an engine of economic growth for many nations,
    provides the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber [1,2]. Technological
    changes during the past century, such as the Green Revolution, have transformed
    the face of agriculture [3]. The improved crop varieties, synthetic fertilizers,
    pesticides, and irrigation during the 1960s–1980s, known as the Green Revolution
    or third agricultural revolution, enhanced crop productivity and food security,
    especially in developing nations [4]. Consequently, despite the doubling population
    and tripling food demand since the 1960s, global agriculture has been able to
    meet the demands with only a 30% expansion in the cultivated area [4,5]. The demand
    for food and agricultural products is projected to further increase by more than
    70% by 2050 [6]. Given the limited availability of arable land, a significant
    part of this increased demand will be met through agricultural intensification,
    i.e., increased use of fertilizers, pesticides, water, and other inputs. However,
    intensified use of agricultural inputs also causes environmental degradation,
    including groundwater depletion, reduced surface flows, and eutrophication [7,8,9,10,11].
    Excessive and/or inefficient use of natural resources (e.g., soil and water),
    fertilizers, and pesticides for agricultural production cause economic losses
    as well as increased water and nutrient losses from agriculture that lead to environmental
    degradation [12]. For an economically and environmentally sustainable production
    system, there is a need to develop techniques that can increase crop production
    through increased efficiency of inputs use and reduced environmental losses [13].
    Precision agriculture (PA) is a key component of sustainable agricultural systems
    in the 21st century [13,14]. PA has been defined in multiple ways, yet the underlying
    concept remains the same [15]. PA entails a management strategy that uses a suite
    of advanced information, communication, and data analysis techniques in the decision
    making process (e.g., application of water, fertilizer, pesticide, seed, fuel,
    labor, etc.), which helps enhancing crop production and reducing water and nutrient
    losses and negative environmental impacts [16,17,18,19,20]. Information-based
    management, site-specific crop management, target farming, variable rate technology,
    and grid farming are some other names used synonymously for PA [15,21]. In addition
    to crop production, PA has been used in viticulture, horticulture, pasture, and
    livestock production and management [18,22]. Presently, agriculture can be considered
    to be going through a fourth revolution facilitated mainly by advances in information
    and communication technologies [23]. Emerging technologies, such as remote sensing,
    global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), Internet
    of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI) are promising
    tools being utilized to optimize agricultural operations and inputs aimed to enhance
    production and reduce inputs and yield losses [13,24,25]. Several IoT technology
    systems utilizing cloud computing, wireless sensors networks, and big data analysis
    have been developed for smart farming operations such as automated wireless-controlled
    irrigation systems and intelligent disease and pest monitoring and forecasting
    systems [24,25]. AI techniques, including machine learning (e.g., artificial neural
    networks) have been used to estimate ET, soil moisture, and crop predictions for
    automated and precise application of water, fertilizer, herbicide, and insecticides
    [23]. These technologies and tools enable farmers to characterize spatial variability
    (e.g., soils) among farms and large crop fields that negatively affect crop growth
    and yields [21]. These state-of-the-art technologies for the development and implementation
    of site-specific management are integral part of PA [16]. Remote sensing systems,
    using information and communication technologies, usually generate a large volume
    of spectral data due to high spatial/spectral/radiometric/temporal resolutions
    needed for application in PA [26]. Emerging data processing techniques such as
    Big Data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have been utilized
    to draw useful information from the large volume of data [27]. Also, cloud computing
    systems have been used to store, process, and distribute/utilize such a large
    amount of data for applications in PA [28,29,30]. All these advanced data acquisitions
    and processing techniques have been applied globally, to aid the decision-making
    process for field crops, horticulture, viticulture, pasture, and livestock [27,31,32,33,34,35,36].
    In the past, several studies have provided reviews of remote sensing techniques
    and applications in agriculture. While some studies focused on specific application
    areas such as soil properties estimation [37], evapotranspiration (ET) estimation
    [38,39], and disease and pest management [40], others included more than one area
    of applications [41,42,43]. Many of these studies reflected the state of the art
    of remote-sensing-based techniques along with their limitations and future challenges
    for application in agriculture. Some of these notable efforts include Mulla et
    al. [42], Weiss et al. [43], Maes and Steppe [44], and Angelopoulou et al. [45].
    The primary purpose of this review is to complement these efforts to provide a
    comprehensive background and knowledge on applications of remotely sensed data
    and technologies in agriculture, focusing on precision agriculture. Specifically,
    we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and applications
    in irrigation management, nutrients management, disease and pest management, and
    yield estimation along with a synthesis table of vegetation indices used for a
    variety of applications in PA. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 describes the types of remote sensing systems covering different sensors
    and platforms used for applications in PA. Section 3 provides a brief history
    of applications of remote sensing in agriculture with a focus on PA. Section 4
    discusses some popularly used vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data
    and their applications in PA. Section 5 has five sub-sections discussing recent
    applications of remote sensing in PA for (i) irrigation water management, (ii)
    nutrient management, (iii) disease management, (iv) weed management, and (v) crop
    monitoring and yield. Particularly, in Section 5, we focus our review/discussion
    on studies published during 2015–2020. The final section in the paper discusses
    the progress made, needs, and challenges for applications of remote sensing in
    PA. 2. Remote Sensing Systems Used in Precision Agriculture Remote sensing systems
    used for PA, and agriculture in general, can be classified based on (i) sensor
    platform and (ii) type of sensor. Sensors are typically mounted on satellites,
    aerial, and ground-based platforms (Figure 1). Since the 1970s, satellite products
    have been extensively used for PA. Recently, aerial platforms, which include aircraft
    and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are also used in PA. Ground-based platforms
    used for PA can be grouped into three categories: (i) hand-held, (ii) free standing
    in the field, and (iii) mounted on tractor or farm machinery. Ground-based systems
    are also referred to as proximal remote sensing systems because they are located
    in close proximity to the target surface (land surface or plant) as compared to
    aerial or satellite-based platforms. Figure 1. A typical layout for the remote,
    aircraft, and ground sensing systems deployed for precision agriculture. SMAP
    = Soil Moisture Active Passive; PA = Precision Agriculture; SM = Soil Moisture;
    UAV = Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; EM = Electromagnetic. (UAV photo credit—Dr. Ripendra
    Awal, PVAMU, Prairie View, TX, USA). Sensors used for remote sensing differ based
    on the spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution they offer [46].
    Spatial resolution of a sensor is defined by the size of the pixel that represents
    the area on the ground. Sensors with high spatial resolution tend to have small
    footprints, and sensors with large footprints tend to have a low spatial resolution.
    Temporal resolution can be considered to be associated with the sensor platform
    rather than the sensor itself. For example, temporal resolution for a satellite
    is the time it takes to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area.
    Spectral resolution of a sensor is indicated by the number of bands captured in
    the given range of electromagnetic spectrum [47]. Hyperspectral images contain
    a large number (10s to 100s) of contagious bands of narrow width (<20 nm) separated
    by small increments in wavelength [48]. Numerous vegetation indices and statistical
    and machine learning approaches, such as deep convolutional neural network and
    random forest, have been applied to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral
    data to extract useful information on crop conditions [49,50,51]. More recently,
    quantification of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from hyperspectral
    images has increasingly been applied to estimate photosynthesis, plant nutrients,
    and biotic and abiotic stresses such as disease and water stress [49,50,51,52,53,54].
    Although numerous recent satellites provide high spatial (<5 m) and temporal (daily)
    resolution images, most publicly available satellite products are rather coarse
    for many PA applications. Appropriate spatio-temporal resolution required for
    PA depends on several factors including management objectives, size of the field,
    and the ability of farm equipment to vary the inputs (irrigation, fertilizer,
    pesticide, etc.) application rates. Crop biomass and yield estimation typically
    require higher spatial resolution (1–3 m) compared to variable rate fertilizer
    and irrigation (5–10 m) applications [42]. Furthermore, weed mapping and variable
    herbicide application require spatial resolution that is finer than the weed patches
    (e.g., 5–50 cm) [55,56]. Aerial platforms such as UAVs generally provide higher
    spatial resolution (<5 m) images as compared to the satellites. Thus, UAVs and
    other ground-based platforms offer greater flexibility in providing images at
    fine spatial and temporal resolution (more frequent) or as needed. Sensors mounted
    on satellites, airplanes, and UAVs are generally passive sensors, i.e., they do
    not have their own light source. However, some of the satellites have active sensors
    onboard, such as the active microwave instrument (AMI) on the ERS-1/2. Many of
    the ground-based remote sensing platforms have active proximity sensors. For example,
    commercially available variable fertilizer rate application systems such as Green
    Seeker and Crop Circle have active proximity sensors. In such systems, variations
    in daylight have minimum effect on measured reflectance, thus providing more accurate
    and reproducible normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or other vegetation
    indices (VI) used for crop nutrient status assessment. Two other sensors (thermal
    infrared and microwave) mounted on recent satellites are increasingly being used
    in agriculture. Thermal infrared sensors measure energy emitted from a target
    (e.g., crops) to estimate its temperature, which could be further used to estimate
    crop water stress, ET, and irrigation requirements [57]. Microwave sensors work
    in a similar way as the thermal sensors to measure the emitted energy (although
    in longer microwave wavelengths) from the land surface. Microwave sensors are
    mainly used to estimate soil moisture contents and crop water use over large areas
    [58]. Also, microwaves can penetrate through clouds, which is advantageous over
    other types of sensors that use visible and NIR wavelengths. However, coarse spatial
    resolution (10s of km) of the microwave satellite sensors, especially passive
    sensors, limits their application in PA. Recently, many methods have been developed
    and used to downscale passive microwave data to a finer resolution for use in
    PA [59,60,61,62]. Active microwave sensors (e.g., synthetic aperture radar—SAR)
    generally offer a higher spatial resolution; however, they are also more sensitive
    to surface roughness (e.g., vegetation) that can introduce errors in soil moisture
    estimation. Overall, there are a variety of remote sensors and platforms available
    that can be used to generate high-resolution (spatial, spectral, radiometric,
    and temporal) images critical to develop and implement site-specific management.
    3. Historical Applications of Remote Sensing in Agriculture Researchers have long
    recognized the need to map soil and land use databases for sustainable management
    of natural resources at local, regional, and national scale [63,64]. Knowledge
    of soil physical, biological, and chemical properties is important to design and
    implement irrigation, drainage, nutrient, and other crop management strategies,
    which are essential components of PA. Similarly, land use mapping can help assess
    the impacts of existing management and policy at regional to national scale. A
    traditional approach of using remote sensing techniques in agriculture has been
    around even before 1958, when the term “remote sensing” was first introduced [65].
    For example, aerial photography has been used to map soils, land use, and crop
    conditions in the United States during the 1930 and 1940s [66]. However, these
    conventional methods of soil mapping and land use classification (e.g., low altitude
    photography and ground crews) typically involve extensive fieldwork and laboratory
    analysis, which are expensive and time-consuming [67,68]. Advent of satellite
    remote sensing during later years facilitated more efficient and effective mapping
    of land use and land cover at regional, national, and global scales. Launch of
    Vanguard 2 and TIROS 1 in 1959 and 1960, respectively, marked the start of satellite
    remote sensing for meteorological information [69]. However, the era of satellite
    remote sensing for agriculture started with the launch of Landsat 1 (formerly
    known as the Earth Resources Technology Satellite—ERTS) on 23 July 1972 by the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA and the US Department
    of the Interior through the US Geological Survey (USGS) jointly manage the Landsat
    program. After Landsat 1, a series of Landsat satellites (Landsat 2–8) were launched
    to provide high quality images to researchers, land managers, and policy makers
    to help in the management of natural resources globally (Table 1). Images acquired
    from Landsat have been used for land use classification, crop classification,
    and monitoring and irrigation water requirement estimations in many parts of the
    world [70,71,72,73,74,75]. Later, in 1984, the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper was launched
    to collect higher resolution (30 m) images in more bands in visible and NIR region.
    Currently, the USGS-NASA is planning to launch Landsat 9 (resolution 30 m, 100
    m) by mid-2021. In 1986 and 1988, France and India also launched the SPOT 1 and
    IRS-1A satellites, respectively (Table 1). Table 1. Spatiotemporal resolutions
    of the satellite sensors used for precision agricultural (PA) applications. Satellites
    that provide high spatial (<30 m) and temporal resolutions (e.g., daily) are more
    suitable for PA. Satellite products from these missions were used for land use
    and crop classification in many large regions of the world. In addition, satellite
    products are used to monitor soil health, vegetation health, and hydrologic and
    climatic parameters, which are important for PA (e.g., soil organic carbon, soil
    moisture, NDVI, leaf area index (LAI), groundwater, and rainfall). Use of the
    satellite images proved to be cost-effective compared to aerial photography previously
    used for land use classification over large regions. However, coarse spatiotemporal
    resolution satellite products are not quite adequate for many PA applications.
    Satellites adequate for PA, such as IKONOS, were launched in the late 1990s. IKONOS,
    launched in 1999, collected imageries at 4-m spatial resolution in visible and
    NIR bands with a revisit period of up to five days [42]. Imageries collected from
    IKONOS have been used for multiple purposes in PA, including soil mapping, crop
    growth and yield prediction, nutrient management, and ET estimation [77,85,86,87].
    Launching of numerous nanosatellite constellations during later years addressed
    further limitations associated with spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution
    of the satellite imagery [110]. Nanosatellite constellations consist of a large
    number of small satellites with compact sensors that are cheaper and replaceable
    [91]. Nanosatellites and other satellites launched after 2000, such as GeoEye-1
    (2008), Pleiades-1A (2011), Worldview-3 (2014), SkySat-2 (2014), and Superview-1
    (2018), collect multispectral images at a high spatial resolution of ≤2 m with
    a daily or sub-daily revisit period. Pleiades-1A and Worldview-3 have been used
    for many PA applications requiring high spatial resolution imagery, including
    disease and crop water stress detection [118,119,120]. To take advantage of a
    wide variety of publicly available satellite data, several data fusion approaches
    have been proposed to combine high/moderate spatial resolution data with high
    temporal resolution data (and vice-versa) to generate high spatial–temporal resolution
    data products [121,122]. Satellite data with moderate spatial resolution but high
    temporal resolution (e.g., Sentinel 2) can also be used with reference ground
    truth data to help develop PA decision support systems [112]. Despite significant
    advances in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of satellite sensors, the
    use of satellite images is still limited in commercial agriculture production.
    Limited flexibility in on-demand imaging solutions, high costs, cloud cover restriction,
    and lack of automated or established frameworks for image analysis and application
    are factors affecting large-scale adoption of satellite imageries in PA [123].
    These limitations have promoted interest in low-cost proximal remote sensing techniques,
    including UAVs. Use of UAVs and hand-held, tractor-mounted, and other sensors
    mounted on farm machinery (e.g., spray boom, fertilizer applicator) has increased
    tremendously during the last two decades. UAVs with multispectral, hyperspectral,
    and thermal sensors can provide on-demand information at a spatial scale necessary
    for PA operations. Getting continuous or frequent satellite scanning during a
    crop growing season can be problematic due to cloud cover and/or other limitations/uncertainties
    associated with the sensor platform (e.g., revisit period) [124]. However, UAVs
    can be flown multiple times during a growing season to acquire information on
    a cm-scale as required. Most satellites do not offer the data at cm-scale needed
    for many field-scale PA applications such as weed mapping and disease detection
    [125,126]. Unprecedented availability of low-cost UAVs is likely to change the
    face of PA in the future. The average size of a farm in the United States was
    179 ha in 2018 [127] and is even smaller in other countries [126]. Acquiring high
    spatial resolution images obtained from commercial satellites can be expensive,
    especially for small farms, as many of these images are not available for free.
    In addition, flying airplanes to obtain such images may be cost-prohibitive for
    small farms. Images acquired from UAVs offer a low cost alternative to expensive
    airplane and satellite products [126]. Although the cost of utilizing UAVs (including
    equipment cost, data processing, and software) at a commercial scale is likely
    to be a sizable investment for limited resources farmers, continuous development
    of low-cost sensor technologies and input-production cost savings and/or benefits
    are likely to outweigh these costs in the future [128,129]. Growth in the development
    and use of UAVs has enabled the acquisition of high spatial, spectral, and temporal
    resolution data needed to implement PA management at a crop field or farm scale.
    Multispectral, high spatial resolution data acquired with UAVs could also be used
    with available satellite data for scale-up applications over large areas [130].
    4. Vegetation Indices Solar radiation reflected by plants depends on the chemical
    and morphological characteristics of the plant. Plant type, water content, and
    canopy characteristics affect the light reflected in each spectral band differently.
    Measured reflected light in ultraviolet, visible (blue, green, red), and near-
    and mid-infrared portions of the spectrum has commonly been used to develop various
    vegetation indices that provide useful information on plant structure and conditions
    [131] (Table 2). Vegetation indices are mathematical expressions that combine
    measured reflectance in many spectral bands to produce a value that helps assess
    crop growth, vigor, and several other vegetation properties such as biomass and
    chlorophyll content [132]. Mapping of these indices can help understand spatio-temporal
    variability in crop conditions, which is crucial for PA applications. Table 2.
    Some recently used vegetation indices for remote sensing applications in precision
    agriculture *. Popularly used vegetation indices such as normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), and soil adjusted vegetation index
    (SAVI) (Table 2) utilize the fact that within the visible range of spectrum, plant
    reflectance is low in blue and red regions, while it peaks in the green region
    (Figure 2). Plant pigments, mainly chlorophyll and carotenoids, adsorb strongly
    in the visible part of the spectrum except for the green region. However, such
    strong adsorption does not occur in the NIR part of the spectrum, thus causing
    high reflectance in NIR region from green and healthy plants (Figure 2). The NDVI
    uses measured reflectance values in red and NIR regions to provide valuable information
    on crop growth (LAI, biomass), vigor, and photosynthesis (Table 2). The value
    of NDVI ranges from −1 to 1, where positive values indicate increasing greenness
    (LAI and vigor), and negative values indicate non-vegetated surfaces such as urban
    areas, bare soil/land, water, and ice. External factors to the vegetation conditions
    such as solar and viewing geometry, soil and crop residue on the land surface,
    and atmospheric effects may cause interferences in spectral signals [133]. NDVI
    is sensitive to confounding effects caused due to soils, atmosphere, cloud, and
    leaf canopy shadow that may result in erroneous information on crop or plant conditions
    [134,135]. In addition, NDVI is also known to be insensitive to changes in LAI
    and biomass after reaching a threshold (saturation), especially in dense vegetative
    conditions [136,137]. A large number of alternative indices have been developed
    to address these shortcomings in NDVI [135,138,139]. Some of the indices that
    address these limitations are the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), atmospherically
    resistant vegetation index (ARVI), and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI).
    Red edge based vegetation indices such as red-edge NDVI (RNDVI), normalized difference
    red edge (NDRE), and red edge difference vegetation index (REDVI) have been shown
    to perform better than NDVI in estimating plant nutrient status, LAI, and biomass
    in dense vegetation conditions such as those present during the later growth stages
    of corn [139,140,141,142]. Figure 2. Typical reflectance spectrum of (A) a healthy
    and a stressed plant (taken from Govaerts and Verhulst [143]) and (B) soil, water,
    and vegetation (taken from Mondal [82]). Measurement of reflectance or emissivity
    in near- and mid-infrared bands is particularly useful in developing indices that
    help to understand several intrinsic plant characteristics such as water content,
    pigments, sugar, carbohydrate, and protein contents [131]. Reflected or emitted
    radiation in thermal infrared bands is directly related to the plant temperature.
    Since plant temperature is related to plant transpiration rate, indices obtained
    from thermal/infrared reflectance data can be used to understand plant water status
    and other biotic and abiotic stresses such as disease [178,179]. In the past,
    many indices have been developed based on infrared and thermal reflectance or
    emission such as crop water stress index (CWSI) and shortwave infrared water stress
    index (SIWSI; Table 2). These indices have been used for a variety of applications
    in PA, including water stress and drought monitoring, soil moisture, plant disease,
    and crop yield estimations [57] (Table 2). 5. Applications 5.1. Irrigation Water
    Management Application time and rate of irrigation play an important role in mitigating
    crop water stress and achieving optimum crop growth and yield. A variety of irrigation
    management practices are used by farmers depending on many factors including water
    availability, existing water management infrastructure at the farm (e.g., storage
    and conveyance system, type of irrigation system), local/regional water laws,
    economic status, size of the farm, knowledge of farmer, and others [180,181].
    Many farmers apply uniform irrigation at regular intervals based on their prior
    knowledge or experience of farming, soils, and climate at the location [182].
    Large commercial farmers deploy soil moisture monitoring systems (wired or wireless
    moisture sensors) to irrigate (automatically or manually operation mode) based
    on the measured soil moisture data and crop/plant water requirements [183,184].
    Local and regional agricultural agencies may provide irrigation advisory services
    based on the observed climate and weather conditions in the area [185,186]. Almost
    all of these conventional farming practices do not consider the variability within
    a field and use a uniform irrigation rate for the entire field. Remote sensing
    data can help discern the variability within the field and apply variable rate
    irrigation with commonly used irrigation systems such as a center pivot. Variable
    rate application can help mitigate water stress arising from extreme wet and dry
    conditions to achieve uniformly high yields in all parts in the field while reducing
    water and nutrient losses [187,188]. Remote sensing images, collected multiple
    times during a growing season, are used to determine various indicators of crop
    water demand such as ET, soil moisture, and crop water stress. These indicators
    are used to estimate crop water requirement and schedule irrigation precisely.
    5.1.1. Water Stress Remote sensing products, either in optical, thermal, and microwave
    bands, have been used to develop and test multiple indices and techniques for
    precision water management [189] (Table 2). For example, normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), developed from
    optical images, can be used to diagnose water stress and soil moisture conditions
    for many crops (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, these indices, combined with forecasted
    weather data, could be used for irrigation scheduling. Thermal remote sensing–based
    crop water stress index (CWSI) is a popular indicator used to estimate irrigation
    water demand and scheduling [57]. 𝐶𝑊𝑆𝐼=  ( 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑎 )− ( 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑎 ) 𝐿𝐿 ( 𝑇 𝑐
    − 𝑇 𝑎 ) 𝑈𝐿 − ( 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑎 ) 𝐿𝐿 where Tc is the canopy temperature extracted from
    thermal images, and Ta is the air temperature. LL and UL indicate the upper and
    lower limit of the difference in canopy and air temperature. Conceptually, the
    lower limit (LL) corresponds to the condition when the canopy is transpiring at
    the potential rate, and the upper limit (UL) corresponds to the condition when
    transpiration from the canopy is ceased. Multiple methods have been used to calculate
    the UL and LL of difference in canopy and air temperature, each having their own
    set of strengths and weaknesses [57]. CWSI has been extensively used for precision
    irrigation management in orchards [44,190]. For example, Katsigiannis et al. [123]
    used an autonomous multi-sensor (multi-spectral and thermal sensor) UAV system
    to develop CWSIs maps for irrigation scheduling and management in kiwi, pomegranate,
    and vine fields. However, some studies have indicated that more research is needed
    to establish climate-soil-crop specific trigger/threshold values to enable the
    use of CWSI for irrigation scheduling [191]. 5.1.2. Evapotranspiration (ET) Evapotranspiration
    (ET), the largest water flux from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere, is a
    critical component of the hydrologic cycle and water balance. Conventional methods
    of ET measurement (e.g., weighing lysimeter and eddy covariance) are generally
    expensive and do not provide spatially variable ET estimates resulting from differences
    in land use, soils, topography and other hydrologic processes [192,193]. Remote
    sensing data is widely used to estimate ET, which is needed to determine crop
    water requirements to schedule irrigation [193,194,195]. ET estimation approaches,
    based on the remote sensing data, can be grouped into three categories: (i) surface
    energy balance, (ii) crop coefficient, and (iii) the Penman–Monteith method [193,194,196].
    Many studies in the past have provided a review of remote-sensing-based ET estimation
    techniques [39,192,197], including a recent review from Zhang et al. [198] that
    discussed the theories of development of several ET estimation approaches/methods
    along with their advantages and limitations. The surface energy balance approach
    has been extensively used for ET estimation in the past five years. Some of the
    studies have used hybrid methods to combine crop coefficient and energy balance
    approaches for ET estimation [195]. In a surface energy balance approach, net
    radiation flux (Rn), soil heat flux (G), and sensible heat flux (H) are typically
    calculated from remotely sensed data in visible, near-infrared and thermal infrared
    bands, while the latent heat flux ( 𝜆𝐸𝑇 ) is calculated as a reminder of the term
    in the energy balance equation [195,196]. 𝜆𝐸𝑇= 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺−𝐻 Recently, Liou and Kar
    [192] and McShane et al. [197] provided a detailed review of various surface energy
    balance algorithms used for estimating landscape-scale ET at high spatial resolution
    and discussed their physical basis, assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations.
    Surface energy balance techniques use a variety of empirical and physically based
    models, input data, and assumptions to fully or partially solve the energy balance
    equation for ET estimation. Popularly used methods such as surface energy balance
    algorithm for land (SEBAL) and mapping ET at high resolution with internalized
    calibration (METRIC) fully solve the energy balance equation by determining the
    sensible heat flux (H) based on the identification of dry and wet pixels in the
    image [199]. Empirical constants derived from dry and wet pixels and measured
    radiometric surface temperature are then used to determine pixel-wise surface-air
    temperature difference and sensible heat-flux. In METRIC, a variant of SEBAL,
    net radiation is calculated using measured narrowband reflectance and radiometric
    surface temperature data, while soil heat flux is estimated using net radiation,
    surface temperature and vegetation indices [197]. Most of the surface energy balance
    methods typically use similar methods to calculate net radiation and soil heat
    flux; the major difference lies in the way sensible heat flux is calculated [200].
    The primary difference between METRIC and SEBAL is that the METRIC method uses
    reference ET data calculated from ground-based weather data to calibrate sensible
    heat and ET estimations obtained from the surface energy balance [199]. Surface
    energy balance methods are also classified based on the sensible heat sources;
    two-source energy balance methods account for the individual contributions of
    soil and vegetation to the total heat flux, while one-source methods do not distinguish
    between soil and vegetation [195]. Simpler surface energy balance methods, such
    as simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) and the operational simplified
    energy balance model (SSEBop) does not require pixel-wise calculation of sensible
    heat flux and can thus be considered as partial surface energy balance models
    [199]. Recently, several studies have evaluated these energy balance approaches
    with satellite data (e.g., Landsat 7 and 8) to estimate ET for irrigation management
    in PA [201,202,203]. However, coarse spatio-temporal resolution of thermal satellite
    data limits the application of surface energy balance approaches in PA. More studies
    are needed to develop and evaluate downscaling techniques that can provide ET
    estimates at a spatio-temporal resolution necessary for irrigation scheduling
    in PA. Crop coefficient based approach for ET estimation involves developing a
    statistical relationship between a vegetation index (e.g., NDVI, SAVI) and basal
    crop coefficient (or crop coefficient). A product (ETref*Kc) of reference ET (ETref),
    estimated from weather data, and crop coefficient (Kc) provides an estimation
    of potential crop water requirements which can be used in a water balance model
    to determine irrigation water requirements [122,204,205,206,207]. In the third
    approach, crop biophysical parameters such as LAI, canopy height, and albedo,
    estimated from remotely sensed data, are used to determine unknown parameters
    in Penman-Monteith equation [196,208] for ET estimation. Calculated ET from these
    approaches is generally used in a soil water balance model to estimate crop irrigation
    requirements. Bhatti et al. [205] used Landsat 7 and 8 and UAV data to estimate
    crop coefficient based ET and variable rate irrigation (VRI) requirements for
    corn and soybean grown in Nebraska, USA. Similarly, Stone et al. [209] demonstrated
    that variable rate irrigation scheduling based on the NDVI derived crop coefficient
    and ET can provide corn yields similar to the other precision irrigation techniques
    relying on measured in-situ soil moisture data. Using crop parameters (LAI and
    albedo) derived from Sentinel 2A/B images, Bonfante et al. [210] calculated Penman–Monteith
    ET and time-variable irrigation requirements to demonstrate the application of
    a publicly available decision support system for maximizing corn yields in Italy.
    A large number of approaches exist for ET estimation based on the remote sensing
    data, each having its own set of advantages and limitations. Some surface energy
    balance approaches such as S-SEBI do not require any ground-based measurements,
    and thus, ET can be estimated solely based on the remote sensing data [192]. However,
    surface energy balance approaches work for only clear sky conditions and suffer
    from various uncertainties related to the retrieval/estimation of surface temperature,
    solar parameters, land surface variables (e.g., LAI, vegetation coverage, plant
    height) and other parameters due to uncertainties in surface emissivity, atmospheric
    corrections, diurnal variation and aerodynamic surface characteristics [192,198].
    In addition, ET estimates derived by solving the surface energy balance equations
    are instantaneous and require temporal extrapolation to generate daily or larger
    time step estimates using further assumptions and methods [198]. The Penman–Monteith
    approach, which uses a process-based model, can provide temporally continuous
    ET estimations. However, it requires several meteorological parameters that are
    not easily available at the needed spatio-temporal resolution. Studies have shown
    that surface energy balance methods such as METRIC and SSEBop provide reasonably
    accurate (80–95% accuracy) ET estimations on daily to seasonal/annual scales [197].
    Generally, ET estimation error of less than 1 mm/day can be considered to be reasonable
    [211]. However, it also depends on the crop and growth stage; higher accuracies
    (mm/day) are desirable during initial crop growth stages when ET is lower. However,
    the accuracy of many of these models (e.g., SEBAL) varies greatly from one spatial
    and temporal scale to another, making it difficult to quantify the uncertainty
    in ET estimation [194]. In order to advance the development of remote sensing
    based ET estimation approaches, further studies are needed to identify and characterize
    the spatio-temporal structure of uncertainties in the ET estimation due to forcing
    errors, process errors, and parametrization errors, among others [198]. Advanced
    approaches that use the knowledge developed from process-based physical models
    to complement the machine learning based surface energy balance methods need to
    be explored to develop more accurate and reliable ET estimates at a scale necessary
    for PA management [212]. 5.1.3. Soil Moisture Remote sensing data acquired in
    multiple bands, including optical, thermal, and microwave, have been used to estimate
    soil moisture globally [28,193,213]. Optical and thermal remote sensing data has
    been extensively used for soil moisture and ET estimations in an approach referred
    to as “triangle” or “trapezoid” or land surface temperature-vegetation index (LST-VI)
    method [198,214,215,216]. The triangle or LST-VI method is based on the physical
    relationship between the land surface temperature (and thus soil moisture and
    latent heat fluxes) and vegetative cover characteristics. Soil moisture estimation
    in this method is based on the interpretation of the pixel distribution in the
    LST-VI plot-space. If a sufficiently large number of pixels are present in an
    image covering a full range of soil moisture and vegetation density and when cloud,
    surface water, and other outliers are removed, the LST-VI space resembles a triangle
    or trapezoid [214]. One edge of the LST-VI triangle or trapezoid falling toward
    higher temperatures represent dry edge (low soil moisture), while the opposite
    side represents the wet edge (high soil moisture) [217]. Triangular or trapezoidal
    shape of the LST-VI space is formed due to the low sensitivity of LST to soil
    moisture under dense vegetative conditions, which is contrary to the high sensitivity
    of LST to soil moisture under bare soil or sparse vegetation conditions. Once
    upper and lower limit moisture content for wet and dry edges is determined, theoretically,
    soil moisture for remaining pixels can be estimated using interpolation techniques.
    The triangle method uses a simple parametrization approach and does not require
    ancillary atmospheric or surface data for soil moisture estimation [214,218].
    However, a subjective determination of wet and dry edges in the triangle method
    can introduce significant uncertainties in soil moisture estimation especially
    over relatively homogenous land-surface areas (e.g., rainfed agriculture during
    dry season) and after rainfall events when there is a general lack of variability
    in soil moisture to form an LST-VI triangle [215]. In addition, the traditional
    triangle method requires individual parametrization for each observation date,
    which is a time-consuming and computationally demanding process [60]. The traditional
    triangle method also needs both optical and thermal data that may not be available
    in certain instances (e.g., Sentinel-2). Recently, a newer generation of triangular
    models has been developed and tested for high spatial resolution mapping of soil
    moisture in PA applications [59,60]. One such technique, called the optical trapezoid
    model (OPTRAM), replaces the LST in the traditional triangle model with short-wave-infra-red
    transformed reflectance (STR). Analogous to the traditional triangle model, soil
    moisture in OPTRAM is estimated based on the interpretation of STR-VI space [60].
    Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data, Sadeghi et al. [53] showed reasonably accurate
    (<0.04 cm3/cm3) soil moisture estimations with OPTRAM model for grass and cropland
    dominated watersheds in Arizona and Oklahoma, USA. The OPTRAM model does not require
    thermal remote sensing data, thus making it more suitable for a wide range of
    remote sensing data. Unlike LST, surface reflectance (STR) is a function of surface
    properties and does not vary significantly with ambient atmospheric conditions,
    which eliminates the need to parametrize/calibrate the model for individual dates
    [216]. However, compared to the traditional triangle model, the OPTRAM model is
    more sensitive to saturated land areas, which may result in increased uncertainty
    in soil moisture estimates [60]. More studies are needed to further evaluate these
    newer models for their applicability in a diverse range of climatic, hydrologic,
    and environmental conditions. Compared to the data acquired in visible, NIR, and
    SWIR bands, microwave remote sensing data have a greater potential to provide
    accurate soil moisture estimations [216]. Signals in visible and NIR regions have
    weaker penetration ability, compared to microwave, and is more likely to get affected
    by interferences caused due to atmospheric and cloud conditions [135]. Microwave
    sensors measure dielectric properties of soil based on land surface emissivity
    or scattering for soil moisture estimation. Several satellites with active and
    passive microwave sensors have been launched for soil moisture monitoring such
    as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-earth observing system (AMSR-E),
    soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS), soil moisture active passive (SMAP),
    and Sentinel-1 [216]. Active microwave sensors provide higher spatial resolution
    as compared to the passive sensors. However, active sensors also suffer from measurement
    uncertainties caused due to land surface roughness and vegetative cover or canopy
    [219]. On the other hand, although passive sensors are more accurate and provide
    better temporal resolution, they also provide a coarser spatial resolution (e.g.,
    10s of km) [215]. Typically, watershed and regional scale hydrologic and agricultural
    applications, especially PA, require finer resolution data [220]. Several spatial
    downscaling techniques have been developed and used in the past to address the
    coarse spatial resolution limitation of passive microwave sensors. These techniques
    can be broadly categorized into two main groups: (i) satellite-based methods and
    (ii) modeling methods [221]. Typically, satellite-based methods use vegetation,
    surface temperature, and other geophysical and environmental information obtained
    from high spatial resolution satellite data (in optical and thermal bands) to
    downscale coarse resolution soil moisture data [61,62]. Machine learning and data
    mining techniques have been used with topography, land surface temperature, albedo,
    land cover, NDVI, and ET obtained from high spatial resolution satellite data
    to downscale coarse resolution soil moisture data from passive microwave sensors
    [135,222]. Higher resolution (1 km) land surface temperature and vegetation data
    derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) have popularly
    been used in many studies to downscale coarse resolution soil moisture data [135,223,224].
    Many others have used higher spatial resolution backscatter data from active microwave
    sensors to disaggregate and downscale brightness and soil moisture data from passive
    sensors [225]. Some studies have used a combination of SAR (Sentinel 1/2) and
    optical remote sensing data with machine learning techniques to downscale passive
    microwave (e.g., SMAP) data [226,227]. Modeling-based methods use high spatial
    resolution data derived from physically-based and statistical models with data
    assimilation approaches to downscale coarse-resolution soil moisture data [221,228].
    Despite the development of these downscaling techniques, spatio-temporal resolution
    of soil moisture estimates generated from microwave data is still coarse and/or
    lacks the accuracy needed for PA, limiting their application for irrigation scheduling
    in PA. Recent launches of multi-polarization sensors (e.g., Radarsat-2) along
    with the development of new polarization parameters and polarization decomposition
    methods can potentially help generating soil moisture and crop information at
    higher spatial resolution [229]. Multi-polarization SAR data can be combined with
    optical satellite data to generate soil moisture estimates at high spatial resolution
    [230]. Further efforts are needed to develop advanced downscaling techniques that
    can combine data from multiple sources (e.g., optical and microwave remote sensing,
    biophysical and hydrologic models) and provide temporally continuous (e.g., daily)
    soil moisture estimates at the finer spatial resolution necessary for PA [221].
    Overall, in addition to satellites, high spatial resolution data acquired from
    UAVs in optical, thermal, infrared, and microwave bands carry great promise for
    soil moisture mapping and other PA applications [231,232,233]. 5.2. Nutrient Management
    Timely and appropriate application of fertilizers is essential to optimize crop
    growth and yields while minimizing environmental damage through nutrient losses
    to groundwater and surface water. Typically, a recommended rate of fertilizer
    is uniformly applied during planting and later crop growth stages. However, the
    fertilizer requirement of crops varies spatially and temporally (during and among
    seasons) due to differences in soils, management, topography, weather, and hydrology
    [12,234]. Mapping of such variability in crop nutrient status/requirement for
    PA applications could be challenging with conventionally used tools such as chlorophyll
    meters [165]. Several vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, SAVI), derived from remote
    sensing data, have been shown to be significantly correlated with plant chlorophyll
    content, photosynthetic activity, and plant productivity (Table 2). Mapping of
    these indices can thus help understand the spatial variability in crop nutrient
    status, which is important for PA. Recently, several tractor mounted remote sensors
    have become available that can measure plant nutrient status for real-time application
    of spatially-variable fertilizer rates. Green Seeker, Yara N-sensor, and Crop
    Circle are some examples of commercially available hand-held and tractor mounted
    remote sensors that use crop reflectance data to determine and apply spatially
    variable fertilizer rates in real-time [235]. In tractor mounted systems, remote
    sensors are usually mounted ahead of the spray boom. Nitrogen (N) application
    rates in these systems are determined based on the calculated vegetation indices
    (e.g., NDVI), which are further communicated to nutrient applicator/spreader for
    real-time fertilizer application. Different algorithms are used to convert the
    measured vegetation indices into recommended N-application rates. In general,
    the N-application rates are calculated by comparing measured vegetation indices
    in the target field with a reference vegetation index measured in a well fertilized
    (N-rich) plot/strip that is representative of the target field. Several fertilizer
    rate calculation algorithms (e.g., the nitrogen fertilizer optimization algorithm)
    [236,237] have been developed and successfully implemented in these commercially
    available sensors to determine vegetation-indices based in-season N-requirements
    for many crops [238,239]. Despite the commercialization of variable rate N-management
    technologies based on proximal remote sensing, farmer’s adoption remains low in
    many agricultural enterprises [240]. A lack of clear evidence on significant economic
    benefits (crop yield and/or profits), especially in commercial farm settings (i.e.,
    large fields) is a limiting factor for the large scale adoption of these technologies
    [241]. To further refine these remote sensing based technologies and enhance its
    benefits, research is being conducted with UAVs and other remote sensors for a
    variety of crops in different climatic regions. Maresma et al. [165] used images
    captured from a UAV to determine the suitability of several vegetation indices
    and crop height in determining in-season fertilizer application rates for corn
    grown in Spain. Cao et al. [242] showed that Green Seeker and Crop Circle sensors
    resulted in reduced N-fertilizer use and increased N-productivity for winter wheat
    production in China. Overall, remote sensing based mapping of crop nutrient status
    in PA can help increase crop nutrient use efficiency while maintaining/increasing
    crop yields and reducing off-site nutrient losses that are damaging to the environment.
    Remote sensing has also been used to determine soil organic matter and phosphorus
    content to develop spatial maps that can aid in site-specific management [243,244,245,246].
    Blasch et al. [243] used multi-temporal satellite images from RapidEye in conjunction
    with principal component analysis to develop field-scale soil organic matter maps
    to aid in site-specific precision management. Castaldi et al. [245] used images
    obtained from Sentinel-2 to develop soil organic carbon maps at both field and
    regional scales in Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium and showed that the satellite
    data have an adequate spatial resolution for field scale planning in PA management.
    Crop growth is a function of several biotic and abiotic factors related to soils,
    management, topography, hydrology, and other environmental variables. Therefore,
    vegetation indices derived from remote sensing of crop growth/status are reflective
    of the combined variability in these factors or stressors. While using the vegetation
    indices to determine the plant nutrient status or N-application rates, one should
    also consider potentially confounding effects caused due to other stressors such
    as moisture stress and disease. 5.3. Disease Management Diseases can cause a significant
    loss of crop production and farm profits. Early detection of plant disease and
    its spatial extent can help contain the disease spread and reduce production losses.
    Field scouting, a conventional method of disease detection, is time consuming,
    labor intensive, and prone to human error [126]. In addition, with field scouting,
    it may be difficult to detect the disease during the early stages when the symptoms
    are not fully visible. Furthermore, some diseases do not show any visible symptoms,
    or the effect may not be noticeable until it is too late to act [247]. It is also
    difficult to map the spatial extent and severity of the disease spread with the
    traditional method of field scouting. Remote sensing could be used to monitor
    the disease efficiently, especially in the early stages of disease development,
    when it may be difficult to discern the signs of disease with field scouting.
    Multiple techniques using RGB, multi-spectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and fluorescence
    imaging have been used to identify diseases in a variety of crops [178]. Di Gennaro
    et al. [248] found a good correlation between grapevine leaf stripe disease and
    NDVI generated from UAV imageries in Italy. Abdulridha et al. [172] used a machine
    learning approach with vegetation indices derived from hyperspectral UAV images
    to detect citrus canker with 96% accuracy even during the early stage of disease
    development. As the differences in spectral signatures observed in a field can
    occur due to a combination of biotic and abiotic stresses, it could be challenging
    to discern the effects caused due to individual stressors (e.g., disease, water
    or nutrient stress). As compared to the typically used vegetation indices (e.g.,
    NDVI), the development of disease specific spectral disease indices (SDI) can
    increase the accuracy of disease detection and differentiation under real world
    field conditions [249,250]. Higher disease detection accuracies during critical
    crop growth stages such as flowering can help implement effective management plans
    in a timely manner to mitigate or avoid large yield and fruit quality losses.
    Use of SDIs, in place of typical VIs, can also reduce the complexity of disease
    detection methods and increase the system efficacy by reducing the computational
    demand [250]. Although studies have been conducted for plant disease classification
    [251], further efforts are needed to develop more accurate, automated and reproducible
    methodologies for disease detection under diverse climatic and real-world field
    conditions [40]. 5.4. Weed Management Conventional weed management approaches
    involving a uniform application of herbicide is an inefficient practice that increases
    the risk for off-site pesticide losses [252]. Application of herbicide at a variable
    rate as per need can help enhance the treatment efficiency and reduce input costs
    and environmental pollution [253]. Remote sensing has widely been used for mapping
    weed patches in crop fields for site-specific weed management [43]. Weeds can
    be identified or differentiated from crop plants based on their peculiar spectral
    signature related to their phenological or morphological attributes that are different
    from the crop. Over the last few years, machine learning approaches have emerged
    as a highly accurate and efficient method of image classification for weed mapping
    [254,255,256]. Two general types of image classification approaches are commonly
    used for weed mapping; supervised and unsupervised classification. Although each
    method has its own strengths and weaknesses, supervised classification is time-intensive
    and requires more manual work [26]. UAVs have been the most popular remote sensing
    platform for weed mapping and management primarily due to its capability to produce
    cm-scale resolution (5 cm) [257]) images needed for weed detection and mapping.
    Using the fully convolutional network approach, Huang et al. [254] mapped weeds
    in a rice field in China with up to 90% accuracy. Partel et al. [255] developed
    a target weed sprayer using deep learning neural network approach for ground-sensor
    based weed detection that yielded in 71% application accuracy in experimental
    fields in Florida, USA. However, the commercial adoption of these technologies
    remains challenging, given the expertise required to use advanced software and
    technical processes involved in their applications [258]. 5.5. Crop Monitoring
    and Yield Monitoring crop growth and yield are necessary to understand the crop
    response to the environment and agronomic practices and develop effective management
    plans for fieldwork and/or remedies [259]. LAI and biomass are two essential indicators
    of crop health and development [28]. LAI is also used as an input in many crop
    growth and yield forecasting models [260]. In-situ methods of LAI estimation (physical
    and optical) are time consuming and labor intensive, similar to the destructive
    field methods used for biomass estimation. Also, these methods do not provide
    a spatial variability map of crop growth and biomass [261,262]. Remote sensing
    data on crop growth (e.g., LAI) and biomass can help obtain valuable information
    on site-specific properties (e.g., soils, topography), management (e.g., water,
    nutrient, and other inputs), and various biotic and abiotic stressors (e.g., diseases,
    weeds, water, and nutrient stress) [263]. Similarly, remote sensing data can also
    be used to map differences in tillage and residue management and its effects on
    crop growth [264]. Several studies have used hyperspectral images with various
    machine learning and classification techniques to map tillage and crop residue
    in agricultural fields [265,266]. Such information on crop conditions and tillage
    practices can help develop site specific management plans, including variable
    water, nutrient, and pesticide application to increase production and management
    efficiency. Remote sensing data have been used to estimate LAI and biomass for
    a variety of crops, including row crops, orchards, and vine crops [267,268,269].
    Typically, such studies use a set of reference data (e.g., measured LAI and corresponding
    vegetation indices) to develop a regression or machine learning based approach
    to estimate LAI and/or biomass for a target field. Yue et al. [262] used multiple
    spectral indices in conjunction with measured plant height to estimate biomass
    (R2 = 0.74) in multiple irrigations and nutrient treatment plots for winter wheat
    grown in China. Ali et al. [269] used red-edge position (REP) extracted from hyperspectral
    images to predict LAI (R2 = 0.93) and chlorophyll content (R2 = 0.90) for Kinnow
    mandarins grown in Pakistan. REP is the position of the main inflection point
    of the red-NIR slope created due to strong chlorophyll absorption in the red spectrum
    and canopy scattering in the NIR region [269]. Reliable LAI estimation from reflectance
    data could be difficult, especially during early crop growth stages due to interference
    from the bare soil surface. To overcome this limitation, modified vegetation indices
    adjusted for soil and other interferences have been proposed and used to estimate
    LAI [270]. Recently, red-edge based vegetation indices have been shown to be promising
    for estimating LAI in multiple crops [271]. For PA, knowledge of spatial variability
    in crop yield is important to understand crop response to management practices
    and environmental stressors. Remote sensing derived crop biophysical parameters,
    or vegetation indices have a strong correlation with observed crop yield and biomass,
    indicating their potential for use in yield estimation [259]. Crop yield estimation
    from remotely sensed data has generally been conducted in two ways. First, biophysical
    parameters (e.g., LAI) derived from remotely sensed data are used in a crop model
    to estimate the crop yield and biomass. Second, statistical (e.g., regression)
    or empirical relationships are developed between remote sensing derived crop parameters/indices
    (e.g., NDVI, LAI) and observed crop yield and biomass in a representative crop
    field. The developed regression model or empirical relationship could then be
    used to map crop yield at a target crop field. Crop modeling is a data-intensive
    approach, which requires a large amount of information as model input parameters,
    meteorological data, and observed yield and biomass data. Maresma et al. [161]
    used a regression based approach to evaluate the relationship between corn yield
    and biomass and spectral indices measured at the V12 stage. Similar to other studies,
    they also found that the red-based indices NDVI and wide dynamic range vegetation
    index (WDRVI) had the highest correlation with grain yields for a range of fertilizer
    application rates. Spatial mapping of crop biophysical parameters or indices at
    multiple times during a growing season is likely to provide a better estimation
    of crop biomass and yield as compared to a single snapshot during the season [263].
    6. Progress Made, Needs, and Challenges Remote sensing has potential applications
    in almost every aspect of PA, from land preparation to harvesting. The abundance
    of high spatial resolution multi-temporal satellite data along with low-cost UAVs
    and commercially available ground-based proximity sensors have changed the face
    of PA. A large number of advanced techniques, including empirical, regression,
    and various forms of machine learning approaches have been used to explore the
    potential applications of remote sensing in PA. Similarly, many vegetation indices
    have been developed and tested for their ability to help PA operations, including
    variable fertilizer management, irrigation scheduling, disease control, weed mapping,
    and yield forecasting. However, many challenges need to be addressed before the
    remote sensing technologies can potentially see a large-scale adoption in commercial
    and non-commercial agriculture. Although most of the satellite data are available
    for free, it may require a significant amount of technical knowledge and expertise
    to process them for real-world applications. For example, image pre-processing
    and post-processing require expert knowledge and software. In addition, many PA
    operations such as disease and weed management require fine spatial resolution
    (cm-scale) data with high spectral and temporal (e.g., daily) resolution. Most
    of the publicly available satellite data do not meet such requirements. Furthermore,
    cloudy days and variable or inconsistent irradiance or sunlight may render many
    satellite images unsuitable for use. Users/farmers may need to purchase high resolution
    (spatial, temporal and spectral) satellite data, which can be cost-prohibitive,
    especially for small farms. However, images acquired from UAVs are likely to offer
    a low-cost alternative for small farm operations [272]. Use of UAVs and tractor-mounted
    sensors also involve the use of special software for data analysis and need professional
    operators (e.g., drone licensing) [235]. Hyperspectral images acquired from the
    state of the art sensors mounted on some of the recently launched satellites and
    UAVs provide a large amount of information on crop biophysical parameters. However,
    these sensors are expensive (UAVs), and the processing of imageries is complex
    [246]. There is a need to explore and develop advanced information and communication
    technologies as well as chemometric and spectral decomposition methods to synthesize
    and generate practical information needed for PA applications. Artificial intelligence
    techniques, including machine learning, has great potential to generate spatially
    and temporally continuous information from instantaneous satellite data at a scale
    necessary for many PA applications [212]. Hybrid methods, combining the knowledge
    obtained from physically based models, can complement such AI techniques to help
    develop techniques useful in PA decision making [43,212]. Despite a large number
    of studies on remote sensing applications in PA, there is a general lack of established
    techniques and/or framework that are accurate, reproducible, and applicable under
    a wide variety of climatic, soil, crop, and management conditions. Accuracies
    of methods using remote sensing (satellite, aerial, and UAV) data depends on a
    variety of factors including image resolution (spatial, spectral, and temporal);
    atmospheric, climatic, and weather conditions; crop and field conditions (e.g.,
    growth stage, land cover); and the analyses technique (e.g., regression-based,
    machine learning, physically based modeling). For example, the accuracy of surface
    energy balance techniques for ET estimation varies significantly in space and
    time, causing a large uncertainty in PA decision making. More studies are needed
    to understand the spatio-temporal structure of uncertainty in estimating ET, soil
    moisture, disease stress, and other crop parameters. Spectral signature from a
    crop is a reflection of crop status/response to site characteristics (e.g., soil,
    topography), management, and simultaneously acting multiple biotic and abiotic
    stressors (e.g., diseases, weeds, nutrient and water stress, etc.). A disease
    detection method found suitable under controlled experimental conditions may not
    perform similarly well in real-world conditions where multiple biotic and biotic
    stressors govern crop response or conditions. Given the complexity of image processing
    methods and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise it requires for application,
    there is a need to explore and develop a simple and reliable workflow for image
    pre-processing, analysis and application in real time. Major challenges and gaps
    remain in the development of tools and frameworks that can facilitate the use
    of satellite data for real-time applications by the end-users. Development of
    accurate, user-friendly systems is likely to result in wider adoption of remote
    sensing data in commercial and non-commercial PA operations. Author Contributions

  description: Crop maps are highly desired information in modern agriculture as they
    enable possessors to manage their business in the most optimal way. Usually in
    remote sensing, crop mapping is performed using satellite images and within-season
    ground truth samples that are collected in extensive survey campaigns every year,
    neglecting information and knowledge that past seasons’ classification models
    provided. This paper assessed different temporal transferring approaches, including
    transfer learning, together with traditional crop mapping approach to provide
    an exhaustive comparison. Transferring approaches differed in portion of knowledge
    utilized from a historical model and that coming from a target season dataset.
    Three distinct algorithms, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer,
    were employed and evaluated using highly dense time series of Sentinel-1 data.
    Source and target domain were respectively represented by two sets, 2017–2020
    and 2021 season data, and 9 different crop types were classified. Results showcased
    that transferring a model has a great potential in crop mapping when little to
    no ground truth data is available for the target season. However, traditional
    approach catches up rather quickly and even surpasses transfer learning approach
    in terms of performance after a certain portion of target domain data is collected.
    Without target season ground truth data, model transferring can yield modest crop
    mapping performance of 78% for F1 score, between 84% and 86% F1 score with transfer
    learning employed in conjunction with limited target season ground truth (i.e.
    between 120 and 720 parcels), and 88% F1 score at best with traditional approach
    (ca. 720 parcels). Even though a good discriminatory is found between different
    crop types, there is still a room for improvement regarding the least represented
    classes in the dataset. The study significantly contributes to the area of agricultural
    monitoring and management by demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning
    while lessening the necessity for extensive and labor-intensive data collection,
    thereby fostering cost and time efficiency. Utilizing Sentinel-1 data, it provides
    a practical and efficient solution for agricultural analysis worldwide regardless

    food, food security, and food production have been key factors driving human progress
    since ancient times, often resulting in both conflict and peace negotiations.
    The present global circumstances have elevated food-related concerns to an unprecedented
    level. In order to ensure sufficient and qualitative food supplies, special attention
    needs to be given to crop production, and thus to timely and accurate crop monitoring.
    Accurate agricultural maps (crop maps, land use maps) are essential in supporting
    decision makers to create optimal policies that ensure food security (Blickensdörfer
    et al., 2022). Nowadays, prerequisites for generating this type of information
    are met, having in mind the increasing number of publicly available satellite
    imagery together with accompanying advances in machine learning (ML) and its subfield
    deep learning (DL) (Turkoglu et al., 2021). Different actions have been made in
    recent years that promote the use of Earth observation (EO) data as means to detect/control
    presence of cultivars declared by farmers or even illegal crops (Arias et al.,
    2020, Rußwurm et al., 2019). In some European countries it is mandatory for farmers
    to declare what type of cultivar they will produce and sometimes it is required
    to report it in order to receive financial support within the scope of Common
    Agricultural Policy (Arias et al., 2020) and national subsidy programmes. Occasionally
    this data is open to the public. This results in creation of datasets such as
    EuroCrops (Schneider et al., 2021), ZueriCrop (Turkoglu et al., 2021), BreizhCrops
    (Rußwurm et al., 2019) and others, that include over hundreds of thousands of
    labeled parcels suitable for high-quality training of machine learning models.
    However, some countries, especially the European Union candidate states, lack
    the mandatory formal system of farmer’s cultivar declaration which is why it is
    hard to acquire any large ground truth dataset for these regions. For this reason,
    production potential of these regions often remains unexplored despite favorable
    agro-ecological conditions. What is more, any continental-scale classification
    model for Europe continues to self-integrate at least partial bias towards better
    represented regions in the reference dataset. This paper represents an attempt
    to bring one of the weakly represented agricultural regions in literature into
    focus, Vojvodina (northernmost part of Serbia), and explore and promote actionable
    use of artificial intelligence (AI) for crop mapping that can grapple with the
    insufficient labeled data. Traditional crop mapping using satellite imagery is
    based on optical or (and) radar images, and reference data, i.e., ground truth
    for the season that is collected by performing field campaigns and labeling at
    the beginning of the season. This is found to be rather labor-intensive and also
    an expensive way of ground truth data collection (Turkoglu et al., 2021, Arias
    et al., 2020) but unfortunately it is very often the only possible way to do it.
    Collection of a detailed large-scale database of ground truth data would require
    involvement of higher-level instances of public authorities who would have to
    establish a set of regulations on how and where data is collected and stored,
    who can use it, and for what purpose. This is practiced in some developed countries
    as mentioned, but even then, a question on the completeness and reliability of
    the data remains. With the aim to enlarge or replace ground truth datasets obtained
    through field based sampling strategies, some forms of algorithmical generation
    of pseudo ground truth have already been tested for crop mapping (Lin et al.,
    2022, Zhang et al., 2023). Furthermore, there were also conscious attempts to
    use ML-generated datasets, such as Crop Land Datalayer, as ground truth for crop
    mapping (Hao et al., 2020, Yuan and Lin, 2020, Cai et al., 2018, Zhang et al.,
    2021) even though this data contains apparent inherited errors of the initial
    processing pipeline. Despite the doubts, benefits over detriments are evident
    as massive collections of ground truth data provide a valuable and indispensable
    resource for many classification tasks. Numerous papers explored crop mapping
    problem using SAR in the presence of plethora of ground truth data; whether through
    the extraction of temporal signature of crops, followed by the comparison of the
    time series of spectral response of the element of interest to it Arias et al.,
    2020, Whelen and Siqueira, 2018 and Xu et al. (2019), or by utilizing various
    machine learning and deep learning techniques (Qu et al., 2020, Xie et al., 2021,
    Reußet al., 2021), or in combination with optical data (Blickensdörfer et al.,
    2022, Orynbaikyzy et al., 2020, Tricht et al., 2018). In order to alleviate the
    necessity for (yearly) ground truth data collection, an inter-annual transfer
    of classification models can be explored. While model transfer can be employed
    directly without adaptations, i.e., without any use of reference data of the target
    year, this paper considers as “transfer learning” (TL) an approach where previously
    acquired model knowledge is combined with limited target year reference data to
    produce a new knowledge, i.e., a new model, that potentially performs better than
    the pure transfer approach. Yang et al. (2020) give a definition of transfer learning
    in the following way: “Given a source domain and learning task , a target domain
    and learning task , transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the
    target predictive function ( ) for the target domain using the knowledge in and
    , where or ”. In this experiment the ultimate goal is to classify the same crop
    types in different seasons so it is assumed that domains are different ( ), rather
    than tasks, because seasons vary in weather conditions, farmers’ practice, etc.
    Transfer learning goes under various terminologies in AI and domain adaptation
    is one of them (Yang et al., 2020). Depending on whether some or none of the labeled
    data from target source are used for model adaptation, it is referred to as supervised
    or unsupervised domain adaptation, or semi-supervised domain adaptation if both
    types of data is used Lucas et al. (2021). Studies dealing with transferability
    of crop mapping models, in comparison to the traditional crop mapping using satellite
    imagery, are usually more of a new age, and can be divided roughly into two categories,
    those dealing with transferability in the temporal domain (You and Dong, 2020,
    Cai et al., 2018, Hu et al., 2022), and those dealing with transferability in
    the spatial domain (Orynbaikyzy et al., 2022, Jo et al., 2022, Yuan and Lin, 2020).
    Combination of the two, i.e., spatio-temporal transferability as a simultaneous
    method is in particular a complex task and thus seldomly seen in the literature
    (Hao et al., 2020, Gilcher and Udelhoven, 2021). Very often model transfers seen
    in literature fit to the category of simple or naive transfer, i.e., transfer
    without adaptations, whereas transfer learning approaches, i.e., transfer with
    adaptations, recently started getting more and more attention. Those of the latter
    group sometimes try to transfer the knowledge from computer vision tasks to crop
    mapping by fine-tuning parameters of previously trained models (Nowakowski et
    al., 2021, Gadiraju and Vatsavai, 2020). 1.1. Research premise The premise of
    this research arise from findings given in Hu et al. (2022), which states that
    ground truth data does not need to be gathered every year and that interannual
    transfer of the trained models can be used for predicting (future) and retracing
    (historical) crop type maps. While Hu et al. (2022) performed pure transfer of
    model, this paper aims to investigate benefits of using small amounts of ground
    truth of the target year (in combination with very dense time series of SAR data)
    and check if (at all) and by what rate (how much) accuracy can benefit from introducing
    certain portions of this data. Due to susceptibility to weather conditions, notably
    cloud cover, optical data could not provide as dense time series as SAR data can
    (Orynbaikyzy et al., 2022). Thus, transferring models based on optical data could
    be rather challenging, having in mind lots of potential constraints (cloudiness
    of the area, number of valid images during the season, adequate matching day-of-year
    of the valid images in source and target domain, etc.), which does not apply for
    SAR. There are attempts to densify optical time series, but they all require additional
    processing, whether using interpolation or some other more advanced machine learning
    methods, that bring in additional uncertainty. Quantifying this induced uncertainty
    is by itself a complex task, and thus it is seldom (or hardly ever) seen in crop
    mapping research in literature. In that sense, SAR based approaches are more robust
    and suitable for wider application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first study to utilize temporal transfer learning in combination with densely
    sampled radar time series for multi-class crop mapping, making our research unique
    in this aspect. The research starts off by creating a dense time series of SAR
    data, followed by building different crop classification models and approaches.
    Objective is to assess the potential of temporal transfer learning in the northern
    Serbian province of Vojvodina. By incorporating data from multiple seasons in
    the experiment, we tend to create robust models that can learn invariant features
    and generalize well, thus successfully handle year-to-year variations. Given that
    the phenological development and growing patterns of a crop are the same or quite
    similar between different regions (Hao et al., 2020), similarities of a crop among
    seasons of the same region is even more apparent which enables us to base hypothesis
    upon. Research questions addressed in this paper are: 1. Is it possible to transfer
    the knowledge of the crop classification model in temporal domain within a particular
    region? 2. How do different portions of ground truth data of the target year added
    to the training set affect classification results? 3. What are advantages and
    disadvantages of transfer learning compared to standard crop mapping procedure?
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Study area and datasets (including
    preprocessing) are described in detail in Section 2, while methodology is presented
    in Section 3. Results are reported in Sections 4 Results, 5 Discussion discusses
    outcomes of the study. Finally, Section 6 provides conclusions and outlook for
    future work. 2. Data and study area 2.1. Study area This paper covers the territory
    of Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. It lies in the North of the Republic of Serbia
    and represents the south-eastern part of the Pannonian Basin (Hrnjak et al., 2014).
    Vojvodina covers ca. 21,500 large region characterized with flatness and predominantly
    occupied by agriculture (Lugonja et al., 2019). According to a 2018 report, nearly
    80% of the territory was used for agricultural production, i.e., 15,743 (RZS Srbije,
    2019). The agricultural output of the province makes a significant contribution
    to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for 3.7% of the total
    in 2021 (RZS Srbije, 2023). Hrnjak et al. (2014), describe Vojvodina’s climate
    as moderate continental, with cold winters and hot and humid summers with huge
    range of extreme temperatures and nonequal distribution of rainfall per months.
    These extremes are even more evident nowadays, which is why the United Nations
    report (Jachia and Milovanović, 2022) lists Serbian agriculture as vulnerable
    to climate change related droughts and floods. Hence, continuous and reliable
    monitoring of agricultural production is of high importance for the region. Family
    farms, which comprize over 99% of all farms in Serbia, have an average size of
    5 hectares (RZS Srbije, 2019). Consequently, this results in a highly fragmented
    agricultural area throughout the country and Vojvodina is equally affected (Fig.
    1). However, small size fields as such should not present a problem for pixel-based
    classification (Crnojevic et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res image (584KB)

    land in Vojvodina (Google Maps, 2022). 2.2. Ground truth data This research spans
    over 5 agricultural seasons, from 2017 to 2021. In each season, ground truth data
    was collected during field campaigns. Prior to field campaigns for ground truth
    data collection, regions of interest were defined that were characterized with
    the presence of medium and large size parcels. Due to its high resolution, Google
    Earth was used for this task but also because it enables to verify that these
    areas were “resistant” to parcel fragmentation in the past. During field campaigns,
    experts (in teams of two) tended to label as large parcels as possible, ensuring
    a sufficient number of 10 10 m pixels within. For this purpose, they were trying
    to avoid long and narrow (less than 100 m in width) parcels, preferring a layout
    that is both uniform and consolidated. For each parcel a label and GPS location
    were recorded (from within the parcel), together with any other necessary information
    for easier visual interpretation later on (e.g. presence of small woody features).
    Starting from 2019, a dedicated in-house built app was used that also records
    images, which were used for another independent check upon the completion of the
    campaign. Field campaigns were usually performed in the end of May or beginning
    of June. Some of the challenges faced during data collection was inaccessibility
    of the planned fields due to bad weather conditions (rain, mud) or natural obstacles
    (channel, bushes, etc.), for which alternative parcels were selected and some
    field trips were postponed. Upon return from field work, collected data was exported
    to QGIS (2022) and parcels were digitized manually by GIS experts using the Sentinel-2
    imagery of 10 m resolution as the base map. Typically, the closest available satellite
    image to date of expedition was selected unless it was obscured by clouds in which
    case the following closest cloud free image was selected. Parcel borders were
    drawn by visually estimating the homogeneous area around the recorded GPS point
    that represented the same field. Practice was to always draw borders a pixel or
    two inside the very parcel, to make sure the effect of border pixels is avoided
    later in processing. Any unclear records were instantly discarded and not used
    further on. The number of labeled polygons per season is given in Table 1. Data
    of 2017–2020 seasons served as source domain, while 2021 season data served as
    target domain in the experiment. Spatial distribution of polygons per domain is
    given in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 3, nine crop types were selected for this classification
    task, namely: corn, wheat, soybean, sunflower, sugar beet, oilseed rape, barley,
    clover, and orchard. Among these, the average parcel size is ca. 14 ha, but the
    median parcel size is ca. 4.5 ha. Variation between parcel sizes is quite large
    with the smallest parcel size being just 0.037 ha (corn), and the largest of about
    317 ha (wheat). Download : Download high-res image (740KB) Download : Download

    selected pixels within each parcel were taken as dataset samples. Due to small
    size of several parcels and resolution of satellite images, not every parcel was
    able to provide all 50 independent pixels. Yet, these parcels with fewer than
    50 pixels were still taken into account. A choice of 50 pixels was selected in
    order to ensure efficient computation given the available resources, as well as
    to restrain the class imbalance from getting bigger in case more pixels were taken
    per parcel. Number of pixel samples given per season are presented in Table 1.
    2.3. Sentinel-1 Sentinel-1 is the synthetic aperture radar satellite mission and
    the first satellite mission of the Copernicus programme developed by the European
    Space Agency which consists of two polar orbiting satellites, Sentinel-1 A and
    Sentinel-1B, respectively launched in April of 2014 and 2015 (Pandžić et al.,
    2020, Potin et al., 2016). Instruments onboard operate with the central frequency
    of 5.405 GHz (C-band), support dual polarization, and operates in four different
    acquisition modes, namely Stripmap, Interferometric Wide swath (IW), Extra-Wide
    swath and Wave mode (ESA, 2022a, Yague-Martinez et al., 2016), of which IW mode
    with the swath width of 250 km was used for the experiment. Data products of Sentinel-1
    are available as Level-1 Single Look Complex or Level-1 Ground Range Detected
    (GRD), and the revisit time of the constellation is 6 days. As of December 23rd,
    2021, due to an onboard anomaly, new Sentinel-1B data is no longer available and
    the end of mission for this satellite was announced (SCIHUB, 2022), leaving Sentinel-1
    A alone in operation with a 12-day revisit time. Sentinel-1 IW GRD data for the
    experiment was acquired from Alaska Satellite Facility - ASF (ASF, 2022). ASF
    provides simple way to select area and desired time span, and then generates Python
    code which triggers data download upon run. Total of 606 images were downloaded
    that span over full five calendar years (January 1st, 2017, to December 31st,
    2021) and provide information for 303 dates. All the acquisitions come from the
    relative orbit number 175 and they were preprocessed according to the steps described
    in following section. Download : Download high-res image (429KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Sentinel-1 preprocessing workflow. 2.4. Preprocessing
    of satellite imagery SAR imagery preprocessing pipeline is depicted in Fig. 4
    and was conducted using readily available snappy Python library (for more details
    readers are referred to official SNAP development page SNAP, 2022 and STEP FORUM
    ESA, 2022b). It starts off by reading a pair of images covering the test area
    and performing apply orbit file, thermal noise removal, border noise removal and
    calibration to Beta0 (radar brightness). Then, the two images are merged using
    slice assembly and their subset to the region of interest (ROI) is extracted.
    This is followed by speckle filter performed using Lee filter and a kernel size
    of 5 5 pixels. Terrain flattening step is based on the algorithm given in Small
    (2011), with parameters SRTM 3 s and a bilinear interpolation set for digital
    elevation model (DEM) and DEM resampling method, respectively. This resampling
    method is chosen based on Truckenbrodt et al. (2019) who suggested it as the best
    compromise between quality of topographic normalization and processing time consumption.
    Similarly, to terrain flattening, terrain correction utilized the same parameters
    for DEM, but also some additional parameters. Namely, bilinear interpolation was
    chosen for an image resampling method, 10 m as a pixel spacing, and alignToStandardGrid
    was set to True in order to have all the processed Sentinel-1 dates aligned. Presented
    processing workflow outputs bands for VV and VH polarizations as Gamma0 backscatter
    (radar cross-section with respect to local incidence angle given by DEM). Some
    authors already discussed superiority of Gamma0 over Sigma0 (Small, 2011, Wicks
    et al., 2018). Resulting products were saved in geotiff format and included these
    two bands, while their ratio (SR ) was added later. All three served as features
    in the analysis afterwards. Download : Download high-res image (598KB) Download

    data, i.e. seasons 2017–2020) served for hyperparameter optimization in FS (hist)
    approach, and for hyperparameter optimization and model training in TL and naive
    approaches. Target domain data (season 2021) was split into 60% for testing for
    all approaches, 30% for re/training, and 10% for validation purpose during hyperparameter
    optimization in FS (2021) approach. 3. Methodology Methodology framework is depicted
    in Fig. 5. Three algorithms are selected for evaluation, namely Random Forest,
    Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer. Random Forest (RF) is a classical
    representative of machine learning group of algorithms. It is a bagging (bootstrap
    aggregation) ensemble learning method made up from collection of decision trees
    that create forest. Every decision tree is trained using bootstrapped dataset
    and gives a single vote for the class output of the input sample. The class label
    with the most votes across the ensemble wins (Breiman, 2001). Convolutional neural
    network (CNN) is a well-known deep learning architecture used to solve various
    pattern recognition tasks. Over the last two decades, regarding the extreme increase
    in annotated datasets availability, as well as manufacturing improvements of graphics
    processor units, a tremendous progress of CNNs algorithms has been made thus achieving
    outstanding results on various tasks (Gu et al., 2018). Transformers (TR) are
    considered nowadays as the state-of-the-art in the deep learning community. Self-attention
    Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) represent a type of neural network initially
    designed as encoder–decoder models for sequence-to-sequence tasks like language
    translation. These models employ attention mechanisms to extract features from
    specific time steps in an input time series signal. In the context of the crop
    classification task, the word embedding step is omitted. This decision is based
    on the continuous spatial nature of the satellite time series data. Instead, positional
    encoding is introduced into the time series signal. This addition is crucial because
    self-attention cannot inherently leverage the sequential correlation present in
    time series data (Rußwurm and Körner, 2020). For each algorithm four different
    model approaches were analyzed, given in Table 2. Each differ in data in use,
    phases and knowledge taken from historical model. Naive represents a case where
    model was trained on historical data and applied as such on test data. Transfer
    Learning approach is approach where model trained on historical data is retrained
    using small portion of target domain training data and applied to test data. From
    scratch (historical) is a model that used historical data only to optimize hyperparameters,
    but used portion of target domain training data to train a model. Lastly, From
    scratch (2021) used only target domain training data both for hyperparameter optimization
    and model training (does not use historical data). Table 2. Characteristics of
    different models. Phase A relies on source domain data, phase B relies on a part
    of target domain data, and the testing phase relies on the remaining part of target
    domain data. Model CNNnaive/RFnaive/TRnaive CNNTL/RFTL/TRTL CNNFS (hist)/RFFS

    (updated) Hyperparameters Source domain data, i.e., 2017–2020 season, was used
    for hyperparameter optimization and model training for models CNNnaive, RFnaive,
    TRnaive, CNNTL, RFTL and TRTL, utilizing leave-one-year-out (loyo) approach (described
    in Section 3.2), while for models CNNFS (hist), RFFS (hist) and TRFS (hist) was
    used just for hyperparameter optimization. Target domain data, i.e., 2021 season,
    was split into three stratified sets: training (30%), validation (10%) and test
    set (60%). If a parcel was chosen for a particular set during the data split (which
    also applies for source domain split during loyo), then all of the associated
    pixels were put in the same set, thereby safeguarding the method against data
    leakage. Training set is smaller than usually seen in literature because the background
    idea is to try to rely on historical data (i.e. source domain) and use as little
    as possible the data coming from the target domain. This training data is used
    for training in CNNFS (hist), RFFS (hist) and TRFS (hist) models, retraining in
    CNNTL, RFTL and TRTL models, and hyperparameter optimization and training in CNNFS
    (2021), RFFS (2021) and TRFS (2021) models (Fig. 5, Table 2). All respective re/training
    and hyperparameter optimization is done at 5% interval. Validation set was used
    only for hyperparameter optimization in CNNFS (2021), RFFS (2021) and TRFS (2021)
    models. The test set was identical for all 12 models. 3.1. Kolmogorov–Smirnov
    goodness-of-fit test for two domains Before running ML and DL models, it was necessary
    to check if the two domains (source and target) are different. Generally speaking,
    seasonal differences mainly originate from management- and weather-induced variabilities
    which were, in this case, only considered in terms of their impact on radar backscatter
    and related derivatives, not as an explicit feature (predictor). In this experiment
    source domain is defined jointly by season 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 data (often
    regarded as historical data), while 2021 season data is taken for target domain
    since that is the year we want to transfer the model to. Following the work by
    Yang et al. (2020), in order to consider source and target domains defined by
    feature space and marginal probability distribution to be different (which is
    one of prerequisites for transfer learning), it is necessary that either their
    feature spaces are different ( ) or that their marginal probability distributions
    are different ( ). In this particular case feature spaces are the same, and the
    identity of the two marginal probability distributions was tested using Kolmogorov–Smirnov
    two-sided test, by comparing respective samples (e.i., pairs of features) of the
    two domains. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is a nonparametric goodness-of-fit test that
    compares two independent samples on joint underlying distribution (Kottegoda and
    Rosso, 2008). Test statistics is calculated as: (1) where (2) and and represent
    two empirical distribution functions of the two samples of size and , respectively,
    and is for the supremum function. The null hypothesis states that both samples
    have the same underlying distribution and it is rejected if the -value of the
    test is less than the level of significance which was set for all tests to 0.05

    optimization Although some studies neglect the process of hyperparameter tuning
    by referring to conclusions previously drawn in literature on rather small improvements
    achieved (Pelletier et al., 2017), this study decisively runs this operation in
    order to find the optimal parameter settings. Grid search method was used for
    this task. In case of RF, parameters to tune were the number of trees in the forest
    ( ), maximum depth of the tree ( ) and the minimum number of samples in the leaf
    ( ; Table 3). RF is rarely prone to the overfitting issue due to the large number
    of decision trees produced by randomly selecting a subset of training samples
    and a subset of variables for splitting at each tree node (Belgiu and Drăguţ,
    2016). On the other hand, the basic CNN architecture which consists of two logical
    blocks, convolutional base and classifier, is used within this analysis as one
    of the deep learning classification tool representatives (Fig. 6). The convolutional
    base consists of multiple convolutional blocks and serves as a feature extractor
    used to obtain generic patterns from the input signal useful for crop classification.
    Each convolutional block comprized convolutional, Dropout (Srivastava et al.,
    2014), BatchNorm (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and ReLU (Nair and Hinton, 2010) layers,
    respectively. Note that within the last convolutional layer, the kernel size is
    set to 1, which produces a consistent number of feature maps regardless of the
    number of convolutional filters in the previous block. Finally, an Adaptive Average
    Pooling layer is used to aggregate features produced by individual convolutional
    filters and create a consistent output size for cases where the input length varies.
    This model property allows to explore the impact of different input sizes due
    to the early-season mapping or number of valid acquisitions used for data generation.
    Finally, the classifier consists of a single fully connected layer followed by
    Softmax layer to produce the classified output. In order to optimize CNN architecture
    different number of convolutional blocks ( ), number of filters ( ), kernel sizes
    ( ) and dropout ( ) values were thoroughly explored. Sets of values evaluated
    for each hyperparameter can be seen in Table 3. The early stopping criteria based
    on the validation loss is used during the model training in order to fight the
    model overfitting towards training samples (Prechelt, 2002). Table 3. Grid search

    [4, 5, 6] d_inner [64, 128, 256] dropout [0, 0.25] Following the work by Rußwurm
    et al. (2019), the Transformer network initiates with the step of positional encoding
    (Fig. 7). After this, the time series data is converted into feature representations
    of higher dimensions using one or more Transformer blocks. In each block, features
    are encoded using a multihead self-attention mechanism, and this is followed by
    several dense layers that operate independently on each time instance. To improve
    the flow of information and gradients through the network, skip connections are
    implemented between layers. Additionally, layer normalization is employed consistently
    across the model. The output of the final layer is then reduced by a global maximum
    pooling through time dimension. This reduced representation is then mapped to
    class scores through a final fully connected layer with a softmax activation function.
    Following hyperparameters were optimized for Transformer architecture: the dimensionality
    of the hidden states ( ), number of layers in the Transformer encoder ( ), number
    of heads in the multi-head attention mechanism ( ), dropout probability ( ) and
    dimensionality of the inner layer of the feed-forward networks ( ) (Table 3).
    Hyperparameter optimization process for models CNNnaive, CNNTL, CNNFS (hist),
    RFnaive, RFTL, RFFS (hist), TRnaive, TRTL and TRFS (hist) was done using historical
    data and leave-one-year-out technique. This means that input data referring to
    years 2017–2020 was used in such a way that 4-fold cross-validation was performed,
    so that each year-data represented only once a validation dataset. This approach
    imitates our general idea where characteristics of the target year data are unknown
    in advance, thus assuming better generalization than simple train-test split approach.
    Once done, the average result per hyperparameter combination was extracted. Metrics
    used were F1 score and time complexity. F1 score is taking the harmonic mean of
    Precision and Recall as presented in Eq. (3): (3) with TP, FP and FN respcetively
    denoting True Positives, False Positives, and False Negatives, while time complexity
    refers to the time spent to fit the model. Features (acquisitions dates) used
    for this purpose ranged from the beginning of March until the end of September
    since this period is characterized with typical phenological developments for
    all crop types considered. Hyperparameter optimization process for models CNNFS
    (2021), RFFS (2021) and TRFS (2021) was already discussed, holding analogous choice
    of features. Once these results were obtained, the Pareto front was drawn to perform
    the final choice of hyperparameters. Pareto front is a concept in multi-objective
    optimization based on non-dominating solutions. In this particular case, this
    means that no other solution (point), rather than those creating “the front”,
    is giving better results on both axes (F1 score and time complexity). In other
    words, if we were to increase F1 score, then time complexity would be compromised,
    and vice versa. Of the points that construct Pareto front, a single point (solution)
    was selected using kneed Python library that enables finding a point of the line
    with maximum curvature (Satopaa et al., 2011). This point marks the chosen hyperparameters
    setting. 3.3. Model choice and transfer learning In addition to previous, a choice
    of a model (denoted as historical model throughout the paper) was done by taking
    a step back and looking at the four corresponding folds for the chosen hyperparameter
    combination. The one with the highest F1 score was selected and forwarded to phase
    B and testing. In Transfer Learning approach, historical model was retrained using
    portion of 2021 season training data. Retraining was carried out in increments
    of 5% of the data, until reaching the previously allocated 30% for re/training.
    Each of these increments went through five iterations. Simultaneously, testing
    was conducted using previously reserved 60% of the target domain data for evaluation.
    The increment of 5% was chosen in order to investigate the impact of varying volumes
    of data on performance of Transfer Learning. In the scope of RF, boosting knowledge
    of the source domain trained model can be done by increasing the number of trees
    while adding target domain samples and fitting new trees over limited target domain
    samples. Decision trees of the forest previously built solely on source domain
    samples remain unchanged, only extra trees are added to the forest to extract
    additional knowledge from target domain. In the scope of CNN, transfer learning
    is done by using the representations learned by a pre-trained model to extract
    interesting features from target domain samples. Namely, a set of layers from
    the convolutional base is frozen, which prevents their weights from being updated
    during training. That way previously learned features using the source domain
    (which comprize higher amounts of information compared to the target domain) are
    not modified and useful knowledge could be reused for the target domain. The reason
    is that the representations learned by the convolutional base are likely to extract
    certain generic concepts within the input signal useful when the number of samples
    within the target domain is limited. On the other hand, fully connected layer
    (classifier) representations acquired during the model training, tend to be more
    specific regarding the source domain. For that reason, fully connected layer weights
    were updated using the information provided within the target domain. Similarly
    to transfer learning process executed utilizing convolutional neural networks,
    a set of weights within the TransferEncoder layer was frozen, while only the weights
    from the final fully connected layer were updated during model training. This
    approach allowed a pre-trained model to extract the general features learned from
    information present in the source domain, whereas parameters in classifier part
    are specifically adjusted towards the target domain dataset. Download : Download

    Domain difference The first insight into data is given in Fig. 8 that displays
    averaged time series of the two domains per respective set of features, namely
    VH, VV and SR. Despite nested pitfalls, due to e.g. aggregation of different classes,
    the graphs still nicely illustrate similar trends in domains together with their
    substantial differences. Differences may originate from specific distribution
    of classes between agricultural seasons (although they are quite related), distinct
    weather characteristics and altered management practice. To statistically verify
    that these differences meet criteria of TL for the experiment, Kolmogorov–Smirnov
    tests were performed for all pairs of features between two domains. For all tests,
    calculated -value was smaller than the set threshold of where K equals number
    of tests, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis that the two samples are
    coming from the same distribution for all 105 tests. For this reason, two domains
    of interest can safely be considered different. Download : Download high-res image

    Hyperparameter optimization With the setup described in Section 3.2 there were
    60 combinations of parameters examined for RF and 144 combinations examined for
    CNN and TR each. In loyo approach each combination was assessed four times, and
    their averaged performances per parameter settings are given in Fig. 9. For models
    CNNFS (2021), RFFS (2021) and TRFS (2021) hyperparameter optimization was done
    18 times (6 times per each algorithm due to chosen 5% increments in training data,
    i.e., 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30%), in a single fold with 5 iterations. The
    non-dominated solutions, shown by a star marker, are creating the Pareto front
    (green line). The intersection of the black dashed vertical line and the Pareto
    front is the knee point, a trade-off between model performance and complexity,
    that represents the selected solution, i.e., combination of hyperparameters. For
    the cases shown in Fig. 9 that relate to historical models, optimal hyperparameter

    dataset Performance of various models on test dataset is shown in Fig. 10. CNN
    models are given in solid lines, RF in dashed lines and TR in dotted lines. Each
    color represents different scenario. Since re/training was done at 5% data increments,
    the evaluation is presented in the same way. CNNnaive, shown in blue, achieves
    an F1 score of 78%. This indicates that it performs quite descent for a given
    task. TRnaive performs 2% lower, i.e. reaches F1 score of 76%. Meanwhile, RFnaive
    lags behind, with an F1 score of 73%. It is the least effective among all the
    models we have tested. Since all of these three scenarios are essentially just
    pre-trained models applied directly to our target domain test dataset, their performance
    is a constant in Fig. 10. When speaking about TL approach, represented by orange
    lines on our chart, CNNTL exhibits a consistently high F1 score ranging between
    84% and 87%. This impressive range firmly positions CNNTL among the top-performing
    models in our analysis. It demonstrates a remarkable capability to deliver robust
    results across different scenarios. In contrast, RFTL achieves an F1 score between
    80% and 84%. This places it in a solid middle ground in terms of performance when
    compared to the other models under consideration. While not reaching the same
    heights as CNNTL, RFTL maintains a respectable level of performance across various
    conditions. Similarly to RFTL, F1 score for TRTL ranges between 81% and 84% for
    different data increments. Also, at the onset of our evaluation, all three models
    CNNFS (hist), RFFS (hist) and TRFS (hist), exhibited a commendable F1 score, beginning
    at approximately 80% (at a 5% increment). However, as we progressed in our analysis,
    CNNFS (hist) demonstrated a modest rise, reaching a peak of nearly 85% F1 score.
    In contrast, RFFS (hist) and TRFS (hist) surpassed expectations by achieving F1
    scores exceeding 87%. While TRFS (hist) exhibited steady increase throughout,
    RFFS (hist) faced performance drop at 10% data increment. Finally, F1 score fluctuated
    within the range of 77% to 82% for CNNFS (2021) model. On the other hand, RFFS
    (2021) showcased a more impressive performance range, spanning from 77% to an
    outstanding 88% F1 score when more training data is being available. What is particularly
    noteworthy is that RFFS (2021) attained the highest F1 score among all the models
    we examined, emphasizing its exceptional performance in the task at hand. F1 score
    of TRFS (2021) model steadily increased from 80% to 88%, making its performances
    at each increment nearly identical to those of TRFS (hist) model. Confusion matrices
    for CNNTL at 5% increment and RFFS (2021) at 30% increment are given in Fig. 11.
    The first one is chosen since it represents the best performing model in scenario
    where the least target domain data was used, while the second is chosen because
    it is the best performing model overall. It can be seen that they quite resemble
    to one another, and that none is ultimately better on all classes. Good discriminatory
    is found for corn, wheat, soybean, sugar beat, barley and oilseed rape (90% or
    more, with single exception of 89% for barley in the first case). A bit lower
    is found for sunflower (80% and 81%), followed by clover (75% and 71%) and orchard
    with only 59%. The subpar discriminatory performance observed for clover and orchard
    is likely attributed to their underrepresentation in the dataset, as they each
    constitute only 2% of the total number of samples (Fig. 3). In such cases, characterized
    by imbalanced data, Precision and Recall metrics represent useful indicators of
    classification performance. Former indicates the likelihood of classifier prediction
    as being correct, whereas latter gives an indication that the classifier is successful
    at identifying instances from the class of interest. In other words, Precision
    focuses on reducing false positives, whereas Recall concentrates on minimizing
    false negatives. For that reason, both metrics are estimated per class in Table
    4 for the two selected models. Based on values provided within the table, it can
    be seen that CNN model gives a good trade-off between Precision and Recall for
    all classes. On the other hand, in case of clovers, sunflowers and orchards, RF
    misclassified a high ratio of instances as different classes, which can also be
    seen in Fig. 11 where orchard are often misclassified as corn (22%), sunflower
    as soybean (13%) or corn (6%) and finally clover as corn (15%). Given that corn
    is the predominant crop type in the dataset, it appears that both models are inclined
    to classify ambiguous predictions as corn, relying prevalently on statistical
    likelihood. However, based on the results provided within Table 4 and Fig. 11,
    CNN model shows higher generalization capabilities compared to RF. Table 4. Precision

    0.63 0.96 0.35 5. Discussion One way to deal with crop classification in areas
    of limited training data is to train a model in another region/year and transfer
    to the target one (Hao et al., 2020). This study aimed to investigate if SAR-based
    crop classification models can be transferred in time and explore their applicability.
    The research showed that it is indeed possible to transfer knowledge of crop classification
    model in temporal domain within a single agricultural region, despite being as
    large as 21,500 . Although simple transfer of model can yield good results, adapting
    the model using in-situ data can boost its performance furthermore. In general,
    the more in-situ data is added to training set, the better classification results
    are achieved. Crop mapping can benefit from historical data-based model if in-situ
    data for target year is very scarce or unavailable. However, when certain portion
    of this data is met (e.g. 15% increment in our case or ca. 360 parcels), traditional
    crop mapping approaches could be more suitable and even outperform transfer learning
    approaches. Still, while existing model would require only retraining, building
    new model from scratch in traditional way would require hyperparameter optimization
    prior to model training which can take substantial amount of time. This study
    generally addressed limited availability of target domain data, despite taking
    different increments of in-situ data into account throughout experimentation.
    Regarding traditional mapping approaches, it resulted in agreement with previous
    findings on ensemble learning models being better than neural networks (Yuan and
    Lin, 2020), when small portion of data is available for training. Unless the crop
    classification study is trying to replicate an existing one, which is not the
    present case, systematically assessing and comparing crop classification studies
    presents difficulties due to the inherent differences not only in the quality
    of the training and testing datasets (Antonijević et al., 2023), but also in quantity
    of data, experiment designs including choice of crops, time and locations, chosen
    evaluation metrics and other relevant parameters (Rusňák et al., 2023). For this
    reason, it was rather challenging to compare with other crop mapping studies.
    In Arias et al. (2018), authors achieved the highest overall accuracy of 79% utilizing
    Sentinel-1 temporal signatures for 11 crop types on rather imbalanced training
    set with 400 parcels. The closest analogy to our experiment would correspond to
    approximately 15% increment in e.g. RFFS (2021), i.e. F1 score of about 86%. Specifically
    speaking of model transferring, Hu et al. (2022) reported OA of 89% when transferring
    model from 2019 to 2020 season using naive approach. Potential respective pair
    from this study could be the worst performing model RFnaive with only 73% F1 score.
    However, their study classified only 4 crop types in comparison to our 9 crop
    types which is a more complex task by itself. They also used combination of SAR
    with optical sensor that, although beneficial, could likely be obstructed from
    use due to weather dependency. Their findings showed that the combination of sensors
    reached about 1% higher OA than the Sentinel-2 only scenario, but did not investigate
    the radar only scenario. Temporal transfer learning in combination with spatial
    transfer was tested by Hao et al. (2020) that reported impressive results (OA
    of 98%, 86% and 95%,) using combination of optical sensors only (harmonized Landsat
    −8 and Sentinel-2 data), yet only 2 or 3 crop types per testing region were assessed.
    Both studies relied on RF algorithm and considered imbalanced datasets for which
    F1 score metric may be more relevant than OA. On the other hand, You and Dong
    (2020) explored all three scenarios (optical only, radar only, and combination
    of sensors) in their research. A naive transferring approach using only Sentinel-1
    achieved poor results, i.e., F1 score of just 67% and 58% for corn and soybean,
    respectively. However, using only Sentinel-2 imagery they managed to reach an
    F1 score of over 90% for both crops. Combination of the two sensors yielded 0.3%
    higher F1 score for corn, while F1 score for soybean was 0.2% lower than using
    Sentinel-2 only. Relying only on optical sensor, i.e., Sentinel-2, authors in
    Wang et al. (2023) reported F1 score between 84% and 92% with their proposed deep
    adaptation crop classification network (DACCN) when transferring models between
    subsequent seasons in the same region. Again, only corn and soybean were classified,
    while all the other crop types were classified as “other”. Račič et al. (2024)
    performed multi-year early crop mapping using Sentinel-2 and achieved an average
    F1 score of 82.5%, without any reference data from the target year (respective
    pair from our study could be CNNnaive with F1 score of 78%). They were able to
    exceed this performance using in season ground truth by 210th DOY with 48,000
    (9% of available dataset) samples from the target year. Authors in Rusňák et al.
    (2023) reported mean accuracy ranging between 88% and 92% for temporal transferability
    scenario. Cai et al. (2018) investigated in-season mapping using Landsat data,
    and reported 95% classification accuracy by the end of June when applying pretrained
    models to a target years. They utilized 13- and 14-years long time-series in this
    research and classified corn and soybean. Transferring only model architecture
    without transferring model weights, such as e.g. CNNFS (hist), gave promising
    results in our test case, which is different from remarks given in Jo et al. (2022),
    who tested transfer learning for single crop type but in different regions. Conclusions
    from Gadiraju and Vatsavai (2020), on superiority of strategies that include fine-tuning
    of pre-trained models over strategies such as naive transfer are also confirmed
    in our case. However, their superiority over models trained from scratch should
    be taken with precautions since it was not indisputably proven within our experiment.
    Finally, to rest assure that created models truly generalize well without overfitting,
    one can compare Fig. 9, Fig. 10. By analyzing these graphs, it can be seen that
    the best performing model, for all three algorithms RF, CNN and TR, is not exceeding
    75% of F1 score during hyperparameter optimization process (Fig. 9). On the other
    hand, the same models evaluated on the independent test set (Fig. 10) do not show
    any decrease in classification performance compared to source-domain validation
    performance. What is more, corresponding models have shown comparably higher performance
    evaluated on the target domain, which proves that trained models optimized in
    the source domain are highly generalized and perform successfully on an independent
    dataset. 6. Conclusion Using highly dense time series of Sentinel-1 imagery, this
    paper analyzed various strategies for transferring crop mapping models over time,
    contrasting them with the traditional, non-transferring approach. It examined
    three algorithms, namely Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer.
    Nine different crop types were classified in the experiment which are typically
    grown in Southeastern Europe, i.e., corn, wheat, soybean, sugar beat, barley,
    clover, sunflower, oilseed rape and orchard. All together, 12 different scenarios
    were tested of which RFnaive performed the worst, while CNNTL and RFFS (2021)
    were the two best performing models at different increments of re/training data.
    This means that pre-trained RF model on historical data and applied to new season
    data as such did not yield high performance. On the other hand, combination of
    CNN with Transfer Learning achieved promising results when little target domain
    data is available (less than 360 parcels in this case), surpassed later by the
    traditional crop mapping approach as more parcels were available. Results showed
    that the model can detect oilseed rape and wheat with highest reliability while
    orchard and clover are the two crop types most difficult to classify, presumably
    due to underrepresentation in the dataset which may have prevented the model from
    learning relevant feature representation and obtaining generic patterns for crop
    classification for the two labels. In our study, we emphasize the importance of
    accuracy as a key metric in evaluating crop classification model’s performance,
    balancing it with the consideration of time complexity. Though this turned not
    to be of high importance for Vojvodina case, it could however become vital for
    large-scale applications such as regional or continental map updates. The study’s
    secondary finding reveals that beyond a certain accuracy level, any further model
    improvement could become marginal relative to the additional time required. While
    temporal transfer learning exhibited significant capability, the experiment also
    highlighted that its application should not be unconditionally adopted as it faced
    a direct challenge from the traditional crop mapping approach when a certain portion
    of target domain data was available. Still, traditional approach requires hyperparameter
    optimization prior to model training, while transfer learning requires only model
    retraining which may make substantial difference in processing time. From the
    practical standpoint of agricultural management, the paper’s findings significantly
    reduce labor costs by minimizing the need for extensive field trips and personnel
    for ground truth data collection. With these methods, a handful of trips can replace
    20 full-day field trips with 40 people (referring to our study), providing an
    efficient overview of seasonal crop distribution. This streamlined approach still
    offers objective information vital for informed decision-making. Also, in situations
    where detailed data collection is impossible, such as natural disasters or war
    conflicts, transfer learning ensures the continuity of crop mapping with minimal
    resources and manpower. This not only cuts down time and effort but also reduces
    potential errors, as training and monitoring a smaller team is more manageable.
    This work concludes with several open questions that merit further exploration.
    The first one deals with searching for a better temporal transfer learning approach
    that could potentially outperform traditional mapping in all circumstances. Different
    number of frozen layers should be explored for this purpose in the first place.
    Alternatively, even though SAR data proved to be a reliable data source for TL
    tasks, further improvements in performances can be expected when radar data is
    combined with other data sources such as optical multispectral or weather data.
    Integrating SAR with optical data would help to better understand specific sensor
    data limitations, while weather data would explicitly address seasonal specificities
    that radar backscatter could not. Further experiments could be dedicated to analyzing
    TL in spatial domain where source and target domains will not represent the same
    area. It would be also interesting to investigate how much TL could help when
    tasks in two domains are not the same, i.e., classify different crop types in
    source and target domain. Finally, different ML and DL algorithms should also
    be explored, as well as early-season crop mapping. CRediT authorship contribution

    sustainability; sustainable production 1. Introduction 1.1. Background on Soilless
    Vegetable Production Soilless vegetable production, encompassing hydroponic and
    substrate-based systems, has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional soil-based
    agriculture [1,2], particularly in regions with poor soil quality or limited arable
    land. Compared to soil-grown crops, this method can offer higher yields [3,4,5],
    efficient nutrient utilization, extension of harvest periods, and reduced susceptibility
    to soil-borne diseases [6,7,8]. In addition, the pressure of climate change on
    agricultural production is steadily increasing because of the reduction in freshwater
    availability [9,10], forcing producers to incorporate efficient production units
    such as hydroponic systems, which can aid in a context of limited water for agriculture
    [11]. However, a critical analysis reveals several challenges and considerations
    that underpin this growing field. First, if organic materials in soilless systems
    are not appropriately supplied to the crop, it can produce less robust microbial
    ecosystems, potentially affecting plant health and nutrient absorption [7]. Additionally,
    these systems often require a higher initial investment in infrastructure and
    technology, which can be a barrier for small-scale farmers or those in developing
    regions [12]. In addition, the environmental impact of soilless systems is still
    controversial; while they often use water more efficiently, the energy requirements
    for climate control and nutrient delivery can be significant [12,13]. Finally,
    there is a learning curve associated with managing these systems, requiring new
    skill sets that traditional farmers may not possess [14,15]. While soilless vegetable
    production presents exciting opportunities for addressing some of the challenges
    of modern agriculture, it also introduces a new set of complexities and considerations
    that must be critically examined. 1.2. Importance of Next-Generation Technologies
    in Advancing the Field The importance of next-generation technologies in advancing
    the field of soilless vegetable production cannot be overstated. These technologies,
    ranging from AI-driven analytics to precision farming and advanced sensing systems,
    can revolutionize the industry by increasing yields, reducing resource consumption,
    and enhancing overall sustainability [16,17]. Nevertheless, as stated before,
    incorporating new types of technologies comes with several challenges to overcoming
    the constant increase in food demand because of population growth [18,19,20],
    potentially exacerbating existing inequalities within the sector. In addition,
    regulatory concerns, such as data privacy and environmental impact, remain unresolved
    [21,22,23], raising questions about their widespread adoption. Additionally, the
    rush to adopt new technologies may lead to inadequately tested implementations,
    risking failing to deliver promised benefits and introducing unforeseen risks;
    therefore, while next-generation technologies hold promise for soilless vegetable
    production, their adoption needs careful deliberation and balanced judgment to
    address these complex challenges. 1.3. Objective of the Review Article This review
    article aims to comprehensively analyze the state-of-the-art technologies and
    methodologies in soilless vegetable production, focusing on next-generation innovations.
    This includes an in-depth examination of automation and precision farming techniques,
    sensing and tracking technologies, and the integration of artificial intelligence
    and data analysis applied in soilless horticultural crops, i.e., in aquatic systems
    and inert substrates (hydroponics), and cultivation with natural organic substrates
    [24]. The review also aims to identify these technologies’ advantages, limitations,
    and challenges. It offers a balanced perspective that considers their potential
    to improve yield and sustainability and the financial and technical considerations
    that may impact their widespread adoption. Furthermore, this article seeks to
    highlight gaps in current research and suggest directions for future studies,
    thereby serving as both a resource for practitioners in the field and a roadmap
    for researchers. In summary, the objective is to present a nuanced view that acknowledges
    the transformative potential of next-generation technologies in soilless vegetable
    production while critically examining the complexities and challenges of their
    implementation. 1.4. Methodology for Literature Selection and Analysis in Soilless
    Agricultural Technologies In the pursuit of a comprehensive review of the current
    literature on soilless plant production, we meticulously established a set of
    selection criteria to ensure the inclusion of articles that were not only thematically
    relevant but also contributed significantly to the collective understanding of
    soilless agricultural practices, with a particular focus on technological innovation
    and sustainability. Our selection process prioritized articles that offered an
    all-encompassing view of the policies, technological advancements, and practical
    applications pertinent to soilless culture, especially hydroponics. We focused
    on studies that delved into soilless cultivation methods, emphasizing hydroponics
    and related innovative technologies. Research discussing integrating emerging
    technologies, such as sensors, artificial intelligence, and automation systems,
    was deemed essential to capture the evolving landscape of soilless farming. Sustainability
    and efficiency were at the forefront of our selection criteria. Articles that
    examined the sustainability aspects of soilless systems, including but not limited
    to resource management, energy consumption, and environmental impacts, were considered
    critical for inclusion. Furthermore, we sought out case studies and real-world
    implementations of hydroponic systems that provided empirical data or firsthand
    accounts, thus ensuring that the review was grounded in practical, actionable
    insights. In recognition of the rapid pace of technological advancement in this
    field, we preferred recent publications, particularly those from the last few
    years, to ensure that our review reflected the most current state of the art.
    Our selection process yielded diverse studies that spanned a broad spectrum of
    research areas within soilless agriculture. This included articles that provided
    in-depth policy and economic analyses, explored innovative technologies for enhancing
    plant growth in soilless systems, and discussed resource management strategies
    aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in greenhouse systems. Additionally,
    we included works that explored the concept of smart agriculture, such as the
    use of smart greenhouses and the assessment of solar energy, underscoring a growing
    trend toward precision agriculture and the adoption of renewable energy sources.
    We also addressed the challenges and prospects of adopting climate-smart agricultural
    practices, reflecting on the barriers to adoption and the potential for future
    opportunities. Case studies and practical experiences were also integral to our
    selection, providing valuable insights into the real-world implementation of soilless
    systems. Through this rigorous selection methodology, our review encapsulates
    a wide array of topics within soilless agriculture, offering a nuanced and well-rounded
    understanding of the field that spans from high-level policy analysis to detailed
    technological applications. 2. Hydroponic Systems 2.1. Overview of Hydroponic
    Systems Hydroponic systems are a method of growing plants without soil, extracting
    the necessary nutrients for their growth from a nutrient solution [25]. These
    systems have emerged as a cornerstone technology in soilless vegetable production,
    offering a range of benefits from resource efficiency [20,26] to optimized plant
    growth [27]. One of the critical advantages of hydroponic systems is the ability
    to precisely control nutrient levels, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and oxygenation
    [28], thereby optimizing plant growth and resources. Hydroponic systems are more
    water-efficient than traditional soil-based cultivation, making them an attractive
    option for sustainable agriculture. These systems can be categorized into several
    types, including Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), Deep Water Culture (DWC), and
    Aeroponics, each with unique advantages and applications. NFT, for instance, employs
    a thin film of nutrient solution that flows over the roots, powered by a water
    pump, providing a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen [29,30]. This system
    is particularly effective for leafy greens and herbs, which require less support
    and can thrive in these conditions. On the other hand, DWC submerges the plant
    roots in a nutrient solution, using air stones to oxygenate the water [31]. This
    system is well-suited for plants that require more support and a stable environment,
    such as tomatoes and cucumbers. Aeroponics represents the most technologically
    advanced form of hydroponics, where nutrient solution is misted directly onto
    the roots, maximizing oxygen exposure [27]. This system has shown promise in rapid
    plant growth and resource efficiency but requires more precise control and monitoring
    [27,32]. The main characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of these systems
    are detailed in [30,33]. 2.2. Recent Technological Advancements in Hydroponics
    Recent technological advancements in hydroponics have significantly transformed
    the field, making it more efficient, sustainable, and user-friendly. For instance,
    integrating Internet of Things (IoT) devices allows real-time monitoring and control
    of key environmental variables, such as temperature and nutrient levels, facilitating
    data-driven decision-making [34,35]. In addition, introducing specialized LED
    grow lights has optimized plant growth through targeted light spectrums and reduced
    energy consumption [36]. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms
    are now being employed to analyze data and predict plant growth patterns and potential
    diseases, enabling preventive and more effective interventions [37]. Additionally,
    robotics has been introduced to automate tasks from planting to harvesting, reducing
    labor costs and human error [38]. Advanced water recycling systems have further
    increased the water efficiency of hydroponic setups [39,40], and new software
    platforms enable remote monitoring and control [41,42], ideal for large-scale
    operations and multi-site growers, setting the stage for a more efficient and
    sustainable future in soilless vegetable production. The main advanced technologies
    currently applied in hydroponics, along with their advantages and disadvantages,
    are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of recent technological advancements in
    hydroponics, highlighting their main advantages and disadvantages. As seen in
    Table 1, advantages and disadvantages are observed when incorporating technologies
    in the productive soilless system, which must be taken into account before considering
    implementing hydroponic systems. In terms of the advantages, hydroponic systems
    can be equipped with automation and sensor technology, allowing for remote monitoring
    and control [52]. This enables growers to make real-time adjustments to environmental
    conditions, nutrient delivery, and other parameters [53]. In this sense, the main
    advantages of the incorporation of advanced technologies in hydroponics are related
    to higher efficiency and optimization in the use of resources, being able to precisely
    control the delivery of water, nutrients, and light to plants, minimizing waste,
    and optimizing resource utilization [45,54,55]. In addition to this, hydroponics
    typically uses significantly less water compared to traditional soil-based agriculture
    [56], which can be especially advantageous in regions with water scarcity or drought
    conditions. Additionally, the controlled environment in hydroponics allows for
    accelerated plant growth [28], which means quicker crop turnover and increased
    productivity, providing a stable and controlled environment for plants, resulting
    in consistent product quality and reducing the risk of soil-borne diseases and
    pests. Finally, it is also important to consider that the local climate, market
    demand, and regulatory factors play a role in determining the extent to which
    advanced hydroponic technologies are advantageous for a particular agricultural
    operation. In this sense, when these technologies are well-planned and managed,
    they can provide significant benefits in terms of resource efficiency, product
    quality, and increased yield. Regarding the disadvantages of these technologies,
    several of them are mentioned in Table 1; however, the most common disadvantage
    is related to the high initial investment costs, which in hydroponic systems are
    mainly related to costs that include items such as grow lights, pumps, nutrient
    delivery systems, climate control systems, and specialized growing media [57],
    which are items that allow the construction of an advanced technological production
    system. These costs can vary significantly depending on the scale and complexity
    of the hydroponic setup. For instance, for large-scale hydroponic operations,
    the construction or retrofitting of greenhouses or indoor growing spaces can be
    a substantial expense, influenced by factors such as location, size, and design;
    however, studies such as [58] have tested the incorporation of technologies such
    as the use of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) to reduce operating cost
    and emissions, concluding that the final cost of cultivating lettuce under the
    established experimental conditions was similar to the cost of traditionally imported
    lettuce, which would indicate a high potential in terms of the competitiveness
    of hydroponically grown produce. Another disadvantage of incorporating new technologies
    in hydroponic systems is that they require technical knowledge and expertise to
    operate them [47,59]. This includes cleaning, nutrient replenishment, equipment
    checks, and maintenance costs. Finally, hydroponic systems often rely on artificial
    lighting and climate control, which can lead to high energy bills. These disadvantages
    highlight the need to incorporate cost-effective solutions that aid in lowering
    the final production costs, generating a more competitive final product, and fulfilling
    future needs for increased food production. 2.3. Impact of Hydroponic Systems
    on Soilless Vegetable Production The impact of hydroponic systems on soilless
    vegetable production is transformative, offering a host of benefits but presenting
    specific challenges that merit critical scrutiny. On the positive side, hydroponic
    systems are highly resource-efficient, using less water than traditional soil-based
    farming, which makes them ideal for regions facing water scarcity [60]. They also
    allow for a controlled environment where variables like nutrient levels and pH
    can be precisely managed, leading to optimized plant growth and potentially higher
    yields [61]. Additionally, these systems are particularly beneficial in urban
    settings where space is limited, thanks to their efficient use of space [62],
    especially when combined with vertical farming techniques [63]. Additionally,
    the reduced need for pesticides in these controlled environments contributes to
    healthier produce [45]. 2.4. Scalability and Replicability of Soilless Cultures
    In the current context of global warming, along with the increase in urbanization
    and the reduction in arable land, soilless culture systems need to be expanded
    or scaled up to meet the increasing demand or production needs and to maintain
    consistent plant growth and yield while increasing the number of plants or the
    size of the growing area [64]. Several cases have reported successfully incorporating
    technological advances to optimize plant production under soilless culture systems.
    However, a critical analysis reveals that these success stories may only sometimes
    be universally applicable and could sometimes paint an overly optimistic picture
    of the technology, given that some of these studies may have been conducted under
    controlled conditions or with significant financial backing, making it unclear
    how scalable or replicable these successes are for average farmers. In addition
    to this, focusing on success stories may overshadow the challenges and failures,
    which are equally important for understanding the limitations of hydroponic systems;
    therefore, while case studies and success stories offer invaluable insights into
    the capabilities of hydroponic systems, a more nuanced and critical approach is
    needed to understand their broader impact, limitations, and the conditions under
    which they can be successfully implemented. Nevertheless, recent studies where
    different factors involved in soilless production are assessed become relevant
    to generate a big picture regarding the future of this field. In this sense, considering
    that soilless production can be limited by factors such as the availability of
    resources such as water, nutrients, and energy, as well as the cost and complexity
    of the system [64], several studies have reported the incorporation and analysis
    of technological advances in hydroponic systems over different crops and over
    different conditions, to overcome the limitations. Such is the case of [65], who
    carried out a study to assess the effects of different nutrient solutions on the
    growth and weight of two lettuce cultivars grown in a floating hydroponic system,
    indicating that hydroponic production can be a cost-effective and easy option
    for organic vegetable production if the nutrient solution is managed according
    to the needs of the crop. In another case, ref. [66] compared an aquaponic system,
    incorporating three different hydroponic systems to assess their effect on tomato
    yield and morphological and biochemical impact quality, indicating that the choice
    of the system had little effect over those properties; however, the system that
    incorporated drip irrigation presented slightly better results in terms of higher
    oxygen radical absorbance capacity, indicating the possibility of producing fruit
    with a higher health value. A study by [42] analyzed the response of kale to liquid
    inorganic nutrients and different planting media in a DWC hydroponic system, indicating
    a high effect on chlorophyll content and yield when using specific combinations
    of planting media and liquid inorganic nutrients. In another study on kale, ref.
    [67] analyzed the effect of different nutrient solution depths on the growth and
    phytochemicals accumulation in this hydroponic-grown vegetable to assess the issue
    of low dissolved oxygen in a nutrient solution, indicating that there was a positive
    effect on kale growth when nutrient solution depth increased, where a 2-cm deep
    nutrient solution could promote kale growth, and 3-cm could have the potential
    of improving kale quality. 3. Substrate-Based Systems 3.1. Introduction to Substrate-Based
    Systems In the context of soilless vegetable production, substrate-based systems
    offer an alternative to hydroponic methods, providing a unique set of advantages
    and challenges critical to understanding the advancement of the field. Unlike
    hydroponics, which relies solely on nutrient-rich water solutions, substrate-based
    systems use inert media such as coconut coir, perlite, or rock wool to support
    plant roots [64]. These substrates serve as a reservoir for nutrients and water,
    allowing for less intensive management practices than hydroponics. This section
    introduces the fundamental aspects of substrate-based systems, including the types
    of substrates commonly used, their benefits, and the innovations shaping this
    method of soilless cultivation. As next-generation technologies evolve, substrate-based
    systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, incorporating automation, real-time
    monitoring, and data analytics to optimize crop yield and resource utilization.
    Therefore, understanding the intricacies of substrate-based systems is essential
    for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers who are invested in the future
    of sustainable and efficient soilless vegetable production. 3.2. Substrate Materials
    and Their Benefits In the rapidly evolving field of soilless vegetable production,
    the correct selection of substrate materials is a critical development that offers
    promising benefits but also presents challenges that require thoughtful analysis.
    On the positive side, newer substrates, such as biochar, are sustainable and provide
    superior nutrient retention capabilities, allowing for more efficient fertilizer
    use and reducing the environmental impact of nutrient leaching [68,69,70,71].
    The advent of composite substrates, which combine different materials to optimize
    physical and chemical properties, adds another layer of versatility, offering
    tailored solutions for specific crop needs. However, these benefits often come
    at a cost—both literally and figuratively. Advanced substrates are generally more
    expensive than traditional options [45], making them less accessible for small-scale
    farmers. In addition, the availability of these new materials can be limited,
    especially in certain regions, which hampers their widespread adoption. Using
    new substrate materials also necessitates a learning curve, requiring adjustments
    in cultivation practices and additional expertise for optimal results. Moreover,
    while many of these substrates are promoted as sustainable options, the environmental
    impact of their production processes, including potential energy-intensive manufacturing
    and transportation emissions, should be considered [72]. An overview of some of
    the substrate materials in soilless agriculture is shown in Table 2. Table 2.
    Overview of Substrate Materials in Soilless Agriculture, Highlighting Their Main
    Advantages and Disadvantages. Considering those above, it is important to highlight
    that, in the field of soilless vegetable production, substrate-based systems have
    evolved to include various materials and technologies, each with its own set of
    advantages and drawbacks that warrant a comprehensive comparative analysis. As
    was discussed, newer substrates such as coconut coir and biochar offer superior
    water and nutrient retention capabilities and environmental benefits such as biodegradability;
    however, these materials can be more expensive and require specialized management
    techniques [45]. Technological advancements have also led to the development of
    systems combining multiple substrate benefits, offering tailored solutions for
    specific crop needs [64]. Furthermore, the choice of substrate can have implications
    for the system’s environmental impact in terms of resource use and potential for
    waste generation. In this sense, while there is no one-size-fits-all solution,
    the choice of substrate and associated technologies in substrate-based systems
    should be guided by various factors, including cost, management complexity, crop-specific
    needs, and environmental impact. 3.3. Innovations in Substrate-Based Cultivation
    Techniques In soilless vegetable production, innovations in substrate-based cultivation
    techniques fundamentally alter the landscape, offering many advantages but presenting
    several challenges that require in-depth analysis. Automated nutrient delivery
    systems, for instance, are a game-changer, given that these systems are designed
    to directly provide precise amounts of nutrients to the substrate, thereby eliminating
    the guesswork and manual labor traditionally associated with fertilization [80].
    The result is improved plant health and the potential for significantly increased
    yields, making this innovation particularly beneficial for commercial-scale operations
    [81]. Real-time monitoring technologies, often facilitated by advanced sensors
    embedded directly into the substrate, are another groundbreaking development.
    These sensors can measure various parameters, such as moisture levels, nutrient
    concentrations, and substrate pH, sending these data to a centralized system [41],
    meaning that growers can make immediate, data-driven adjustments to their cultivation
    practices, optimizing resource utilization. This is a monumental step forward
    in terms of both sustainability and operational efficiency. However, the energy
    requirements for running these automated and monitoring systems should be noted.
    While they may optimize water and nutrient use, they also require a continuous
    power supply, which could increase the operation’s carbon footprint if the energy
    is sourced from non-renewable resources [82,83]. 4. Automation and Precision Farming
    4.1. Role of Automation in Soilless Vegetable Production Automation is increasingly
    becoming a focal point in soilless vegetable production, offering transformative
    benefits but posing challenges that require critical evaluation. Automation technologies,
    such as automated nutrient delivery systems [80], climate control [16], and robotic
    harvesting [84], can revolutionize the industry by increasing efficiency, reducing
    labor costs, and enhancing crop productivity. These systems allow for precise
    control over various environmental factors, from nutrient levels to humidity and
    temperature, enabling optimized growing conditions that lead to higher-quality
    produce. The data-driven nature of these technologies also provides valuable insights
    into crop performance, allowing for timely interventions and more effective resource
    management. The application of automation technologies into soilless vegetable
    production has been observed in studies such as [85], which aimed to identify
    the optimal irrigation level in a microgreen production based on the use of a
    dielectric moisture sensor to generate a low-cost automated irrigation system,
    contributing to the automation of precision irrigation in hydroponically grown
    microgreens. In a similar study carried out by [86], a system for wireless irrigation
    management was developed and tested on soilless basil, concluding that employing
    a wireless sensor network to monitor substrate water conditions in real-time,
    along with detailed insights into how varying water availability impacts plants,
    proves to be a valuable resource for optimizing precision irrigation in soilless
    basil cultivation in greenhouses. A study conducted by [87] on an automated system
    for fertigation control in soilless tomatoes growing in a sand substrate under
    greenhouse conditions concluded that the developed control system could effectively
    adjust fertigation cycle frequency according to plant transpiration, reducing
    unnecessary applications under varying climatic conditions. Based on the above,
    it should be noted that while automation holds great promise for improving efficiency
    and productivity in soilless vegetable production, it also introduces financial
    and technical challenges that need to be carefully considered for responsible
    and long-lasting adoption. 4.2. Application of Precision Farming/Agriculture Techniques
    in Hydroponics In soilless vegetable production, applying precision farming or
    precision agriculture techniques to hydroponics and substrate-based systems is
    an emerging trend with far-reaching implications, given that precision agriculture
    is a tool able to generate an increase in production and quality, reducing the
    use of resources and its environmental impact [88]. These techniques, which leverage
    advanced sensors, data analytics, and automation, promise to optimize every aspect
    of the growing process, from nutrient delivery to environmental control. In hydroponic
    systems, for example, precision farming can lead to more efficient nutrient utilization,
    reducing waste and potentially lowering the environmental impact. Similarly, real-time
    monitoring can help fine-tune irrigation schedules and nutrient levels in substrate-based
    systems, thereby conserving resources and improving yield [89]. Several researchers
    have reported the use of precision farming applied to hydroponics. For instance,
    a study carried out by [47] developed a monitoring and controlling system for
    precision farming based on the IoT concept and fuzzy logic for the monitoring
    of water and nutrient needs of lettuce and bok choi, indicating that this monitoring
    system allowed assessing the needs of the crop in real-time, which translated
    into larger leaves for both crops. In another case, ref. [90] proposed an automatic
    management system on a tropical hydroponic system, focusing on reducing information
    exchange between sensors, obtaining a simpler system in data obtention and analysis,
    and aiding in managing hydroponic crops. In a study carried out by [91] on a greenhouse
    with hydroponic crops, a low-cost sensor based on IoT to develop control processes
    for precision agriculture was developed, resulting in a series of benefits related
    to cost, energy saving, smart development, and most importantly, an increase in
    acceptance by producers. Studying hydroponic saffron cultivation, ref. [46] proposes
    a novel approach to sensor selection, aiming to optimize crop cultivation in an
    artificial environment using technology, specifically IoT and sensors, creating
    an automated and controlled cultivation system. Given the above, it can be noted
    that implementing automation and precision farming techniques in soilless vegetable
    production presents a complex interplay of benefits and challenges that warrant
    a nuanced analysis. On the benefit side, automation and precision farming offer
    unparalleled advantages in terms of operational efficiency, resource optimization,
    and yield improvement. Automated systems can handle exact tasks like nutrient
    delivery and climate control, reducing human error and freeing up labor for other
    jobs. With its data-driven approach, precision farming allows for real-time adjustments
    to various growth parameters, leading to more efficient use of resources, such
    as water and fertilizers. This can increase yield and make the production system
    more sustainable by minimizing waste and environmental impact. However, these
    advantages come with challenges that must be addressed. As mentioned before, the
    initial cost of implementing these advanced technologies and energy consumption
    can be significant, posing a financial barrier for small-scale farmers. This raises
    concerns about the extent of these benefits across the agricultural sector. These
    concerns need to be addressed properly and in a timely manner to fulfill the current
    need for an increase in food production in the context of a reduction in the cultivable
    surface and under the scenario of severe climate change. 4.3. Prospects and Trends
    in Automated Soilless Crop Systems In the field of soilless vegetable production,
    the prospects and trends in automated systems are both promising and fraught with
    complexities that demand critical scrutiny. On the optimistic side, advancements
    in the era of Agriculture 4.0 have been accompanied by technologies such as IoT
    artificial intelligence, data analytics, and big data, among others, which can
    generate tools that, in the end, can address issues such as food safety, data
    analysis, and improved crop management [92]. These technologies will likely make
    soilless systems more efficient, scalable, and even self-adaptive, adjusting to
    environmental variables in real time for optimized crop yields. Integrating IoT
    devices could further streamline operations, allowing for remote monitoring and
    control, which is particularly beneficial for large-scale commercial setups. Sustainability
    is another area where automation could make significant strides, especially with
    the development of energy-efficient systems and closed-loop nutrient recycling
    processes. These technological advancements have transformed traditional farming
    methods into automated systems, introducing a new era of agricultural innovation
    driven by the IoT and fundamentally altering how farming is conducted today [93].
    In this sense, while the future of automated soilless crop systems holds immense
    promise for transforming the industry in terms of efficiency, scalability, and
    sustainability, the adoption of these systems should be done in a way that is
    responsible, considering the social and environmental impacts of the system [15].
    5. Sensing and Monitoring Technologies 5.1. Importance of Sensing and Monitoring
    in Soilless Vegetable Production In the evolving landscape of soilless vegetable
    production, the importance of sensing and monitoring technologies cannot be overstated,
    yet they come with complexities that merit a critical examination. Sensing and
    monitoring technologies, such as soil moisture sensors, nutrient level detectors,
    and environmental sensors, are the backbone of data-driven agriculture [94,95,96].
    They provide real-time insights into various growth parameters, enabling timely
    interventions that significantly improve crop yields and resource efficiency.
    For instance, soil moisture sensors can help optimize irrigation schedules, reducing
    water consumption. In this sense, ref. [93] developed a cost-effective control
    system for the optimization of soilless crop irrigation through a prototype of
    an intelligent gravimetric tray that records the irrigation and drainage volumes
    and drainage pH and electrical conductivity (EC), as well as the temperature,
    EC, and humidity of the substrate. Regarding nutrient content, ref. [97] determined
    the nutrient content of hydroponically cultivated microgreens with a novel immersible
    silicon photonic sensor to determine the optimal harvest time. These technologies
    are particularly crucial in soilless systems, where the margin for error is often
    smaller than in traditional soil-based agriculture. However, implementing these
    advanced sensing and monitoring systems is not without challenges. The initial
    cost of these technologies can be a significant barrier for small-scale farmers,
    and the data collected by these sensors often require sophisticated analysis,
    necessitating a level of resources and expertise that some farmers may not possess
    [98,99]. Ref. [99] found that one of the barriers to the adoption of agricultural
    innovations by farmers is the level of learning investment, initial investment
    cost, and additional labor required when adopting a farm innovation, but also
    found that smallholder farmers continuously adapt to changing circumstances that
    affect their farming businesses. Age, gender, education level, years of farming,
    and involvement in off-farm activities are influencing forces on the adoption
    of new technologies. These factors could limit or boost the adoption of these
    beneficial technologies. 5.2. Advances in Sensor Technologies for Nutrient Management
    and Environmental Control In the domain of soilless vegetable production, advances
    in sensor technologies for nutrient management and environmental control are increasingly
    becoming pivotal, yet they introduce a set of intricate challenges that necessitate
    a thorough critical analysis. Cutting-edge sensors now offer unprecedented accuracy
    in measuring nutrient concentrations, pH levels, and environmental factors such
    as temperature, moisture, and humidity [100]. This level of precision is a game-changer
    for soilless systems, where optimal nutrient and environmental conditions are
    crucial for maximizing yield and quality. For instance, nutrient sensors can automatically
    adjust the composition of nutrient solutions in real-time, ensuring that plants
    receive exactly what they need for optimal growth. Ref. [101] developed an automatic
    system capable of performing water delivery automatically when the water level
    is less than a minimum predefined level and adding the nutrients automatically
    when the nutrient solution concentration is below 800 ppm, using a GP2Y0A21 proximity
    sensor as a water level detector and a TDS sensor as a detector of electrical
    conductivity of the nutrient solution. In this system, a servo motor turns on
    a valve in the nutrient container. To improve macronutrient detection for more
    efficient management of nutrients in crops growing in a closed hydroponic system,
    ref. [102] developed a system based on small, portable ion-selective electrode
    (ISE) sensors, which can directly measure the analyte with a wide range of sensitivity.
    The great benefit of this system is that it would allow the automatic sensing
    of nutrients in greenhouse hydroponics. Environmental sensors can similarly adjust
    climate control systems to maintain ideal growing conditions. These advancements
    significantly reduce the margin for human error and can lead to more sustainable
    practices by minimizing waste of resources such as water and fertilizers. For
    example, a researcher from Indonesia [103] built a simple micro-climate control
    system to control the temperature and humidity in a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse
    by implementing a fuzzy logic controller based on pre-defined thresholds. Similarly,
    ref. [104] presented an effective method that monitors and controls environmental
    parameters using sensors and actuators for tunnel farming and hydroponics, resulting
    in increased crop yield and water savings. A more comprehensive approach was taken
    by Chinese researchers [105], who developed an environment monitoring system for
    hydroponics and aquaculture applications. The system employed multiple sensors,
    including dissolved oxygen and water temperature, outdoor meteorological parameters,
    soil temperature and humidity, indoor temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide
    concentrations, and humidity of hydroponic plant leaves. The data from these sensors
    are then transmitted to the cloud, processed, and displayed to the user through
    a web platform and a mobile application to support hydroponic and aquaculture
    production management. Another benefit of using sensors was proposed by [106]
    to estimate the condition of hydroponic tomato plants in real-time; they developed
    an environmental control system with wireless sensors that supply the appropriate
    amount of hydroponic liquid for the tomatoes based on evapotranspiration, with
    errors of less than 3%. 5.3. Real-Time Monitoring Systems for Optimizing Crop
    Growth and Resource Utilization In the specialized field of soilless vegetable
    production, the advent of real-time monitoring systems for optimizing crop growth
    and resource utilization marks a significant leap forward, but it also brings
    forth a set of multifaceted challenges that require critical evaluation, considering,
    for example, that hydroponics necessitates more monitoring and micromanagement
    than traditional plant cultivation. Real-time monitoring systems, which often
    integrate various types of sensors and data analytics platforms, provide immediate
    feedback on a range of critical parameters such as plant development status, nutrient
    levels, moisture content, and environmental conditions [107]. This immediacy allows
    for dynamic adjustments that significantly improve yield and resource efficiency.
    With the aim to improve and automate the irrigation process of lettuce grown in
    a hydroponic system, ref. [108] proposed a real-time monitoring system that considers
    the use of IoT technology for sensing important factors of the nutrient solution,
    such as pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), temperature, and humidity. An application
    was developed that notifies the user of the abovementioned parameters and initiates
    irrigation automatically through a click on the app. A different approach was
    taken by [109], where the application of computer vision in a smart system for
    real-time monitoring, quality control, and condition assessment of romaine lettuce
    grown in aquaponic was researched. The proposed system uses image-processing techniques,
    image segmentation, deep learning, and regression analysis to estimate the size
    of the crops (growth rate) and then correlate it with their fresh weight, with
    the aim of using it in real scenarios to promote autonomous farms. In nutrient
    film technique (NFT), two key parameters that affect plant growth are pH and EC.
    To maintain these parameters within a set range, ref. [110] implemented a real-time
    fuzzy logic control for an NFT-based hydroponic system using an IoT environment
    composed of a wireless sensor network, data logger, and machine-to-machine actuators
    (pumps). With this system, they were able to stabilize the pH and EC values in
    less than 15 min. Table 3 summarizes different real-time monitoring systems, their
    advantages, and disadvantages in the smart farming agriculture field. The yield
    and success of a crop depend on the parameters measured by these sensors for the
    continuous monitoring of environmental conditions and the automation of various
    aspects of farming operations [111]. The advantage of this approach is that sensors
    are lightweight, suitable to be deployed in harsh conditions, and have improved
    accuracy, removing or reducing the risk of human error inherent to manual data
    capturing and allowing real-time monitoring and remote access when integrated
    into network gateways. These systems can contribute to increased plant growth
    [112,113,114], reduce water consumption [115,116], improve environmental and agricultural
    parameters [117,118,119,120,121], reduce manpower [122], allow remote monitoring
    [123,124,125,126], and function as an early warning system [127]. Additionally,
    IoT devices can allow increased automation of operations. However, real-time monitoring
    requires wireless connectivity because IoT devices are the building blocks of
    wireless sensor networks (WSN), which is not always available in farms or rural
    areas. Another significant limitation to the adoption of these systems is cost,
    which often prevents its adoption by small farmers, who have increasingly smaller
    profit margins, and also by larger farms, as the scalability of systems is not
    fully explored. The high cost is related to the degree of customization required
    for installation, research and development, updates and maintenance, and costs
    associated with data transmission. There are other technical considerations, such
    as the power source. In many cases, there is no access to constant power; therefore,
    systems depend on batteries and solar panels for their operation, so consumption
    and energy conservation becomes an important limitation. Multiple sensors produce
    huge amounts of data that require storage (locally or cloud-based) and computing
    power to be analyzed. This, associated with the lesser technical expertise of
    farmers, becomes a major setback to IoT-based monitoring [128,129]. Table 3. Overview
    of Real-Time Monitoring Systems for Optimizing Crop Growth and Resource Utilization,
    Highlighting Their Advantages and Disadvantages. 5.4. Case Studies Demonstrating
    the Effectiveness of Sensing and Monitoring Technologies In soilless vegetable
    production, real-time monitoring systems and sensor technologies have shown promise
    in optimizing yield and resource utilization, as evidenced by various case studies.
    Countless systems that rely on different monitoring sensors, such as for water
    level, pH, air humidity, air temperature, light intensity, CO2 concentration,
    soil moisture and temperature, and EC, among others, to then apply a smart decision
    workflow to control actuators, pumps, fans, lights, and other equipment with different
    levels of automation have been proposed and developed by several authors [143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155].
    However, while case studies often highlight significant improvements in yield
    and efficiency, they are usually conducted in controlled or well-funded environments,
    casting doubt on their generalizability to smaller operations. Additionally, these
    studies often focus solely on positive outcomes, neglecting to address challenges
    such as technical difficulties, ongoing operational costs, and data security risks.
    In this regard, the adoption of smart sensing and monitoring technologies is accompanied
    by security issues that can compromise farming operations, data integrity, and
    privacy. Small vulnerabilities can become cybersecurity threats, considering that
    smart farms are very interconnected systems and farmers have limited awareness
    of the risks associated with smart agriculture systems [156]; if someone exploits
    those vulnerabilities, it can create the potential to disrupt the economies of
    countries. These attacks can be at the data level (leakage of confidential data,
    insertion of false data, misconfiguration), at the network and equipment level
    (radio frequency jamming or signal disruption, malware injection, denial of service
    (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DdoS), Botnet or central malicious system,
    data transit attacks, autonomous system hijacking, node capture), at the chain
    level of supplies (third party attacks, software update attacks, data fabrication),
    or other types of attacks (unauthorized access, cloud computing attacks) [157,158].
    Another aspect is the energy requirements for these systems; if sourced from non-renewable
    resources, this could negate some of the sustainability benefits. Therefore, while
    real-time monitoring and sensing technologies offer groundbreaking opportunities
    for soilless vegetable production, their cost, technical expertise, data security,
    and sustainability limitations must be critically examined when implementing a
    new farm project for a more comprehensive understanding of their long-term viability
    and adoption. 6. Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics 6.1. Clarifying AI
    Applications in Soilless Agriculture: Beyond Predictive Analytics The advent of
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Analytics has revolutionized many industries,
    with agriculture being no exception. Integrating these technologies into soilless
    crop systems has opened a new frontier for innovation and efficiency. This section
    delves into the multifaceted role of AI in these systems, distinguishing between
    predictive algorithms and machine learning techniques and exploring their unique
    contributions to soilless agriculture. Predictive algorithms have long been employed
    to forecast various aspects of crop management, from nutrient requirements to
    yield estimation. These algorithms, which can be as straightforward as linear
    regression models or as complex as non-linear time-series analyses, serve as the
    backbone for decision-making processes. They are particularly valuable in soilless
    crop systems where precision and control are paramount. Machine learning, a dynamic
    subset of AI, extends beyond predictive capabilities to include classification,
    clustering, and reinforcement learning. In the controlled environments of soilless
    agriculture, machine learning algorithms leverage large datasets to uncover patterns
    and insights imperceptible to the human eye or traditional methods. For instance,
    neural networks may be utilized to predict plant stress levels, while support
    vector machines could classify the health of plants based on spectral data. However,
    it is essential to recognize that not all predictive algorithms in soilless crop
    systems employ machine-learning techniques. Various statistical methods and mathematical
    models rely on predefined rules and equations, offering a different approach to
    prediction. These non-ML predictive algorithms are crucial in scenarios where
    transparency and interpretability are necessary or data may be too scarce or noisy
    for complex machine-learning models. Furthermore, the application of computer
    vision techniques extends into the realms of robotics and cybernetics, which are
    increasingly becoming intertwined with AI in modern agriculture. In soilless farming,
    computer vision is not only used for static image analysis but is also integrated
    into robotic systems for dynamic tasks such as automated harvesting or real-time
    growth monitoring. As we continue exploring AI’s capabilities and applications
    in soilless crop systems, it is imperative to establish a clear understanding
    of the various technologies at play. This section aims to clarify by dissecting
    the roles and responsibilities of different AI applications and setting the stage
    for future innovations that will further enhance the precision and productivity
    of soilless agriculture. 6.2. Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Soilless
    Crop Systems Artificial Intelligence (AI), referred to as the simulation of human
    intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that typically require
    human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making,
    and language translation, could revolutionize soilless crop systems by automating
    complex decision-making processes [159], optimizing resource allocation, and even
    predicting future growth patterns. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of sensor
    data to make real-time adjustments to nutrient levels, irrigation schedules, and
    environmental controls, maximizing yield and minimizing resource loss [160,161].
    Table 4 summarizes the main advantages and disadvantages of AI applications over
    soilless systems. Table 4. Overview of the Integration of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) in Soilless Crop Systems, Highlighting Their Advantages, Disadvantages, and
    Key Use-Cases. According to a great number of articles and applications of artificial
    intelligence in agriculture in general and in soilless systems in particular,
    the main benefits of this technology include increased efficiency, improved crop
    quality, reduced labor costs, better decision-making, and more sustainable practices
    [189]. The optimization of crop yields by efficiently managing factors such as
    water, fertilizer, and pest control is one of the main advantages of AI in soilless
    agriculture. This optimization leads to higher returns on investment for farmers.
    AI enables more precise control over irrigation and soil fertilizer application,
    resulting in higher resource use efficiency. For example, ref. [164] evaluated
    the performances of four bio-inspired algorithm-optimized extreme learning machine
    (ELM) models for predicting daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) across China
    and demonstrated that the values predicted by all ELM models agreed well with
    the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith values. This means that farmers can achieve higher
    yields with the same resources or maintain yields by lowering resource use, contributing
    to sustainable agricultural practices. Another benefit of AI is the reduction
    in pests and diseases by enabling early detection and diagnosis through image
    signal processing techniques [190]. This early diagnosis, such as identifying
    powdery mildew, allows for timely intervention and reduces the impact of pests
    and diseases on crops. Energy use is a key factor in modern agriculture, and AI
    can contribute to efficient management between smart greenhouses and soilless
    systems, allowing cost savings and improving sustainability. This involves the
    integration of various technologies, such as bio-inspired algorithms, automation,
    and dynamic pricing based on real-time metrics. Regarding automation, robotic
    systems driven by AI are being utilized for various tasks, including irrigation,
    harvesting, counting, and other mechanical farming processes. This automation
    not only improves efficiency but also reduces the labor intensity of farming operations.
    Additionally, AI-powered robot platforms can perform unsafe tasks such as toxic
    pesticide application and UV-C treatments to impede the spread of powdery mildew
    [191,192,193]. Taking into consideration the above, AI technologies, including
    bio-inspired algorithms and machine learning, enable precision agriculture. This
    precision ensures the accurate and targeted application of resources, minimizing
    waste and maximizing productivity. This leads to enhanced agricultural sustainability.
    By addressing challenges such as resource optimization, pest control, and energy
    efficiency, AI contributes to environmentally friendly and economically viable
    farming practices. AI is no longer just a research topic, as commercially viable
    AI technologies for agriculture are starting to appear [194]. This suggests ongoing
    advancements in the field, providing farmers with access to more sophisticated
    and effective tools for improving their farming practices. However, this promising
    frontier also presents several challenges that require critical consideration.
    One of the main constraints of AI implementation is cost, one reason being the
    expensive sensors (up to USD 1000+) [195], considering that in many instances,
    multiple sensors, cameras (RGB, thermal, multispectral), and other hardware are
    required, and for automation, actuators, fans, heathers, lightning, dehumidifiers,
    and motors are required. As was stated by [196] the cost of installation of AI
    systems on farms was enormous and out of reach for smallholder farmers. In contrast,
    larger farms can take the risk of absorbing this higher cost and are more willing
    to invest [197]. To implement these technologies, technical expertise is needed,
    as it can be complex and require specialized knowledge to implement and maintain,
    requiring greater computational resources. This can be a challenge for growers
    who are not familiar with the technology or who lack technical expertise. That
    is the situation in Europe, where the aging population and shortage of young progressive
    farmers raise concerns about technology adoption [198], considering that it is
    well-known that less educated and older farmers are less inclined to adopt precision
    farming technologies [197]. There are also obstacles to transferring this technology
    to developing countries due to farm size, less connectivity, reduced infrastructure,
    and economic issues, among others. Concerning predictive models, ref. [199] indicated
    that the absence of appropriate historical data poses a significant obstacle to
    the integration of AI systems in agriculture, which is necessary for accurate
    predictions and the training of AI and ML systems. Moreover, studies have suggested
    that the creation of algorithms for assessing greenhouse parameters should be
    calibrated with local conditions and specific requirements [200]. 6.3. AI-Based
    Decision Support Systems (DSS) for Optimizing Cultivation Parameters Using AI-based
    decision support systems (DSS) in soilless crop systems offers a transformative
    approach to optimizing cultivation parameters such as nutrient levels, irrigation
    timing, and environmental conditions. These systems can analyze large datasets,
    identify patterns, and make predictive recommendations, enhancing yield and resource
    efficiency [201,202,203]. AI has played a pivotal role in transforming agriculture
    and protecting it from various threats, such as weather, population growth, labor
    issues, and food security concerns. The numerous applications of AI in agriculture,
    including tasks like irrigation, weeding, and spraying, are often implemented
    through sensors in robots and drones. These technologies help conserve water,
    reduce pesticide and herbicide use, preserve soil fertility, and optimize labor,
    leading to increased agricultural output and improved quality [204]. In this regard,
    ref. [205] presented the development and implementation of a smart agriculture
    IoT system based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The system integrates advanced
    information technologies, including AI and cloud computing, with agricultural
    production to increase food production while reducing the consumption of resources.
    The AI model technique used in the cloud layer is DRL, which makes immediate,
    intelligent decisions, such as determining the water needed for irrigation to
    enhance crop growth. In an innovative way, the research by [206] discusses the
    results of an international competition focused on autonomous greenhouses that
    combined horticultural expertise with AI to improve fresh food production with
    fewer resources. Teams applied various AI algorithms, ranging from supervised
    and unsupervised learning to reinforcement machine learning, to control the greenhouse
    environment remotely. The use of AI demonstrated the potential to outperform traditional
    manual growing methods. To further optimize the operation of AI technologies for
    agriculture, ref. [207] proposed a novel approach using AI-based soft sensors
    combined with remote sensing models utilizing deep learning architectures. The
    study involves preprocessing techniques to clean missing data and remove noise
    from agricultural land images, with subsequent feature representation and classification
    processes demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and
    accuracy in agricultural applications. Building upon these foundations and discussing
    the diversity of AI-based DSS and their specific applications in soilless crop
    systems is crucial. AI-based DSS vary significantly in complexity and function,
    from simple regression models to sophisticated deep learning algorithms capable
    of strategic planning and real-time adaptive management. For example, while some
    DSS may employ traditional statistical methods for short-term forecasting, others
    leverage complex neural networks for comprehensive analysis and long-term planning.
    These systems are tailored to the unique needs of soilless operations, considering
    factors like production scale, crop types, and automation levels. Moreover, integrating
    AI-based DSS in soilless agriculture goes beyond mere data analysis; it encompasses
    the entire decision-making process, from data collection and preprocessing to
    action implementation. This holistic approach ensures that every soilless farming
    operation is optimized for efficiency and sustainability. In conclusion, AI-based
    DSS are indispensable in soilless crop systems, providing a level of analysis
    and foresight that is unparalleled. These systems not only contribute to more
    sustainable and productive farming practices but also represent a significant
    advancement in the field of precision agriculture. Our discussion aims to clearly
    understand the diverse and powerful AI techniques that drive decision-making in
    soilless agriculture, addressing the specific needs and challenges of this innovative
    farming approach [208]. 6.4. Potential Challenges and Ethical Considerations in
    AI-Driven Cultivation However, some related aspects must be considered when analyzing
    this technological advancement. First, the effectiveness of AI-based decision
    support systems depends on the quality and quantity of data they are trained on.
    The potential for algorithmic bias also exists, especially if the data used to
    train these systems do not represent diverse growing conditions and crop types.
    Poorly trained systems can lead to incorrect recommendations, potentially harming
    crop yield and wasting resources [209,210,211]. Second, the technical complexity
    of AI systems often requires specialized expertise to set up, operate, and interpret,
    creating a knowledge barrier for some farmers [212]. Third, the ethical issue
    regarding the use of AI in agricultural production has gained great interest over
    the past few years, which can be related to concerns about issues derived from
    inadequate design and setup of intelligent systems, which could lead to negative
    outcomes in agricultural production, such as violations of farmers’ privacy and
    harm to animal welfare due to the incorporation of robotic technologies, among
    others [213,214,215]. In this sense, the increased reliance on digital technology
    introduces new vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to cyberattacks, including
    data breaches and unauthorized system manipulation, that could compromise the
    data and have severe consequences for individual farmers and the broader food
    supply [216,217,218]. Therefore, while AI-based decision support systems hold
    immense promise for optimizing cultivation parameters in soilless agriculture,
    they also present challenges related to cost, data quality, expertise, and security
    that must be critically evaluated. 7. Environmental Sustainability and Resource
    Management 7.1. Role of Next-Generation Technologies in Enhancing Sustainability
    Next-generation technologies, including AI, real-time monitoring systems, precision
    agriculture, and predictive analytics, as detailed in Table 5, promise to enhance
    sustainability in soilless vegetable production. These technologies can optimize
    resource and energy use, reduce waste, and improve yield, contributing to economic
    and environmental sustainability [219]. For example, new applications of existing
    technologies, such as AI and mathematical models, have been successfully applied
    to predict energy consumption in agricultural applications, facilitating the evaluation
    of each production component and reducing CO2 emissions [220]. Additionally, real-time
    monitoring can facilitate precise irrigation and nutrient delivery, minimizing
    water and fertilizer use, such as in [221], where they developed an irrigation
    control system for soilless culture based on a proportional integral derivative
    (PID) algorithm that allows fully automatic operation with a minimum set of variables,
    calculating the average daily leaching fractions reasonably well, to reduce the
    cost. In [222], a review of IoT implementations for real-time monitoring, control,
    and management in aquaponics (a closed-loop soilless farming method) is presented.
    The importance of monitoring water variables is highlighted, such as water level,
    temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrification, nitrites, electrical
    conductivity, total dissolved solids, salinity, and water hardness, and environmental
    variables, such as light intensity, relative humidity, air temperature, media
    moisture, and CO2. In addition, the study discusses wireless monitoring with the
    integration of sensors and communication technologies and the implementation of
    machine learning techniques. A key point to precise irrigation in this closed
    system is the estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc). In this regard, ref.
    [223] generated artificial neural networks (ANN), utilizing climate data from
    sensors (air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation) and calculated
    inputs (crop coefficient and net radiation) and inputs from time and space (day
    of year, days after planting, and extraterrestrial radiation), to create models
    for ETc estimation for tomato (cv. Duru) plants grown in two substrates (perlite
    and coco fiber) in an unheated plastic greenhouse. When the models generated were
    compared to traditional methodologies, such as FAO Penman–Monteith (PM) and Hargreaves
    (HG) equations, it was found that even with limited data, ANN models predicted
    ETc better than classic equations, requiring only temperature and humidity sensors.
    This is because, in certain climatic conditions, PM and HG equations can overestimate
    or underestimate ETc, as has been evidenced by several authors [224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233].
    Searching for similar results, ref. [234] followed a dynamic Bayesian approach
    to modeling crop coefficient (Kr) and predicting crop ET for greenhouse sweet
    basil grown in a soilless substrate, using input data from sensors measuring temperature,
    global radiation, and crop weight connected to a lightweight IoT client operating
    in real-time. The results showed that the Kr approach predicts crop evapotranspiration
    with much higher accuracy than the Baille-based ET (a simplified version of the
    PM equation proposed by [235] for greenhouses) approach. Table 5. Overview of
    the Role of Next-Generation Technologies in Enhancing Sustainability.            However,
    there are also potential limitations that need to be addressed in the context
    of soilless farming. A recurring problem with these technologies is the high initial
    cost of implementation [257,258]. Additionally, accessibility to these technologies
    in rural areas may pose challenges because communication infrastructure (cellular
    connectivity, internet) is not always available [259]. When these technologies
    are implemented in real operating environments, their integration can be complex
    because interoperability is not well established, mainly because an area is still
    in development with much research being conducted in parallel. Therefore, ensuring
    seamless integration and interoperability among these technologies is crucial
    for their effective functioning [260,261]. The energy consumption of platforms
    where AI, machine learning, and communications technologies operate can be a limitation,
    especially in remote or off-grid farming locations [262]. This can impact the
    sustainability of smart farming systems, particularly when considering renewable
    energy sources. Additionally, renewable energy sources suffer from intermittency.
    For example, solar power generation is affected by factors such as time of day,
    weather conditions, and seasonal changes, so energy storage technologies, such
    as batteries, are a necessity [263]. AI and machine learning models depend heavily
    on data quality; hence, inaccurate or low-quality data can lead to incorrect decisions
    and recommendations in smart farming systems [209,264]. These data-intensive systems
    are susceptible to security breaches and privacy concerns among farmers [265],
    as was discussed previously. Solutions include ensuring diverse and high-quality
    datasets, developing explainable AI models, investing in secure communication
    protocols, addressing intermittency with energy storage, and investing in research
    to make this technology more available. Additionally, there is a need for government
    support, subsidies, and education programs to make these technologies more accessible
    to farmers, promoting widespread adoption in the agricultural sector [266]. 7.2.
    Efficient Water and Nutrient Management Strategies Efficient water and nutrient
    management strategies are pivotal in soilless vegetable production, offering the
    dual benefits of resource conservation and improved crop yield, emphasizing the
    environmental benefits of using inorganic substrate (rock wool and volcanic tuff)
    and the reuse of nutrient solution (closed systems) to avoid water and nutrient
    losses [267]. Additionally, advanced sensing technologies, including smart irrigation
    systems and the utilization of surface reflectance data obtained from crop canopies,
    offer promising avenues for enhancing the efficiency of soilless farming systems.
    Utilizing cloud-connected wireless sensor networks to monitor real-time substrate
    water status in basil [87] was able to automate irrigation and allowed assessment
    of the physiological responses of plants to different water availability levels
    in the growing substrate. For efficient crop management, detecting early signs
    of water deficit stress is crucial. In this sense, non-contact techniques for
    detecting changes in spectral reflectance have been used successfully for monitoring
    the water status of crops, as in tomatoes, where [239] found that crop reflectance
    increased with increasing water deficit or in [268], where spectral reflectance
    indices (SRI) allowed estimating the midday stem water potential in grapevines
    with great success. This demonstrates that smart irrigation systems are valuable
    instruments for precision irrigation management in soilless crop cultivation within
    greenhouses. When coupled with precise data regarding the impact of different
    water availability levels on plant growth, these systems offer a powerful solution
    for optimizing crop irrigation. These precision agricultural techniques rely on
    real-time assessments of crop water demands rather than adhering to rigid watering
    schedules. As a result, they hold significant potential for optimizing water and
    nutrient utilization within soilless farming setups [267]. Technologies such as
    drip irrigation systems and nutrient film techniques can significantly reduce
    water usage, while real-time monitoring and AI-driven decision support systems
    can optimize nutrient delivery [267,269,270,271,272]. Traditional EC and pH sensors
    provide insufficient information about ion imbalances in hydroponic solutions,
    which can lead to nutrient wastage or reduced yields. Therefore, the use of on-site
    ion monitoring systems based on ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) that can automatically
    calibrate sensors and measure the concentrations of individual ions (NO3−, K+,
    and Ca2+) in hydroponic solutions [271] allows farmers to effectively oversee
    nutrient management in reused solutions by promptly identifying any imbalances
    that may arise in the nutrient ratios has been proposed. However, these advancements
    are not without challenges. The initial cost of implementing these technologies
    can be prohibitive for small-scale farmers, raising concerns about their access
    [273,274]. Moreover, the effectiveness of these strategies is highly dependent
    on accurate data and specialized expertise for system calibration and maintenance,
    which could be barriers for some growers. There is also the risk of over-reliance
    on technology, potentially reducing manual monitoring and adjustments vigilance.
    Other considerations also come into play, particularly regarding data privacy
    and ownership, as many of these systems require cloud-based data storage and third-party
    analytics platforms [275]. Additionally, while these strategies aim to be sustainable,
    the energy requirements for operating advanced water and nutrient management systems
    could offset some environmental benefits if the energy is sourced from non-renewable
    resources [276,277]. 7.3. Energy-Saving Techniques in Soilless Vegetable Production
    Energy-saving techniques, such as solar panels, energy-efficient lighting, and
    automated climate control systems, are increasingly integrated into soilless vegetable
    production to reduce operational costs and environmental impact. These technologies
    can significantly lower energy consumption and increase performance, thereby contributing
    to the sustainability of soilless farming practices [278,279,280,281,282]. The
    majority of current greenhouses utilize conventional materials on the facade and
    traditional technologies for heating, cooling, ventilation, air-conditioning,
    lighting, energy generation, and storage; therefore, by simply changing the design
    and materials of the greenhouse with novel energy-efficient, low-cost, and eco-friendly
    solutions, such as semi-transparent PV modules, vertical ground heat exchangers,
    solar assisted heat pump systems, windcatchers, vacuum tube windows, blue and
    red LEDs for lighting, among others, farmers can minimize their cost of cultivation
    and, thus, maximize their profits, with payback periods from 4 to 8 years [280].
    However, adopting these energy-saving techniques is fraught with challenges that
    warrant critical analysis. Cost: the initial investment required for these technologies
    can be substantial, making it difficult for small-scale or financially constrained
    farmers to adopt them. Applicability: the effectiveness of these energy-saving
    techniques often depends on geographic and climatic factors; for example, solar
    panels may be less effective in regions with limited sunlight [283]. Reconversion:
    the transition to energy-efficient systems may require a reconfiguration of existing
    setups, which could be both labor-intensive and technically challenging. Specialized
    knowledge: while these techniques aim to reduce energy consumption, they often
    require a certain level of technical expertise for installation and maintenance
    [284,285], potentially creating a barrier for less tech-savvy farmers. Lastly,
    sustainability: the push for energy efficiency should be balanced with other sustainability
    considerations, such as water use and waste management, which are equally critical
    in soilless vegetable production [286,287]. 7.4. Life Cycle Assessment and Eco-Friendly
    Practices Life cycle assessment (LCA) and eco-friendly practices are becoming
    increasingly important in soilless vegetable production to evaluate the environmental
    impact of various cultivation methods and technologies. LCA provides a comprehensive
    environmental footprint analysis, from resource extraction to waste management,
    offering valuable insights into areas for improvement [288,289,290,291,292,293].
    Eco-friendly practices, such as using organic substrates and renewable energy
    sources, aim to minimize this footprint. For example, ref. [289], reviewing substrates
    for use in urban farming, found that perlite has the highest environmental impact
    because it is a material obtained from open-pit mines, which necessitates substantial
    energy consumption and a lengthy transportation process. Moreover, horticultural
    and fruit crops are typically regarded as highly intensive and frequently require
    numerous inputs, including fertilizers, pesticides, and various other materials,
    and the benefit of one cropping system over another cannot always be established,
    as was described by [292] in strawberry cultivated in a traditional mulched soil
    tunnel versus a soilless tunnel system, concluding that, in general terms, the
    tunnel exploits more land and crop inputs (excluding pesticides), while the soilless,
    more technology and building materials, thus, making it difficult to establish
    which system is more environmentally sustainable. As stated, these analyses can
    be challenging, especially for smallholder farmers. Conducting a thorough LCA
    can be resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise and access to extensive
    data, which may be prohibitive or nonexistent. Eco-friendly practices often involve
    an upfront investment, raising concerns about cost and access to sustainable technologies.
    While these practices aim to be environmentally sustainable, their effectiveness
    can vary depending on local conditions such as climate and soil quality, which
    may limit their applicability on a broader scale. The transition to eco-friendly
    practices may necessitate significant changes to existing systems and operations,
    which could be costly and disruptive. 8. Future Directions and Challenges 8.1.
    Promising Areas for Further Research and Development In the context of soilless
    vegetable production, promising areas for further research and development include
    the integration of AI and machine learning for predictive analytics, developing
    more efficient and affordable sensing technologies, and exploring alternative
    sustainable substrates [65]. These areas hold significant potential for advancing
    the field by improving yield, reducing resource consumption, and enhancing sustainability
    [294,295,296,297]. However, several challenges and considerations accompany these
    promising avenues. First, focusing on high-tech solutions like AI could divert
    attention and resources from low-tech but effective traditional practices, potentially
    widening the gap between large-scale and small-scale farmers [298]. Soilless farming,
    particularly in the context of traditional crops like rice, soybean, and wheat,
    has seen limited exploration when integrating new technologies, e.g., artificial
    intelligence. Surprisingly, there is a lack of research dedicated to harnessing
    the potential of AI in these basic crop cultivation methods. Many existing systems
    remain in the prototype stage, and their practical application in real-world agricultural
    settings remains largely conceptual, especially within the confines of greenhouse
    environments [219]. Second, while the push for more sustainable substrates is
    commendable, the long-term impacts of these materials on plant health and yield
    are not yet fully understood and warrant further investigation [65]. Third, the
    drive for innovation must be balanced with cost considerations and accessibility
    to ensure that advancements benefit a broad range of producers, including those
    with limited resources [299,300]. Fourth, as research delves into increasingly
    specialized areas, there is a risk of creating solutions that are so tailored
    that they cannot be easily adapted for broader applications. Finally, all new
    technologies and practices must be evaluated for their immediate benefits and
    long-term sustainability, including their environmental, social, and economic
    impacts [301]. 8.2. Regulatory and Policy Considerations for Next-Generation Technologies
    In the context of the rapid advancement of next-generation technologies in soilless
    vegetable production, “data and intellectual property of farmers” takes on a multifaceted
    dimension that intersects with privacy, security, and economic interests [302].
    As we integrate sophisticated AI and real-time monitoring systems into agricultural
    practices, these systems invariably collect and process vast data points [303,304].
    These data, ranging from crop health metrics to environmental conditions within
    soilless systems, constitute an asset central to operational success and innovation
    in modern farming. Farmers’ intellectual property extends beyond the traditional
    understanding of crop varieties or farming techniques. It now includes the unique
    datasets and proprietary algorithms developed to interpret these data, optimize
    production, and manage resources efficiently. The data collected through these
    advanced systems can reveal insights into the micro-level responses of crops to
    various stimuli, which, when analyzed, contribute to the macro-level strategies
    for improving yield and sustainability. However, the aggregation and analysis
    of such data also raise significant concerns regarding ownership and control.
    Who has the right to access, analyze, and benefit from these data? How can farmers
    protect their data from being exploited by larger entities that can process and
    utilize this information at a scale far beyond the individual farmer’s capability?
    These questions underscore the need for robust regulatory frameworks that recognize
    the value of these data and the intellectual property they generate [302]. Regulatory
    guidelines must be crafted to ensure that farmers retain control over their data
    and their intellectual contributions to soilless agriculture. This involves establishing
    clear data governance policies that address consent, access rights, and the distribution
    of benefits derived from data use. Moreover, these guidelines must safeguard against
    unauthorized use of data, prevent data breaches, and ensure that farmers’ data
    are not used in ways that could harm their competitive position or violate their
    privacy [303,304]. As we consider integrating new materials, energy sources, and
    potentially genetically modified crops into soilless farming systems, the scope
    of intellectual property also expands. It now encompasses the innovative use of
    alternative substrates, the development of crops specifically tailored to soilless
    conditions, and the creation of new technologies for energy efficiency [305,306].
    Each area brings with it the need for updated safety and environmental impact
    assessments and the potential for new patents and trademarks. Standardization
    efforts are critical to ensure that these new technologies can be seamlessly integrated
    with existing systems, but they must be balanced to protect farmers’ intellectual
    property rights [307]. Without such protections, there is a risk that the benefits
    of innovation will accrue only to those with the resources to exploit them, potentially
    widening the gap between large-scale operations and smaller, resource-constrained
    farmers. Furthermore, access to technology is a pressing concern [303]. Policies
    must be designed to ensure that all farmers, regardless of scale, can benefit
    from technological advancements. This includes considering the potential impacts
    of technology adoption, such as job displacement due to automation [308]. Policy
    frameworks must protect data and intellectual property and address the socioeconomic
    impacts of technology adoption, ensuring that the transition to more advanced
    systems is just and inclusive. 8.3. Potential Limitations and Hurdles to Widespread
    Adoption Several limitations temper the potential for widespread adoption of next-generation
    technologies in soilless vegetable production (Table 6). First and foremost is
    the cost issue; the initial investment for implementing advanced technologies
    such as AI-driven monitoring systems, precision farming techniques, new materials,
    and alternative substrates can be prohibitively expensive for small-scale farmers.
    This financial barrier risks creating a technological divide in the industry,
    where only well-funded operations can afford to adopt these innovations [309].
    Second, there is the challenge of technical complexity; the operation and maintenance
    of advanced systems often require specialized skills and training, which could
    be a significant hurdle for less tech-savvy farmers [310]. Third, the effectiveness
    of these technologies can be influenced by various external factors such as climate,
    geographic location, and market demand, limiting their applicability in certain
    contexts [311]. Fourth, regulatory considerations, including data privacy and
    potential job displacement [303,312], could slow down the rate of adoption. Fifth,
    if not sourced sustainably, the energy requirements for some of these technologies
    could offset the environmental benefits they aim to provide [313,314]. Lastly,
    there is the issue of social acceptance; farmers and consumers may be hesitant
    to embrace these technologies due to concerns about safety or data security considerations
    [315]. Table 6. Overview of Potential Limitations and Hurdles to Widespread Adoption
    of Soilless Agriculture, Highlighting Their Impact, Possible Solutions, and Areas
    Affected. To address the limitations and hurdles to the widespread adoption of
    soilless agriculture, several strategic approaches and solutions can be considered,
    such as providing farmers with the necessary knowledge and training to adopt soilless
    agriculture techniques effectively through education [333,334]. Providing financial
    incentives such as grants, subsidies, and tax breaks for farmers and businesses
    to adopt soilless agriculture can help offset initial setup costs and encourage
    investment in this method, especially for smallholder farmers [335,336]. Developing
    supportive policies and regulations that recognize and promote soilless agriculture
    can create an enabling environment for its adoption [337]. This includes zoning
    regulations, water usage policies, and agricultural subsidies designed to support
    soilless farming. The introduction of automation in farming systems can optimize
    power consumption. By introducing automated systems and technologies, farmers
    can reduce energy consumption while maintaining or even increasing yield efficiency
    [338]. The aforementioned, together with the integration of alternative power,
    such as renewable energy sources, allows for the reduction of energy consumption
    and environmental impact. Research has shown that soilless cultivation optimally
    utilizes water, fertilizer, and land resources, achieving efficiencies of 90%,
    70%, and 75%, respectively. Soilless agriculture uses water more efficiently than
    traditional soil-based farming, as the water and nutrient solutions are recirculated,
    reducing overall water consumption. By eliminating soil disturbance, it alleviates
    land pressure and degradation while facilitating year-round crop intensification.
    This method complements traditional soil-based farming, diminishes the adverse
    effects of agrochemicals on the environment, addresses climate change, and enhances
    productivity in arid regions [5]. Educating farmers, agricultural communities,
    and the general public about these benefits and techniques of soilless agriculture
    is crucial for its social acceptance [339]. This can be achieved through workshops,
    seminars, and educational campaigns. Highlighting the advantages, such as higher
    yields, efficient water usage, and reduced environmental impact, can help increase
    awareness and understanding. 9. Conclusions and Final Remarks This research paper
    provides a thorough and balanced investigation into the role of next-generation
    technologies in soilless vegetable production, emphasizing both their revolutionary
    capabilities and the multifaceted challenges that limit their widespread adoption.
    It addresses the financial barriers that could create a technological divide,
    favoring well-funded operations over small-scale farmers. The paper also critically
    examines the technical complexities that necessitate specialized skills, thereby
    widening the existing knowledge gap among farmers. While the paper is strong in
    discussing potential impacts, such as data privacy and job displacement, it could
    benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the regulatory frameworks and international
    trade regulations that may need to be revised to accommodate these innovations.
    Ongoing work in this field should prioritize the development of cost-effective
    technologies and educational programs to make these advancements more accessible.
    Future research should also focus on the long-term environmental sustainability
    of these technologies, as well as a more granular understanding of their implications.
    By addressing these critical areas, this research can contribute to a more holistic
    understanding of the challenges and opportunities, facilitating the implementation
    of next-generation technologies in soilless vegetable production. Author Contributions

    smart IoT systems; machine learning 1. Introduction Smart “Internet of Things”
    (IoT) systems refer to interconnected networks of devices, sensors, and objects
    that communicate and interact, collect and analyze data, make smart decisions
    based on the accumulated data, and take actions that improve the systems’ efficiency,
    productivity, and safety and security [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. These systems leverage
    the capabilities of IoT and data science technologies, such as networking connectivity,
    data analytics, and automation, to enable intelligent and efficient operations
    across various application domains. Some of the representative application domains
    include energy [11,12], transportation [13,14], industry [15,16], and healthcare
    [17], among others. The basic building blocks of these systems include the sensing,
    identification, and/or controlling unit consisting of sensors and actuators for
    perceiving their operating environments and executing the received instructions,
    the processing unit housing microprocessors and software applications for data
    processing and running computations within the network edge, a communication unit
    comprised of the radio access network (RAN) for connecting the different nodes
    to the core network and the services unit for orchestrating the other components
    of the system to provide the required services [18]. The advancement of IoT technology
    heavily depends on its three pillars of computing, communication, and things (sensors
    and actuators). As evident by Figure 1, smart IoT systems have diverse quality
    of service (QoS) and reliability requirements [15,19]. For example, healthcare
    wearables and energy grid smart meters are massive-connectivity-intensive. At
    the same time, self-driving vehicles and remote surgery are latency-intensive,
    while telemedicine and industrial control and monitoring systems are broadband-intensive
    [20,21,22,23]. Figure 1. Building block of IoT systems. In the last two decades,
    mobile technology has opened the wildest imaginations regarding innovation and
    creativity in the telecom sector by drastically changing how we communicate from
    the perspective of distance and geographical divide. As a result, the total user
    experience has been consistently and substantially improved by new technology
    generations launched on average every ten years [24]. In a report published in
    2022 by Dell’Oro, it was predicted that the global Radio Access Network (RAN)
    industry will surpass $40 billion by 2026 and that Open-RAN deployment will represent
    more than 15% to 20% of RAN worldwide [24,25]. Traditional cellular networks such
    as 3G and 4G are built on monolithic, inflexible infrastructure, unlike 5G, which
    supports heterogeneity, allowing O-RAN to run on software-defined radio (SDR),
    an open loop instead of traditional analog hardware-based systems, which are closed-loop
    control [26]. The practical implementation of 5G systems requires drastically
    reworking existing plug-and-play methodologies instead of flexible, new, and open
    paradigms for network management, deployment, and control [27]. In this scenario,
    the cellular arena welcomes ground-breaking and cutting-edge networking solutions
    based on softwarization, openness, resource sharing, virtualization, and mobile
    edge-computing [28,29]. O-RAN technology aims at maximizing possible resource
    usage and sharing infrastructure, providing a unique market opportunity such as
    infrastructure leasing and connectivity-as-a-service (CaaS) technology. As a result,
    it is an appealing solution for network operators and infrastructure providers
    [30]. The monolithic nature of RAN components, which supported a few vendors and
    were viewed by operators as black boxes, gave rise to drawbacks such as network
    node cooperation restrictions, poor reconfiguration, and vendor lock-in [28].
    Furthermore, O-RAN technology advocates for the disaggregation of the RAN into
    smaller modules: a radio unit (RU), distributed unit (DU), control unit (CU),
    and opening the interfaces between the different components to promote flexibility,
    interoperability, innovation, and reduce costs [31]. The O-RAN Alliance is a group
    of companies formed to develop and promote the O-RAN concept. The alliance includes
    numerous companies, including mobile network operators, equipment vendors, and
    software providers. The alliance has developed a set of specifications and reference
    architectures for O-RAN, which are designed to ensure interoperability between
    different vendors’ equipment [32]. Even though the O-RAN idea was initially conceived
    to support traditional mobile networks, next-generation wireless networks and
    smart IoT systems are also covered [33]. For example, networks for IoT systems
    comprise a heterogeneous and growing number of devices, sensors, objects, and
    other components, which makes it challenging to manage and orchestrate the network.
    With the aid of O-RAN, the interface between the different network components
    can be standardized and opened for easier management and orchestration, leading
    to enhanced efficiency and cost savings. Furthermore, it can facilitate the development
    of open and standardized interfaces between IoT devices, gateways, and the edge
    and cloud to allow different vendors’ devices and gateways to work together seamlessly.
    Similarly, O-RAN can promote the development of enhanced edge intelligence solutions,
    i.e., by processing data close to where it is generated for transmission latency
    reduction [33,34,35,36]. In this study, we have systematically reviewed the literature
    by querying the reputable research databases using AND operation between keywords
    to have precise results such as ‘O-RAN’ and ‘IoT’, ‘O-RAN’ and ‘Transportation’,
    ‘O-RAN’ and ‘Industrial IoT’, ‘O-RAN’ and ‘Healthcare’, ‘O-RAN’ and ‘Energy’.
    Furthermore, the articles are scrutinized to ensure that the O-RAN concept supports
    the IoT systems conceptually or technically. Articles not satisfying the above
    criteria are not included in this research. Table 1 lists the key terms and abbreviations
    in the paper. Table 1. List of terms and abbreviations. Our major contributions
    to this paper are as follows. We systematically review the applications of O-RAN
    in smart IoT systems, i.e., transportation, industry, healthcare, and energy.
    We propose a generic three-dimensional problem space that considers IoT systems
    (e.g., transportation, industry, healthcare, energy), targets (e.g., reliable
    communication, real-time analytics, fault tolerance, interoperability, integration),
    and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) schemes (e.g., reinforcement
    learning (RL), deep neural networks (DNNs). We outline future research directions
    concerning robust and scalable solutions, interoperability and standardizations,
    privacy, and security. We also present a taxonomy to unveil the security threats
    to emerge from the O-RAN-assisted IoT systems and the feasible directions to address
    those threats. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
    introduces the background of traditional radio access networks (RAN), the concept
    of O-RAN technology, AI/ML, and a brief literature review on O-RAN. Section 3
    explores the O-RAN in smart IoT systems based on our defined problem space. Section
    4 presents several challenges and future research directions. Finally, Section
    5 gives the final remarks. 2. Background This section begins with a briefing of
    the traditional RAN, the basic concept of O-RAN technology, such as disaggregation,
    virtualization, RAN intelligent controller (RIC), and open interfaces. Then, this
    section introduces AI/ML techniques to make optimal or sub-optimal decisions or
    pattern recognition and classification, and a brief literature review on O-RAN.
    2.1. Traditional Radio Access Network (RAN) The RAN, popularly known as the access
    network, is the radio component of the cellular network. It is an essential element
    of a wireless telecommunication system that employs radio links to connect each
    device to other network sections. The RAN connects user equipment (UEs) over a
    fiber or wireless backhaul connection, such as a phone, computer, or any remotely
    operated machine. From the first generation (1G) of cellular networking to the
    fifth generation (5G), RANs have undergone several developments. The core network
    and radio access network underwent a significant change due to the introduction
    of long-term evolution (LTE) RAN by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
    in the 2000s with the advent of fourth-generation (4G) technology. With 4G, system
    connectivity was replaced by circuit-based networks for the first time and was
    based on the internet protocol (IP). The first cellular networks were developed
    in the early years of the 2000s. Text messages, voice calls, streaming video,
    and audio have all become part of RAN’s capabilities. Many more types of UEs use
    these networks, including autonomous cars, drones, and IoT devices. Despite these
    remarkable advancements, traditional RANs are monolithic nowadays (i.e., inflexible,
    protocol-based, proprietary-driven), and inefficient in handling a number of vast
    dynamic requirements brought by 5G and future 6G. This calls for open, flexible,
    intelligent, software-driven connectivity solutions capable of handling these
    requirements and resolving the traditional RAN’s deficiencies in a more cost-effective
    and energy-efficient manner. To address the shortcomings posed by RAN architecture,
    a number of research and standardization initiatives proposed O-RAN as the new
    paradigm shift for the future of RAN. Notwithstanding, O-RAN implementations use
    software-based, virtualized, and disaggregated components that are interoperable
    across multiple vendors and connected by open, standardized interfaces [37,38].
    2.2. Concept of O-RAN Technology The new O-RAN paradigm approach is software-based
    and adaptable, enabling data-informed smart control loops for cellular systems
    and openness, virtualization, and programmability of RAN functionality and components.
    As a result, network engineers can support new customized services on common physical
    infrastructures and vigorously rearrange them in response to user demand and network
    conditions thanks to the Open RAN. In addition, the network’s operating expenses
    could decrease due to greater efficiency [26]. Disaggregation: It entails breaking
    down the RAN components into smaller chunks of functional modules that different
    vendors can implement. The following units emerged by disaggregating the O-RAN
    components: the baseband unit (BBU), i.e., the control unit (CU), which is responsible
    for control plane functions, such as radio resource management and mobility management;
    the distributed unit (DU), which is responsible for radio frequency (RF) processing
    and data plane functions, such as user data forwarding; and finally, the radio
    unit (RU), which is responsible for radio frequency (RF) signal reception and
    transmission. Virtualization: It encompasses separating the RAN software components
    from the underlying hardware to allow greater flexibility and agility in the RAN
    and the potential for cost savings. Since software components are tightly coupled
    to the underlying hardware in a traditional RAN, virtualization decouples the
    software components from the underlying hardware to optimize the RAN’s performance
    for different application environments or even gives room for creating a responsive
    cloud-based RAN that scales or shrinks based on the available demand to ease the
    management of the RAN. RAN intelligent controller (RIC): It is a key component
    of the O-RAN architecture. It carries out controlling and managing the RAN, and
    it uses software-based intelligence to optimize the performance of the network.
    The RIC is divided into the near-real-time RIC (NRT-RIC) and the non-real-time
    RIC (N-NRT-RIC). The N-NRT-RIC operates on a timescale greater than 1 s to handle
    non-real-time events and their respective control loops, such as configuration
    changes and performance optimization. The NRT-RIC operates between the 10 ms and
    1 s timescale to handle near real-time events and their respective control loops,
    such as handovers and admission control. D’Oro et al. [39] proposed the concept
    of dApps operating in the CU and DU to extend the RIC capabilities towards handling
    real-time control loops such as scheduling and beamforming working on timescales
    of less than 10 ms, even though efforts extending the RIC concept to the RU are
    yet to be recorded at the time of this writing. For instance, Ko et al. [40] proposed
    edgeRic to confirm that decoupling the RIC from the RAN stack and co-locating
    it close to the DU can support control loops operating within sub milliseconds
    and even microseconds. These proposed contributions extended the RIC capabilities
    toward addressing the latency requirements of the next-generation smart IoT systems.
    Open interface: It involves the collection of standardized interfaces that enable
    the different components of the RAN to communicate with each other. The interfaces
    are designed to be open and interoperable to facilitate the seamless cooperation
    of different vendors. Some of the interfaces that are defined and standardized
    by the O-RAN Alliance include the following: The O1 interface, which connects
    the SMO with the remaining components (CU, DU, RU, and near-RT RIC) of the RAN
    stack to manage and orchestrate the RAN as well as enable the integration of the
    third-party apps. The A1 interface, which provides a connection between the non-RT-RIC
    and the N-RT-RIC to send intelligent policies and telemetries to the N-RT-RIC
    and allow the N-RT-RIC to control the RAN intelligently. The E2 interface, which
    connects the N-RT-RIC with the E2 nodes, enabling different RAN optimization and
    automation services like RAN control, monitoring, and configuration. Other interfaces
    include the fronthaul, which connects the RU with the DU. Midhaul enables connections
    between the DU and the CU, and backhaul connects the RAN with the core network.
    Figure 2 describes the architecture of O-RAN as defined by O-RAN Alliance [32].
    The alliance is a global industry consortium that promotes developing and adopting
    open and intelligent RAN technologies. It was initiated to transform traditional
    RAN infrastructure by enabling greater interoperability, flexibility, and innovation
    in the mobile telecommunications industry. The alliance plays a pivotal role in
    driving innovation and openness in RAN technology, which is essential for the
    evolution of 5G networks and the deployment of future wireless communication technologies.
    Figure 2. O-RAN architecture as defined by the O-RAN Alliance [32]. 2.3. Artificial
    Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) Simply put, AI is the art of enabling
    machines with human-like thought, reasoning, and decision-making power. It is
    the grand quest to breathe life into algorithms, allowing them to perceive the
    world, learn from experience to build a model that can reflect the target system,
    adapt to changing circumstances, and provide solutions to complex problems [7,41,42].
    The ML, which is a subset of AI, learns from the given data about the past to
    make better futuristic predictions. It is the digital detective, discovering patterns
    and insights that elude human senses in pursuing more intelligent and autonomous
    machines. In this context, the typical applications of AI/ML methods include dynamic
    control decision-making and pattern recognition/classification techniques as described
    below. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of the dynamic ML paradigm where
    software agents learn to make decisions in an environment by receiving feedback
    as rewards [43]. Through a cycle of observations, actions, and learning, the agents
    gradually improve their decision-making abilities to achieve long-term goals.
    Several RL types range from value-based, policy-based, deep RL, or actor–critic
    learning, which combines the two for optimized decision making in dynamic environments.
    RL is applied in the O-RAN context to optimize the management and performance
    of the network. For example, RL dynamically allocates resources (bandwidth, power,
    frequencies, etc.) to different IoT devices or network slices based on real-time
    conditions and demands. Similarly, RL can control power consumption by optimizing
    transmission power levels and sleep modes of devices while ensuring connectivity
    and QoS. Again, RL agents can be trained to detect network anomalies and failures
    and then decide to implement self-healing mechanisms. This proactive approach
    ensures network resilience and reduces downtime. Despite RL’s promising capabilities
    for optimizing O-RAN and the emerging O-RAN-based IoT systems, challenges related
    to training data, model robustness, and real-time adaptation, among others, remain
    open for the research community to solve [43,44]. Deep neural networks (DNNs):
    This refers to the stacked neural network architectures that recognize patterns
    and extract information from structured or unstructured data. They are well suited
    for tasks involving images, sequences, and graph data [41]. Convolutional neural
    networks (CNNs), as a good example, are applied to tasks involving grid-like data,
    such as images and videos. They are proficient at capturing spatial relationships
    within data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on the other hand, are designed
    for handling sequential data. The architecture has connections that allow information
    to persist over time, which makes it exemplary at capturing temporal relationships
    within the data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are essential for data representation
    involving graphs, i.e., data consisting of several nodes and edges. They are mostly
    used in applications with essential relationships between data points, such as
    network traffic analysis [45]. In this context, these techniques are applied to
    learn the latent characteristics of the network and its users, which will guide
    the effective management of the network in several ways. For example, these techniques
    can learn the operating pattern of the network from its data to predict traffic
    and performance degradation, detect anomalies and intrusions, and optimize energy
    efficiency. However, despite DNN’s potential, striking a balance between their
    complexity and the complexity of the emerging O-RAN-based IoT system to satisfy
    the real-time performance requirement of their operating environment remains open
    for further research [41,46,47]. 2.4. Brief Review on O-RAN A number of recent
    research works have shown that O-RAN can support the next-generation smart IoT
    systems in several ways. For example, in two separate works, researchers in Pham
    et al. [48] and Pham et al. [49] considered the Internet of drones by integrating
    UAVs with O-RAN architecture to optimize user routes to the core network to improve
    resource allocation and enhance offloading tasks. Similarly, Wang et al. [36]
    proposed a computation offloading strategy that minimizes energy consumption and
    reduces the communication latency of O-RAN-based IoT systems. Riccio et al. [50]
    leveraged the RAN intelligent controller (RIC) to enhance IoT handover management.
    Lini et al. [51] emphasized that merging AI with 5G is essential in facilitating
    open networking (vendor independence) as well as realizing the next-generation
    smart IoT systems. Firouzi et al. [35] adopted O-RAN to optimize federated learning
    (FL) operation in supporting distributed edge intelligence of 5G-based IoT systems.
    Liu et al. [52] addressed network slicing security in cyber–physical systems (CPS),
    while Kougioumzidis et al. [53] considered extending O-RAN capabilities to virtual
    reality applications. Vila et al. [54] presented the network digital twins (DT)
    concept to reflect the RAN’s operation for taking the appropriate action. Likewise,
    Masaracchia et al. [55] demonstrated the integration of DT with O-RAN as inevitable
    for yielding the 6G RAN. Similarly, there are several surveys and reviews on O-RAN,
    its application areas, and areas of challenges. For example, Polese et al. [31]
    presented a comprehensive tutorial on O-RAN, discussing its architecture, interfaces,
    and workflows, giving a big picture of how O-RAN aims to transform the next-generation
    cellular networks. In addition to covering the areas of research successes and
    challenges, Liyanage et al. [56] presented both threats and possible solutions
    that are associated with O-RAN’s security and privacy concerns. Bitton et al.
    [57] presented a systematic adversarial machine learning (AML) threat analysis
    for O-RAN, discussing some of the possible AML countermeasures and a method for
    conducting risk assessments. Abdalla et al. [58] reviewed O-RAN capabilities.
    Likewise, Wu et al. [59] reviewed network slicing management in Industrial IoT.
    Thus, there is room for more effort within the public domain to provide a holistic
    investigation of the applications of O-RAN in smart IoT systems. 3. O-RAN in Smart
    IoT Systems This section explores the smart IoT systems and the O-RAN contribution
    in each selected domain. In particular, we first describe the problem system and
    then present the O-RAN application to some representative IoT systems. 3.1. Problem
    Space We propose a three-dimensional problem space, as detailed by Figure 3, where
    the X-axis indicates the IoT systems (e.g., STS, SMS, others), the Y-axis displays
    the targets (e.g., reliable communication, real-time analytics, fault tolerance,
    interoperability and integration), and the Z-axis covers the AI/ML techniques
    (i.e., RL, DNN). Figure 3. Problem space. As shown in Figure 3, four targets were
    adopted to represent the research objectives achieved by O-RAN while supporting
    the smart IoT systems. The targets derived from the adopted research methodology
    and the diligent consideration of the objectives achieved by O-RAN in these domains.
    The dimension of targets (Y) are detailed below: Reliable communication ( 𝑌 1
    ): It entails the achievement of reliable, optimized, and secure communication
    infrastructure for seamless connectivity and data exchange within and between
    these systems by addressing challenges related to latency, bandwidth, privacy,
    authentication protocols, interference, etc. For example, V2X communication represents
    optimal transmission latency [60], IoE beamforming represents optimized interference
    in the transmission medium [61], and telemedicine represents optimum end-to-end
    healthcare service delivery [62]. Real-time analytics ( 𝑌 2 ): It involves improving
    data collection, analysis, decision-making, and control by integrating edge computing,
    distributed analytics, and machine learning techniques to support extracting valuable
    insights and real-time monitoring. It also enables predictive maintenance, personalized
    services, etc. For example, resource allocation represents the dynamic assignment
    of network resources in real time [34], and edge intelligence represents data
    analytics close to where it is generated for improved performance [63,64]. Fault
    tolerance ( 𝑌 3 ): It implies using the O-RAN concept to enhance IoT systems’
    resilience and self-healing capabilities by improving the robustness of fault
    detection and recovery mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted operation, quick response
    to disruptions and security threats to minimize downtime. Some of the examples
    are signaling storm detection [65] and Industrial IoT data security [66]. Interoperability
    and integration ( 𝑌 4 ): It entails using the O-RAN concept to promote interoperability
    and integration among IoT devices, systems, and platforms using the standardized
    interfaces to enable seamless connectivity, data exchange, and integration of
    diverse components for efficient operations. For example, O-RAN can be used to
    facilitate interoperability between two or more IoT domains [59]. It is worth
    noting that to make O-RAN a viable wireless network infrastructure to support
    IoT applications, it is critical to perform quantitative analysis with performance
    metrics (latency, bandwidth, scalability, capacity, coverage, range, etc.) for
    IoT applications based on O-RAN. For example, related to smart manufacturing systems,
    to carry out monitoring capability of industrial systems, the latency range must
    be below 100 ms, bandwidth must be in the range of 0.1–0.5 Mp/s, and reliability
    needs to be larger than 99.9% [67]. In our prior study [15], we emphasized the
    importance of understanding the key parameters and performance requirements of
    smart manufacturing systems, including types of manufacturing applications, key
    parameters (network size, etc.) and performance requirements (latency, reliability,
    etc.), discussed the challenges and limitations of existing static networking
    infrastructure to support applications in smart manufacturing systems with diversified
    performance requirements, and called for the necessity of developing dynamic and
    flexible/re-configurable networking infrastructures (e.g., software-defined networking)
    to support IoT applications with different performance requirements. Additionally,
    for energy-based IoT systems such as smart grids [68], it is critical to understand
    the performance requirements of smart grid applications in both the transmission
    and distribution side based on the standardization and carry out performance evaluation
    of different networking architectures and protocols. As the O-RAN is a new network
    infrastructure, the standardization and research community shall have joint efforts
    on the performance gap of O-RAN to support IoT applications via modeling, simulation,
    and testbed development. 3.2. Smart Transportation Systems The smart transportation
    system leverages advanced information communication technologies (ICT) to enhance
    transportation systems’ safety, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. It
    integrates sensors, communication systems, data analytics, and control systems
    to collect and process data, providing real-time decisions, and optimize transportation
    operations. Nowadays, the smart transportation system is used to support the automatic
    control of vehicles, monitor traffic conditions, handle traffic flow, provide
    real-time information updates to drivers, reduce environmental pollution, and
    even improve air quality. With the advent of 5G, the next-generation smart transportation
    system aims to improve road safety, traffic efficiency, environmental sustainability,
    and user experience through enhanced communication and data-driven technologies
    [69]. Just like the “ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC)” capabilities
    to support real-time applications like autonomous driving, improving the reliability,
    range, and capacity of V2X communication promotes better coordination among road
    users [70]. The “enhanced mobile broadband (emBB)” applications like in-vehicle
    entertainment and infotainments require high-quality multimedia streaming, augmented
    reality navigation, and other entertainment services to passengers in moving vehicles
    [71]. The “massive machine type communication (mMTC)” enables more effective traffic
    management and congestion reduction strategies using dynamic traffic signal control,
    adaptive routing, and predictive traffic flow analysis, etc. [72,73]. At the same
    time, O-RAN could build on that to promote automation, interoperability, and cost-efficiency
    in the next-generation ITS by enhancing vehicular communication optimization,
    traffic management and control, cooperative autonomous driving, etc. For example,
    Huang et al. [63] presented an improved edge intelligence supporting IoV networks.
    Hammami et al. [74] leveraged the O-RAN concept to implement a centralized training
    but distributed execution (CTDE) strategy to enable cooperation among diverging
    agents operating in vehicular networks. In this manner, they addressed the resource
    allocation problem of V2V and V2I while satisfying their reliability and QoS requirements.
    Likewise, Ndikumana et al. [64] used the NRT-RIC to create a collaboration area
    in a network of multiple radios and edges. Their approach can balance computation
    and communication, translating to a latency reduction in autonomous vehicles network
    [75]. Abolhasan et al. [76] utilized the RIC to control the proposed fuzzy-based
    routing protocol. The RIC handles the dynamic network topology and arrives at
    the optimum traffic route by generating and maintaining the link state database,
    which guides the multi-hop peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. Linsalata et al.
    [60] presented O-RAN as a promising enabler of the next-generation vehicular communication
    orchestration, together with open research considerations militating against integrating
    the two technologies. V2X resource allocation, beam selection, relay assignment,
    and network DTs are among the feasible research directions in their work. Takeaways
    from smart transportation systems: Supported by Table 2, the reviewed efforts
    in smart transportation covered 𝑌 1 and 𝑌 2 , while 𝑌 3 and 𝑌 4 are less explored.
    However, despite O-RAN’s achievements in smart transportation, there is a need
    for smart-transportation-compatible specifications, standards, and tools facilitating
    the development of robust, secure, energy-efficient, adaptive solutions that operate
    in real life. Table 2. Summary of O-RAN in smart transportation systems. 3.3.
    Smart Manufacturing Systems Smart manufacturing applies cutting-edge technology
    that uses Internet-connected equipment to increase production efficiency and track
    processes by employing computer controls, modeling, big data, and other automation
    [15]. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has specific applications, one
    of which is smart manufacturing. The IIoT aims to increase the reachability, effectiveness,
    and decision making in industrial control systems (ICS). It also offers intelligent
    functions, including energy consumption monitoring, environmental release management,
    and general safety and security for the ICS network. ICSs are hardware and software-based
    systems that monitor and manage industrial activities. The networking hardware
    and protocols that serve the ICS are known as operational technologies (OT). Supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA), plant distribution control systems (DCSs),
    as well as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are some of the common examples
    of OT employed in ICS [77]. This entails integrating inter-connected IoT devices,
    technologies, and principles in industrial settings to improve operational efficiency,
    optimize processes, and enhance productivity. The smart manufacturing system leverages
    sensors, devices, and intelligent systems to connect and collect data from various
    industrial assets, machines, and equipment, enabling real-time monitoring, control
    of environmental activities, analysis, and automation. From the 5G era and beyond,
    the smart manufacturing system targets improving seamless connectivity, ultra-reliable
    communication, high data rate, low latency, efficient data processing, and optimal
    resource allocation for various industrial applications, for example, industrial
    automation and remote robotics, where minimal transmission latency is the principal
    objective, video surveillance for real-time monitoring of industrial assets where
    high-speed data rates are targeted, and industrial assets tracking, where massive
    machine connectivity is preferred, among others [78,79,80]. O-RAN will build on
    5G’s intervention to yield open, scalable, resilient, cost-effective solutions
    that lead to a more efficient, productive, resilient, and sustainable industrial
    setting. This can be achieved in several ways. For example, Rahman et al. [67]
    conducted a “SWOT Analysis” to determine O-RAN’s areas of strengths that could
    be leveraged to support the next-generation smart manufacturing applications in
    satisfying their seamless connectivity requirements. Lin et al. [81] proposed
    “zero-touch” architecture to connect the diverse components of a smart factory
    together. The RIC was used to control the connectivity using AI/ML in a distributed
    passion. Abedin et al. [34] proposed a flexible and scalable method of slicing
    the IIoT network in RIC while considering the diverse QoS requirements and the
    available resources within the network. Their approach reduces the problem’s complexity
    by employing distributed game theory to match each slice to its corresponding
    cell base stations and then applying actor–critic learning to achieve an optimum
    resource allocation that facilitates IIoT monitoring and control. Hoffmann et
    al. [65] proposed an xApp that examines the control plane messages to detect malicious
    threats targeting IIoT devices. Tselikis et al. [66] presented IIoT data security
    as critical for effectively monitoring and controlling the ecosystem, thereby
    examining O-RAN’s readiness towards ensuring the privacy and security of the data.
    Takeaways from smart manufacturing systems: As supported by Table 3, the reviewed
    efforts in smart manufacturing systems covered 𝑌 1 , 𝑌 2 , and 𝑌 3 while 𝑌 4 still
    needs further exploration. However, despite O-RAN’s achievements in smart manufacturing,
    there is a need for more efforts on SMS-compatible specifications, standards,
    and development, as well as testing tools facilitating the development of scalable,
    robust, adaptive solutions that keep the end-to-end security and privacy of the
    operating environment and its data in mind. Table 3. Summary of O-RAN in smart
    manufacturing systems. 3.4. Smart Healthcare Systems The smart healthcare system
    entails leveraging technological advancements in AI/ML and IoT to improve healthcare
    delivery, enhance medical services, improve patient outcomes, and streamline healthcare
    processes. The fundamental objective of smart healthcare is to provide personalized,
    efficient, and effective healthcare services while minimizing costs and enhancing
    the general quality of caregiving. Some of the critical components of smart healthcare
    include IoT devices (sensors/actuators) and healthcare wearables for collecting
    patients’ data remotely. The data are analyzed using AI/ML models to predict the
    required action, processed and stored with the aid of computing infrastructures
    like the network edge, cloud, data centers, and other networking equipment, and
    supported with a user interface to guide user interaction with the system. Due
    to the critical nature of the system and the data in circulation, the system is
    supported with authentication, encryption, access control, and intrusion detection
    mechanisms to ensure the security and privacy of the system and data [82]. With
    the benefits realized from the advancements in cellular networks like the 5G/6G,
    O-RAN can improve the services rendered by IHS by providing a flexible, scalable,
    and interoperable architecture that can support many devices, users, and systems
    to operate more cost-effectively and energy-efficiently. For example, De et al.
    [62] presented “OpenCare5G”, a project aimed at demonstrating 5G-enabled telemedicine,
    i.e., remote digital healthcare examinations in real-time. The project employs
    the O-RAN concept to disaggregate the network components, giving room for customization
    and updates and making the solution flexible and cost-effective. Likewise, Trifonov
    et al. [83] demonstrated how O-RAN uses AI/ML to improve network performance and
    supported that a policy-driven use case could control the inactivity timer prediction
    of narrow-band medical IoT devices. Takeaways from smart healthcare systems: Supported
    by Table 4, the reviewed efforts in smart healthcare covered 𝑌 1 and 𝑌 2 , while
    𝑌 3 and 𝑌 4 are yet to be explored. However, despite O-RAN’s achievements in smart
    healthcare, there is a need for more efforts to transition the several objectives
    in smart healthcare to reality as well as healthcare-compatible specifications,
    standards and tools facilitating the development of enhanced solutions that preserve
    the end-to-end privacy and security of the patient’s data. Table 4. Summary of
    O-RAN in smart healthcare systems. 3.5. Smart Energy Systems The smart energy
    system, such as the smart grid, involves integrating modern communication and
    information technologies with the energy sector to create a more interconnected,
    efficient, and sustainable energy ecosystem by applying digital solutions to energy
    generation, distribution, consumption, and management. The smart energy system
    leverages data analytics, automation, and real-time communication to optimize
    energy systems, enhance grid stability, and support the integration of distributed
    energy resources (DER). Some candidate systems in smart energy systems include
    smart grids, energy management and optimization systems, renewable energy integration
    mechanisms, demand response programs, microgrids, and energy trading schemes.
    With 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks, the smart energy system targets the revolution
    of the entire energy sector by supporting efficient, flexible, and responsive
    energy systems. This can be achieved in several ways. Starting from ensuring low
    latency, facilitating real-time communication between various energy assets, sensors,
    and control systems to maintain grid stability, respond quickly to supply and
    demand fluctuations, and ensure the reliability of energy services to providing
    the massive connectivity required by the smart energy system to connect a wide
    range of devices, like the smart meters, sensors, DERs, energy storage systems,
    and electric vehicles as well as providing the necessary bandwidth required for
    transmitting large amounts of data in real-time, especially for the essential
    applications requiring high-resolution energy consumption monitoring, real-time
    analytics, and video surveillance of energy infrastructures [84]. When the O-RAN
    concept is extended to smart energy applications, it will yield more flexibly
    connected, efficient, and collaborative energy systems supporting enhanced communication,
    improved management of DERs, better grid stability, and increased flexibility
    in adapting to evolving energy demands. For example, Mongay et al. [61] presented
    5G as a promising enabler of smart energy systems and supported that with an O-RAN-based
    beamforming case study. Similarly, Kundacina et al. [85] proposed how 5G will
    support the next generation’s smart distributed state estimation of PMU-based
    WAMS in near-real-time. Takeaways from smart energy systems: Supported by Table
    5, the reviewed efforts in smart energy systems covered 𝑌 1 and 𝑌 2 , while 𝑌
    3 and 𝑌 4 remain open for further investigation. However, despite O-RAN’s achievements
    in smart energy systems, there is a need for more real-time operating ideas to
    maintain the integrity of the operating environment’s data, minimizing interference
    in the transmission medium, which will improve the system’s resilience to threats.
    Table 5. Summary of O-RAN in smart energy systems. Finally, as depicted in Table
    6, the O-RAN-IoT convergence helps to minimize IoT devices’ energy consumption.
    In particular, computation tasks can be offloaded from the participating nodes
    to the network edge in the representative CPS (smart transportation, smart manufacturing,
    smart energy grids, smart healthcare, etc). The network edge can leverage the
    O-RAN to promote openness and intelligence in addition to virtualization, scalability,
    and flexibility provided by the proprietary C-RAN and V-RAN. The openness in the
    edge offers the opportunity for heterogeneous computation and communication tasks
    to be jointly optimized and executed for latency reduction, which translates to
    the cost-effective energy consumption of participating IoT devices. Taking the
    computation offloading case [86] as an example, offloading points, processing
    speed, offloading ratio, and transmission power were jointly optimized within
    the edge. Since computation is carried out in the O-RAN-based edge and only the
    results are sent back to the participating nodes (IoT devices) via the downlink
    channel; this avoids traffic congestion, drastically reducing the energy consumption
    of IoT devices. Illustratively, in the smart transportation system, by minimizing
    the offloading delay in an open collaborative edge [64], the convergence leads
    to a massive communication latency reduction, a stringent requirement for the
    effective communication of autonomous vehicles. Likewise, in the smart healthcare
    system, the convergence can considerably reduce the cost associated with remote
    healthcare giving, just like the case of the OpenCare5G project [62], where the
    O-RAN concept was used to realize an interoperable architecture housing hardware
    and software, virtual machines and cloud-based open interfaces developed by different
    healthcare vendors. Table 6. State-of-the-art benefits of O-RAN-based IoT systems.
    4. Challenges and Future Research Directions This section outlines several challenges
    and suggests some future research directions. Some of the challenges listed are
    interoperability and standardization, robust, scalable solutions, AI for O-RAN,
    and security and privacy. Future research directions include O-RAN for IoT applications,
    security and privacy in O-RAN, explainable AI for IoT and O-RAN integration and
    standardization, and research and development. 4.1. Challenges Based on the investigation
    conducted in this study, it is clear that O-RAN can support IoT systems in several
    ways. However, these systems comprise diverse devices used by different application
    domains with different communication protocols to achieve their respective goals.
    This could lead to several challenges that need to be addressed before these systems
    can be widely deployed. We have summarized the challenges based on the dimensions
    below. 4.1.1. Interoperability and Standardization Interoperability between IoT
    and O-RAN will be a significant challenge for integrating the two systems because
    they comprise various devices from different manufacturers, cross-layer networking
    topologies, and edge computing vendors, having their respective communication
    protocols and standards. These devices span various application domains (transportation,
    industry, healthcare, energy, etc.), where each application has its unique requirements
    and data formats. Second, O-RAN uses standard communication protocols like the
    5G NR. In contrast, IoT devices use various IoT-specific protocols (e.g., MQTT,
    CoAP, AMQP, etc.). Most IoT devices have limited battery power. At the same time,
    the O-RAN concept is more complex and battery-demanding than the traditional RANs.
    Lastly, the development, validation, and testing tools are imperfect for extending
    the O-RAN concept into IoT systems. Most of the efforts reviewed in this study
    are either complex (computation-expensive), static (does not scale to environmental
    changes and demands), visionary (theory/hypothesis, yet to be implemented), vulnerable
    to threats, or even undeployable (needs thorough testing/validation) in some cases.
    There is a need for standards, tools, and specifications that guarantee the integration
    and interoperability operation of these systems. The O-RAN Alliance has dedicated
    several focus groups working to ensure that the O-RAN vision comes to fruition
    [87]. Similarly, there is a need for a dedicated group that engages O-RAN and
    IoT standardization and research communities to investigate the feasible ways
    O-RAN could be an idea match for IoT systems. At this juncture, there is not much
    published research reporting the possible ways of integrating O-RAN interfaces
    with IoT applications. How to implement IoT-specific protocols, such as RFID,
    NB-IoT, LoRAWAN, etc., in O-RAN still needs to be discovered and investigated.
    Most of the research efforts are visions and discussions for the future study.
    However, it is critical to dedicate a focus group within the O-RAN Alliance community
    that engages the IoT research community to develop standards and specifications
    for O-RAN to IoT integration. After that, the yielded specifications will be helpful
    to the research on a theoretical foundation and analysis, modeling and simulation
    testbeds, among others. 4.1.2. Robust and Scalable Solutions Realising robust,
    dynamic, and adaptive O-RAN-based IoT solutions that shrink or scale based on
    the operating environment requirements is hectic. This is because of the diverging
    QoS and reliability criteria to be satisfied by the emerging systems. For example,
    the systems are expected to scale either vertically or horizontally to accommodate
    the increasing number of connected devices and be equipped with efficient network
    management mechanisms for handling their dynamic resource allocation based on
    the demands of IoT applications. Similarly, as the system complexity grows, the
    attack surface for potential security threats also increases. Conflicts may also
    emerge when the IoT devices employ incompatible communication protocols with the
    O-RAN architecture. Scalability challenges may also arise when IoT systems need
    to ensure seamless cross-domain integration with legacy networks, cloud, or data
    centers. In addition, the vast amount of data generated will require scalable
    analytics to generate relevant insights that benefit the operating environment.
    The entire system lifecycle management strategies need to be scalably dynamic
    and efficient, starting from onboarding, provisioning, and firmware updates. Optimized
    communication protocols and mechanisms that extend the battery life of these devices
    will also be required. The system will need to handle a massive variety of new
    IoT device applications and services to be developed in the future. In other words,
    resilient solutions that scale to the operating environment dynamics remain open
    for the research community to solve. 4.1.3. AI for O-RAN AI can support the O-RAN
    network by enhancing its performance, efficiency, and adaptability. On the other
    hand, AI deployment in O-RAN is not free from challenges. As for the areas of
    support, with the intervention of the RIC, i.e., rApps/xApps, intelligence could
    be deployed in O-RAN to yield an efficient network-slicing method. This will dynamically
    slice the network to meet the needs of different IoT applications, enhance edge
    intelligence by offloading computation to the edge of the network, improving the
    performance and reducing the latency of IoT applications. It will also optimize
    resource allocation in the network (bandwidth, power, etc.), enhancing IoT application
    performance and reducing costs. Furthermore, it could orchestrate the deployment
    and operation of IoT applications across the network, ensuring that applications
    are deployed most efficiently to facilitate effective communication. The challenges
    include data quality and availability, as AI models and algorithms require large
    amounts of data to train and learn. This is a challenge in O-RAN, as the data
    are distributed across multiple networks and devices. The quality of the data
    that are used as the input to train AI models and algorithms is essential for
    the accuracy of the results. The IoT data pipeline, especially for intelligent
    systems such as smart transportation, healthcare, energy, etc., is critical when
    integrating IoT with O-RAN. This is because the nature of data pipelines determines
    the quality of AI/ML model output and data analytic tools. However, the data used
    in O-RAN networks are sometimes noisy and unreliable. Distributed AI algorithms
    are primarily complex and computationally expensive to train and run. This can
    be a challenge for O-RAN-based networks, which are mostly resource-constrained.
    Similarly, AI models and algorithms can be challenging to interpret, which makes
    it much more difficult to understand why they make certain decisions. This can
    be a challenge for O-RAN operators, who need to be able to trust the decisions
    made by AI models and algorithms. Finally, AI models and algorithms can be biased,
    leading to unfair or discriminatory results. These challenges need to be addressed
    for effective intelligence deployment in O-RAN networks. 4.1.4. Security and Privacy
    O-RAN has a core networking infrastructure to support smart IoT systems, but the
    significance of the security and privacy of the system and its data cannot be
    overemphasized. There are inherent layer-wise IoT security and O-RAN privacy concerns,
    which can be transferred to the O-RAN for IoT systems. For instance, by launching
    denial of service (DoS) attacks on communication channels between the IoT system
    and O-RAN, adversaries can disrupt the network established by the network protocols
    and prevent communication between the two systems. Additionally, O-RAN, as a new
    architecture, opens an additional vulnerability interface, which has left the
    research community with questions such as the following: What are the security
    vulnerabilities to be realized from the emerging system? How do we deal with such
    vulnerabilities to lead to trustworthy security of O-RAN systems for IoT applications?
    As evident from the previous sections, supporting IoT systems with O-RAN will
    yield several promising benefits in terms of automation, cost savings, and interoperability
    while increasing the system’s attack surfaces, i.e., exposing the resulting system
    to several security threats that need to be taken care of to ensure the integrity,
    confidentiality, and availability of the connected devices and data. Considering
    the sensing unit, for example, adversaries can spoof the system to gain unauthorized
    access, thereby corrupting the data generated by the sensing unit with the aid
    of malicious codes, hardware Trojans, etc., or launch DoS/DDoS attacks by depleting
    the batteries of the narrow-band IoT sensing devices to make their services unavailable
    as well as acting as a man in the middle (MITM) between the industrial controllers
    among others. The processing unit is responsible for cleaning, filtering, and
    aggregating the data generated using the networked edge/cloud computing infrastructure
    that can provision data-driven ML/AI models to assist system security. In this
    unit, the adversaries can launch attacks that hinder the integrity and availability
    of the generated data, for example, a jamming attack (damaging the data using
    irrelevant signals), a hijacking attack that renders the services unavailable,
    or a social engineering attack by misguiding the unit stakeholders. The literature
    has recorded several attacks targeting the protocols, transmission channels, and
    standards used by the traditional communication unit. However, the O-RAN-based
    communication unit is exposed to new versions of attacks targeting each layer
    of the O-RAN setting. The non-RT-RIC guides and orchestrates the RAN using data-driven
    policies deployed on containerized rApps, while the N-RT-RIC executes the policies
    with the aid of the containerized xApps. Under openness in the system, adversaries
    can inject malicious codes into the rApps/xApps as a backdoor or adversarial examples
    to destabilize the system’s operation by compromising the guiding data or the
    model. The existence of different xApps/rApps, as demonstrated in Figure 4, can
    result in several conflicts while achieving the interoperability goal. Adversaries
    can leverage this loophole to misconfigure and disrupt the decisions made by the
    operating apps or the radio resource management, for example, to degrade the system’s
    performance or even trigger DoS attacks that will shut down the RIC. The disaggregated
    components (CU, DU, RU) serve as another attack target: network functions deployed
    on the cloud expose the system to internal and external attacks. On the path to
    enabling interoperability, the open interfaces expose the system to several threats
    like MITM, DoS, radio jamming, etc., which are targeted towards the different
    levels of communication units. Figure 4. Attack spaces in O-RAN assisted IoT systems.
    The services unit integrates the preceding processes from the previous units to
    yield an effective, efficient operating environment for the users. In this unit,
    adversaries could inject malicious scripts into the system to launch phishing
    attacks or even attempt to hijack the control unit’s safe operation, rendering
    the system unavailable. 4.2. Future Research Directions 4.2.1. O-RAN for IoT Applications
    Designing O-RAN that supports IoT applications effectively will involve considering
    scalability, flexibility, resource efficiency, and seamless integration with the
    diverse IoT devices and use cases, i.e., starting from scalable architectures
    that support low power, high data rates, and higher-performance devices to dynamic
    network slicing capabilities implemented in dedicated virtual networks for different
    IoT use cases where each slice is customized to meet specific IoT application
    requirements. Traffic models and analysis on IoT applications can characterize
    the traffic generated by IoT applications and improve the efficacy of network
    resource management [88]. QoS differentiation mechanisms can prioritize critical
    IoT applications to allocate network resources accordingly, as well as robust
    security by design standards that protect IoT devices and data by enforcing continuous
    monitoring, authentication, encryption, and threat detection mechanisms tailored
    to IoT requirements. Seamless integration with edge computing infrastructures
    can enable real-time data processing and decision-making while reducing latency
    for time-sensitive IoT applications. The development of standardized interfaces
    and protocols can promote interoperability among different devices, vendors, IoT
    applications, and energy-efficient communication protocols that boost the lifetime
    of the battery-powered devices, as well as facilitate cross-domain orchestration
    and communication. Dynamic frequency allocation mechanisms that optimize spectrum
    usage while minimizing interference among IoT devices will also be required, as
    will APIs and interfaces that enable third-party developers and IoT solution providers
    to innovate and integrate with O-RAN. For O-RAN to remain relevant in supporting
    the next-generation IoT applications, the O-RAN concept should remain adaptable
    and evolving to meet the changing dynamics of IoT applications. This can only
    be achieved with continuous research and development involving collaboration among
    standardization bodies and industry technocrats to align O-RAN standards with
    emerging IoT standards to ensure seamless integration and compatibility. As described
    in Section 2, O-RAN has defined standardized interfaces (eCPRI, Fronthaul, F1,
    O1, etc.) to promote flexibility and interoperability among cellular vendors for
    yielding lower operational and capital expenditures. In this context, with the
    aid of the network slicing concepts introduced by 5G, these interfaces, if standardized
    for IoT applications, could promote interoperability within and among IoT systems,
    just like in the case of the production line of a smart factory as demonstrated
    in [59] or the traffic steering process as depicted in [57]. Traditionally, IoT
    communications utilize short-range communication technologies such as BLE, GSM,
    Wi-Fi, ZigBee, etc. Recently, IoT connectivity has been extended to long-range,
    low-power WAN (LPWAN), such as LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox, and LoRa. Integrating
    5G networks with LPWAN technologies based on new architecture such as O-RAN will
    significantly improve IoT service use cases for industrial automation, smart cities,
    and other applications [89,90]. Note that how to effectively integrate O-RAN interfaces
    with IoT applications or implement IoT-specific protocols like the RFID, NB-IoT,
    LoRAWAN, etc., in O-RAN remain unsolved problems that require further research
    concerning system modeling, simulation, and empirical evaluations. Even though
    NB-IoT operates alongside the LTE in the same frequency band, it is evident that
    the next-generation IoT applications [91] have diverging QoS and reliability requirements
    that NB-IoT cannot directly satisfy, for instance, live-streaming video surveillance
    in smart cities or remote surgery in healthcare, which are both high-bandwidth
    and low-latency applications, or autonomous vehicles, which have stringent latency
    of 1 ms and high mobility requirements. NB-IoT is only ideal for supporting massive
    connectivity-intensive applications requiring data rates up to 254 kbps, which
    does not have mobility [92]. Among the feasible directions for addressing this
    issue will be dedicating a focus group within the O-RAN Alliance community which
    will engage both research and standardization communities to develop standards
    and specifications for enabling O-RAN as a viable network infrastructure to support
    IoT applications. After that, the yielded specifications could guide the research
    community’s efforts towards developing theoretical foundation and analysis, modeling,
    and simulation testbeds, etc., until the interoperability and integration vision
    becomes a reality. 4.2.2. Security and Privacy in O-RAN Dealing with security
    and privacy issues in O-RAN will require ongoing strategies involving continuous
    monitoring, assessment, and adaptation to evolving threats and regulations by
    implementing various measures and best practices to protect the network, devices,
    and data. Starting from end-to-end encryption protocols, access control mechanisms,
    robust authentication and authorization strategies, network segmentation, intrusion
    detection, and prevention methods, based on Figure 4, it is clear that individual
    security and privacy enforcement strategies are ineffective for O-RAN and emerging
    IoT systems. There is a need for security and privacy by design principles, where
    security and privacy measures are integrated into the design and development of
    these systems right from the beginning. In this context, the emerging O-RAN-based
    IoT systems should integrate security and privacy-preserving features, mechanisms,
    and best practices throughout the system’s entire lifecycle, from its conceptualization
    and design to its deployment and maintenance. For example, at the initial stage,
    the system’s threat surface should be identified and modeled to identify the potential
    security threats and vulnerabilities the system may face to guide the implementation
    of appropriate security controls. This will catalyze the realization of secured
    end-to-end architecture in the future that is designed with robust authentication
    mechanisms, access control strategies, and data encryption protocols to protect
    sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Incorporating secure communication
    protocols shall ensure data transmitted between IoT devices and the O-RAN network
    is encrypted and protected from interception. Also, the system should implement
    continuous monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents in
    real time. One example of the security and privacy by design principle is the
    zero-trust architecture (ZTA), where every player is considered an adversary unless
    verified to be proven otherwise. The approach necessitates the continuous authentication,
    authorization, and monitoring of every network stakeholder requesting or providing
    resources to enhance security and reduce the risk of data breaches by minimizing
    the attack surface and limiting lateral movement within the network [93]. According
    to some recent research works conducted by [94,95], the ZTA concept has been applied
    to secure several facets of safety-critical infrastructures. This includes communication
    networks and O-RAN on the one hand [95,96,97] and the different IoT domains on
    the other [98,99,100,101]. However, as is obvious from Figure 4, there is a need
    to develop ZTA to preserve the security and privacy of O-RAN-based IoT systems.
    Likewise, the open capability of O-RAN interfaces and the heterogeneous nature
    of IoT provide opportunities for malicious actors [102]. One of the leading security
    groups, namely, the O-RAN Alliance Security Work Group, is continuously investigating
    the security challenges and defining O-RAN security solutions [103]. Among the
    feasible directions for overcoming this is the zero trust architecture (ZTA),
    which is currently on course for its standardization by the security focus group
    of the O-RAN Alliance community. To summarize, a body of mechanisms concerning
    security resilient design, AI-empowered threat detection and recognition, response,
    and recovery, considering the performance requirements of IoT applications, should
    be systematically studied. To this end, developing the integrated modeling, analysis,
    simulation, emulation, and testbed-based evaluation study should be carried out.
    In this way, systematically understanding the foundational capability and limitation
    of threats and the ability of defense schemes in the context of O-RAN enable IoT
    systems should be investigated. 4.2.3. Explainable AI for IoT and O-RAN Integration
    One critical problem governing AI models and algorithms in AI-based O-RAN decision
    making requires transparency. This causes difficulties for network operators in
    identifying issues and root causes and further controlling the network with desired
    behaviors. Consequently, incorporating XAI into the O-RAN system management operations
    process to learn how AI/ML models and algorithms make decisions and find ways
    to validate them. Thus, to explain their outputs explicitly, running AI-based
    rApps/xApps should contain XAI approaches. This would enhance the accuracy and
    openness of outcomes made by these systems and the network operators optimize
    the functionalities of networks, leading to efficient network operations and services
    to IoT applications. For instance, rApps/xApps can be developed with large language
    model (LLM) capabilities to provide on-demand and real-time feedback to IoT systems.
    Developing a naturalistic AI solution for O-RAN will involve integrating natural
    language understanding and generation capabilities with O-RAN infrastructure to
    enhance network management, troubleshooting, and communication. This will make
    it easier for network administrators to interact with complex networking infrastructures
    using natural language and improve network operations’ responsiveness and accuracy.
    Several factors shall be considered before bringing such solutions to fruition
    [104]. 4.2.4. Standardization Research and Development Despite the challenges,
    the reviewed efforts presented in Section 3 can be regarded as preliminary results
    supporting the feasibility of integrating the O-RAN concept into IoT architecture
    to support the next-generation IoT systems. However, there is a need for collaborative
    efforts in this direction from academia, industries, and all the relevant bodies
    involved in transitioning these visionary ideas into reality. This can be achieved
    by establishing a collaborative IoT ecosystem housing device manufacturers, solution
    developers, and focus groups dedicated to IoT within the O-RAN Alliance community
    to focus on IoT-related standards, use cases, and best practices. Similarly, research
    and development should be geared toward simulation tools and testbeds to motivate
    proof of concept developments and validation before deployments. Some efforts
    have been recorded in this direction, which led to the development of an “open-ran
    gym” [37] for end-to-end or comprehensive design and testing of data-driven xApps,
    “ns-O-RAN” [105] for simulating O-RAN solutions in ns-3 [106], and “NS3-O-RAN”
    [107] for simulating O-RAN-based AI/ML solutions in ns-3, etc. These efforts primarily
    focused on the O-RAN concept. There needs to be more effort to develop testing/validation
    tools for O-RAN-based IoT systems. Finally, investments in training programs to
    develop a skilled workforce capable of designing, deploying, and managing O-RAN
    networks should be encouraged in all facets of teaching and learning. This should
    include formal and informal training on technical aspects and best practices.
    5. Final Remarks IoT systems consist of physical devices and various objects connected
    and integrated with monitoring and control capabilities, which can be applied
    to numerous critical infrastructure systems in energy, transportation, and cities,
    among others. With the advancement of information communication technology, IoT
    systems can be enabled by sensors/actuators and other enabling technologies, which
    support data collection and exchange and derive intelligent decisions to guide
    their operations based on the collected data via viable data science and machine
    learning technologies. The advancements in cellular networks, i.e., 5G and beyond,
    have enabled these systems to achieve their required connectivity. However, their
    reliability and QoS across various pervasive domains require more effective, economical,
    and adequate solutions. In this paper, we have investigated the applications of
    O-RAN in this context by conducting a literature survey to determine how openness
    in the RAN, as a critical networking infrastructure, can support the next-generation
    IoT systems. This research proposes a problem space covering IoT systems: transportation,
    industry, healthcare, and energy; targets; reliable communication, real-time analytics,
    fault tolerance, interoperability and integration, and AI/ML; and RL and DNNs.
    We have outlined several challenges militating against integrating these concepts
    and future research directions guiding how to design O-RAN for IoT applications
    and deal with emerging security and privacy issues, natural AI solutions in O-RAN,
    and finally, the standardization, research, and development efforts required in
    the forthcoming years. In the future, we plan to extend this research by investigating
    the feasible simulation tools, experimental testbeds, and other supporting technologies
    that could be leveraged to transform the interoperability and integration ( 𝑌
    4 ) vision into fruition, as well as the systematical exploration of threats and
    the design of countermeasures to deal with the security and privacy ( 𝑌 3 ) of
    the emerging O-RAN-based IoT system. Funding This research received no external
    funding. Data Availability Statement Not applicable, the study does not report

  description: Semantic knowledge representations in the IoT can enable the vision
    of autonomic computing by providing a specification that enables interoperability
    and reasoning. Nevertheless, semantic representations in IoT have focused on describing
    the elements that compose it and their interactions, without addressing the challenges
    of the logical evolution of a system (updating and design of new algorithms).
    This work focuses on this gap, proposing the Taxonomy for Decision Making in IoT
    Systems (TDMIoT), a high-level characterization of decision-making processes in
    IoT developed following a conceptual-empirical methodological approach. TDMIoT
    considers a decision-making process a problem-solution association aiming to deliver
    a semantic representation that can be used as a design framework to support changes
    or even the design of new decision processes. A systematic review of the literature
    on decision-making processes in IoT application domains was conducted to evaluate
    the taxonomy as a classification scheme. A summary of the state-of-the-art decision-making
    process design approaches was generated from the classification of the selected
    studies through the systematic review. The classification showed design bias regarding
    the decision processes. For instance, most studies have focused on decision processes
    with prediction as an objective, and the most widely used algorithmic approach
    has been data-driven. In addition, the taxonomy was used to develop the COVID-19
    Crowd Management project to test its usefulness as a design framework. In this
    regard, TDMIoT narrowed the search for decision models, validating its effectiveness
    in selecting an algorithmic approach for a given objective.

    • Semantic knowledge representation for the design of decision processes in IoT
    domains. • Determine the applicability of an algorithmic approach given a decision
    problem. • Conceptual framework to classify decision-making approaches in the

    This work focuses on this gap, proposing the Taxonomy for Decision Making in IoT
    Systems (TDMIoT), a high-level characterization of decision-making processes in

    considers a decision-making process a problem-solution association aiming to deliver
    a semantic representation that can be used as a design framework to support changes
    or even the design of new decision processes. A systematic review of the literature

    algorithmsProblem-solution association 1. Introduction 1.1. Context The inherent
    characteristics of IoT, such as interoperability, heterogeneity, scale, and dynamism
    [1], along with the wide variety of deployment environments, represent a challenge
    for the development, upgrade, and maintenance of IoT-based systems. To address
    the challenges imposed by IoT characteristics, IoT-based systems should handle
    the unexpected behaviors produced by the diversity of interactions between physical
    and virtual elements with an automated approach focused on interoperability. In
    this regard, the IoT can benefit from the autonomic computing approach, which
    enables the self-management of systems based on high-level objectives, and present
    the following properties: self-optimization, self-configuration, self-healing,
    and self-protection [2]. Developing an IoT-based system is quite a challenge,
    being a critical concern to anticipate and design solutions to behaviors and phenomena
    that could eventually emerge from new or existing system interactions that give
    rise to new requirements. An autonomic IoT-based system would be able to adapt
    to these new requirements without human intervention overcoming the challenges
    posed by the IoT characteristics. Fig. 1 exhibits a graphical representation of
    this idea. The MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) [3] loop represents
    the foundational paradigm to develop autonomic systems, and several works in the
    IoT field have integrated this paradigm [4], [5], [6], [7]. This work is focused
    on the knowledge block and provides a specific artifact, the Taxonomy of Decision
    Making in IoT Systems (TDMIoT). This taxonomy provides a high-level characterization
    of the decision processes used in the IoT. Download : Download high-res image

    To integrate autonomic computing within the IoT, semantic knowledge bases are
    needed. Nevertheless, despite the importance of the decision-making processes,
    semantic models in the IoT have a focus on describing the elements that interact
    (sensors, actuators, services, environment, etc.) [8], [9], [10], [11], [12],
    [13], [14], [15], defining service specification [16], [17], [18] or stating the
    metrics to select a service [19]. While these representations enable interoperability
    between devices and services, they do not improve the adaptability regarding logical
    functionality to upgrade or develop decision-making processes. Characterizing
    the decision-making processes focusing on the algorithmic approach can provide
    the generalities associated for this objective. To represent such characterization,
    a taxonomy can be particularly useful as it provides common terminology to enable
    interoperability and a better understanding of relationships between the classified
    objects; it can also help to identify gaps in the knowledge available [20]. Furthermore,
    from a computational point of view, taxonomies are semantic tools and are the
    base structure to develop ontologies [21]. 1.3. Motivation and contribution IoT
    is a technology with wide domain applicability, where every domain presents its
    own particularities. Nevertheless, the algorithms used in decision-making processes
    are the same across the different IoT application domains. This work addresses
    the characterization of the decision-making processes involved in the different
    IoT application domains and provides TDMIoT, a taxonomy focused on the algorithmic
    design of decision-making processes that considers a decision process as a problem-solution
    association and has the following objectives: • To provide a conceptual framework
    to classify decision-making approaches and provide a common vocabulary. • Identify
    the relationships between the different decision-making processes. This can enable
    the mapping of relationships among the different elements, support the development
    or upgrade of decision processes, and lay out the foundation of a knowledge base
    to enable the self-configuration property regarding the evolution of the logical
    functionality. • Support changes or even design new decision processes in the
    different IoT application domains. The contributions of this paper are the following:
    (i) a review of concepts and techniques for decision-making models and processes
    in the IoT; (ii) a taxonomy proposal that researchers and developers can use to
    support the design of decision-making processes; (iii) validation of the proposed
    taxonomy through a systematic review in the IoT domains and a case of study. 1.4.
    Paper organization This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes different
    studies on characterizing decision-making processes. Section 3 presents the objectives
    and research methodology. In Section 4, TDMIoT is described. Section 5 presents
    the validation mechanisms and assessment. Section 6 contains a list of TDMIoT
    implications and future directions. Finally, in section, 7, conclusions are presented.
    2. Related work Recent taxonomies in the IoT have focused on describing aspects
    related to cybersecurity [23], [24], [25], the IoT elements [8], [9], [10], [11],
    [12], [13], [14], [15], data [26], [27], services [16], [17], [18], [19], AI algorithms
    [28], and the specifications for an application domain [29], [30], [31], [32],
    [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. This work addresses the gap in relation to
    the semantic representation of decision-making processes in the IoT. The systemic
    review presented at [22] confirms that the topics for which a taxonomy has been
    defined have been consistent in recent years, leaving aside the semantic representation
    of the decision making of an IoT system. Fig. 2 summarizes IoT decision-making
    taxonomies and groups them according to the purpose of the taxonomy, which can
    be a design artifact (explain dimensions and relationships, standardize concepts,
    and support decision-making)) or a review tool (determine the boundaries of a
    topic, discover gaps and classification) [39]. Taxonomies on decision making as
    design artifacts are scarce in IoT; however, the multi-agent and self-adaptive
    computing literature presents taxonomies as design artifacts. It should be noted
    that both areas present challenges similar to those of IoT. Regarding the analysis
    of decision making in IoT, Fig. 2 presents the related work classified in terms
    of the process, model, and problems involved. This research aims to provide a
    taxonomy that serves as a design artifact and characterize decision problems within
    the IoT application domains. In this regard, the related work is divided into
    two subsections: Taxonomies and Decision Analysis. The first subsection addresses
    the taxonomical representation of decision-making processes (Decision-making block
    in Fig. 2). The second subsection deals with the related works that carry out
    a general analysis regarding the processes, models and problems involved in decision
    making (Analysis Block in Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (480KB)

    [26], [27], [28], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49],
    [49], [50], [51], [59], [60], [61]). 2.1. Taxonomies focused on decision-making
    In the IoT, taxonomies focusing on the decision-making process are scarce. Other
    areas within computer sciences, such as self-adaptive and multiagent systems,
    have focused on designing robust decision-making processes. Decision-making models
    in these areas must identify when a system requires an adjustment or determine
    the following action of an agent with limited information. In this regard, both
    areas offer taxonomies related to the decision-making process. In the self-adaptative
    systems area, the works [40], [41], [42] have focused on identifying the types
    of uncertainty to which these systems are exposed. They present taxonomies to
    characterize uncertainty. However, these models may be unsuitable for the IoT
    due to its particular characteristics, such as the heterogeneity of devices, interconnectivity,
    dynamism, and scale of the network [1]. In the multiagents systems area, the works
    described in [43], [44] focus on characterizing decision problems, and they use
    taxonomies to accomplish. For instance, the taxonomy proposed by [43] characterizes
    a decision problem from an agent requirements perspective; it is useful for selecting
    an algorithm but does not specify whether it can classify decision problems involving
    heterogeneous agents. In [44], the taxonomy classifies problems that belong to
    the domain of multiobjective decisions; it considers heterogeneous agents, but
    its classification is limited to a specific type of decision problem. The works
    [45], and [46], characterize decision models. The former focuses on sequential
    decision models, while the latter focuses on decision models in general. Both
    characterizations are useful as they offer comparisons and application examples,
    but the characterization only considers the disciplines to which these models
    are related. Although these works offer us basic knowledge about decision-making
    models, the perspective of the process as such is addressed in a limited way.
    In the field of IoT, most taxonomies have primarily focused on describing Things,
    Security, or the IoT system as a whole [47]. The works on decision-making taxonomies
    focus on classifying algorithms rather than characterizing the problem to be solved
    and its possible solution. For instance, [48], [49] classify big data techniques,
    which are fundamental for some decision processes; however, none of these works
    acknowledges the relationship between the decision problem and the techniques
    presented. In [50], authors analyze decision models for cognitive IoT and classify
    them within their discipline. In [51], a characterization of models and methods
    for decision-making under uncertainty is presented. The resulting classification
    scheme focuses on resource management in networks and the categories are proposed
    according to the method utilized to make the decision. Although a list of decision
    models under uncertainty is presented, no analysis is performed to study the relationships
    between the models. None of the aforementioned taxonomies have focused on the
    decision-making process in general nor specifically, as presented in this paper,
    regarding the relationship between a decision problem and its decision-making
    algorithm. 2.2. Decision analysis Decision analysis entails the theoretic and
    methodological aspects to approach a decision problem systematically [52]. In
    computer science the decision analysis has been focused on developing methodologies
    [53], creating frameworks to approach decision problems [54] or to replicate human
    behavior [55]. In decision analysis, a decision problem is approached by breaking
    it down into small elements and structuring those elements. This is in fact a
    characterization process. [56] proposed an initial characterization of the decision
    process that divided the decision process into three stages: intelligence, design,
    and choice; this work has been the basis of different characterizations of decision
    processes. However, characterizations and the analysis associated with their development
    may vary. Considering this, Table 1 presents different characterizations related
    to decision analysis that are relevant to this work. The works reviewed in this
    paper address the representation of knowledge applied to decision making. Table

    and development approach The main objective of this work is to produce a taxonomy
    that characterizes the decision processes in the IoT application domains and enables
    the association of a decision problem with an algorithmic approach. To this end,
    a research and development (R&D) methodology was applied. The methodology consists
    of two phases; the first is about taxonomy development and is based on the conceptual-empirical
    approach proposed by [62]; and the second is about the application of the developed
    taxonomy as a knowledge representation. This section presents the specific objectives
    of the research and the methodology followed to develop TDMIoT. 3.1. Objectives
    The TDMIoT taxonomy aims to meet three specific objectives: 1. Analyze the state-of-the-art
    decision-making processes in IoT, considering the decision process as a problem-solution
    association. 2. Provide a better understanding of relationships between the elements
    of the decision-making process in IoT systems. 3. Serve as a semantic tool for
    algorithmic design in decision-making processes for IoT. 3.2. Methodology Fig.
    3 presents the methodology followed. This methodology consists of two phases:
    development and deployment. The first phase focuses on the development of a taxonomy,
    and it is divided into three stages: (i) Conceptualization: the guidelines are
    established; (ii) Analysis: a study is carried out to collect and manage the metadata
    that will be used to iterate the taxonomy; (iii) Refinement: this stage is about
    improving the structure. The second phase focuses on the application and evaluation
    of the taxonomy produced and consists of a single stage called Research Evaluation.
    This is the final stage in the R&D methodology and involves the evaluation of
    the taxonomy as a novel design asset in new deployments and exploratory designs.
    In other words, based on the resulting metacharacteristics and the classification
    performed as part of the design engineering process, an algorithm is then selected.

    Fig. 3. Research and development methodology. 3.2.1. TDMIoT conceptualization
    In this stage, the study guidelines are generated and a first taxonomy proposal
    is defined. The steps of this stage are: the definition of a meta-characteristic,
    the specification of the final conditions, and a first conceptualization of the
    taxonomy. These steps are described below: • Determine the meta-characteristic.
    This work attempts to characterize the decision-making process in IoT systems
    as a problem-solution association. Therefore, to analyze the decision processes
    presented in the reviewed literature, the following questions were established:
    1. Who made the decision? 2. What was the decision goal? 3. What elements were
    involved in the decision? 4. What algorithms were selected? These questions are
    formulated to study how these aspects influence the selection of a decision-making
    model and algorithm. • Determine ending conditions. The development of a taxonomy
    is an iterative process. To complete this process, the ending conditions must
    be defined. The ending conditions guarantee finding a taxonomy that meets the
    qualitative and quantitative attributes. The methodology proposed by [62] refers
    to the subjective ending conditions as the criteria that must be met to achieve
    the qualitative attributes (consistency, robustness, explainability, completeness
    and expandability); while the objective ending conditions are those that seek
    to satisfy the quantitative attributes that refer to the number of dimensions
    and characteristics. • First conceptualization of taxonomy. Based on empirical
    knowledge about IoT decision processes, the first draft of the taxonomy is created.
    In the case of TDMIoT it comprises four dimensions: Processing, Objective, Interaction,
    and Uncertainty. This first draft serves as a starting point to begin the iterative
    process of development. 3.2.2. TDMIoT analysis At this stage, the main objective
    is to develop the tools to refine the taxonomy. To do this, a systematic review
    of the literature on decision processes in IoT application domains is carried
    out and the guidelines for a case study are defined. These tools (the systematic
    review and guidelines) were selected according to the objectives of TDMIoT. The
    steps of this stage are described below: • Systematic review. To develop TDMIoT
    as a classification artifact, a systematic review of research studies focused
    on decision-making processes in IoT application domains was conducted based on
    [63], see Fig. 4. The systemic review methodology considers the following steps:
    preparation, retrieval, appraisal and synthesis. The systematic review carried
    out in this work focused on the Scopus database, considering the study by [64],
    which indicates that this database contains the largest number of articles indexed
    in the area of computational sciences. The preparation step considers four elements:
    research question, general criteria, keywords, inclusion, criteria and exclusion
    criteria. The defined research question was from an algorithmic point of view,
    how is it approached the decision making processes in study cases across different
    IoT application domains?. As a general criterion, articles from the IoT area that
    were cataloged in the sub-areas of Engineering, Decision Theory, and Computing
    were included. Then, the keywords decision-making and decision making under uncertainty
    were combined with keywords from the different IoT application domains. The inclusion
    criteria included: research articles describing the implementation of an algorithm
    or decision-making model, research articles that propose automated decision-making,
    and research articles that answer the questions posed in the meta-characteristic.
    The exclusion criteria consisted of algorithmic evaluation articles, articles
    involving ontologies or rule-based systems, studies with a business process modeling
    approach, etc. In the retrieval step the search resulted in 1604 articles, of
    which duplicates were removed, leaving a total of 1173. These articles were further
    processed (appraisal step) using a list of irrelevant keywords or tokens to syntactically
    filter those articles that contained such tokens in the title, giving a total
    of 958. The article titles were then semantically filtered again using the exclusion
    criteria, resulting in only 196 articles. The same type of filter was applied
    to the abstract and then to the full text, reducing the number of articles to
    81 and 56, respectively. Of these 56 articles, fifty of them addressed a decision
    problem in an IoT application domain, and six of them were not classifiable within
    an IoT domain but addressed a relevant decision problem. • Analysis based on the
    meta-characteristic. The decision processes contained in the 56 works selected
    from the systematic review were analyzed. The objective of this analysis is to
    obtain the relevant data to classify the decision processes within the proposed
    taxonomy. This analysis was carried out by extracting the answers to the questions
    posed as part of the meta-characteristic. As a result an extract for each of the
    56 articles is produced (meta-extract) containing the defined meta-characteristic.
    • Define guidelines for the study case. From a general perspective, a taxonomy
    is a tool that supports decision-making processes [20]. In this sense, classifying
    the elements that intervene in the decision-making processes in IoT systems can
    guide the users of the taxonomy in the search for an algorithm that solves their
    problem. For this, the requirements of a decision process within an IoT application
    domain were established. – Define a decision process in an IoT application domain
    using the systematic approach for problem-solving [65]. – The decision process
    should be classifiable within the taxonomy. – The decision process must not be
    rule-based. – The effectiveness of the decision process must be evaluated such
    that it accomplish its objective. – The taxonomy utility as a design framework
    must be evaluated such that it reduces the search space within the algorithmic
    approach category. • Classification in taxonomy. At this point, the goal is to
    use the data extracted from the previous steps (56 meta-extracts) to classify
    the decision processes in the first draft of TDMIoT. In this task it was possible
    to classify only 22 of the 56 meta-extracts. This means that the drafted taxonomy
    needs to be refined, in other words, new dimensions and categories are required.
    This is done in the next stage. Download : Download high-res image (500KB) Download

    refinement The structure of the taxonomy in this stage is systematically iterated
    until it meets the evaluation criteria established in the conceptualization stage.
    The workflow in each iteration involves the following: • Evaluation of the ending
    conditions. In the conceptualization stage, the ending conditions were established
    according to [62]. In this stage, these conditions are reviewed after the classification
    of the 56 meta-extracts selected. • Conceptualize new categories and characteristics.
    When the final conditions are not satisfied, a new analysis of the most relevant
    aspects of the decision-making processes is carried out based on the evaluation
    of the ending conditions, then new dimensions and characteristics are conceptualized.
    • Structure new version of the taxonomy. In this step, the new categories conceptualized
    from the previous step are structured to produce a new taxonomy. • Classify in
    taxonomy. The new version of taxonomy produced in the previous step is used to
    reclassify the 56 meta-extracts. In the development of TDMIoT, five iterations
    were required. The final version is presented in Section 4. 3.2.4. TDMIoT research
    evaluation Once an iteration of the taxonomy has satisfied the ending conditions,
    the utility of the taxonomy is evaluated. According to [20], the usefulness of
    a taxonomy as a classification tool can be determined by the extent to which it
    is capable of classifying (review) literature and applied as a general design
    framework in a case study. As a classification artifact, utility is measured by
    counting the number of works that are successfully categorized within its scope.
    The use cases of the TDMIoT taxonomy are described in Section 5. The steps of
    this stage of the proposed research and development methodology are described
    below: • Develop a study case. This step comprises all the phases within the development
    of a case study. This research is particularly about designing and developing
    a decision process in an IoT application domain. TDMIoT aims to characterize the
    decision process as a problem-solution association. An adequate characterization
    of the problem would reduce the search space of the decision-making algorithms.
    Once the problem is characterized in the case study, a solution is proposed and
    implemented for evaluation. • Classification. In this step, the meta-extracts
    are classified using the final version of the taxonomy. Then, the classification
    results are organized and structured. The structure for TDMIoT is presented in
    Fig. 5. This corresponds to the 56 meta-extracts obtained for TDMIoT. • Analysis.
    In this step, an analysis of the results is performed. The analysis focuses on
    the performance of the taxonomy in terms of its utility. This analysis is based
    on the objectives of the taxonomy. In this sense, a taxonomy as a design framework
    must be evaluated in terms of ease of use and whether it can support a new design
    to meet the defined objectives. As a classification artifact, a taxonomy should
    be able to provide semantic knowledge. For TDMIoT this is presented in detail
    in Section 5. Download : Download high-res image (824KB) Download : Download full-size

    IoT systems (TDMIoT) 4.1. Preliminaries Before presenting the proposed taxonomy,
    it is important to define concepts and terminology that will be used in the following
    sections. 4.1.1. Taxonomy Formally, a hierarchical taxonomy is defined as a set
    of categories or dimensions , each consisting of (where ) mutually exclusive and
    collectively exhaustive characteristics such that each object evaluated by the
    taxonomy has one and only one characteristic for each dimension , [66]: (1) 4.1.2.
    Decision problem A decision problem is defined as the selection of an action between
    at least two alternatives in response to an event that results in a consequence.
    In this work a decision problem is characterized by the following elements [67]:
    1. A set of actions (2) 2. A set of events associated with every action (3) 3.
    A set of consequences defined by the relation: (4) where refers to a consequence.
    (5) In this framework, the best action is the one that has the most desirable
    consequence or effect, and a decision process refers to the method by which the
    best action is selected. 4.2. Description TDMIoT (Fig. 6) is a hierarchical taxonomy
    developed following a conceptual-empirical approach [62]; its purpose is to characterize
    decision processes in the IoT application domains. The analysis carried out to
    define the seven dimensions proposed within TDMIoT is based on an Input-Process-Output
    model [68], [69]. These dimensions are derived from the defined metacharacteristic
    following the Methodology presented in Section 3.2. TDMIoT describes a decision
    process as a problem-solution association. In this sense, the dimensions target,
    collaboration, processing, level and uncertainty describe a decision problem;
    while a solution is abstracted by the knowledge representation and algorithmic
    approach dimensions. Each dimension is detailed in the following subsections.

    Fig. 6. TDMIoT. 4.3. Dimensions 4.3.1. Objective Dimension that classifies a decision
    problem according to its goal. This goal or required result is mapped to a category
    within this dimension and it can be: value estimation of future data from time
    series analysis (forecast), selection of the best element from a set of alternatives
    (optimization), a plan of a set of actions to achieve a goal (planning), a consensus
    between different entities (conflict resolution), or an estimated value given
    previous observations (prediction). The latter can be further sub-categorized
    as estimation (when the predicted values are bounded on the interval [0,1] and
    express a probability), regression (when the predicted values are numeric and
    not bounded and classification (when the variables to be predicted are categorical).
    4.3.2. Processing This dimension classifies a decision process according to how
    the decision algorithm execution is managed. A decision process can be considered
    centralized when an entity has access to all the information (data and models)
    necessary to make a decision and executes the decision process itself; or decentralized
    when multiple entities send information to each other or share computing resources
    to execute the decision process. 4.3.3. Processing layer Dimension that refers
    to the architectural layer in which the decision process is executed. This can
    be in any of three possible layers or locations: perception, middleware and application.
    The Perception layer corresponds to local executions of the decision process in
    IoT devices. The Middleware layer is an intermediate layer in which decision processes
    are executed that are responsible for the communication between applications,
    devices or systems. In the Application layer the decision processes are executed
    in the fog, edge or cloud. This occurs when computing power is required and not
    available on the IoT device. 4.3.4. Interaction This dimension classifies a decision
    process according to its input source. This source can be a device, a human, or
    an external system (natural or artificial) that provide an input to the decision
    process; or any additional information related to the interactions and can also
    be taken into account in the decision process. This dimension is important in
    the context of IoT systems since there is a constant interaction between physical
    and virtual elements. Within this dimension two categories are proposed: system
    and human. A system interaction involves decision problems that require an output
    (e.g. data, an object, an electronic signal, etc.) from an external non-human
    source. Decision problems classified within this category are characterized by
    being part of a linear sequence of operations. A human interaction involves decision
    problems that require human interventions or considers human behavior as a crucial
    aspect of the decision process. A human interaction can be direct, such as placing
    an object or indirect, as in applications in which user information or data is
    collected without their mediation. 4.3.5. Uncertainty This dimension classifies
    the source of uncertainty in a decision problem. Identifying the source of uncertainty
    allows us to narrow down the selection of an algorithmic approach since each decision
    algorithm implements an inherent strategy to deal with the source of uncertainty.
    In this context, uncertainty refers to a condition of limited knowledge in which
    it is impossible to accurately describe the state of the world or its future evolution
    [70]. In the IoT, uncertainty analysis can be approached from the physical perspective
    in ciberphysical systems. Therefore, this paper considers three types of uncertainty
    [71]: • Measurements: uncertainty associated with data and measurements. It is
    derived from measurement scaling, interpolation, noise, data fusion, or preprocessing.
    Measurement uncertainty is present in an IoT system if there is a difference between
    the actual data and the measured data (6) however, it is impossible to determine
    this difference precisely. • Parameter: this uncertainty occurs in decision problems
    involving variables that cannot be controlled, inferred, or precisely known, but
    can be addressed by assuming or delimiting any given variable as seen in optimization
    problems. The uncertainty of a parameter is usually bounded (7) • Model: refers
    to decision problems where there is no specific model to address the decision,
    therefore a complex set of assumptions are made. This uncertainty is presented
    in the following scenarios: – when there is a dataset with relevant variables
    to infer a decision model. – when the environment in which the decision process
    will be deployed is partially known or provides noisy observations. – when observable
    events that depend on unobservable factors have been identified. Quantifying model
    uncertainty is difficult since it requires a significant amount of data. Assuming
    we know an actual value and the predicted value by a model , the model uncertainty
    can be represented by (8) 4.3.6. Knowledge representation A knowledge representation
    is an abstraction of variables and their possible relationships and dynamics that
    are relevant to making a decision [72]. Knowledge representations are fundamental
    to the design of decision processes, since they contain the identified information
    about a problem and can determine how to approach it. In this taxonomy, four representations
    of knowledge are distinguished. A data representation contains a set of records
    denoting observations or characteristics, however, relationships between these
    elements are not identified. A symbolic representation refers to a scheme with
    specific rules that describe the decision variables and their relationships. A
    mathematical representation refers to the formal representation of variables and
    their relationships as functions or equations. Finally, the hybrid representations
    involve two of the previous knowledge representations, eg a Markov decision process
    uses a schema (symbolic representation) and transition and reward functions (mathematical
    representation). 4.3.7. Algorithmic approach This dimension classifies the algorithm
    in charge of the decision-making process. While the previous dimensions describe
    the decision problem, this dimension focuses on the solution itself. This dimension
    comprises two levels or subcategories, see Fig. 6. Level 1 (subcategory in blue
    background) classifies the approach that drives the decision within the algorithm.
    Level 2 (subcategory in yellow background) represents the employed techniques
    within each approach. • Criterion-driven (Level 1): this category refers to algorithms
    that follow specific criterion to narrow or navigate the search space in a decision
    process. The criterion is represented by a mathematical model or search strategy,
    three criterion techniques have been identified: 1. Constrained (Level 2): it
    covers algorithms that require a mathematical model with defined constraints.
    Algorithms of this type are based on Mathematical Programming [73], for instance
    linear programming, non-linear programming and geometric programming fall into
    this category. 2. Heuristic (Level 2): it comprises algorithms that use a heuristic
    or metaheuristic to navigate the solution space. A heuristic provides an approximate
    solution and can be seen as the criteria that guides an algorithm [74]; examples
    of algorithms belonging to this category are genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence
    (particle swarm optimization-PSO, ant colony-ACO), simulated annealing, sparse
    search, etc. 3. Dynamic programming (Level 2): it refers to algorithms that use
    the criterion of dividing the problem into subproblems and keeping track of those
    already solved [75]. Examples of algorithms included in this category are those
    in the field of reinforcement learning such as Policy-Gradient, SARSA, and Q-Learning.
    • Data-driven (Level 1): this category comprises algorithms that infer or learn
    patterns from data. The models used by these algorithms are data-independent,
    meaning they do not try to fit the data into a framework or theory; instead, they
    recognize and learn patterns by adjusting themselves to fit the data, then the
    fitted model is used to make decisions. Since the field of machine learning studies
    these algorithms, it has been decided to use the classification established in
    this area: 1. Supervised learning (Level 2): it covers algorithms that analyze
    a dataset composed of pairs of input (features) and output values (known as a
    labeled dataset), with the goal of learning how to produce the output labels [76].
    Algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, support
    vector machines, etc. fall into this category. 2. Unsupervised Learning (Level
    2): it involves algorithms that use an unlabeled dataset with the goal of inferring
    a common structure among the data [76]. Examples of algorithms that fall into
    this category are principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and latent variable
    models. • Utility-driven: this category comprises algorithms that use utility
    theory to model and make decisions. Utility theory consists of evaluating and
    comparing alternatives using mathematical models [77]. It differs from Criterion-driven
    in its modeling approach; in Criterion-driven, the techniques are based on an
    objective function and numerical constraints, while in Utility-driven the techniques
    are based on evaluating a ranking of preferences among the variables involved
    in a decision problem. 1. Multicriteria (Level 2): it involves algorithms that
    solve decision problems characterized by many alternatives that must be evaluated
    against multiple conflicting criteria. Ranking algorithms, Case-Based Reasoning
    (CBR), Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), and Analytical Hierarchy Process
    (AHP), etc. belong to this category [78]. 2. Game theory (Level 2): it comprises
    algorithms that use game theory to model and solve a decision problem. Game theory
    is a branch of mathematics and economics that analyzes situations of strategic
    interaction between rational agents [79], and provides a theoretical framework
    for dealing with situations in which various agents cooperate or compete to produce
    an optimal decision. For instance, the minimax algorithm uses this technique to
    solve decision problems. • Probability-driven (Level 1) this category includes
    algorithms that use a probabilistic model to make a decision. 1. Stochastic (Level
    2): it refers to algorithms based on stochastic models. A stochastic process is
    a set of random variables indexed by the set (where ). This type of process can
    be interpreted as a phenomenon that evolves over time with random dynamics [80].
    Examples of these algorithms in the continuous case are the Kalman filter and
    the Automatic Regressive Moving Average (ARMA), while in the discrete case the
    Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). 2. Bayesian (Level
    2): it comprises algorithms based on Bayesian models. In a Bayesian model, a problem
    is formulated as a set of random variables with conditional relationships. The
    goal of a Bayesian model is to determine the posterior distribution that represents
    an update of knowledge. The posterior distribution can be calculated with the
    available knowledge known as the prior distribution and the observed evidence
    is referred to as the likelihood distribution, [81]. Examples of algorithms using
    this technique are Bayesian network inference, Bayesian classifiers, etc. 3. Theory
    of evidence (Level 2): it includes decision-making algorithms based on Evidence
    Theory or Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST), which is a general framework for reasoning
    with uncertainty. Based on the DST framework, evidence from different sources
    is combined to obtain a degree of belief or level of certainty. In this framework,
    there is a set of mutually exclusive elements in a domain (called the discernment
    framework ), a hypothesis (a subset of the discernment framework ), and a belief
    function that determines the degree of belief in a hypothesis ( ). The discernment
    framework represents the evidence. Based on this evidence, a hypothesis is formulated
    and a set of calculations are applied to measure its strength through a belief
    function, and then a decision is finally made [82], [83]. This framework is commonly
    used in data fusion. 4.4. TDMIoT as a design framework TDMIoT is intended to be
    a semantic knowledge representation for the new design or change of decision processes
    of IoT systems in its various domains (third objective, see Section 3.1). In this
    sense, TDMIoT can be seen as a design framework. The goal is to reduce the search
    space of possible algorithmic solutions for a given problem. To this end, the
    dimensions within TDMIoT can be mapped to the activities of the problem-solution
    process defined by [65] as follows: 1. Problem definition establish the dimensions
    objective, level and interaction. 2. Problem analysis determines the dimensions
    processing, uncertainty, and algorithmic approach (Level 1). 3. Evaluation of
    the solution select a technique according to the algorithmic approach (Level 2).
    4. Solution selection within the technique category, choose the algorithm that
    fits the decision problem and then classify the knowledge representation as required.
    5. TDMIoT research evaluation TDMIoT was developed to be used as both a classification
    artifact and a design framework. In this sense, the results of the TDMIoT application
    and an analysis regarding the fulfillment of the three objectives set out in Section
    3.1 are described below. 5.1. TDMIoT as a classification artifact As a result
    of the systemic review performed, a total of 56 articles were successfully and
    completely classified using the TDMIoT taxonomy. Then, the meta-extracts obtained
    from these articles (summaries) were classified according to TDMIoT; Fig. 7, Fig.
    8 present the article references, the algorithm used and the application domain
    mapped to TDMIoT. The classification process resulted in 37 different combinations
    of the TDMIoT categories; the analysis in terms of the objectives set out in Section
    3.1 is presented next. 1. Analyzing the state of the art in IoT, considering the
    decision process as a problem-solution association. Fig. 7, Fig. 8 present the
    state of the art successfully classified from the systematic review. The relevant
    findings that emerge from these figures are presented below: Download : Download

    [134], [135], [136], [137], [142], [143]). • Most studies in IoT application domains
    have focused on prediction. Specifically, these problems have been addressed with
    supervised learning. • The most widely used algorithmic approach is revealed to
    be data-driven, highlighting the trend to use machine learning in IoT. • The most
    common knowledge representation in IoT is data. In other words, for the Knowledge
    Representation dimension in most cases, the matching category was “data”. • Decision
    processes in IoT application domains have mainly addressed problems at the application
    level. This means that the Processing Layer was the Application. However, although
    IoT devices have gained more computational power, recent research studies have
    not focused on decision-making processes at the perception level. In addition,
    the decision processes in the middleware layer have been barely addressed, which
    contrasts with the importance implied by the communication processes of IoT systems.
    • Most articles in recent years have focused on the design of centralized decision-making
    processes. Nevertheless, the proliferation of IoT devices with higher processing
    power and the advent of 5G technology have increased interest in Edge Intelligence
    [84], [85]; therefore, IoT is expected to take a decentralized approach. However,
    this classification shows how little attention decentralized decision-making approaches
    have received in recent studies. • Most of the studies were classified in the
    system category of the interaction dimension, which implies that a low human-machine
    interaction has been proposed in recent works. It is important to note that researchers
    can benefit from these findings to explore new solutions using different approaches
    to the current state of the art. 2. Provide a better understanding of the relationships
    between the elements that make up an IoT systems decision-making process Regarding
    this objective, TDMIoT has allowed us to infer the following relationships: •
    In the reviewed state of the art, the most common algorithmic approach is utility-driven
    for decentralized decision processes. • Uncertainty of measure is commonly associated
    with the probability-driven algorithmic approach. • The data-driven approach is
    associated with model uncertainty. • Planning problems are mainly related to the
    criterion-driven algorithmic approach. • Forecast problems are related to centralized
    processing. • Data as a representation of knowledge is not only used by the techniques
    contained in the data-driven approach but also by the following techniques: dynamic
    programming, Bayesian, game theory, and theory of evidence. • All studies using
    the Heuristic technique are executed in the Application layer; this highlights
    the computational power required to execute a heuristic search. • The symbolic
    representation of knowledge is generally associated with the probability-driven
    approach. • Planning problems are associated with hybrid knowledge representations.
    From the relationships identified, it is possible to affirm that the type of problem
    determines the selection of the algorithm. However, the study of these relationships
    can provide guidelines to create flexible decision-making models using TDMIoT
    as a framework. 3. Serve as a semantic tool for algorithmic design in decision-making
    processes IoT systems Fig. 7, Fig. 8 and the relationships listed in the objective
    discussed above indicate that using TDMIoT to perform classification it is possible
    to infer semantic knowledge and establish a problem-solution association. For
    example, a relationship was found between the objective forecast, the type of
    uncertainty measure, and the data-driven algorithmic approach; also, an association
    between the objective forecast, the type of uncertainty measurements, and the
    probability-driven algorithmic approach. A search of the literature on forecasting
    problems will show that they are usually approached with a probabilistic model;
    however, recently, they have been addressed with recurrent neural networks. Furthermore,
    decision problems classified in the objective optimization are associated with
    the uncertainty of parameter, and most of them are associated with a criterion-driven
    algorithmic approach. Therefore, it is possible to state that an optimization
    decision problem uses a parameter-bound model and an objective function to make
    a decision. In addition, problems with planning as the objective were associated
    with a hybrid knowledge representation and a probability-driven or criterion-driven
    algorithmic approach. In this sense, the hybrid representation of knowledge exhibits
    the importance of symbolic models with mathematical constraints to address the
    evolution of planning problems. Correspondingly, algorithmic approaches drive
    model evolution which can be stochastic (probability-based) or criterion-driven
    (criterion-based). The above findings or associations may be apparent to a human
    expert; however, with a relational model derived from applying a taxonomy, it
    would be easier for a computer system to establish such associations. In this
    sense, TDMIoT has shown that it can provide a semantic representation of knowledge.
    5.2. TDMIoT as a design framework - study cases The research evaluation phase
    of the proposed methodology, as presented in Fig. 3, considers carrying out study
    cases. For TDMIoT, this is discussed below. To illustrate the use of TDMIoT, we
    discuss the case study COVID-19 Crowd Management that we presented in [86], which
    was carried out under the proposed TDMIoT framework. This case consists of a points
    of interest (POI) recommendation system that recommends the closest POI to the
    user’s location with the lowest estimated occupancy or congestion. Table 2, Table
    3 show the TDMIoT mapped problem-solution process followed for this case study,
    as defined in Section 4.4. As a result of the application of the TDMIoT Framework,
    it was possible to make a successful taxonomic selection of the solution. The
    discussed case study validated the utility of TDMIoT as a general design framework
    and thus the third objective for the proposed taxonomy is met. Table 2. TDMIoT
    as a design framework — Part 1. (1) Problem definition Definition Calculate the
    congestion in a POI (Point of Interest), avoiding the constant monitoring of the
    user. A recommender system will use the congestion measure along with the distance
    to rank points of interest. Objective Estimate Level Application Interaction System
    (2) Problem analysis Analysis  The recommendation system will have centralized
    processing. An application makes requests to this system and gets recommendations
    in response.  The crowd level (occupancy) is known at a specific time; when a
    POI opens, it is 0.  There is no data to train a model to make the prediction
    so data-driven is discarded.  There is no probabilistic model applied in the context
    of the COVID-19 pandemic to model the flows of people during the day in a POI
    so probability-driven is discarded.  The criterion-based approach is useful for
    optimization or planning problems, this decision problem does not fit in those
    goals.  Utility-driven describes how humans evaluate and compare alternatives
    assuming they do so rationally. However, humans do not always make decisions rationally
    and therefore the decision process is classified as Model uncertainty. Processing
    Centralized Uncertainty Model Algorithmic approach (Level 1) Utility-driven Table
    3. TDMIoT as a design framework — Part 2. (3) Solutions assessment Assessment
    Following the TDMIoT classification :  Multicriteria: The multicriteria technique
    aims to determine a general preference between different alternatives. Although
    in this decision problem the objective can be seen as predicting a user’s preference
    for estimating congestion at a POI, this approach does not take into account how
    the actions of other users may affect this preference.  Game Theory: Within this
    area, there is a field called Behavioral Game Theory that models human decisions
    and is based on experimentation. Therefore, human decisions regarding a POI can
    be modeled under this technique. Algorithmic technique (Level 2) Game theory.
    (4) Select solution Solution Within the behavioral game theory, there is a model
    called logit level-k that assumes that humans make mistakes when they are least
    costly. This model has been used in [87] for a problem similar to the case study
    under discussion where there are two restaurants with limited capacity and a set
    of diners who want to visit them. To choose, diners question the possible choice
    of other diners, knowing that if they choose a full restaurant they will have
    to wait. The logit level-k model can be used to predict the level of occupancy
    or congestion of the POI and thus the possible choice of the user. Knowledge representation
    Mathematical 6. Implications and future directions 6.1. TDMIoT as a tool for research
    As a classification scheme, TDMIoT offers a helpful tool for research. For instance,
    TDMIoT enables a straight definition of a decision problem and the algorithmic
    approach of a solution. With this, researchers can compare their approaches and
    define their novelty. Additionally, the classification of the selected 56 studies
    showed significant associations and gaps among the dimensions of TDMIoT. This
    summary allows researchers to explore novel decision-making approaches in IoT
    application domains. 6.2. TDMIoT as a design framework for practitioners For practitioners
    (developers and engineers), TDMIoT provides guidelines to analyze and define a
    decision-making problem within the IoT application domains. This is particularly
    useful for IoT development, as designing an IoT-based system is a multidisciplinary
    task where engineers or developers can be unfamiliar with software or domain-related
    terms. Furthermore, TDMIoT narrows the search for an algorithmic by guiding the
    selection of an algorithmic technique. However, TDMIoT is highly dependent on
    user understanding. Therefore, it is prone to interpretation errors. 6.3. TDMIoT
    as a description mechanism IoT-based systems are generally implemented under a
    service-oriented architecture. TDMIoT provides a common vocabulary that could
    be used to describe the logical functionality of services and build a database
    that maps relationships between decision problems and the selected approach to
    solve them. Such a database could be exploited to implement learning algorithms.
    6.4. TDMIoT to enable self-configuration property The utility of TDMIoT as a design
    framework is limited to characterizing a problem and narrowing the search space
    to select an algorithm. Extension is still needed to identify fine-grained features
    and relationships between decision problems and the algorithms used as their solution.
    Such extension aims to enable the autonomic selection of an algorithm (automatic
    algorithm selection problem) and will be the semantic knowledge base that finally
    enables the self-configuration property. The self-configuration property can allow
    adaptation to facilitate updating of IoT-based systems without human intervention.
    However, TDMIoT is the first step in this direction since it is still required
    to develop mechanisms that automatically classify a problem and then suggest and
    implement the best algorithm. 7. Conclusion In light of the stated objectives,
    TDMIoT provided a summary of the state of the art in decision processes in IoT
    application domains showing that most studies have focused on decision processes
    with prediction as objective and that the most widely used algorithmic approach
    has been data-driven. Through TDMIoT it was possible to identify relationships
    between its different categories, for example, revealing that for decentralized
    processing, the most used approach has been the one based on utility and that
    measure uncertainty is generally associated with an algorithmic approach probability-driven;
    the identification of such relationships allows the use of TDMIoT as a semantic
    tool. Finally, the utility of TDMIoT as a design framework was demonstrated in
    the search for an algorithmic solution to utility-driven models in the COVID-19
    Crowd Management project. TDMIoT represents a decision process design framework
    and a tool for designers and developers of IoT systems. Furthermore, it could
    be used as a semantic tool for automatic selection of decision-making algorithms,
    which is relevant for creating flexible decision processes and the evolution of
    the IoT. CRediT authorship contribution statement Liliana Durán-Polanco: Conceptualization,

    of ThingsMachine-type communicationsMobile networks 1. Introduction The cellular
    Internet of Things (CIoT) refers to using cellular networks, such as fourth and
    fifth-generation (4G and 5G) networks, to connect IoT devices to the Internet.
    These devices can range from simple to complex, from smart thermostats and surveillance
    cameras to agricultural monitoring systems. The concept of CIoT is derived from
    an interest in a wide coverage area, massive connectivity, security, trustworthiness,
    ultralow latency, throughput, and ultra-reliability. One of the main benefits
    of using cellular networks for the IoT is their wide coverage area and ability
    to connect to the Internet, even in remote or hard-to-reach locations. Compared
    to other types of wireless networks, cellular networks typically offer greater
    reliability and lower latency, making them ideal for applications that require
    real-time data transfers or remote control [1]. Moreover, because many IoT applications
    are mission critical and demand more than 99.99% reliability with less than 1
    ms end-to-end latency, cellular connectivity is considered the most appropriate
    option because it has access to the licensed spectrum, ensuring the security and
    reliability of the communication service [2]. Due to their global and standardized
    nature, cellular technology is required for the connection of billions of devices
    in IoT applications. The cellular network offers a variety of attributes that
    makes it a good choice for various IoT applications, including good quality of
    service (QoS) and experience (QoE), the ability to support mobility and service-level
    agreements, fast data rates, and worldwide coverage [1]. To support massive connectivity,
    the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization has standardized
    three new types of technology: the extended coverage (EC) global system for mobile
    communications (GSM) IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution (LTE) for machine-type
    communications (LTE-M), and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), known as the CIoT, since
    Release (Rel.) 13. Additionally, Rel. 17 introduced the fourth category of CIoT
    technology, called reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR), which is specifically
    designed to offer cellular services to a vast number of IoT devices planned for
    use in the 5G licensed spectrum [3]. The improvements made by 3GPP from Rel. 13
    [4] to 15 [5] are on their baseline deployment; however, since Rel. 16, LTE-M
    and the NB-IoT can share the 5G NR channels with 5G devices. 3GPP is working on
    a technology that assures better coverage for a large number of inexpensive, low-throughput
    devices with low power consumption in applications that can tolerate delays. The
    CIoT is being applied as a new approach to global connectivity and remote device
    management. Moreover, given the enhanced data rate and capacity, 5G networks are
    expected to drive numerous IoT connections. Thus, cellular networks should be
    optimized to support low-power and low-data-rate use cases to satisfy IoT demands
    [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Machine-type communication (MTC) applications can be
    delay-tolerant (tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g., utility meters)
    or delay-sensitive (cannot tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g.,
    remote robotics surgery), certain applications, such as smart cities, fall in
    the middle of these two opposite ends. Considering these categories, as per Ericsson’s
    mobility report [11], by 2023, 3.5 billion CIoT connections are expected to be
    deployed, and by 2026 [12], the NB-IoT and LTE-M are expected to comprise 45%
    of all CIoT connections. Consequently, research has been conducted to provide
    a review of the CIoT with various scopes and themes, as detailed in the subsequent
    section (Section 2). However, the existing studies have covered only a subset
    of the CIoT technology or were limited to a specific focus area. Table 1. Definitions

    Fig. 1. Paper organization. 2. Related work Since the introduction of the CIoT,
    various research has been conducted from different perspectives to provide an
    overview of the related use cases, key enablers, and challenges. A comparative
    study [13] evaluated the NB-IoT against other technology regarding latency, QoS,
    battery lifetime, capacity, and cost, applying some application scenarios. In
    other studies [14], [15], authors have analyzed the indoor coverage, low power
    consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection support of NB-IoT-targeted
    technical features, such as resource allocation, energy-efficiency techniques,
    and latency-energy performance evaluations. In addition, some applications, such
    as smart agriculture and smart health, have been analyzed with future research
    directions. In [16], the authors detailed and analyzed possible security attacks
    on NB-IoT-enabled devices and proposed various approaches and techniques for smart
    home and smart healthcare applications. Standardization efforts employed on the
    security aspects of the NB-IoT and security requirements of IoT applications with
    an extensible combination of the NB-IoT to the 5G are addressed in [17]. In [18],
    basic factors, such as the modulation scheme selection and channel coding that
    affect the energy consumption of the NB-IoT from the perspective of resource management,
    were analyzed and synthesized, and future work suggestions were offered. In [19],
    the physical layer, specifically the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE)
    of the NB-IoT system, was presented in detail, exploring the radio resource control
    (RRC) and medium access control (MAC) layers in the physical design of channels
    as well. In [20], the power consumption and communication range of self-powered
    NB-IoT in remote monitoring applications were evaluated. However, these studies
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] considered only the NB-IoT technology
    in the CIoT. The authors of [21] focused on integrating low-power wide-area network
    (LPWA) technology to preserve an affordable low-battery device and a wide geographical
    area while enhancing power consumption and providing future research directions.
    In [22], channel control procedures and massive MTC (mMTC) standard guidelines
    with NB-IoT and LTE-M features, including wide coverage, low power consumption,
    and massive connectivity, were explored along with future challenges and innovative
    ideas. A comparative study on the performance of CIoT technology was conducted
    in [23], focusing primarily on the NB-IoT and LTE-M. Coverage (i.e., coverage
    enhancements (CEs)), power consumption, module cost, connection count (i.e., number
    of connections per cell), supported features (i.e., voice support), and service
    modes have been compared. In [24], the authors provided comprehensive guidance
    on the IoT localization methods of NB-IoT and LTE-M devices, which is vital for
    ultra-dense devices that result in IoT positioning problems. Power consumption
    is the primary concern in IoT applications. Hence, improving battery life and
    message latency is essential, especially in rare data transmission cases, because
    it has a large signaling overhead in LTE-M and the NB-IoT due to the process of
    establishing a connection. In [25], the authors clarified early data transmission
    (EDT) mechanisms introduced by 3GPP to transmit data during the random-access
    procedure (triggers the connection to a cell) to enhance the power efficiency
    of the device and minimize message delay, which is vital in a wide coverage scenario.
    The authors of [26] evaluated mMTC features and QoS provisioning issues with critical
    enablers for mMTC in cellular networks. A detailed overview is presented on the
    channel access mechanisms and radio access network (RAN) congestion problems in
    the NB-IoT and LTE-M with machine learning (Q-learning approach) solutions for
    congestion relief, including future research directions. However, these surveys
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] reviewed only the NB-IoT and LTE-M. In [7],
    the authors investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M as licensed LPWA technologies,
    focusing on their low power consumption, low data rate, and broad coverage area
    features. Their study had a limited scope and aimed to facilitate LPWAN-5G integration
    to support a more extensive range of industrial applications, including process
    control and high data-rate multimedia applications. The authors of [27] compared
    the cost of EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT in urban and rural deployments and key
    cost factors from the perspective of profitability in employing the CIoT in firms.
    A broad survey on energy-saving solutions in EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT was
    conducted, including analyzing critical factors that affect power usage, such
    as data reporting frequency, discontinuous reception cycles (DRX), and RRC timers,
    [28], directing future energy consumption reduction techniques. However, these
    studies [7], [27], [28] investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M within limited
    key enablers. Table 2. Summary of recent surveys on the CIoT. Reference Year CIoT

    In [29], the authors provided the primary features of the RedCap device standardized
    by 3GPP to support mid-range IoT applications with complexity reduction, coverage

    assessment of coverage for RedCap UE in various settings, including rural, urban,
    and indoor scenarios. In [30], a comprehensive overview of 3GPP Rel. 17 RedCap
    regarding cost reduction, and power-saving results were presented with design
    guidelines with future expected 3GPP RedCap release specifications. These surveys
    [9], [29], [30] focused on RedCap with some feature components based on the 3GPP
    standard specifications. In [31], the authors analyzed EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap and verified that they are proven as 5G IoT standards employed in various
    real-time applications when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI). However,
    the research focuses on AI and IoT integration in the CIoT with future research
    directions. Hence, considering the various surveys conducted, the surveys and
    studies address various aspects with limited focus. However, this survey provides
    comprehensive all-in-one information on coverage, power consumption, cost, device
    complexity, and device connection analysis. Furthermore, this review covers the
    general architecture, applications, release enhancement, development analysis,
    focus area explorations, and future challenges based on previous studies and on-hand
    survey results. Table 2 summarizes related studies to illustrate the difference
    from this survey. 3. General network architecture of the CIoT This section discusses
    the general network architecture of the CIoT. The cellular network standards organizations,
    such as 3GPP and its member companies: Ericsson, Huawei, Qualcomm, and Vodafone
    endorse the cellular-network-based architecture of CIoT. Cellular-network-based
    architectures connect IoT devices to the cellular network’s IoT infrastructure
    and allow them to access the Internet through middleware provided by the operators.
    Various requirements, such as bandwidth, energy efficiency, coverage, mobility,
    and reliability, are considered when network architecture is developed and deployed.
    The network architecture of the CIoT is designed to be scalable and flexible to
    support a wide range of devices and applications. Its ultimate goal is to transition
    from inflexible network structures, where all devices communicate directly with
    a network access point, to a more flexible architecture. This new approach allows
    devices and the network to dynamically form interconnected sub-networks, resembling
    a mesh, as and when needed [32]. It can support low-power, low-bandwidth, and
    high-power, high-bandwidth devices and can be easily integrated with existing
    networks and systems. Integration with existing networks and systems allows organizations
    to leverage the advantages offered by IoT without having to completely overhaul
    the existing infrastructure. Fig. 2 presents the general network architecture
    of CIoT, facilitating communication between IoT devices and the Internet. A CIoT
    network architecture focuses on increasing network robustness against dynamic
    resource availability and providing ubiquitous connectivity. For instance, to
    meet the requirements of CIoT, existing legacy network architectures need to undergo
    substantial changes, such as enabling non-orthogonal access to increase the number
    of connected devices, implementing grant-free UL communication for fast and reliable
    communication, and adopting a multihop mesh network to support low-power devices
    in challenging locations [33]. As CIoT operates within existing cellular infrastructure,
    it facilitates interoperability between devices and harvests communication and
    computing resources across the network [34]. As depicted in the figure, the architecture
    comprises four main components: the IoT devices, BS, network stack (user plane
    and control plane), and Internet (CIoT applications). The first layer, the IoT
    devices include sensors, actuators, and other connected devices that collect and
    transmit data. Using these nodes, sensor data will be collected and transmitted
    to the access point, or they will receive data from it, to perform the response
    associated with the actuators. These devices communicate with the next layer,
    the BS, using CIoT technology (EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap), which connects
    the IoT devices to the network. Download : Download high-res image (761KB) Download

    layer is the network stack, comprising the user and control planes responsible
    for the efficient and effective data delivery between IoT devices and applications
    which are the two optimizations for the CIoT. The user and control planes form
    two distinct layers of the network stack and serve distinct functions, with the
    user plane carrying the data and the control plane managing the network resources
    [35]. Specifically, the user plane manages the data transmission and chooses the
    best path for control data packets for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) [36], and
    the control plane manages the overall network. In addition, the user and control
    planes work together to ensure an efficient and reliable exchange of information
    among IoT devices and the Internet. Finally, CIoT applications are at the top
    layer, which includes the applications and services that use the data collected
    by IoT devices. These applications can include everything from smart home systems
    to industrial automation systems [37]. The CIoT network architecture allows for
    the seamless integration of IoT devices and applications, making it an essential
    part of the IoT and plays a significant role to enable massive CIoT applications.
    Some of the CIoT technology (e.g., LTE-M and the NB-IoT) operates over a shared
    spectrum of LTE architecture with certain optimization techniques [38]. Some features
    were removed to reduce the complexity, equipment cost, and battery consumption
    in the shared LTE architecture, including handover for fast connection, carrier
    aggregation, and channel quality measurements [39]. In the CIoT network, two dedicated
    machines are used for communication: the MTC device and the MTC gateway. An MTC
    device is an endpoint that can communicate directly with a BS or connect via two
    hops to MTC gateways, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this way, MTC gateways help
    increase data transmission efficiency by relaying data to the BS [40]. In fact,
    gateway utilization is feasible in numerous instances, but certain regions and
    circumstances lack such infrastructure. Consequently, in such scenarios, it becomes
    imperative to establish direct communication. 4. CIoT application use-case classifications
    The development of CIoT results from collaboration and innovation from multiple
    companies and researchers [11], [41], [42]. It has emerged as a way to extend
    the capabilities of cellular networks to establish connectivity for a diverse
    range of devices to enable a broad range of new use cases and applications, such
    as smart cities, industrial automation, and remote monitoring, to mention a few,
    by offering low-cost, low-power, and reliable connectivity. Globally, the standards
    of the CIoT have been developed by 3GPP and Ericsson, among others, which have
    different methods of classifying CIoT application use cases, as presented in Fig.
    3. Accordingly, this section discusses the application use classification by 3GPP
    and Ericsson. 4.1. 3GPP classification 3GPP is a collaboration between telecommunications
    standard organizations to develop global standards for cellular communication
    technologies [43]. Specifically, 3GPP is working on the development of 5G technology
    and standardization of IoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices [44]. They also work on developing new features and functionalities
    for cellular networks, such as network slicing, improved security, and reduced
    latency, to support the growing demands of IoT and other emerging technologies.
    This section focuses on their classifications from the application perspectives
    that 3GPP defines three usage scenarios of 5G: mMTC, ultra-reliable and low-latency
    communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) [45], [46]. 4.1.1.
    mMTC Specifically, mMTC is designed to enable numerous low-power, low-cost IoT
    devices to connect to cellular networks where many devices infrequently transmit
    small volumes of data. It is designed to connect numerous low-cost devices (e.g.,
    about 1,000,0000 devices/km ) with sporadic, low-throughput data transmissions
    within a 10-s latency [47]. The focus is on low power consumption with up to 10
    years of battery life and high reliability to efficiently use the network resources.
    It is intended for use cases requiring high device density, such as smart cities,
    industrial automation, smart homes, smart metering, and asset tracking, where
    many devices must connect to the network simultaneously. In Rel. 13, 3GPP proposed
    LPWA cellular technology that specified long-range coverage of 164 dB, inexpensive
    and extremely energy-efficient devices that necessitate intermittent and periodic
    connectivity, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT [45]. 4.1.2. URLLC Higher
    reliability and lower latency are the most important design standards in wireless
    communications. From Rel. 14 to the present, reliability and latency have been
    the focus requirements, such as new data center interconnect formats, enhanced
    physical DL control channel (PDCCH) monitoring capability, hybrid automatic repeat
    request acknowledgment (HARQ ACK) feedback based on sub slots, enhanced inter-UE
    transmitter (Tx) multiplexing, physical UL shared channel (PUSCH) enhancements,
    and a variety of active configuration grants [48]. It is intended for IoT applications
    that are mission-critical, such as emergency services, which demand high availability
    and coverage with a low response time of fewer than 1 ms. It is intended for use
    cases, such as factory automation, autonomous driving, and remote surgery [46]
    for which NR-RedCap is a complement. 4.1.3. eMBB The eMBB is designed to provide
    high-bandwidth and low-latency media streaming applications [49], such as virtual
    and augmented reality, smart offices, and 4k and 8k video streaming with ultra-high
    speed Internet access. The eMBB is intended for use cases, such as smart cities
    and entertainment. Although eMBB and CIoT differ, they can work together to offer
    more comprehensive and reliable connectivity solutions. The purpose of organizations
    in the CIoT regarding eMBB is to work to integrate them to share the capabilities
    of the trending wireless development in 5G. These categories are not mutually
    exclusive and can overlap. For example, an IoT application may require both mMTC
    and URLLC capabilities (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart grids, industrial automation),
    or an IoT device may require mMTC and eMBB capabilities (smart cities, healthcare,
    and smart agriculture). 3GPP aims to establish a framework that can cater to the
    varied needs of IoT applications and devices and ensure seamless interoperability
    among devices and networks. 4.2. Ericsson classification Ericsson [50], a leading
    information communication technology network provider, working on developing solutions
    for connecting a large number of devices to the network, improving network coverage,
    and increasing the efficiency and security of IoT applications. Involved in the
    standardization and development of CIoT technology and refined the IoT applications
    incorporated into the CIoT into four divisions: massive IoT, broadband IoT, critical
    IoT, and industrial automation IoT [32], [51]. Download : Download high-res image
    (580KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. 3GPP and Ericsson’s CIoT use-case
    classifications. 4.2.1. Massive IoT Massive IoT is focused on low-cost devices,
    small data volumes, and extreme coverage. It is intended to enable increased network
    coverage, longer device lifespan, and high connection density, which is known
    as mMTC. Ericsson identified the massive IoT as LPWA technology, as classified
    by 3GPP, employed on licensed spectrum bands. Massive IoT is employed when low-complexity
    devices, long battery life, extensive coverage, and massive deployments are necessary.
    Massive IoT applications (i.e., smart building, retail, shopping, and manufacturing;
    smart home systems; personal IoT devices; etc.) tend to tolerate delays at various
    levels in operation [52], [53], [54]. Hence, LTE-M, EC-GSM-IoT, and NB-IoT were
    developed by 3GPP to support the massive IoT [55] in which according to Ericsson’s
    projection massive IoT will make up 51 percent of CIoT connections by 2027 [56].
    4.2.2. Broadband IoT The broadband IoT provides significantly faster data transfer
    speeds and reduced latency compared to the massive IoT, which was released based
    on mobile broadband [50]. The broadband IoT is evolving due to the requirements
    of accessing multimedia information with high throughput, low latency, and large
    data volumes for communication purposes. The broadband IoT is designed for high-bandwidth
    applications, such as video surveillance and remote health monitoring. Due to
    its capability of supporting high-speed data transfer, it enables devices to transmit
    numerous data quickly and efficiently, which is relevant in healthcare applications
    (e.g., where high-resolution images and data-intensive information is transmitted
    in real-time). 4.2.3. Critical IoT The critical IoT is necessary when the industrial
    IoT (IIoT) and mission-critical applications that require ultrahigh performance,
    very high availability (99.999%), ultra-reliability, and ultralow latency are
    in demand [57]. Unlike the massive IoT, applications of the critical IoT that
    require a minimal delay, such as smart healthcare (e.g., remote surgery), industrial
    automation in smart manufacturing [22], autonomous driving, asset tracking, traffic
    safety and control, and remote control of the sensitive components of a smart
    grid automation [58], are particularly sensitive to delays. Critical IoT applications
    are technically known as URLLC, comprising industrial control, robotic machines,
    and autonomous vehicles [32] that require real-time data transmission. Ultra-reliable,
    very low latency, and very high availability are the key performance indicators
    of the critical IoT [54]. 4.2.4. Industrial automation IoT The IIoT targets improving
    the operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability of industrial processes
    and systems that require unique network deployments. The IIoT is designed for
    applications in manufacturing and industrial process automation [46], achieving
    increased reliability, reduced latency, higher data transfer rates, greater flexibility,
    and secure communication. The IIoT is the focus and enabler of Industry 4.0 [32],
    [59], [60], enhancing the controlling capability with remote monitoring applications,
    such as smart factories, agricultural monitoring, and industrial assets [61].
    The IIoT is primarily applied in IoT applications that demand Ethernet protocol
    integration, time-sensitive networking, clock synchronization services, and other
    requirements. Furthermore, in these industrial real time applications proper implementation
    and effective design of deep learning algorithms are necessary aiming for high
    performance in terms of reliability, speed, and security. Deep learning provides
    a dynamic optimization of the warehouse facilities, enhances assembly line performance,
    improves the generative design, predicts future demands, and reduces errors [62].
    Moreover, low cost and complexity are the most important factors in the IIoT [63].
    5. CIoT technologies This section discusses CIoT technology from various perspectives.
    Initially, 3GPP collated cellular network technology for the IoT in Rel. 13 included
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and in Rel. 17 the NR-RedCap. As illustrated in Table
    3, we summarize the fundamental parameters of the first Rel. 13 for the three
    types of CIoT technology and the first NR-RedCap Rel. 17 technology. 3GPP worked
    on the EC-GSM-IoT (a complete backward-compatible solution for CIoT that builds
    upon the existing GSM or enhanced-GPRS (eGPRS) deployments) under the 850–900
    MHz and 1800–1900 MHz frequency bandwidth with the aim of achieving extended battery
    life and lower device costs compared to general packet radio service (GPRS) or
    GSM devices. It also has extended coverage of up to 164 dB maximum coupling loss
    (MCL) for 33 dBm UE and 154 dB MCL for 23 dBm UE, with variable rates using Gaussian
    minimum shift keying (GMSK) ranging from approximately 350 bps to 70 kbps, and
    eight-phase shift keying (8PSK) up to 240 kbps. The technology can handle a large
    number of devices, with around 50,000 per cell, and provides enhanced security
    compared to GSM orEDGE. It can be installed through a software update to the GSM
    infrastructure [66]. Table 3. First release parameter values of the CIoT (LTE-M,

    Moreover, as shown in the table, the first release of LTE-M, Cat-0, was out on
    Rel. 12 in March 2015 to be configured as a UE Cat-0 (Cat-0 MTC) IoT version.
    In Rel. 13 in March 2016, LTE enhanced MTC or Cat-M1 (Cat-1 MTC) IoT, and the
    NB-IoT was released to afford IoT applications. In the combined Cat-0 and Cat-M1,
    LTE-M was introduced to contribute a 1 Mbps data-rate capacity, supporting full
    mobility features with a battery life exceeding a duration of 10 years, which
    can be configured easily with a software update to the LTE infrastructure. In
    the multiple access techniques, both Cat-0 and Cat-M1 in the UL transmission scenario
    support the single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) methods,
    and in the downlink scenario, they both employ orthogonal frequency-division multiple
    access (OFDMA). However, Cat-0 and Cat-M1 have differences in terms of the UL
    and DL bandwidth coverage. The former has a 20 MHz bandwidth, and the latter has
    a 1.4 MHz bandwidth derived from the legacy LTE. The coverage or link budget of
    Cat-0 is around 141 and is 156 dB for Cat-M1 [43]. In contrast, the NB-IoT was
    developed from an LTE or GSM network with 200 kHz of physical resource blocks
    (PRBs) and a clean sheet format of 180 kHz that can be compatible with a software
    update to the existing legacy LTE or GSM systems under the 700, 800 and 900 MHz
    frequency bandwidth. Because the NB-IoT utilizes many of the same design aspects
    as LTE, including channel modulation, coding schemes, and higher-layer protocols,
    it provides deployment flexibility and is primarily designed to address ultralow-end
    IoT applications [65], [68]. The NB-IoT introduces two modes of operation types,
    different from the LTE, where the whole PRB is assigned to a single piece of UE
    in the UL and DL. In the single-tone mode, the NB-IoT utilizes one PRB that has
    a bandwidth of 180 kHz in both the DL and UL of the LTE spectrum. However, in
    the multitone mode, the resource units are allocated to multiple pieces of UE
    to attain the massive device deployment objective of the CIoT, specifically for
    the NB-IoT. The NB-IoT system assigns each tone a transmission bandwidth of either
    3.75 or 15 kHz for UL transmission using the SC-FDMA scheme. For DL transmission,
    15 kHz transmission bandwidth is used with the OFDMA scheme similar to LTE. Using
    15 kHz spacing, NB-IoT can allocate either one or multiple tones (three, six,
    or twelve) to different UE with durations of 4, 2, and 1 ms, respectively. However,
    with 3.75 kHz spacing, only a single-tone allocation is supported for various
    users, with 48 sub-carriers of 32 ms duration [69], which allows the NB-IoT for
    increased deployment flexibility and higher system capacity. From the Rel. 13
    specifications, the data rate in the single-tone allocation is 48 kbps for the
    UL, 64 kbps for the multitone mode, and 128 kbps in the single- and multitone
    modes in the DL, with a 20 dB link budget from the legacy LTE of 144 dB supporting
    more than 10 years of battery life but without mobility support [70]. In addition,
    3GPP introduced RedCap on 5G device specifications with reduced features in Rel.
    17, designed objectively to simplify the standard NR technology. In the 5G technology,
    it is insufficient to reuse traditional existing frequency bands for high-end
    5G requirements, so another new and varied frequency band is needed. For 5G NR,
    frequency band 1 (FR1) is below 6 GHz or 4.10 to 7.125 GHz, and frequency band
    2 (FR2) is above 6 GHz or 24.250 to 52.600 GHz [71]. Hence, RedCap is supposed
    to use 20 MHz for FR1 and 50 and 100 MHz for FR2 in the UL and DL bandwidths,
    respectively [67]. The multiple access method is FDMA or time division multiple
    access (TDMA), where frequency or time slot is employed. The peak data rate varies
    based on the use cases (e.g., 2 Mbps is expected for wireless industry sensors,
    25 Mbps for wearables, and 150 Mbps (DL and UL) for surveillance applications).
    Moreover, after Rel. 13, 3GPP added subsequent enhancements to the current releases.
    The subsequent sections discuss these CIoT technologies in detail, considering
    their focuses, features, and applications. Following is a detailed explanation
    of each CIoT technology, including their unique features, applications, focuses,
    and review state of the art. In this section, we will explore the different CIoT
    technologies available, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, and discuss
    how they are being used in various industries and sectors. Download : Download

    5.1. EC-GSM-IoT 3GPP standardized it to support IoT applications in Rel. 13 using
    the Technical Specifications Group GSM RAN using LTE-advanced pro [7], [75], [76].
    Its development can be considered a great success because it only requires design
    reuse and software upgrades to deploy EC-GSM-IoT in the existing 2G GSM or eGPRS
    network without needing new network infrastructure. It plays a pivotal service
    in M2M or IoT communications in the form of voice, data, and SMS. Moreover, most
    sub-Saharan African subscriptions are still GSM or EDGE, which is vital for MTC
    and global IoT deployment [77]. In particular, the EC-GSM-IoT technology is intended
    to facilitate the use of IoT devices in areas with difficult radio coverage and
    can operate in frequency deployments as narrow as 600 kHz. Operators and companies,
    such as Broadcom Corporation, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Gemalto NV, Intel Corporation,
    KDDI Corporation, LG Electronics, MediaTek, Nokia, Oberthur Technologies, Ooredoo,
    Orange, Samsung Electronics, Saudi Telecom Company, Sierra Wireless, Telit Communications,
    and VimpelCom, are also trying to use it with 3G and 4G mobile networks [78].
    As shown in Table 4, the maximum UL-DL instantaneous peak data rates from the
    Rel. 14 to Rel. 17, in the 8PSK modulation, is 489.6 kbps both in DL and UL, 153.6
    kbps in GMSK modulation in the UL [45], [72]. The channel bandwidth is 200 kHz,
    and the device capacity (i.e., devices/km ) is around 60,000. Additionally, the
    technology uses CE through message repetitions [31], [73]. Indeed, the GSM technology
    is well-established, and it still plays an important role in the deployment of
    IoT. With the upgrades implemented by 3GPP in Rel. 13, GSM offers advantages in
    terms of time, coverage footprint, and cost that are crucial for IoT development.
    In addition, spectrum availability is an essential controlling factor of the CIoT
    and its innovation capability, growth rate, and development paths. Backward compatibility
    has been applied to use the existing devices and network in the EC-GSM-IoT deployment.
    As illustrated in [79], only new synchronization, the broadcast control channel,
    and common control channels on time slot 1 of the broadcast control channel carrier
    are required for EC-GSM-IoT functioning. The extended Discontinuous Reception
    (eDRX) with radio control level enhancements provides several advantages, including
    extended battery life, lower device cost in comparison to GPRS or GSM devices,
    improved coverage, and variable rates. The technology can accommodate a large
    number of devices while offering improved security features. As shown in Fig.
    4, the 3GPP did efforts to enhance the EC-GSM-IoT service levels to cope with
    the requirements of IoT application requirements. Enhancements on EC-GSM-IoT have
    been done including achieving reduced complexity, low device power consumption,
    ensuring support of a massive number of CIoT devices and backward compatibility
    with GSM, securing low-device cost, improving end-user security, and so on. In
    the consequent release, Rel.14, fundamentally, they developed three enhancement
    requirement objectives including improving the positioning of devices, coverage
    for 23 dBm devices, and new time slots (TSs) mapping in extended coverage for
    improved resource handling [45]. In EC-GSM-IoT, there are four coverage classes,
    namely CC1, CC2, CC3, and CC4, that are assigned to different channels. Each coverage
    class determines the number of blind repetitions in the DL channel, which are
    1, 8, 16, and 32 respectively. Similarly, in the UL channel, the coverage classes
    determine the number of blind repetitions as 1, 4, 16, and 48 respectively that
    can help to attain the MCL [28]. In Rel.15, feature enhancements such as supporting
    multicast to operate in extended coverage in both UL and DL, incorporating coverage
    class CC5 and CC6 to attain 33 dBm, mobility support, and power consumption reduction
    techniques (e.g., eDRX, paging) were employed. In Rel.16, enhancements in localization,
    power consumption reduction (eDRX, WUS, paging, Preconfigured UL Resources (PUR)),
    and improved multicarrier operation. The PUR is employed to allocate radio resources
    to a UE in advance, enabling the transmission of UL data without requiring a connection
    setup process. In Rel.17, enhancements have been incorporated into EC-GSM-IoT
    to better meet the requirements of application scenarios. These enhancements focus
    on improving the battery lifecycle, device density, and link budget. Download

    countries, after Rel.15, since the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. They are shifting to
    5G and confirmed the LTE-M and NB-IoT are a candidate for CIoT technology in addition
    to RedCap. Instead of EC-GSM-IoT, they are focused on LTE improvements and 5G
    NR so that no further EC-GSM-IoT feature enhancement is applied. However, in the
    Middle East, South-East Asia, and Africa, 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile networks are still
    applicable, know that it can co-exist with 3G, and 4G mobile networks, EC-GSM-IoT
    is serving well even though demand for 5G is getting high. In spite of the relatively
    lesser attention the EC-GSM-IoT network receives than the LTE-M and NB-IoT networks,
    EC-GSM-IoT still offers some promising applications. In fact, it is a good solution
    for IoT deployment in developing countries, where cellular networks are primarily
    used for voice and other locations where GSM coverage exceeds LTE coverage. 5.2.
    LTE-M Under the 3GPP feasibility study titled “Study on Provision of Low-Cost
    MTC UEs Based on LTE”, LTE-M started in September 2011, earlier than the EC-GSM-IoT
    and NB-IoT [84]. The main objective was to enhance the LTE device capabilities
    in the low-end MTC domain, present an option for the GPRS and EGPRS devices, and
    roam GSM networks to LTE. At the time, eGPRS was incompatible with supporting
    more devices and was not cost-effective for MTC devices. They aimed to provide
    a solution with device complexity and cost to facilitate better requirement satisfaction
    regarding data rates, spectrum efficiency, and power consumption than the eGPRS.
    In 2012, in addition to the mentioned requirements, the group extended coverage
    improvement over the normal LTE coverage capacity by at least 20 dB to support
    deep indoor coverage, as summarized in as shown in Table 5. Furthermore, LTE devices
    were more expensive than GSM or eGPRS, so it was worth reducing the device cost
    to address the low-end mMTC use cases. The LTE-M release feature enhancements
    increased the number of supported devices per cell, from 361,000 to 1,000,000
    devices/km allowing for more IoT devices to connect to a single BS, enabling better
    use of the available spectrum and improved scalability. New CE techniques (i.e.,
    Mode A, a moderate number of retransmissions with 32 repetitions, and Mode B,
    a high number of repetitions with 2,048 repetitions, from Rel. 14 forward) are
    introduced to improve the QoS for IoT devices operating in remote or challenging
    environments [85]. Through shorter transmission time intervals, the latency is
    reduced from 50 to 100 ms in Rel. 12 to 10 to 15 ms in recent releases [82]. The
    LTE-M release enhancements increased the maximum number of HARQ processes from
    eight to 10 to improve the reliability of data transmissions, reducing the number
    of retransmissions needed to deliver data to IoT devices, improving overall system
    efficiency and reliability, and reducing latency. The HARQ allows for more flexibility
    in determining the type and amount of retransmitted data, as explained by [86].
    Compared with other CIoT components, LTE-M has important features (see Fig. 5).
    LTE-M is considered the most suitable LPWA technology for IoT applications that
    need high data rates, low latency, and full mobility, including voice, under standard
    coverage conditions. It is also an ideal choice for IoT applications that require
    deep coverage, where the demands for latency, mobility, and data speed are less
    rigorous. Indeed, LTE-M is a highly adaptable LPWA technology that can cater to
    both lower and higher data rates, with its system bandwidth being flexible and
    capable of accommodating 1.4 MHz or more. It can handle real-time traffic, full
    mobility, and voice features. In general, in the form of low-cost devices and
    coverage improvements, Rel. 14 and Rel. 15 further developed the standard, as
    shown in Table 5. In addition, MTC was further enhanced for LTE [82], commonly
    referred to as the “feMTC” work item in Rel. 14, which brought further enhanced
    improvements for supporting higher data speeds, improved voice over long-term
    evolution (VoLTE) support, improved positioning, multicast support, and the new
    LTE device, Cat-M2. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat-M2, unlike the normal LTE UE for
    IoT applications that require a higher data rate (e.g., wearables, such as smartwatches)
    but lower device cost. The UE Cat-M2 has a UE bandwidth of 5 MHz and can achieve
    peak rates of around 4 Mbps for the DL and 7 Mbps for the UL, assuming it supports
    FD-FDD operations [87]. For UE that supports HD-FDD, these peak rates are roughly
    half of the aforementioned figures, and for UE that supports time division duplex,
    the peak rates depend on the DL/UL subframe configuration, as stated in [82].
    The Cat-M2 UE supports larger maximum TBSs for unicast transmission than Cat-M1
    UE. Valuable enhancements have been provided in each release, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. Rel. 13 enhanced by employing coverage enhancement modes (CE mode A and
    B), improved device type having lower complexity and cost, enabled VoLTE in HD
    mode and introduced additional power saving features (eDRX) than Rel. 12 that
    was featured as lower complexity (a single receive antenna) and low-cost devices
    (Cat-0), HD operation, supports a lower data rate requirement (Max: 1 Mbps) and
    PSM enhancements for the UE. Rel. 14 further enhanced LTE-M, offering further
    developments than Rel. 13 regarding mobility, data rate, HARQ processing, new
    Cat-2 specifications, supporting positioning features, and additional power consumption
    management techniques [82]. The other power-saving mechanism developed in Rel.
    14, the Release Assistance Indication (RAI) feature is employed to conserve power
    by permitting the network to terminate a connection that is no longer required.
    By turning off the device radio and freeing network resources sooner, RAI can
    help to minimize battery consumption. A Rel. 15 work item that added use cases,
    increased spectrum efficiency, and additional benefits even further enhanced MTC
    (efeMTC) for LTE [88] while reducing latency and power consumption. Particularly,
    LTE-M is suited for industry operations with mobility features that must be tracked
    and monitored while moving. In Rel. 15, the central objective was to improve latency,
    spectral efficiency, and power consumption further. Potential enhancements to
    enhance latency include reducing the system acquisition time (e.g., improving
    the BS search or system information acquisition performance) and supporting EDT.
    To increase system capacity, spectral efficiency was improved in the DL by introducing
    higher-order modulation (64 QAM), and in the UL by enabling more precise resource
    allocation using sub-PRB granularity, as stated in [89]. To reduce power consumption,
    several possible enhancements could help including the implementation of EDT,
    sub-PRB resource allocation, WUSs, novel synchronization signals, improved HARQ
    feedback, and less stringent measurements for cell reselection [81], [88], [90].
    Rel. 15 offered even further enhancements of increased spectral efficiency, latency
    improvement, and lower power class. In Rel. 16, 5G integration has been realized
    to share 5G capabilities, CE for non-bandwidth reduced low complexity, standalone
    development, and mobility improvements. Rel. 17 [91], [92] introduced a maximum
    DL TBS of 1736 bits, 14 HARQ processes, and traffic management capabilities. In
    each release, enhancements in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient
    solutions have been integrated. Download : Download high-res image (465KB) Download

    [44] 5.3. NB-IoT The NB-IoT is a promising technology for the massive IoT specifically
    designed for low data-rate applications [14]. Improving the design of the UL/DL
    Rx to function effectively in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely
    low is pivotal [96]. The latency is enhanced between 1.6 and 10 s [97] with a
    maximum of one or two HARQ techniques. The maximum TBS in Rel. 14 was enhanced
    to 2536 b in the DL and UL by applying the HARQ process [65]. The NB-IoT has three
    deployment options and can be deployed inside an LTE carrier (in-band in 3, 5,
    10, 15, and 20 MHz LTE bandwidths), in its guard-band (in 10 MHz LTE carriers),
    or its own designated spectrum (standalone, 200 kHz in the GSM band) [65], [98],
    [99], [100]. When a guardband is applied, NB-IoT devices transmit data with great
    performance and efficiency while avoiding interfering with regular voice or data
    traffic on cellular networks. It can be considered a new radio access technology
    that is different from EC-GSM-IoT and LTE-M with no backward compatibility [101].
    In Rel. 14, it was intended to optimize the battery efficiency for up to 35 years
    with extended coverage of 164 dB [27] with transmission repetitions, power boosting,
    software modifications enhancing transport layer protocols [102], low complexity,
    support for a massive number of devices, improved power efficiency, and 10 s or
    less latency with positioning and multicast features [103]. The ITU and 3GPP’s
    mMTC performance criteria are further met by NB-IoT Rel. 15 (2018), which can
    fulfill 5G IoT requirements. It provides IoT connectivity with high data rates
    and reliable communication, boosting the 5G capacity while increasing IoT connectivity
    [104]. These requirements comprise high-performance and low-complexity features
    with an improved spectral efficiency and data rate [8]. Recently, 6G IoT has been
    studied extensively regarding the convergence of the 6G and IoT on five key domains:
    healthcare IoT, vehicular IoT and autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), satellite IoT, and IIoT [105] in which 3GPP must work on the CIoT to support
    these stringent requirements. CIoT is also envisioned to support monitoring real-time
    applications in UAVs under the circumstances of Age of Information (AoI) handling
    status. As shown in Table 6, the same way as LTE-M, in each release; enhancements
    in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient solutions are recorded.
    As shown in Fig. 6, enhancements made available in each release including low
    device power consumption, higher density, improved indoor coverage, reduced complexity,
    ultra-low device cost, optimized network architecture, cell reselection in the
    idle state, and Cat-NB1; power consumption and latency reduction (DL and UL for
    2 HARQ processes and larger maximum TBS), new power class of 14 dBm, Cat-NB2,
    multicast, higher data rate, location and positioning protocol OTDOA, non-anchor
    PRB enhancements, mobility, and service continuity enhancements; improved latency,
    improved power consumption(WUS, EDT), improved cell range, support TDD, higher
    spectral efficiency, improved load control, enhance cell acquisition, D2D communication;
    reduced control-signaling overhead, coexistence with NR, better UE energy efficiency,
    scheduling enhancement, better UL or DL transmission efficiency, improved multi-carrier
    operation, 2-step PRACH; enabling data transmission in RRC inactive mode, intra-UE
    multiplexing, positioning enhancement targeting factory automation, extend peak
    data rate, time synchronization enhancements, 2-HARQ process enhancement, CSI
    enhancements in the subsequent releases. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat. NB2 has developed
    with lower device cost and supports a massive number of IoT devices 8̃0,000 in
    an urban environment. In resolving energy-consumption problems, they employed
    solutions including PSM, I-eDRX, C-DRX, and cell reselection in addition to the
    eDRX. In Rel. 15 [95], 3GPP introduced the RRC-connected inactive state, which
    can benefit low data transmission optimization for devices operating for a short
    period. It is because of the substantial battery consumption, high demand for
    specialized resources, and high measurement reports and handovers, keeping the
    device in the RRC-connected state without active data transfer is not financially
    advantageous. The NB-IoT shortens the network monitoring duration for UE in idle
    mode, reduces the unnecessary startup of receiving cells, and reduces power consumption.
    Furthermore, Rel. 15 introduced the following energy efficiency solutions, as
    illustrated in Table 6. Wake-up signaling for IDLE mode (FDD) is served in an
    energy efficiency solution, reducing energy consumption. In communications, UE
    must frequently determine whether a paging message is from the core network when
    in DRX or eDRX. When paging is available, the UE mostly does not receive a message,
    and power is saved. With this capability, the BS can advise the UE to watch the
    narrowband physical DL control channel for paging by sending it an NB-IoT WUS
    (NWUS) introduced in Rel. 15 [106] to enhance the device energy efficiency, but
    otherwise, the UE is free to ignore the paging operations. NWUS enables the UE
    to potentially keep some of its hardware off for longer periods while saving the
    energy required to decode the narrowband physical DL control channel and shared
    channel for paging. The time the network allows the UE to “wake up” after receiving
    an NWUS determines whether the UE can maintain only one Rx switched on for WUS
    detection, leaving most of the UE conventional hardware in a very low-power state.
    The other viable solution is scheduling requests, included in the Rel. 13 and
    Rel. 14 NB-IoT as a higher-layer procedure that causes a random-access process
    to request enough UL resources to send a buffer status report. In addition, Rel.
    15 has provided new, more resource and power-effective methods to accomplish this
    goal that the BS can configure, the EDT. The EDT is an idle mode with a bitrate
    of 328 to 1000 bits. For example, UE can send data in msg 3 of the random-access
    procedure [107]. The random-access operation ends if a BS successfully receives
    a signal and the UE does not switch to connected mode. If the UE waiting data
    are less than the maximum permissible size established by the BS, the UE requests
    a grant for EDT by transmitting its preamble using a preconfigured set of narrowband
    physical random-access channel resources. To save energy on transmitting padding
    bits, the BS can authorize the UE to transmit fewer data than the maximum allowed
    size [106]. Due to minimizing the signaling overhead and message latency, the
    battery life is prolonged [19]. 5.4. RedCap The RedCap approach was created to
    address use cases (IIoT, video surveillance, and wearables) in IoT requirements
    that cannot be met using the EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, or LTE-M [44], [108] operating
    at a higher data rate and reliability with lower latency than LTE-M and the NB-IoT.
    It offers a lower cost, lower complexity, and longer battery life than NR eMBB
    and wider coverage than URLLC. Some requirements often necessitate higher reliability
    and quicker response time than those offered by LTE-M and the NB-IoT, while still
    maintaining lower complexity and expenses, as well as longer battery life compared
    to eMBB and URLLC services. The RedCap interface is designed to bridge the gap
    between the intricate and expensive 5G-NR interface that caters to eMBB and URLLC
    services and the lower data rates and increased latency of NB-IoT and LTE-M interfaces
    that support mMTC services. Under the study item “Low complexity NR devices” [67],
    in June 2019, 3GPP introduced RedCap NR devices in Rel. 17 with lower cost, lower
    complexity, and longer battery life compared to regular NR devices. In addition,
    RedCap was introduced to meet the low-cost, large-bandwidth, medium data rate,
    and no latency no delay tolerance IoT service requirements [31]. Hence, RedCap
    inherits the majority of the key advantages of NR. These include the ability to
    connect to the 5G core network, which is a cloud-based platform with a service-based
    architecture, support for a very broad range of frequency bands (FR1 and FR2 and
    millimeter-wave bands), network energy efficiency due to the ultra-flexible design,
    forward-compatible and beam-based air interfaces, and support for millimeter-wave
    bands [30]. As depicted in Fig. 7, enhancements have been incorporated in each
    release of RedCap. The applications use cases that are targeted include wearables,
    medical sensors, remote surgery, industrial sensors, surveillance cameras, and
    others. Rel. 17 of RedCap offers a multitude of enhancements that make it a cutting-edge
    solution for IoT applications. One of the most notable features is its ability
    to provide slicing capabilities, creating virtual networks within a single physical
    network, increasing network efficiency, and ensuring optimal resource utilization
    [67]. The positioning component of Rel. 17 has also been improved, providing more
    accurate location-based services and enabling new location-based applications.
    Furthermore, this release boasts a large capacity for storing and processing data,
    making it ideal for handling large volumes of IoT data. The UE energy-efficient
    operation component ensures that the end-user experience is optimized for energy
    efficiency, reducing the overall carbon footprint of IoT devices [30]. In addition,
    Rel. 17 is highly cost-effective and offers low latency, making it an attractive
    solution for a wide range of IoT applications and budgets [109]. In Fig. 7, one
    of the key advancements in Rel. 18 is supporting higher transmission rates, providing
    faster data transfer, and enabling new applications that require higher bandwidth.
    Another major improvement is the support for the unlicensed spectrum, which expands
    the available spectrum for IoT devices and enables new use cases. Advanced positioning
    technology has also been incorporated, further improving location-based services
    and enabling new location-based applications [29]. Integrating side-link near-field
    communications allows for direct communication between devices, providing a new
    level of convenience and enabling new use cases. In addition, it takes steps to
    reduce the complexity of RedCap UE further, making it even more user-friendly
    and accessible. Finally, the addition of device-to-device (D2D) communication
    expands the communication options for IoT devices, making it easier to connect
    and communicate with other devices in a local network. These enhancements and
    new features make Rel. 18 of RedCap CIoT necessary for anyone aiming to remain
    at the forefront of IoT technology. RedCap has unique features incorporated with
    5G NR services and was objectively designed to maintain lower complexity devices
    with 20 or 100 MHz maximum bandwidth in sub-7 or millimeter-wave with one or two
    Rx antennae. Additionally, 3GPP introduced this standard [61] due to RedCap’s
    ability to coexist with URLLC features, use higher frequency bands, and apply
    other 5G features, such as network slicing. For instance, RedCap is designed to
    provide significantly faster data rates than previous CIoT technology compared
    to the data rate specified in Rel. 17 using a higher frequency band, multiple-input
    multiple-output technology, advanced modulation techniques, advanced beamforming
    features, and network slicing. Use cases for RedCap are less battery-life-intensive
    than mMTC use cases, but they are more demanding for throughput and latency. However,
    a higher data rate of up to 100 Mbps is required to accommodate live video feed,
    visual production, and process automation [30]. This approach enables new use
    cases and applications that were previously impossible [9]. In addition to the
    transmission rate, in machine-to-machine collaboration and real-time remote control,
    ultra-low communication latency is expected at around 1 ms. Communication latency
    can be raised from the physical layer latency and scheduling latency problems
    [112]. However, for the time being, in the higher requirement scenario, it is
    possible to achieve a latency of 10 to 30 ms to support applications like remote
    drone operation, cooperative farm machinery, time-critical sensing and feedback,
    and remote vehicle operations. Higher communication reliability in mission and
    time-critical applications, for example, autonomous vehicles, remote surgery,
    and smart factories, is not an option to compromise but should be kept stable
    [9]. In IIoT, data transmission security is the top demand to make sensitive information
    extremely secure and highly available on demand. For Rel. 17 RedCap features [111],
    3GPP also added extra features in future Rel. 18 work, depicted in Fig. 7. Download

    [31], [109], [110], [111] Furthermore, localization or positioning increases network
    complexity, potential overhead, and accuracy degradation and can include power,
    time, and space domain localization [66]. Positioning or localization in the MTC
    has become difficult due to the complication of environments, sensor errors, and
    device motions, as Le et al. [24] investigated. Supporting location-based service
    applications is crucial for some IoT applications, such as tracking items. Although
    a smaller BS density has an advantage in the IoT scenario, a higher BS density
    is an important factor in localization with small BSs. In addition to environment
    complexity, other problems in positioning are end device-related errors, environment-related
    errors, BS-related errors, and data-related errors [24]. Hence, positioning accuracy
    can be supported by different mechanisms, including received signal strength (RSS),
    time difference of arrival [24], and channel-state information [113]. Regarding
    the D2D Protocol, communication between devices, such as wearables, that can directly
    communicate with nearby smartphones or connected vehicles is supported by RedCap
    [114]. It is enabled via sideline communication over a shared RF channel in which
    the cellular BS provides a synchronization signal that enables direct D2D communication,
    which can also improve communication efficiency, reduce latency, and extend network
    coverage and capacity. Most importantly, RedCap supports the Unlicensed Spectrum.
    In 3GPP’s EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, there is no support for sub-GHz license-free
    frequency bands (unlicensed spectrum). There have been efforts, such as MulteFire
    Alliance [115] that have been working on expanding IoT services with LPWAN support
    in the 800/900 MHz band (902 to 928 MHz band in the United States and 863 to 870
    MHz band in the European Union) with NB-IoT unlicensed and 2.4 GHz with extended
    MTC unlicensed. RedCap uses unlicensed spectrum bands under both licensed and
    unlicensed standards and regulatory requirements to address spectrum scarcity
    issues. Due to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming
    manifested in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require
    low latency, ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. RedCap
    contributes to services that require more capabilities than the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    and NB-IoT but are lower than URLLC and eMBB machines including process monitoring
    (pressure sensors, humidity sensors, and thermometers), self-diagnosis and maintenance
    (motion sensors, accelerometers, and actuators), and video-assisted applications
    (asset monitoring and augmented reality) [108]. According to TR 22.832, TS 22.104,
    and TR 22.804, [110] as summarized in Table 7, reference use cases and requirements
    are as follows. End-to-end latency is less than 100 ms, and communication services
    are 99.99% available. For all usage situations, the reference bit rate is less
    than 2 Mbps, and the device is immobile. This reference bit rate may be asymmetric,
    such as in high UL traffic [111]. At least a couple of years should pass between
    charges. Safety-related sensors, such as smart factories, require less delay (5
    to 10 ms). Generally, time-critical sensing and feedback, augmented reality, safety-related
    sensors, and remote drone operations are applications in industrial sensors. For
    instance, the goal of the smart grid is to create a more sustainable and efficient-energy
    infrastructure that can meet the needs of an increasingly connected and energy-intensive
    world. In IIoT, a specific application known as the power IoT focuses on smart
    grids to attain automatic optimized data collection and exchange of information,
    as well as smart energy management [116]. 6. Focuses of CIoT technologies One
    of the focuses of the CIoT is to provide extended coverage in areas where traditional
    cellular networks may not reach, including indoor and underground locations and
    remote or rural areas. This reach is achieved using a narrowband frequency for
    better signal penetration and greater range. Another key role of the CIoT is to
    offer efficient and cost-effective connectivity for a broad scope of IoT applications,
    from smart cities and homes to agriculture, transportation, and healthcare. With
    its low-power consumption and ability to facilitate numerous connected devices,
    the CIoT enables a broad range of use cases, including asset tracking, remote
    monitoring, and sensor networks [38]. For instance, international roaming can
    be considered one important focus of the EC-GSM-IoT, minimizing device complexity
    and cost. Because the EC-GSM-IoT has coexisted with 2G mobile networks, it has
    benefited significantly from all the security and privacy features provided by
    mobile networks including various measures to ensure user confidentiality and
    privacy, such as the protection of user identity, authentication protocols, data
    encryption to ensure confidentiality, measures to maintain data integrity, and
    identification of mobile equipment [73]. LTE-M, on the other hand, targets medium-sized
    IoT applications supporting voice and video services. Therefore, it is a better
    candidate technology for over-the-air firmware updates during the life span of
    IoT devices [26]. Unlike the NB-IoT, LTE-M is better suited for mobile devices
    to avoid connection and data loss and provides higher data rates that would enable
    more use cases, such as VoLTE vehicles, fleet management, tracking devices, and
    related use cases [117]. Moreover, LTE-M can be used in video surveillance systems
    because it supports higher data rates and can transmit real-time video data. In
    addition, the NB-IoT is primarily designed for ultralow-end and latency insensitive
    or delay tolerant IoT applications [68]. It focuses on fixed indoor coverage in
    areas where signal loss and multitiered layers have posed problems. NB1 UE, for
    example, operates only in the 200 kHz bandwidth with IoT devices imposing ultralow
    complexity for services without strict data rate, latency, or mobility requirements
    but that requires a massive deployment of low-cost devices [65]. Lastly, according
    to 3GPP and Ericsson [44], [51], RedCap has many use cases and is highly necessary
    to work in extremely harsh environments. RedCap was introduced with lower hardware
    complexity at more affordable prices. It aims for terrestrial coverage and targets
    exchanging data over the satellite with the aim of ubiquitous coverage area (referred
    to as NTN communication) [109]. It is possible to run a RedCap device on an NR
    carrier optimized for eMBB or time-critical communications. The objective of the
    study group on the NR-RedCap has been emphasizing reduced UE complexity, such
    as a reduced number of antennae, reduced UE bandwidth, HD-FDD, and other aspects.
    Compared to high-end eMBB and URLLC devices of Rel. 15/16, the primary driving
    force of the new device type is to reduce device cost and complexity, which is
    true for industrial sensors [109]. The standard must allow for a device design
    with a compact form factor to support most use cases, and all FR1/FR2 bands for
    FDD and time division duplex should be supported by the system [110]. As shown
    in Table 7, video cameras, for instance, lead to higher data-rate requirements
    than can be satisfied by the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT. Smart cities, smart
    farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly installed
    surveillance cameras. According to TR 22.804, a reference economic video bitrate
    would be 2 to 4 Mbps with a latency of 500 ms or less and a reliability of 99%
    to 99.9% [110]. High-quality video, for example, for farming, would require 7.5
    to 25 Mbps [30]. As explained in [3], reference bitrates for smart wearable applications
    can range from 5 to 50 Mbps in the DL and 2 to 5 Mbps in the UL. The device’s
    peak bit rates can reach 150 Mbps in the DL and 50 Mbps in the UL [30]. The battery
    should last one to two weeks for wearables, as reviewed in Fig. 7. Rel. 17 for
    RedCap devices introduced power-saving techniques to extend battery life and enable
    longer usage times. These are; eDRX for RRC idle and inactive states and RRM relaxation
    for stationary devices. In eDRX, when DRX cycles are utilized, it can achieve
    up to 10 485.76 s, almost 3 h when the RRC is idle, and up to 10.24 s when the
    RRC is inactive. In demanding RedCap use cases, such as industrial wireless sensors,
    eDRX proves to be a valuable solution in meeting the battery lifetime requirements.
    Regarding the RRM relaxation, in RRC idle and inactive states, the device is required
    to regularly conduct RRM measurements. These measurements are necessary to determine
    and select the best available cell for the device to establish a connection. In
    spite of this, the battery will be depleted even if there is no active data transmission.
    Thus, skip performing RRM measurements under certain thresholds of reference signal
    received power (RSRP) and reference signal received quality (RSRQ) values are
    employed [30]. In addition, the other optional power-saving features, standardized
    in Rel 15 and Rel. 16, are also made available for RedCap devices which offer
    power-saving capabilities to enhance the battery performance. Because of the fast-growing
    need for personal care devices and diagnostics, such as sports, healthcare, and
    fitness devices, wearables have garnered more attention. Devices that are too
    small in size, such as smartwatches, rings, e-health-related devices, and medical
    monitoring devices, are supported by RedCap, which can collect and relay health
    information. The CIoT plays an immense role in healthcare, and healthcare IoT
    (HIoT) is developed and supported by AI, big data, software-defined networks,
    and blockchains [118] with the driving technology; the Internet of Nano Things
    and tactile Internet. The HIoT is implemented in the form of wrist-worn smart
    wearables [119]. As with other IoT application requirements, HIoT prompts low
    latency that can be obtained through edge computing implementation using a large
    volume of data through cloud and edge computing. As most medical applications
    are private, the blockchain has been a solution to secure patient data from third-party
    access risks [120]. In healthcare-based medical operations, it is highly recommended
    to securely transmit sensitive healthcare data to the fog and cloud for processing.
    Ullah et al. [121] recommended fog and cloud-assisted computing as the appropriate
    candidate solutions for these issues. RedCap has an immense role in remote surgery
    applications by integrating wearables, medical sensors, industrial sensors incorporating
    surveillance cameras, and more. For more, we briefly present their detailed features
    in the following sections. 7. Features of CIoT technologies To guarantee that
    CIoT technologies can efficiently provide connectivity solutions for various use
    cases ranging from Massive IoT to Critical IoT, this section outlines essential
    requirements that must be met for the large-scale deployment of these services.
    These include extended coverage areas, low deployment costs, extended battery
    life, affordable device costs, support for a vast number of connected devices
    (scalability), and robust security and privacy measures, we discuss in detail
    as follows. Wide Coverage: Delivering a wider and more extended coverage area
    is one of the main aims of the CIoT. In a wide coverage area, the path range is
    an important parameter that varies inversely with frequency, offering tens of
    kilometers of coverage. Carrier frequency has a significant effect on CE. Although
    the path loss is directly dependent on the size of the carrier frequency, if the
    carrier frequency is high, the propagation loss becomes high. Maintaining a lower
    carrier frequency is important to maximize the coverage in the CIoT to lessen
    propagation loss. For instance, the EC-GSM-IoT is based on the GSM; thus, the
    frequency band of the GSM is highly globally deployed with the four known global
    frequency bands 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz, where coverage is ultimately enhanced
    [73]. Ericsson, Orange, and Intel have tried extending coverage on smart agriculture
    use cases using the EC-GSM-IoT, confirming that it is possible to enhance indoor
    coverage by deploying new software on the existing cellular networks [122]. Moreover,
    CE techniques should be implemented to achieve a wide or deep coverage area (it
    is primarily accomplished by sacrificing the data rate for coverage), which is
    required for two reasons. Implementing reduction techniques in device complexity
    (e.g., minimizing to a single-antenna Rx and lower maximum transmission power)
    may result in performance degradation that directly produces coverage loss. The
    loss of coverage can be maintained by scaling transport block size (TBS), HARQ
    re-transmissions for the physical DL shared channel (PDSCH), PUSCH, physical UL
    control channel (PUCCH), and PDCCH [9], [67]. Second, some CIoT devices could
    encounter extremely difficult coverage circumstances. Hence, transmission time
    interval bundling, sending a limited, predefined number of transmissions without
    feedback instead of sending a block of transmissions once, and narrowband retuning
    are key feature techniques to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. In widening
    the coverage, the objective is to attain a CE of 15 dB compared to GSM and LTE
    [123]. The 3GPP measures CE using the MCL standard, which is the discrepancy between
    the power levels transmitted and received before the signal is lost. Coverage
    can be measured as “kilometers of coverage” but according to the analysis presented
    in [124], it is not adequate since it heavily relies on the carrier frequency
    and environmental factors such as the type of location, whether it is indoors,
    outdoors, urban, suburban, or rural. In contrast, MCL is an appropriate measure
    because it is not influenced by the frequency and environmental aspects. At extreme
    coverage, it is expected to attain 20 dB from the normal LTE or GSM coverage,
    and it is very important to determine exactly how much coverage the CIoTs can
    provide. Apparently, for evaluation, Ericsson, AT and T, KT, SK Telecom by Korea,
    Nokia, Verizon, Altair, Docomo, Sony, SoftBank, TELKOMSEL by Telecom Indonesia,
    Virtuosys, Sequans Communications, KDDI, and Orange conducted a thorough link-level
    simulation inspection to assess the actual coverage performance of 3GPP’s LTE-M
    technology. Their findings discovered that LTE-M is capable of achieving a coverage
    gain of 21 dB compared to older LTE devices, which is higher than the 3GPP target
    of 18 dB. This increase of 21 dB corresponds to a data rate of 1400 bps in the
    DL and 250 bps in the UL. If IoT applications can tolerate slower data rates and
    longer acquisition times, it is possible to achieve a coverage gain beyond 21
    dB without using the BS power spectral density (PSD) boosting [124]. With a 21-dB
    gain with 23 dBm UE (the maximum coverage) and less conservative noise figures,
    LTE-M is a strong competitor for IoT applications that require extensive coverage,
    with a maximum MCL of 164 dB, and where the demands for low latency, high mobility,
    and fast data transfer are less stringent. Moreover, LTE-M has two specifications
    in its CE strategy: Modes A and B. The former mode is mandatory and supports only
    moderate CE, whereas the latter mode, B, supports deep and extended coverage that
    can be considered optional. Common coverage techniques are employed to provide
    CE for the LTE-M specification. The Tx power (e.g., Class 3 power amplifier 23
    dBm and Class 5 power amplifier 20 dBm) is increased by considering the increasing
    cost management, repetition by optimizing accurate channel estimations, and frequency
    tracking to manage the downside of repetition in linearly increasing the latency.
    In addition, PSD boosting improves the DL coverage and reduces the power by employing
    a maximum amount of PSD boosting to 4 dB. These methods are the most feasible
    in CE, as illustrated in [124]. In B5G CIoT [125], a programmable metasurface
    can significantly improve coverage with an intelligent reflecting surface. Through
    the IoT non terrestrial network (NTN) work item in Rel. 17 [91], 3GPP has already
    addressed NTN support for LTE-M and the NB-IoT [114]. Overall, LTE-M can support
    extensive IoT deployments, covering the maximum distance and beyond with the approved
    QoS and minimum maintenance provisions. From the 3GPP standard specification,
    the range of the NB-IoT covers urban and rural areas, outlined as 1 to 2 and 10
    to 15 km, respectively [126], enabling better signal propagation in basements
    (aiming for 20 dB improvement over legacy cellular systems) [127]. A transmission
    time interval bundling, repetition (retransmission, such as 128 and 2,048 times
    in the UL and DL, respectively [89]), and narrowband retuning are employed as
    key features to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. The number of repetitions
    of a transmission is determined by the desired CE level (CEL) for a given set
    of devices. The CEL is the signal strength at a particular location and can be
    influenced by the distance between the Tx and Rx, the transmit power, the Rx sensitivity,
    and interference. The number of tones and sub-carrier spacing, which are the number
    of different frequency components used to transmit data and the distance in frequency
    between adjacent sub-carriers, respectively, also affect the CEL and spectral
    efficiency of a wireless communication system [22]. The increased number of retransmissions
    lowers the spectral efficiency [128], which requires reducing the number of retransmissions.
    However, three CELs are supported by NB-IoT devices: CEL-0 for 0 dB with an MCL
    of 144 dB with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, CEL-1 for 10 dB with an MCL of
    154 dB with 15 kHz spacing, and CEL-2 for 20 dB with an MCL of 164 dB with 3.75
    kHz carrier spacing [79]. In the CE of the NB-IoT, the objective is to attain
    a coverage capacity of 164 dB [123], [129] and guarantee that it can enhance the
    164-dB coverage achieved through repetitions in time, with power amplification
    in in-band and guard-band operation modes [65]. In general, this is preserved
    by implementing repetition, boosting the PSD, reducing the system acquisition
    time, and random-access range enhancement. Based on the findings in [21], the
    coverage of NB-IoT [882 MHz] can be boosted by up to 398% with a mere 10% enhancement
    in Rx sensitivity. Enhancing the coverage by implementing machine learning methods
    using reinforcement learning-based dynamic spectrum access [130] is also feasible.
    The NB-IoT increases the link budget by over 20 dB, significantly enhancing penetration.
    Although reducing the device capabilities can lower the device cost and reduce
    the device size, it has an adverse influence on coverage. For instance, in RedCap,
    reducing the number of antennae and limiting the number of spectrum bands can
    affect device coverage. It is vital to secure the device cost and lower complexity
    simultaneously to enhance the coverage. In RedCap, it is expected to extend 10
    to 15 dB compared to URLLC. Low Power Consumption: Most IoT devices are powered
    by batteries. Therefore, conserving energy to extend their lifespan is vital.
    It is exceptionally demanding to reserve the main power supply by implementing
    longevity in the battery life of the device before recharging is mandated. Devices
    that support lower power consumption have a longer device battery life. In many
    use cases, the CIoTs are supposed to achieve a battery life of up to 10 years.
    The battery usage directly relates to how long the device spends sending and receiving
    data. As research [58] has noted, to maintain a battery life of 5 years, for example,
    a device with a 5000 mAh battery capacity should use no more than 2.74 mAh per
    day. This limit can be achieved by restricting daily battery consumption to below
    5000 mAh/5/365 [58]. Achieving long battery life and reducing maintenance costs
    are critical in applications and equipment with limited battery capacity, which
    makes low energy consumption essential. However, the battery life depends on coverage
    [131]. The objective of 3GPP standards for battery life in the CIoT is to achieve
    10 years of service life in most extreme coverage situations at 164 dB MCL [47]
    (11.9 years is achievable) and 35.7 years at normal coverage (144 dB MCL) [84].
    This feature can also save costs in areas where replacing batteries can be a challenging
    task, such as basements or subterranean tunnels. In minimizing power consumption,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT utilize techniques including the power-saving mode
    (PSM) [132], [133], [134], long periodic tracking area updates (TAU), and eDRX
    which are developed by the 3GPP standards to reduce energy consumption and enable
    an extended life for these devices [80]. The PSM allows modules to enter a sleep
    mode that consumes very little energy (only a few microamps) while sending TAU
    messages at long intervals to remain registered on the network. This approach
    eliminates the need for reregistration when the module wakes. The eDRX feature
    allows devices to enter a low-power paging mode for an extended period of time,
    during which they can receive data from the server but do not need to send data,
    saving power when the device does not need to transmit. In eDRX, an extension
    of 52 min is possible. The PSM can use paging in the DRX or jointly use paging
    and routing area updates (via incoming SMS, voice call, or data) to reach the
    CIoT devices on the network. For devices that prefer a lower periodicity of reachability,
    using eDRX is more advantageous; however, for devices that can tolerate longer
    intervals of inaccessibility, the PSM emerges as an appealing alternative. Furthermore,
    implementing GMSK modulation in the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, influences power
    and energy efficiency. The enhanced coverage common control channel (eCCCH)can
    also contribute to energy efficiency, providing long battery life. Other energy-saving
    techniques besides PSM and eDRX have been developed and employed, such as energy-efficient
    TAU, user and control plane optimizations, energy-efficient paging reception,
    wake-up signal (WUS) calls, and techniques for monitoring cells less frequently.
    Furthermore, RedCap power consumption is anticipated to be significantly (2 to
    4 times) lower than that of Rel. 16 eMBB, resulting in minimized power usage.
    The battery life is expected to span 1 to 3 years. In Rel. 17, 3GPP suggested
    improvements for UE power conservation in the idle or inactive mode while considering
    system performance factors to address the power consumption problem. They studied
    and specified improvements to power-saving methods for connected UE, with the
    least possible influence on system performance [3]. Based on power-saving techniques
    proposed in Rel. 17 for RedCap devices, in the idle and inactive state, eDRX cycles
    are almost 3 h and 10.24 s, respectively. This approach better extends the battery
    life [67] in the stringent use case of industrial wireless sensors, for example.
    In addition to eDRX, the relaxation of frequent radio resource management (RRM)
    to secure the exact camping in its idle and inactive state can avoid the drainage
    of batteries, primarily in stationary devices. In general, potential power consumption-saving
    techniques include reducing the duration the device spends checking the control
    channel for scheduling, lengthening the device sleep time by extending the DRX
    period, and allowing for less frequent measurements for stationary devices. In
    the long run, a very high energy-efficiency technology is expected, supporting
    battery-free IoT devices, such as self-driving cars, drones, and auto-robots [135].
    The most important area of research in the IoT is energy efficiency, especially
    in IIoT, to preserve moderate power consumption [136]. According to [28], energy-saving
    methods can be maintained in three ways: configurations (including traffic models,
    connectivity periods, and DRX cycles), software modification (comprising improved
    radio layer protocols, changes have been made to the scheduling request procedures
    for accessing radio channel resources, as well as the introduction of new software
    entities in the core network to improve communication in both the UL and DL directions),
    and hardware integration (embedding a low-power Rx by deactivating the main Rx).
    In [137], energy efficiency or low power consumption can be achieved by eliminating
    transmission between nodes using the star topology, maintaining a straightforward
    node design, and using narrowband channels for reduced noise and an extended transmission
    range. Based on [138], the joint optimization of user selection, power allocation,
    and antenna selection while fulfilling the QoS requirements has a prior role in
    maximizing energy efficiency under imperfect channel state information. In most
    IoT devices, the channel state information is imperfect due to the functional
    limitations and mobility, as stated in [139]. In addition, an advanced energy-harvesting
    technique called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is another
    promising solution to achieve energy-efficient green communication. Chen et al.
    developed a two-layer iterative algorithm to manage inter- and intra-beam interferences
    by leveraging the Dinkelbach method [140] for energy maximizing by allocating
    power at the base station and splitting power at each IoT node. The other promising
    solution is HARQ feedback. Transmitting a positive HARQ-ACK over MPDCCH in a UL
    data center interconnect is now possible [141]. This approach enables early termination
    of the UL (PUSCH) transmission or early termination of the DL (MPDCCH) monitoring
    (for FD-FDD or time division duplex but not HD-FDD). It allows the BS to notify
    the UE that UL data have been successfully received using two HARQ processes and
    10 HARQ processes with a beneficial effect. In addition, cell reselection with
    relaxed monitoring is a good option. When enabled, the UE can reduce neighbor
    cell measurements to once every 24 h [25]. This approach can significantly lower
    power usage, especially for fixed UE in difficult coverage situations. Moreover,
    resynchronization signal (RSS) better improves energy economy when a device needs
    to regain synchronization with a cell’s time and frequency [5]. Researchers from
    academics and industry have been studying solutions and techniques to address
    power consumption issues, including energy harvesting [142], [143], [144], sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, zonal thermal pattern analysis
    for smart agriculture, and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring system
    for smart health applications [14]. In [145], RF energy harvesting on the strength
    of RF signals was cheaper to implement and available in difficult-to-reach places
    where other popular sources, such as solar or wind, may not be accessible. Moreover,
    accurate computation and efficient communication are critical for numerous devices
    to reduce power usage. Developing communication systems that are energy-efficient,
    both in terms of system design and hardware is vital to mitigate power problems
    [146]. Over-the-air computation was proposed as a promising solution [147]. In
    [148], energy-harvesting strategies for operating low-power network devices using
    long-lasting IoT devices and sensors were studied, enabling them to be self-powered
    and providing devices with long standby intervals. Network parameter settings
    affect energy consumption and network performance, and [149] found that the paging
    interval set by the BS has the greatest effect on energy consumption when the
    device is connected. Low Cost: In the CIoT, installing or maintaining local networks
    or gateways is unnecessary. The sensor can connect directly to the desired system
    or network, which maintains the cost [27]. Maintaining low power consumption facilitates
    low device costs, which can be achieved by reducing Tx and Rx bandwidths. Current
    costs run between $10 and $15 per module, with a long-term goal of reaching $5.
    The GSM, for instance, is the main player in machine-to-machine communications
    because of its reduced cost compared to other technology. As a result of the expiration
    of the device module patents in GSM networks, compared to other 3GPP-defined technology,
    the cost of the EC-GSM-IoT module is the most economical in developing countries
    [27], [52], less than $10, where 2G, 3G are deployed. The EC-GSM-IoT module cost
    is $5.5 and $2.9 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151], respectively. It is because of
    the overall cost of deployment, network coverage (which can balance the economy
    of vendors, particularly in the Asian and African continents), maturity (the presence
    of a more mature ecosystem comprising a wide range of compatible devices, and
    applications), lower complexity, and lower frequency band specificity. The other
    player in achieving ultralow-cost devices is the implementation of a GMSK-only
    modulation. Moreover, for cost reduction, according to the analysis of [152],
    the trend reveals a 10-times reduction in 1G and 2G, respectively, and a 1000-times
    reduction from 3G to 6G. In contrast, the NB-IoT has many design trade-offs to
    achieve low-cost goals, resulting in a simplified, low-complexity system with
    a lower data rate. One of these trade-offs is the lack of carrier aggregation,
    a technique that combines multiple carriers (or frequency bands) to increase the
    available data rate. Carrier aggregation requires additional hardware and processing
    resources, increasing the cost and complexity of NB-IoT devices. Similarly, NB-IoT
    does not support voice services or multi-stream transmissions in the DL/UL direction.
    These features would also require additional hardware and processing resources,
    which would be incompatible with the low-power and low-cost requirements of the
    NB-IoT. Instead, the NB-IoT provides simple, low-data-rate communication for IoT
    applications that do not require high-bandwidth or real-time services [80]. However,
    the NB-IoT can operate alongside the existing GSM and LTE networks, which can
    help lower deployment costs. The device cost is related to the complexity of baseband
    processing, memory consumption, and RF requirements. Valuable cost reductions
    can be achieved from various modifications associated with narrowband operations,
    power reduction mechanisms, and the simplification of a physical layer [14]. The
    NB-IoT module cost is achieved $4 and $2-3 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151] per module,
    respectively which is more effective in urban environments where 5G requirements
    are in hand. Regarding LTE-M devices, they could achieve a similar cost to GSM
    devices by simplifying the design of the end devices. Due to its compatibility
    with existing LTE radio systems, LTE-M can be easily deployed through a simple
    software upgrade to meet the cost optimization needs of IoT applications, building
    upon the foundation of LTE technology. Taking into consideration the market scale,
    the module cost for LTE-M is less than $10, making it an affordable option [153]
    by incorporating various optimizations to enhance efficiency and reduce complexity.
    These optimizations include incorporating half-duplex operations (i.e., less complex
    and less costly), reduced transmission mode (TM) support, minimizing the number
    of blind decodings required for control channel reception, and eliminating simultaneous
    reception. As elaborated in [150], [151], the LTE-M module cost achieved $5 in
    2016 and $3.3 in 2020. On the other hand, compared to standard NR UE, RedCap UE
    is substantially simpler due to the half-duplex operation, which means that the
    UE is not required to transmit and receive simultaneously, a smaller number of
    radio RX antenna branches (reducing the antenna configuration, can reduce the
    device size), and a smaller radio Tx bandwidth. As a result of the projected decreased
    complexity, devices are expected to be more affordable, enabling the use of NR
    in novel applications, such as industrial sensor networks [44]. In conclusion,
    these requirements are achieved through careful configurations, properly adjusting
    the traffic profile (the frequency and number of data transmitted and received
    by the UE), coverage situation (under normal, robust, and extreme coverage scenarios),
    and network settings [154]. Low Complexity: Simplified network topology and deployment
    is one component of the CIoT that the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, highly fulfills.
    It only requires software upgrades in the existing GSM networks [122]. In addition,
    by simplifying the modulation scheme used for transmitting data over the air instead
    of using more complex modulation schemes, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation
    (QAM) or 64 QAM used in traditional GSM networks, the low-complexity mode of EC-GSM-IoT
    employs a simpler modulation scheme called GMSK. This approach reduces the complexity
    of the transceiver hardware required to implement the technology. Keeping the
    device complexity ultralow to secure a low-cost device is expected to support
    the large-scale deployment of millions of devices. Indeed, the EC-GSM-IoT technology,
    for example, is an advanced version of the EGPRS technology, which already satisfies
    the necessary requirements without any need for further complexity reduction [73].
    The goal of LTE-M, for example, was to drastically reduce the complexity and cost
    compared to the preceding LTE device categories. In addition to reducing complexity,
    LTE-M aims to handle a broad range of mMTC use cases, including demanding high-throughput
    and low-latency applications. Under the 3GPP cost reduction analysis and techniques
    [155], employing the following methods can provide remarkable complexity reductions
    in LTE-M: reduction of the maximum bandwidth (from 20 to 1.4 MHz), a single-receive
    radio frequency (RF) chain (from 2 to 1), a reduction of the peak rate (from 10
    to 1 Mbps), a reduction of transmit power (from 23 to 20, or 14 dBm), half-duplex
    instead of a full-duplex operation, and a reduction of supported DL transmission
    modes. Furthermore, securing low device complexity is required to boost the QoE
    and QoS in IoT applications. The device complexity is related to the complexity
    of baseband processing, memory consumption, and transmit-and-receive antenna (RF
    requirements). In NB-IoT, for instance, low complexity can be secured by reducing
    the TBS, accommodating only single-stream transmissions, supporting only a single
    HARQ process for both the DL and UL, adapting only one redundancy version in the
    DL, applying a low sampling rate due to lower UE bandwidth NB-IoT support, and
    allowing only HD-FDD operation [68]. Additionally, synchronization in the modulation
    and demodulation process requires higher computation. However, the NB-IoT has
    been specifically designed to facilitate low-complexity Rx processing in such
    operations. The RedCap, in addition, is also developed to be lower in complexity
    compared to the standard NR via narrowing the bandwidth, reducing the number of
    DL MIMO layers, the transmit antennas, the receive antennas, and so on. Mass Device
    Connection and Global Deployment: Massive connectivity is the key component in
    IoT applications to provide and offer the intended services to society. Mass device
    connectivity pertains to the number of devices that meet a specific QoS within
    a given area, typically measured in terms of square kilometers. As a result of
    the CIoT’s low complexity features and high demands and expectations, deploying
    a massive number of IoT devices is demanded. As concluded in [147], the present
    CIoT technology is efficient, and developing 6G CIoT is essential. Massive numbers
    of device connections are vital when expanding coverage is needed. According to
    [101], low-orbit satellites have been identified as an efficient option for delivering
    long-range IoT services with good coverage and latency by supporting numerous
    connections. Furthermore, the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication
    Sector (ITU-R) [41] has established a firm requirement for International Mobile
    Telecommunications (IMT) 2020 systems that mandates a connection density of one
    million devices per square kilometer. For instance, the GSM has been deployed
    for over 30 years. A round 50% and 25% of subscriptions are made in developing
    countries in Africa and the Middle East, respectively, according to Ericsson’s
    November 2022 report [156]. The GSM networks are widely covered and deployed worldwide,
    making connecting devices feasible, which means that the EC-GSM-IoT can be deployed
    in most regions without significant additional infrastructure. Hence, the deployment
    of the EC-GSM-IoT is feasible worldwide. It can also accommodate massive device
    connections with at least 50,000 nodes per cell [66]. 3GPP has been developed
    enhancements to support more devices per cell. For instance, optimizing resource
    allocation in IoT communication systems is critical in supporting many IoT devices.
    In [157], the authors devised a two-step optimization technique for UL transmission
    using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on deep learning. This approach
    is capable of optimizing the assignment of sub-bands and controlling transmit
    power with outcomes of low complexity, and it can accommodate a large number of
    devices. Moreover, regarding enabling numerous IoT device connections, [158] introduced
    leveraging the unlicensed spectrum in addition to exploiting the licensed spectrum.
    From the Technical Specifications Group RAN work group of TR-45.820 [32], [43],
    [159], for only one PRB (12 × 15 kHz), the NB-IoT, for example, can hold more
    than 52,500 pieces of UE per cell, in some scenarios, it also supports 72,000
    devices [160]. NB-IoT enables the connection of up to 100,000 end devices at the
    expense of complexity and cost [28], [75], [134] within single-cell, and its capacity
    can be obtained by incorporating multiple NB-IoT carriers of 200 kHz. In this
    configuration, one anchor carrier is dedicated to carrying the always-on broadcast
    signaling, while additional carriers (non-anchor carriers) are utilized for offloading
    data traffic and enhancing capacity. Moreover, enhancement objectives include
    designing positioning support (horizontal) targeting at least 50-m accuracy; extending
    the single cell point to multi-point network to support the CIoT for multicast
    DL transmissions (namely firmware or software updates and group message delivery);
    specifying new UE power classes (e.g., 14 dBm) to enable lower maximum transmit
    power suitable for small form-factor batteries, mobility, and service continuity
    enhancements; UL enhancements to reduce device power consumption further; and
    enhancements to support voice [93]. Improved Security: Given the growing importance
    of IoT devices in various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation,
    ensuring the security of things is critical to protecting sensitive data and ensuring
    the safe operation of these devices. Every CIoT technology option necessitates
    that both the network and the mobile station employ an enhanced and strong security
    framework. They have got a significant benefit from all the security and privacy
    mobile network features comprising user identity confidentiality, authentication,
    confidentiality, data integrity, and mobile equipment identification since it
    is operating in the licensed spectrum sharing all the advantages of standards-based
    technologies. For instance, EC-GSM-IoT has an LTE-grade security to improve end
    user security for the sake of removing any security concerns. The security measures
    currently in place for GSM technology have significantly contributed to enhancing
    security in EC-GSM-IoT. These procedures involve mutual authentication of both
    the device and the network during connection establishment, employment of 64-bit
    long encryption and 128-bit ciphering algorithms for better encryption, rejection
    of incompatible networks, and protection of control plane integrity [75]. Most
    importantly, the integration of existing CIoT technologies with 5G is done. This
    integration allows for enhanced security mechanisms across the network, addressing
    issues of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for a wide range
    of interconnected IoT devices. In general, in CIoT, extending coverage, reducing
    power consumption, lowering device complexity, reducing device cost, enhancing
    massive connectivity, and enhancing positioning are the foremost required features
    to maintain during CIoT communication by all mobile network operators, organizations,
    and companies. As shown in Fig. 8, coverage extension techniques can be incorporated,
    such as repetition and bundling, direct interface side-links or relays, and reducing
    the subcarrier spacing. For example, asset tracking, fleet management, and smart
    cities all rely on accurate positioning data to function effectively and maintain
    position enhancement. Hence, observed time-difference-of-arrival positioning,
    enhanced cell-ID positioning, UL time difference of arrival positioning, location
    positioning protocol, assisted global navigation satellite systems, and centimeter-level
    positioning techniques have been integrated. Solutions for reducing power consumption
    include lowering the transmit power by introducing new classes of UE, enhancing
    power-saving modes (PSM, eDRX, and WUS), and limiting mobility and handovers.
    Narrowing the bandwidth and reducing the number of DLs, multiple-input multiple-output
    layers, and Tx or Rx antennae minimize device complexity. Moreover, reducing signaling
    overhead, simplifying the core network architecture (network elements, interfaces,
    and protocols), and employing better resource management techniques can enhance
    network efficiency. Further, reducing device costs and Tx and Rx bandwidths, minimizing
    the device complexity, reusing the available spectrum and technology, and lowering
    order modulations can play a vital role in using the devices and removing marketing
    barriers. Download : Download high-res image (678KB) Download : Download full-size

    CIoT technologies CIoT technologies have a wide range of applications and can
    be used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of life in
    various industries and sectors. Table 8 presents applications better suited for
    the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap. The EC-GSM-IoT is fundamentally designed
    to offer coverage for machine-to-machine communications (direct communication
    with each other without the need for human involvement) in areas with challenging
    radio coverage conditions. However, the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. The EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap can be employed in areas of applications including; smart cities (waste
    and traffic management), smart environments (building automation; urban safety;
    and intelligent environment monitoring), smart metering (electricity, water, gas,
    and parking spot meters), asset tracking and smart logistics [154], localization,
    farming (monitoring livestock), forestry, industry pallets and pipelines [18],
    [161], and intelligent transportation (e.g., logistics services, and traveling
    time estimation) [23]. Moreover, the LTE and NB-IoT can work with the low and
    geostationary earth orbit satellites to support NTN, studied in Rel. 17 on the
    NB-IoT and LTE-M for NTN [31]. Under the IoT over NTN projects [91], for instance,
    UAVs [162] can use LTE-M to develop low-latency energy-efficient communication
    techniques and power-efficient computing modules [163] in military applications
    to track enemy locations. The feasibility of integrating the NB-IoT into the NTN
    [70] was investigated to extend the coverage in challenging environments like
    mountains, deserts, and oceans [164]. In the same objective, NR-RedCap is designed
    based on the 5G NR requirements, so its application is vital. The 5G is becoming
    prominent in the healthcare industry, automotive industry, smart cars, manufacturing
    sector, smart factories, smart grids, and smart cities [53], which substantially
    affects the IoT but has high costs and complexity issues compared to RedCap. Due
    to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming manifested
    in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require low latency,
    ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. Hence,
    these envisioned use cases have specific requirements regarding data rate, latency,
    battery life, reliability, and other factors. As of today, CIoTs are being applied
    in the following application areas. Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture is one
    of the key application scenarios in the IoT industry [165]. Via CIoTs connectivity,
    farmers and cities can capture data from environmental sensors for management.
    The reason is that they can access places that are hard to reach, such as remote
    areas where agriculture or infrastructure sensors are installed. Due to this,
    monitoring the soil temperature and humidity and tracking the existing land features,
    rain, and pollution are some of the activities farmers can perform using EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap [24], [166]. In Africa, specifically, farmers are utilizing
    multiple interconnected sensors in their fields to identify the optimal planting
    and harvesting periods for specific crops by leveraging EC-GSM-IoT technology
    [76], [167]. LTE-M and NB-IoT have a role in smart agriculture. Moreover, RedCap
    is expected to be used in cooperative farm machinery in the near future. Minimizing
    water waste will be vital to advancing agricultural processes based on real-time
    monitoring and predictive data analytics via remote sensing [13]. Smart Grid and
    Meter: CIoT technologies play a significant role in application areas, such as
    smart metering, smart grid management with strong coverage requirements, and low
    power use scenarios (e.g., water and gas) since they can access places that are
    hard to reach, such as deep basements where smart meters are installed. They are
    well-suited for connecting many remote smart meters to a central data collection
    point, allowing utility companies to remotely monitor energy consumption and manage
    their networks more efficiently, leading to cost savings and improved customer
    service [168]. Through the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, in smart grid
    applications; electricity is efficiently transmitted and distributed, power is
    recovered rapidly after a fault occurs, maintenance costs are reduced, and security
    and protection. They can remotely control and monitor energy-consuming devices,
    such as air-conditioning and heating systems, to reduce energy consumption during
    peak demand periods [37], [169], [170], [171] with the support of numerous (more
    than 10,000 devices in a cell) smart grid devices. Indeed, a smart grid management
    system is the main operational demand for power control, enabling two-way communication
    between providers and consumers. For instance, according to the investigation
    in [171], demand–response techniques are pivotal to addressing power outage problems,
    reducing cost, and increasing reliability. Intelligent Transportation: Tracking
    and monitoring vehicles intelligently is crucial for transportation companies
    and vehicle owners. Hence, 3GPP identified the vehicle-to-everything communication
    types [33]: vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to pedestrian,
    and vehicle to network. In intelligent transportation, vehicle-to-vehicle communication,
    vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, autonomous/semi autonomous driving, and
    in-car infotainment systems emerged [57]. The CIoT technologies can also assist
    drivers in various ways, such as providing real-time traffic and weather information,
    route planning, and parking assistance; improving the driving experience; and
    reducing the risk of accidents. In intelligent transportation, fleet management
    applications are most in demand [172] including; monitoring fuel consumption and
    scheduling maintenance and repairs. Moreover, LTE-M is well-suited for applications
    requiring voice and data communications, such as telemetry and remote control
    systems. Hence, LTE-M is well-suited for fleet management applications because
    it supports voice and data communication and can track the location and status
    of vehicles in real-time. For transportation systems to be effective, they need
    to be quick, dependable, and adaptable. By implementing the CIoT-based Internet
    of Vehicles, drivers can receive real-time traffic updates, monitor speed limits,
    and subsequently reduce traffic congestion and accidents. In smart parking, for
    instance, data can be transmitted and received in real-time, enabling immediate
    updates to park availability and other information. The available CIoTs can improve
    efficiency, reduce parking costs, and improve the overall user experience [173].
    For some IoT use cases with stationary mobility in intelligent transportation,
    for instance, all CIoT technologies are applicable. NB-IoT, despite its limited
    mobility characteristics, can be considered applicable for smart transportation.
    The devices are often deployed in fixed locations, such as road sensors, infrastructure
    components, or stationary objects along roadways. These devices collect and transmit
    various transportation-related data including real-time tracking, traffic analysis
    (traffic conditions, environmental factors), parking space reservation (often
    involves parking in the basement), location navigation, vehicle management, and
    enable communication between vehicles [174]. Overall, using EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    NB-IoT, and RedCap for intelligent transportation systems helps reduce travel
    time, fuel consumption, and environmental effects and can improve the overall
    travel experience for passengers and drivers. Smart City: Smart cities have a
    high level of technology integration and are distinguished by the extensive use
    of information and communication methods [175]. Due to the current urbanization
    demands worldwide, the smart city concept has been extended from smart offices
    and smart homes to smart buildings. In the framework of smart cities, applications,
    such as environmental sensors, smart grids, predictive maintenance, utility meters,
    high-definition security cameras, smart parking, smart traffic management, smart
    city sensors system for irrigation, and smart street lighting are included, and
    supported by CIoT systems [153], [176], [177]. A smart city cuts costs, increases
    resource consumption efficiency, engages with inhabitants more actively during
    emergencies, and greatly reduces labor costs. Controlling street lights, assessing
    free parking spaces, monitoring environmental conditions, and inspecting road
    conditions are some of the daily administrative tasks performed by city bodies.
    Furthermore, in each layer of IoT applications (i.e., in smart cities), security
    and privacy are daily concerns for safety [178]. Noteworthy to know a smart city
    can be considered a package comprising applications, including intelligent environmental
    monitoring, intelligent transportation, smart street lighting, smart grid, smart
    metering, smart homes, and the like. These applications are demanding the use
    of deep learning-based techniques, for example, in smart lighting [24], [179]
    of smart garbage detection systems that can recognize garbage more accurately,
    reducing the necessary deployment costs and material resources. Smart Homes and
    Buildings: One of CIoT’s rapidly expanding markets is smart homes. The primary
    focus behind the smart home philosophy is preserving energy [79]. Recently, the
    CIoT has offered a powerful and flexible way to control and monitor various aspects
    of the home, providing convenience, energy reduction, and enhanced security [180].
    Various ECG-SM-IoT, LTE-m, NB-IoT, and RedCap devices can be deployed in the living
    room, kitchen, bathrooms, and other rooms. In addition, the devices can be used
    for video surveillance monitoring [177]. For example, homeowners can access remote
    lighting controls, monitor their children, and turn devices on and off while commuting
    to and from work. In emergencies, such as smoke and hazard incidents, installing
    CIoT devices in a smart home is beneficial. Examples of applications that can
    utilize these CIoT’s building penetration capability include monitoring utility
    usage (e.g., smart heat), enhancing security in residential properties, smoke
    detectors, and managing energy consumption in household appliances [24]. Smart
    Environmental Monitoring: Environmental monitoring is a wider concept comprising
    both natural and human environmental phenomena involving rural-agricultural and
    urban-city-oriented monitoring. It includes monitoring air, soil, water, traffic
    volumes, city infrastructure, and other aspects. The existing CIoT cellular network
    can provide intelligent services [181] by incorporating a wireless sensor network
    to automate data acquisition for easy data analysis. These intelligent services
    optimize resource usage, reduce waste, and increase energy efficiency by providing
    real-time data on environmental conditions [182], [183]. It can also be used for
    monitoring the location of wild animals, observing their habitats, and recognizing
    their behaviors. Furthermore, the role of the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    in intelligent environment monitoring involves public health and safety in identifying
    and mitigating possible environmental hazards and extreme weather conditions.
    Smart Tracking: Vertical industries, including transportation, logistics, and
    manufacturing, have a high demand for tracking and monitoring the location and
    movement of physical assets, such as vehicles, equipment, and inventory. Installing
    or attaching global positioning system trackers or RF identification tags onto
    assets and communicating their location and status to the central system optimizes
    operations (e.g., routes in logistics companies) by delivering real-time updates
    on the location, movement, and condition of the assets (e.g., temperature). Hence,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap are useful in tracking shipping, monitoring
    drivers and goods, and obtaining diagnostics and reports across moving operations
    in industry [153], [184], contributing to efficiency improvement, cost reduction,
    and customer service enhancement. Note that when continuous tracking is not required
    NB-IoT can be taken as a good method. In addition to enabling real-time tracking
    and monitoring, they can also provide other benefits in asset tracking systems,
    such as the ability to monitor the condition of the assets and alert maintenance
    personnel when repairs are needed, reducing downtime and improving the overall
    efficiency of the tracking system. Smart Hospitals: Healthcare is the most important
    concern in the era of smart life projects, with a high priority [177]. Wearable
    devices, such as fitness trackers or sports wearables, smartwatches, and smart
    clothing, can track and monitor location and movements and provide identification,
    authentication, data collection, and sensing, including patient vital signs, such
    as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Moreover, implantable devices,
    such as pacemakers and defibrillators, can monitor the heart, or sensors can monitor
    a segment of an organ (i.e., the lungs or kidneys). A periodic update of training
    data and message reception is possible with the NB-IoT and LTE-M in normal conditions
    [190]. Similar to LTE-M and NB-IoT, EC-GSM-IoT is also suitable for low data rate
    healthcare applications. To enhance patient outcomes and lower healthcare expenses
    through the implementation of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring systems,
    EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are suggested for healthcare applications.
    These technologies offer swift data transfer, energy efficiency, broad communication
    coverage, dependable performance, the ability to handle large data volumes, and
    human tissue safety. Their accurate localization capabilities enable them to address
    clinical care in the hospital and remote patient care. Furthermore, they can be
    utilized to acquire medical reports at regular intervals and receive alerts triggered
    by specific events. Additionally, it enables real-time, two-way medical control
    and monitoring of health conditions through live video feeds. General applications
    in health care systems, including remote patient monitoring, medical asset tracking,
    wellness-tracking wearables, and secure data collection protecting patient data
    privacy [16], can be supported by the current CIoT technologies. Table 8. CIoT

    play a pivotal role in tracking and monitoring assets and their states in industries
    (transportation, logistics, and manufacturing). Smart hospitals [61], [66], [167],
    [188] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Because of their fast data transfer, optimized energy consumption,
    rapid data transfer, wide-ranging communication reach, high reliability, capacity

    patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by implementing telemedicine and
    remote patient monitoring systems. Video surveillance cameras [110], [153] ✓ ✓
    LTE-M and RedCap are used for remote monitoring and surveillance applications
    in various industries, in cooperative farm machinery for example, to assist in
    monitoring crops, livestock, and so on. Industry IoT [8], [66], [111] ✓ ✓ ✓ NB-IoT,
    LTE-M, and RedCap are used in monitoring equipment status, controlling processes,
    and ensuring factory safety. Wearables [1], [189] ✓ ✓ ✓ LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    have the ability to provide assistance for wearable devices, such as smartwatches,
    which typically necessitate voice functionality, portability, and fast data transfer
    rates for connectivity to the Internet. Wearables: Devices equipped with NB-IoT
    technology enable real-time monitoring of energy consumption, enabling utilities
    to enhance energy management and improve the efficiency of health monitoring.
    Moreover, in the context of wearables, the ability to support mobility and high
    data rates is critical, as is the ability to support VoLTE. For this reason, LTE-M
    and RedCap are emerging as strong candidates for powering the next generation
    of wearable devices. In applications such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and
    medical wearables, crucial data can be extracted based on various metrics, including
    heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity levels. These real-time data are sent
    over LTE-M and RedCap networks to be analyzed by the responsible authorized individuals
    (e.g., doctors and caregivers) or organizations [118]. Importantly, LTE-M and
    RedCap support movement so that it is possible to monitor users anywhere in motion,
    such as runners, to track their well-being [189]. The utilization of wearable
    devices potentially simplifies self-care for elderly individuals, for instance.
    Hence, wearable devices equipped with NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap technology have
    the capability to track and record an individual’s physical activity, heart rate,
    body temperature, and other health-related data. Video Surveillance Cameras: Due
    to their support of high data rate and video capturing, LTE-M and RedCap are the
    candidate CIoT technologies in video surveillance camera services. Smart cities,
    smart farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly
    installed surveillance cameras. In LTE-M, for example, the Cat-M2 UE category
    supports multimedia IoT applications such as voice and video which have a maximum
    TBS of 4008 bits in the DL and 6968 bits in the UL good for video surveillance
    applications. Moreover, for high-quality video, RedCap plays a significant role.
    Industry IoT: The LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap sensors can be used in the prediction
    of machine failure in the factory. Note that the NB-IoT is not suitable for moving
    objects, so the device is assumed to be battery-powered in a fixed location in
    the factory, requiring two-way communication to upgrade the firmware and software
    [191]. It has a significant role in real-time applications and is more suitable
    for industrial systems that require real-time communication without mobility requirements.
    Even though the NB-IoT supports only up to QPSK modulation that limits its data
    rate, spectral efficient frequency division multiplexing has been proposed, which
    uses higher modulation formats; however, it has drawbacks in energy consumption.
    The authors of [192] developed a two-dimensional channel-aware adaptive modulation
    scheme that improves network performance while maintaining energy efficiency to
    solve this problem. On the other hand, LTE-M and RedCap are the prominent technologies
    for IIoTs since they support mobility and high data rates. Moreover, RedCap is
    objectively developed for such use cases including wearables and video surveillance
    cameras, which we discuss under the RedCap section in detail. 9. Future challenges
    The proposed solutions are explicitly explored as part of the CIoT use-case specifications
    by the 3GPP working group. Most requirements set by the study groups in various
    release versions have been met as promised and planned. Indeed, CIoT has gained
    attention globally due to its cost-effective, ubiquitous coverage with ease of
    deployment of massive MTC and URLLC and several feasible reasons. However, there
    are further challenges that need to be resolved. Congestion Problems: Overcrowding
    or congestion is a significant challenge in the CIoT with a very high concentration
    of devices, as there are limited resources available to handle the numerous sporadic
    access attempts made by a diverse range of MTC devices [26]. With a massive number
    of devices, an enormous number of simultaneous access requests occurs, causing
    congestion in the physical random-access channel, resulting in network access
    delays [193]. For instance, if multiple machine-type devices transmit the same
    preamble simultaneously, they cause the access requests to fail so that access
    efficiency decreases and the number of supported devices reduces. Hence, optimized
    node clustering and data aggregation have been employed as candidate solutions
    to address congestion [194]. Kim and Bang [195] proposed a random-access parallelization
    technique to support multiple preambles, enabling each IoT device to attempt multiple
    instances of random access in parallel to mitigate collisions. In addition, the
    preamble (re)transmission limit [196] is adopted in the UE MAC layer. In contrast,
    network slicing is another promising method to improve the efficiency of resource
    utilization [57], [197] by allocating resources dynamically between slices, providing
    QoS in congestion situations and end-to-end communication. Furthermore, a study
    [198] introduced a recursive access class barring technique to use the available
    resources optimally, obtaining an optimized service time and average access delay
    compared to the conventional access class barring schemes. Despite these solutions,
    as the massive number of devices expands, the reliability of access, data transmission,
    and energy consumption are inevitably questioned. Very High Signaling Overhead
    per Data Packet: In the CIoT, signaling overhead becomes a significant issue when
    considerable signaling is required for each data packet a device sends. Very high
    signaling overhead per data packet can occur when frequent updates or small amounts
    of data are sent from the device. Cellular networks are optimized for larger data
    packets, and when small data packets are sent frequently, the overhead required
    to establish and maintain the connection becomes a significant proportion of the
    overall communication. However, it is particularly problematic in scenarios where
    devices are battery-powered and have limited energy resources, such as IoT devices
    where a device sends small data packets infrequently. The signaling required to
    establish and maintain the connection can become a bottleneck. It can significantly
    increase network traffic, causing issues, such as network congestion, increased
    latency, and energy consumption [52] on the device and network sides, and reduced
    overall performance. Although data packets transmitted by IoT devices are typically
    small, the high signaling overhead required per packet can always become a significant
    issue for IoT devices [199]. Various signaling reduction techniques can address
    these issues, such as message queuing, efficient protocols, and optimized network
    coverage [200]. Studying more appropriate methods is crucial for scheduling transmissions
    and reducing signaling overhead in extremely dense environments using advanced
    techniques, such as machine learning to overcome these challenges in the ultra-dense
    CIoT to meet service requirements, such as latency, battery life, and accuracy.
    Scalability/Massive Connection: There has been a surge in demand for CIoT connectivity,
    especially in the healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing industries, according
    to the future market insight projections [201]. Hence, numerous connected devices,
    sensors, and machines must be handled simultaneously. The main challenge facing
    the CIoT is the need to support numerous devices with a broad range of capabilities
    and requirements to mitigate problems, such as network congestion, power consumption,
    security, and cost. This challenge requires significant investments in network
    infrastructure and management systems to ensure that the network can scale to
    meet the demands of the IoT. Providing connectivity for many devices can be a
    challenge for CIoT networks, where the system scalability [112] comprises the
    network capacity, processing power, data storage, and security. In [202], mobile
    edge computing (MEC) based CIoT (MECIoT) is taken as one of the promising solutions
    for scalability. Thus, techniques including developing low-power devices, designing
    and implementing smart system architecture involving leveraging distributed computing,
    cloud-based infrastructure, and other advanced technology, such as edge computing
    and AI might help and should be further investigated. Privacy and Security: Security
    cameras, biometric sensors, and authentication devices, electronic door locks
    and access control systems, fire alarm and detection systems, intrusion detection
    and prevention systems, industrial control systems used in critical infrastructure
    such as energy, water, and transportation systems, medical devices such as pacemakers
    and insulin pumps are security-sensitive devices that could harm owners if their
    security is threatened by intruders [118]. It is because, the limited resources
    of CIoT devices can make it challenging to implement robust security measures,
    leaving them vulnerable to attacks [203]. CIoT devices are often deployed in physically
    vulnerable locations, making them susceptible to tampering. In addition, the low
    power and low data rates of CIoT devices can make it difficult to implement strong
    security protocols, leaving them open to network-based attacks. Moreover, the
    lack of uniform standards for security in CIoT can lead to inconsistencies in
    security measures across different devices and networks, potentially exposing
    vulnerabilities. To address these risks, it is essential to implement strong security
    measures such as encryption, secure authentication, and access control, while
    also establishing industry standards for securing the devices [204]. Moreover,
    Ni et al. [205] proposed a security authentication system to protect device security
    during network slicing by isolating IoT applications. Savic et al. [206] proposed
    a deep learning-based anomaly detection, the anomaly detection module (ADM) for
    IoT devices (ADM-EDGE) and the ADM at the mobile core network (ADM-FOG), to enhance
    the CIoT security and the mobile core network, respectively, by demonstrating
    it on smart logistics use cases. However, the trial is on small-scale real-world
    use cases that should be examined on a large scale. In [161], quantum resistance
    access authentication is developed to achieve privacy protection and anti-quantum
    attacks. However, numerous IoT devices with high-speed mobility still have security
    issues relating to moving from one cell to another. Interoperability and Integration
    Issues: Enabling different IoT devices and applications to communicate with each
    other and with the CIoT networks seamlessly is another barrier facing the CIoT.
    Due to the requirements for the device, network, standardization, and security
    and the heterogeneity of the protocols, there are a variety of interoperability
    types, including infrastructure (device interoperability), architecture (network
    interoperability), design (syntactical and semantic interoperability), and platform
    interoperability [207], in which intelligent algorithms should be implemented.
    However, ensuring seamless and interoperable communication among numerous devices
    is challenging because of its various data formats, protocol interfaces and application,
    and the complexity increases if two or more devices communicate simultaneously
    [208]. It is necessary to create a multifaceted technology approach to handle
    the interoperability concerns. This approach requires the development of standards,
    protocols, software tools and interfaces, data formats, and more that can be used
    across networks and devices. Energy Efficiency/Power Consumption: One of the most
    critical constraints for CIoT devices is battery life. Most CIoT devices are battery-powered
    require constant sources of power and need low power consumption with many years
    of deployment lifecycle in remote locations where supplying power is spectacularly
    difficult. The reason why many years of deployment are employed is that activities
    include charging batteries regularly, devices that are hard-wired to maintain
    electricity, and a complete device replacement which causes human interaction
    too costly for the business case. For battery-powered IoT devices, energy efficiency
    is a highly critical factor [154]. Often, IoT devices are designed to be low-power
    and energy-efficient, but this is not easy to achieve with cellular networks,
    which requires new approaches to network design and management to ensure the network
    can support low-power devices while providing the necessary performance and coverage.
    However, there are still compromising power consumption issues in the CIoT. One
    method of saving energy in the age of AI is applying the recommended deep neural
    network techniques. However, due to frequent memory access, executing power-intensive
    deep neural networks on low-resource IoT devices increases power consumption.
    To address these problems, a study [209] suggested that reducing the number of
    MAC operations and data precision saves energy. In addition, the recursive access
    class barring technique provides resource-efficiency and energy-efficiency solutions
    [198]. However, a trade-off occurs between energy efficiency and other performance
    factors, such as high data transfer rates, poor network coverage, and complex
    data processing (to mention a few that could be balanced), and further investigation
    is required. Cost: As the deployment of numerous IoT devices increases exponentially,
    it can result in high costs for network providers and end users. Network providers
    and IoT device manufacturers explore partnerships and collaborations to reduce
    costs, share resources, and leverage each other’s expertise and capabilities.
    Among other solutions, significant factors of the CIoT to make IoT devices more
    accessible and affordable for a wider range of applications and use cases are
    using low-cost devices and employing technology that stabilizes the costs for
    the device, network, maintenance, data management, and others [27], [30], [155].
    Often, IoT devices are designed to be low cost, which requires new approaches
    to network design and management to ensure that the network can be deployed and
    maintained at a low cost. However, a low-cost design negatively affects CIoT performance,
    spectral efficiency, and energy consumption. In [210], the authors proposed a
    time allocation algorithm to avoid the problem. Nonetheless, the support for a
    massive number of devices can become limited. Spectrum Efficiency: As IoT devices
    use a small amount of bandwidth, the spectrum is a limited resource that must
    be shared among a massive number of connecting devices. Efficient spectrum allocation
    is vital for connecting many IoT devices and preventing network disruptions. The
    author [211] investigated power-domain nonorthogonal multiple access as the best
    multiple access technique for efficiently utilizing the existing spectrum resources
    in IoT networks from the multiple-user scenario by assigning different power levels.
    However, the number of frequency blocks in the IoT network in the framework is
    limited. Al-Dweik et al. [212] mentioned that power-domain nonorthogonal multiple
    access could be a prominent solution for spectral efficiency from the same user
    perspective in which nonidentical power values can be assigned. However, in large-scale
    IoT networks, spectral efficiency requires new robust approaches to spectrum management
    to ensure that the network can support numerous low-power devices. Quality of
    Service: The level of services and performance of a network provider guarantees
    its customers to make the IoT devices reliable is a highly important factor in
    the CIoT. The technical challenges in the CIoT regarding the bandwidth, power,
    delay, and error rate should be optimized to attain the various QoS requirements,
    including reliability, low latency, high throughput, low power consumption, security,
    scalability, cost-effectiveness, and more. Indeed, IoT devices require low-latency
    and high reliability communication, which is challenging to provide in cellular
    networks. Network optimization, traffic management, and service-level agreement
    strategies are good for preserving QoS [199]. Furthermore, deploying fixed and
    mobile small cells due to the reduced Tx-to-Rx distance is expected to improve
    the QoS with the ever-increasing data demands [213]. However, challenges still
    exist, such as interference and resource management. Hence, new and robust approaches
    to network design and management are required to ensure the network can support
    low-latency, high-reliability communication to achieve QoS. 10. Conclusion In
    recent years, the CIoT has emerged as a promising solution for providing a scalable,
    reliable, and secure infrastructure connecting a broad range of devices and applications.
    The CIoT enables billions of devices to connect and share information, creating
    new services and applications. With the ongoing full deployment and integration
    of 5G networks, CIoT is poised to gain further significance. The fact that 5G
    offers higher data rates, lower latency, and massive device connectivity, which
    unlock new possibilities for CIoT applications, 3GPP and Ericsson have been working
    on standardization of CIoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices. The LTE-M and NB-IoT have confirmed that they can efficiently
    be integrated into the 5G and share its ultimate benefits. The URLLC capabilities
    of 5G enable mission-critical CIoT use cases, such as autonomous vehicles, remote
    surgery, and industrial automation, that require real-time, reliable connectivity
    is now achieved. Moreover, the CIoT is valuable because it reduces the cost and
    complexity of deploying and maintaining IoT networks, provides a global and standardized
    solution for connecting IoT devices, and enables interoperability while ensuring
    the security and privacy of data transmitted over the CIoT network. To this end,
    in this paper, we have compared the existing literature on CIoT technologies and
    discussed their general network architecture. Moreover, we have elaborated on
    the existing CIoT technologies with a complete overview from the perspectives
    of their features and current state-of-the-art including release enhancements,
    focuses, and applications. Finally, we have identified the major challenges in
    CIoT technology that researchers, academics, and industry operators might find
    interesting for further studies and efforts. Declaration of competing interest

    Keywords: Internet of Everything; Internet of Things; cloud computing; security;
    privacy; smart systems 1. Introduction The digital transformation of the 21st
    century has ushered in a new era of connectivity, where everyday objects, devices,
    and systems are becoming increasingly interconnected, intelligent, and data-driven.
    As a result of the exponential emergence of the Internet in interconnected networks,
    most technology must adhere to more rigorous standards. This transformative phenomenon
    is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. However, beyond
    the IoT lies a more comprehensive and expansive concept known as the Internet
    of Everything (IoE), which expands the boundaries of network connectivity with
    intelligent devices and is forecasted to see even more rapid advancement in the
    future [3]. The IoE is an ecosystem where devices and things are connected to
    the Internet, and where people, processes, and data are seamlessly integrated,
    creating a web of interconnectedness that transcends traditional boundaries [4].
    The Internet of Everything (IoE), as delineated by Cisco Systems Inc., encompasses
    an intricate network of interconnections involving individuals, processes, data,
    and IoT devices. According to Cisco’s estimations, the forthcoming 15 years are
    poised to yield substantial advantages from IoE implementation in the global public
    sector, amounting to an impressive USD 4.6 trillion. Simultaneously, the private
    sector is expected to generate a remarkable USD 14.4 trillion in economic value
    during this period [5]. In this digital realm, objects can communicate with each
    other, make autonomous decisions, and interact with humans in ways that were once
    the stuff of science fiction. The IoE concept not only encompasses smart devices
    and sensors but also leverages data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud
    computing, and advanced networking technologies to create a symbiotic relationship
    between the digital and physical worlds. It promises to revolutionize industries,
    enhance the quality of life, and address some of the most pressing global challenges,
    from healthcare and transportation to energy efficiency and sustainability. This
    introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the IoE ecosystem, its
    key components and challenges, and the transformative impact it is poised to have
    on various domains of human activity. In the following sections, we will delve
    into the fundamental concepts, technologies, applications, and emerging trends
    of the Internet of Everything. In this paper, we have divided the structure into
    sections and subsections. In the introduction part, we introduced the concept
    of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and its transformative potential, setting
    the stage for our journey. In the section on related works, we examine existing
    research and innovation efforts, highlighting the progress made thus far. The
    materials and methods section delves into the critical components of the IoE,
    emphasizing the convergence of the IoE that underpins this revolutionary concept.
    Our discussion of the results underscores the dynamic and multifaceted nature
    of IoE innovation. Ultima, the promise of IoE technologies and innovation is substantial,
    offering boundless opportunities for a brighter and more connected future. The
    motivation to explore IoE technologies is driven by its capacity to solve complex
    challenges. The IoE has the potential to address global issues such as the integration
    of physical and digital realms, creating a landscape where devices, systems, and
    individuals converge, interoperate, and share data in real time. In conclusion,
    this exploration of IoE technologies and innovation sets the stage for a compelling
    journey into the interconnected world of the future. By understanding and leveraging
    IoE, we can pave the way for a more efficient, sustainable, and connected society
    that unlocks opportunities for growth and transformation across all sectors. 2.
    Related Works The evolution of the Internet of Everything (IoE) has been a subject
    of profound interest and investigation in recent years. Researchers and scholars
    alike have delved into various facets of the IoE, seeking to unravel its intricate
    web of connections between people, processes, data, and objects. A significant
    body of related works has emerged, shedding light on the transformative potential
    of the IoE in diverse domains, including industry IoT (IIoT) and cognitive IoT
    (CIoT), as shown in Figure 1. These studies have elucidated the critical role
    of the IoE in enhancing efficiency, enabling data-driven decision making, and
    ushering in the new era of connectivity. Figure 1. The Internet of Everything
    (IoE). The IoE plays a pivotal role in enabling the creation of innovative services,
    based on the Internet of Things (IoT), fog, and cloud computing paradigms. IoT-based
    sensors are poised to enhance data transmission for analysis, thus contributing
    to improved decision making and an overall increase in the quality of citizens’
    lives [6]. The IoE is anticipated to receive significant amounts of attention
    in the coming years, especially with the emergence of new, exciting technologies
    in the sectors of networking, software, hardware, and luxury-oriented services
    for humans [5]. Several researchers have made significant contributions, with
    diverse objectives that collectively enhance the capabilities of the IoE. Antonios
    et al. conducted a systematic literature review on semantic technologies in smart
    cities, with objectives centered on identifying trends and challenges in adopting
    semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient urban
    environments [7]. In the context of the Internet of Everything (IoE) environment,
    the incorporation of infrared communication into the smart home system emerges
    as a noteworthy development. Researchers [8] have effectively addressed the longstanding
    challenge wherein a significant portion of infrared-communication-based household
    appliances faced limitations in their integration into the smart home network.
    This innovative effort not only resolves this problem but also helps to lower
    the implementation costs of such a smart home system, making it more affordable
    and useful in the everyday lives of the general population. Another study attempted
    to replicate a multitude of pragmatic Internet of Everything (IoE) scenarios,
    mirroring real-world applications. In this pursuit, this paper adeptly harnesses
    the capabilities of the Cisco Packet Tracer, an instrumental tool employed in
    the experimental setup [9]. This comprehensive exploration necessitates the interconnection
    of a substantial array of sensors and devices, effectively emulating the complexities
    that are inherent to IoE ecosystems. Moreover, this investigative work encompasses
    the deployment of a diverse range of network components, including routers, switches,
    and servers, with IoT devices thus culminating in the establishment of a fully
    operational network infrastructure, like the contributions such as [10]. Numerous
    researchers are eagerly contributing to holistic performance enhancement by adopting
    heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms that are used extensively for time–cost
    optimization in cloud computing [11]. Equally, in [12], the study focuses on elevating
    various performance aspects of quality management (QM) and bolstering consumer
    confidence within the Internet of Everything (IoE) framework. The study introduces
    a QM platform designed to prioritize swift responses and minimize latency in acquiring
    sensor data, while also ensuring authentication, data consistency, and transparency
    in the context of cold supply chain logistics. Additionally, an innovative adaptive
    data smoothing and compression (ADSC) mechanism is proposed to efficiently reduce
    the size of IoE data. This facilitates storage within edge gateways, even when
    they have limited computational and storage capacities. This research contributes
    significantly to optimizing cold supply chain logistics by harnessing IoE and
    blockchain technologies to enhance quality management and transparency in supply
    chain operations. 3. Materials and Methods Systematic mapping or scoping studies
    aim to offer a comprehensive perspective on a specific research field by categorizing
    and organizing existing research. These studies primarily delve into the body
    of available research to assess the breadth of various subjects, publication frequency,
    emerging research patterns, and the sources where relevant studies have been disseminated.
    In this particular study, the systematic mapping process adheres to the recommendations
    outlined by Petersen et al. [13]. In accordance with the systematic mapping study
    guidelines, the key procedural stages encompass defining research inquiries, scouring
    for pertinent academic papers, screening these papers, annotating abstracts with
    relevant keywords, extracting data, and creating a visual representation, as illustrated
    in Figure 2. Each of these steps yields specific outcomes, and the ultimate product
    of this entire undertaking is a systematic map, which is further elucidated in
    [13,14]. Figure 2. Systematic mapping [13]. Definition of Research Questions (Research
    Scope)—The principal objective of a systematic mapping study is to establish a
    comprehensive view of a specific research domain, determining the extent and nature
    of the research and findings available in that domain. Conducting the Search for
    Primary Studies (All Papers)—The identification of primary studies was accomplished
    by employing search terms within scientific databases or by manually perusing
    relevant conference proceedings and journal publications. Screening of Papers
    for Inclusion and Exclusion (Relevant Papers)—Inclusion and exclusion criteria
    were applied to sift through studies that were pertinent to addressing the research
    inquiries, discarding those that did not meet the criteria. Keywording of Abstracts
    (Classification Scheme)—Keywording served as a method to expedite the development
    of the classification scheme and ensure that it took into account existing studies,
    thereby reducing the time required. Data Extraction and Mapping of Studies (Systematic
    Map)—Once the classification scheme had been established, the relevant articles
    were organized within it, signifying the practical phase of data extraction. 3.1.
    Research Questions The primary research question (RQ) of this systematic mapping
    study was: “What innovations are derived from IoE technology?” This primary question
    was divided into seven RQs. Table 1 lists the formulated RQs along with the rationale
    behind each RQ. Table 1. Research questions. 3.2. Data Sources We examined twelve
    electronic databases as our main sources for potentially relevant studies. Google
    Scholar was omitted from the selection due to its lower precision in delivering
    results and the significant overlap with results from other data sources. The
    electronic databases utilized during the search process are detailed in Table
    2. Table 2. Electronic databases. 3.3. Search Terms To ensure a thorough search
    of pertinent studies, it is crucial to identify the appropriate search terms.
    Kitchenham et al. [15] introduced the population, intervention, comparison, and
    outcome (PICO) perspective as a valuable framework for this purpose. This perspective
    has been widely adopted in numerous systematic literature reviews (SLRs). Below,
    the relevant PICO terms are listed: Population: primary studies on the Internet
    of Things; Intervention: IoE innovations; Comparison: problems, innovation, advantages,
    limitation performance metrics, and future directions; Outcome: innovation, advantages,
    and limitations of IoE technology. (‘‘Internet of Things” OR “Internet of Everything’’
    OR “Internet of Everything Technologies’’ OR “Internet of Everything Trends” OR
    “Internet of Everything Limitation” OR “Internet of Everything Innovations’’)
    AND (‘‘Artificial Intelligence’’ OR ‘‘Smart Environment’’ OR “Smart Systems’’
    OR ‘‘Cloud Computing” OR ‘‘Security Privacy’’ OR “Network Technologies”) 3.4.
    Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria In this systematic mapping study, inclusion and
    exclusion criteria were used to select and excludestudies from the data sources
    to answer the RQs. These criteria were applied to all studies retrieved during
    the different phases of the study selection procedure (see Table 3). Early cited
    articles were also included, provided the full text was available. Table 3. Inclusion
    and exclusion criteria. 4. Results and Discussion In this section, all the RQs
    are answered by analyzing the results extracted from the collection of primary
    studies. In the course of our discussions, each primary study is referenced using
    a unique Paper Identification (PID), and these PIDs correspond to the research
    works summarized in Appendix A. 4.1. RQ1: To Which Domains Has the IoE Been Heavily

    study. As depicted in Figure 3, the cloud computing, fog, and edge collaboration
    domain represents 25%, signifying its substantial prevalence in the IoE landscape
    compared with other domains. This prominence can be attributed to its central
    role in enabling IoE services, minimizing latency, and streamlining data processing
    and analysis. This domain effectively caters to the fundamental infrastructure
    and connectivity demands of IoE, rendering it a primary focal point for researchers
    and practitioners in this field. Figure 3. IoE technology in various domains.
    Collectively, these researchers have contributed to the advancement of similar
    domains, addressing critical challenges and fostering innovation through their
    IoE expertise. Therefore, there are also interconnections between researchers’
    work in various domains. This interdisciplinary collaboration leads to innovations
    that leverage IoT technologies to address complex challenges across diverse domains.

    illustrating the interconnections among studies in different domains and their
    contributions to diverse IoT applications. Furthermore, as addressed in RQ1 discussions,
    Figure 3 presents the percentages of research undertaken in various domains, enhancing
    the comprehensibility of the analysis. Table 4. Number of studies and interconnections
    in IoT applications. 4.2. RQ2: What Types of Problems Exist in IoE Innovations?
    The Internet of Everything (IoE) encompasses a wide range of innovations and technologies
    that aim to connect not onlydevices and people, but also data, processes, and
    things in a more comprehensive and integrated manner. As a result, IoE innovations
    can address a diverse set of problems and challenges across various domains. Based
    on the analysis of this study, we identify the current problems in IoE innovations.
    Below are some common types of problems in IoE innovation. 4.2.1. Healthcare As
    healthcare becomes more patient-centric, it needs a multilayer architecture to
    manage the enormous amount of data generated by the system, such as to control
    COVID epidemics/pandemics while maintaining privacy and addressing protection
    issues in healthcare [16,17]. The proliferation of the e-commerce market has posed
    challenges to staff safety, product quality, and operational efficiency, especially
    for cold-chain logistics (CCL). Recently, the logistics of vaccine supply under
    the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has re-aroused public attention and led to calls
    for innovative solutions to tackle the challenges remaining in CCL [18]. 4.2.2.
    Smart Environments Due to the unprecedented increase in the use of IoE technology
    and the volume of data it generates, there is a need to develop a state-of-the-art
    architecture to support a wide range of applications to manage smart city resources
    efficiently and intelligently [19,47]. The main challenge in realizing the smart
    city vision is providing seamless interoperability between the IoE entities [7].
    This is due to most of the systems nowadays working in a silo-based manner and
    not being able to be connected or communicate with other systems [8,20,23]. Security
    has become a hot subject of particular concern, with issues of complicated technology
    and a massive volume of data [37]. The IoE also poses considerable challenges
    to firms, including the development of interoperability between systems, coping
    with entrenched industry partners that do not collaborate with the new developments,
    path-dependent legacy processes and transactions, contractual and liability issues,
    security challenges, loss of control, as well as privacy concerns related to the
    explosion of data collected and used by businesses and their smart things [41,44,48,58].
    4.2.3. Power Systems, Virtualization, Distributed Systems, and Automation The
    IoT evolves into the IoE by incorporating the concept of things. A further step
    towards a Tactile Internet requires significantly reduced latency [3]. The coordination
    and management of the IoE in different equipment is challenging, and the energy
    consumption efficiency could be much higher, which is the bottleneck of battery-operated
    IoT equipment [46]. To meet the growing demands for IoE devices, the current power
    supply system needs improvement in both system and unit-level energy storage and
    management [55]. Challenging environments include environments where the medium
    is inhomogeneous, or the signal propagation is subject to high scattering and
    multipath effects. In addition, peer-to-peer networking of small devices and smart
    sensors will attract even more attention, with increased integration of participator
    sensing within the Internet of Things [29]. The disaster area is a constantly
    changing environment, making it challenging to distribute supplies effectively.
    The lack of credibility of IoE devices’ data operations, trust evaluation, and
    accurate information about the required goods and potential bottlenecks in the
    distribution process can be detrimental [42,43]. The IoE is expected to reinvent
    the business and the automation wheel altogether. From operational models to business
    and manufacturing frameworks, everything is likely to change with the change in
    data available and the smart connectivity between people and machines for critical
    decision making [59]. For several IoT applications, a long range, low cost, and
    low power consumption are the main connectivity constraints to meet, making many
    network technologies impractical [60]. 4.2.4. Cloud, Fog, and Edge Sensory infrastructure
    deployment and sensing technique development across different domains may share
    common challenges and specificities, which should be considered when designing
    an architecture. That is, sensors or sensory infrastructures belonging to one
    domain should be transmitted to and used by another domain when needed [24,26].
    One main challenge is moving these data from the underlying IoT to the cloud;
    architecture must support resource sharing across other domains [26,28]. Malicious
    attack detection and mitigation are essential issues for the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) [29]. Massive devices will lead to explosive traffic growth, which in turn
    will cause a significant burden for data transmission and content delivery [25,33].
    The distributed environment used for the IoE’s generation of big data (BD) has
    the potential to lead to data storage and processing problems. Inherent problems
    are the reason for the inefficient working of the applications in the cloud environment
    [21,22,34]. Several challenges include the significant fluctuation of user devices’
    requests at the edge side, the lack of collaboration among edge nodes, service
    delays, resource exploitation in multidevice fog-cloud architecture, and problems
    associated with time-sensitive applications [19,30,31,32]. 4.2.5. Digital Marketing
    and Blockchain Ongoing challenges persist in maintaining security within this
    context, while also adapting to evolving legal privacy requirements, many of which
    demand further technical clarification [60]. In the age of the Internet of Everything
    (IoE), intricate patterns of connectivity emerge among individuals, processes,
    data, and devices. When evaluating the assessment of companies operating within
    the IoE industry, the predominant issue revolves around substantial uncertainty
    [51]. Critical concerns in the IoE domain include user consent and data security,
    encompassing mobile devices and diverse service providers [27,58]. In the IoE
    ecosystem, the majority of “things” consist of low-power, low-performance devices.
    Several device attributes, such as security, privacy, power consumption, and computational
    capabilities, pose challenges when integrating a blockchain environment into the
    IoE [35]. 4.2.6. Data Security and Deep Learning With the increasing ubiquity
    and sophistication of facial recognition technology, a potential security and
    privacy concern regarding the exposure of facial data linked to sensitive personal
    information within the expansive Internet of Everything application platform arises
    [40]. Across various domains, the Internet of Everything generates copious data,
    encompassing domains like healthcare systems, traffic management, smart city surveillance,
    educational platforms, social networks, and government entities, among others.
    Scouring through this extensive dataset and locating specific data or keys presents
    a formidable challenge [56]. To safeguard the integrity of data, multiple security
    protocols operate in tandem with confidential keys, aiming to furnish security
    services. The primary hurdle lies in securely exchanging or distributing keys
    between two parties operating over an inherently insecure network [39]. Most existing
    anomaly detection solutions within the Internet of Everything are characterized
    by time-consuming processes and exhibit suboptimal accuracy levels [61]. 4.2.7.
    Agriculture The combined forces of climate change and a swiftly growing global
    population have significantly burdened agriculture. This, in turn, has created
    a ripple effect on the Earth’s water resources, a critical component of sustainable
    development. The imperative to transition away from fossil fuels for powering
    irrigation systems, prompted by climate change, necessitates striking a delicate
    balance [57]. Addressing the challenges within this sector is pivotal in order
    to reinvigorate it and propel it towards enhanced progress [27]. 4.2.8. Education
    Teaching has evolved beyond the mere transmission of content knowledge; it now
    emphasizes the development of the practical “how, when, and why” aspects of applying
    this knowledge in real-world contexts [53]. The complexity in designing and implementing
    IoE-based educational systems arises from the need to create multiple intelligent
    agents that infuse intelligence into every facet of the teaching–learning experience.
    The absence of intelligence within IoE-related systems can impede the management
    of the vast volume of information generated by individuals and devices within
    these systems [52]. To establish a smart campus, a range of systems is essential,
    including those for detection, monitoring, and analysis [54]. Based on the discussion,
    Table 5 has outlined the common challenges encountered in IoE innovation across
    diverse domains. Meanwhile, Figure 4 showcases the specific number of problems
    that researchers have focused on within their respective domains in the IoE landscape.
    Figure 4. Number of IoE problems focused on. Table 5. Common problems in IoE innovation.
    4.3. RQ3: What Is the Contribution of the IoE to Each Innovation? Researchers
    from different fields have strived to harness the IoE’s potential for addressing
    domain-specific challenges. This subsection synthesizes their efforts, highlighting
    common themes in research contributions. 4.3.1. Healthcare An exceptionally spectacular
    usage of the IoE was while the whole world suffered with the COVID-19 pandemic.
    The healthcare domain has witnessed significant IoE-driven improvements, and one
    of them is aimed at tracking and containing pandemics such as COVID-19 [16]. Leveraging
    accurate tracking technologies, cloud computing, and interoperable devices, researchers
    have focused on screening and identifying infected individuals during their daily
    routines. Other research endeavors [17,18] have proposed a multilayer architecture
    and a cyber-physical platform framework that applied the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) and digital twin (DT) technologies, respectively, to promote information
    integration and provide smart services for different stakeholders in the healthcare
    area. 4.3.2. Smart Cities and Urban Environments Smart cities have been at the
    forefront of IoE research, with a focus on resource allocation and job offloading
    architectures using intelligence-enriched 6G architectures [19]. The concept of
    EdgeOSH [20] has been introduced, revolutionizing home automation through edge
    computing. Researchers [21,22] have adopted fog aims to enhance data processing
    through the blockchain–fog architecture network (BFAN) whereas others [22] have
    introduced fog nodes (FN) within fog computing (FC) to facilitate IoT applications
    in urban environments, satisfying mobility support, low latency, and geo-distribution
    requirements. As a part of smart cities, [8] specifically focused on smart homes
    through introducing convenience and energy efficiency to daily life within smart
    homes. 4.3.3. Cloud, Fog, and Edge Collaborations Mutual objectives shared by
    several researchers [24,25,26,27,28] were achieved through adopting cloud, fog,
    and edge environments in IoE. Researchers have proposed a cloud-based architecture
    for resource sharing (CARS) and the energy-efficient cloud-based Internet of Everything
    (EECloudIoE) [25]. These architectures introduce geographically distributed platforms
    connecting sensors and various IoE components, providing valuable services to
    end-users. Dhaya and Khantavel contribute to this landscape by focusing on algorithmic
    efficiency within multi-data-center environments, further optimizing resource
    management in cloud-based IoE platforms [28]. Moreover, the paper [26] underscores
    the importance of integration by outlining a research agenda for the integration
    of IoT and cloud computing across various application fields. The peer-to-peer
    central-registry-biased Internet of Everything protocol (P2PRioEP) [27] formalizes
    provisions for hybrid peer-to-peer IoT networks, promoting efficient collaboration
    and data exchange within IoE ecosystems. Xu et al. introduce adaptive mechanisms
    for dynamically collaborative computing power and task scheduling (ADCS) [32].
    This approach enhances the efficiency of edge computing by dynamically allocating
    resources and tasks, aligning to optimize edge computing in IoE scenarios. Yi
    et al. reimagine IoE as an end–edge–cloud collaborative system that promotes the
    development of digital twin-based methods within edge computing [33]. Jain et
    al. highlight the importance of cyber twins in network frameworks by introducing
    a metaheuristic with blockchain-based resource allocation techniques [34]. Sachdev
    navigates key security and privacy issues related to edge AI in IoT/IoE digital
    marketing environments [56]. Bera et al. focus on enhancing security by introducing
    an artificial-intelligence-based blockchain-envisioned access control framework.
    This framework addresses the critical need for robust security measures within
    fog and cloud environments [29]. Velasquez et al. identify key challenges in developing
    a fog orchestrator to support IoE, particularly its impact on fog service orchestration
    tasks [30]. This research objective aims to streamline the orchestration of services
    within fog environments, ensuring efficient and reliable IoE operations. The objective
    of [31] is to introduce a conceptual model for mixed reality (MR) applications
    within fog and cloud environments. By enhancing user experiences through IoT/IoE
    models, this research contributes to the evolving landscape of mixed reality applications,
    which is increasingly relevant in the context of IoE. 4.3.4. Advancements in AI
    The authors of [59,61] both leveraged artificial intelligence in the IoE to enhance
    anomaly detection. The authors of [61] propose a novel deep learning framework
    that combines decomposition methods, deep neural networks, and evolutionary computation.
    Furthermore, innovations in force and tactile sensors, along with AR sensors,
    drive advancements in industrial robotics and manufacturing [59]. 4.3.5. Security
    in the IoE Security remains a paramount concern in IoE research. Innovations include
    novel blockchains such as “PUFChain” [35], which is designed for resource-constrained
    IoT environments. Various authentication schemes have been proposed for 6G IoE-based
    vehicular communication environments [36], emphasizing privacy preservation and
    security. Security and privacy challenges posed by personal smart devices used
    within enterprise settings were explored by [41]. Zhan et al., in their study,
    introduced the Internet of Everything smart logistic network (IoE-SLN) to improve
    smart logistics [37]. Various transportation system applications were integrated
    to enhance logistics parameters, supported by mathematical analysis. IoE research
    on distributed systems focuses on disaster management [42]. Researchers propose
    the integration of blockchain, the IoT, and the IoE to streamline disaster responses,
    reduce response times, and ensure the secure distribution of goods. Furthermore,
    content-based intelligent trust evaluation (CITE) schemes have been introduced
    for collecting trustworthy data in large-scale sensor-cloud systems [43]. 4.3.6.
    Optimization of Network Technologies with IoE The virtualization of networking
    services is explored, with a focus on customized and on-the-fly interconnectivity
    [29]. Other research emphasizes connecting terrestrial IoT network segments to
    satellite backends via satellite broadband [62]. Further, Iannacci aims to build
    an inclusive vision of the IoT, IoE, Tactile Internet, and 5G by leveraging MEMS
    technology, with a focus on energy harvesters (EH-MEMS) and radio frequency passives
    (RF-MEMS) [3]. A data manipulation method proposed by [46] aims to reduce energy
    consumption and network traffic in IoT networks, with an enhancement from software-defined
    networking (SDN). 4.3.7. Enhancing Business Strategies via the IoE IoE research
    extends to the realm of business strategies. Researchers explore how the IoE impacts
    business models and value creation [48]. Additionally, studies evaluate the implications
    of the IoE on marketing analytics [49], new product development, and management
    [50]. Approaches for determining objective and subjective weights in decision
    making are also introduced [51]. Demirkan et al. explored the impact of emerging
    big data and smart analytics on transforming connected products into “smart service”
    businesses [47]. This described a paradigm shift in value chains towards continuous
    data flow through complex business systems. 4.3.8. The IoE in Education Looking
    at an education perspective, the IoE has a transformative potential in improvising
    the field of learning. Ref. [52] focuses on developing system of systems (SoS)
    architectures to support educational contexts, fostering novel educational applications
    and dynamic interactions. Secure and agile architectures for IoE-based educational
    models and learning analytics systems (LAS) are proposed [53]. Furthermore, campus
    security management and notification systems are designed to enhance security
    and monitoring [54]. Researchers have similar objectives in terms of providing
    advancement in education services in the IoE environment. 4.3.9. IoE Research
    for Smart Systems The authors of [44,55] are both engaged in the area of smart
    systems in IoE research. Specifically, their research underlines the significance
    of efficient power supply systems with a high-output performance and extended
    lifetime, placing a strong emphasis on self-power capability in order to guarantee
    the long-term viability and maintenance-free operation of IoE networks. Additionally,
    these researchers expand their focus to include the design of architectural models
    for managing tourism information effectively, introducing the concept of smart
    tourism [44]. Fan et al., in their paper, describe that their objectives revolve
    around enhancing power supply systems and architectural models for the IoE while
    incorporating tourism management strategies [55]. Next, in their research, Pedro
    et al. introduced a cognition module for gathering information from smart systems
    to create knowledge for intelligent services [58]. The goal was to develop a generic
    framework for various smart systems, enabling horizontal integration. Similarly,
    research by Vaya and Hadpawat aimed to provide efficient keys or data-searching
    mechanisms for clients to explore big data within a database [56]. The respective
    studies share common objectives in the realm of IoE in terms of contributing to
    various smart system enhancements. Adenugba et al. demonstrated how smart irrigation
    systems powered by renewable energy sources (RES) could substantially improve
    crop yield and agricultural profitability [57]. They emphasized control and monitoring
    using sensors and environmental data from the Internet of Everything (IoE). Kumar
    et al. aimed to attain a standard quality in crops, focusing on duration, measure,
    hygiene, and blooming stem. They proposed an advanced prototype to enable continuous
    tracking and informed decision making for farmers, using data mining principles
    [27]. Researchers have proposed smart operating systems to streamline IoE system
    management for practitioners [23]. Further, the emerging areas in Internet of
    Everything (IoE) research were examined, revealing several key domains where researchers
    have made notable contributions. Figure 5 illustrates this and includes smart
    cities (23.08%), marked by urban applications and resource allocation; smart systems
    (30.77%), focusing on efficient power supply and architectural models; cloud/fog/edge
    (15.38%), involving collaborations between the IoE and cloud technologies; disaster
    management (15.38%), integrating blockchain and the IoT for logistics and disaster
    response; network technologies (7.69%), emphasizing networking virtualization;
    and education (7.69%), aiming to enhance educational systems. Smart systems garnered
    the most attention from researchers, with smart cities being the second most explored
    domain. This analysis showcases the multifaceted nature of IoE research, spanning
    various domains and applications. Figure 5. Contributions in Emerging Areas. The
    research contributions summarized in this article emphasize the IoE’s versatility
    and transformative potential. They highlight the diverse ways in which IoE technologies
    can address domain-specific challenges and inspire interdisciplinary collaboration.
    As the IoE continues to evolve, researchers from various domains are poised to
    contribute to its growth and maturity [63]. 4.4. RQ4: What Are the Most Frequently
    Used Evaluation Metrics? Evaluation metrics play a vital role in gauging the quality
    of the IoE. Various evaluation metrics are at our disposal for assessing IoE innovation,
    as illustrated in Figure 6. The lines and circles in Figure 6. represent the evaluation
    metrics and the total number of primary studies associated with the enhancement
    of each specific performance metrics. The employment of multiple evaluation metrics
    is of paramount importance, since an innovation may excel under one metric but
    underperform when assessed with another [64]. Therefore, selecting the right evaluation
    metrics is crucial for ensuring the proper and optimal development of IoE innovation.
    Quantitative evaluation, a methodology that relies on numerical indices derived
    primarily from objective data collection methods, systematic and controlled observation,
    and a well-defined research design, comes into play. Specifically, it is imperative
    to specify the evaluation metric. Within the realm of IoE innovations, the researchers
    in this study primarily considered accuracy, energy consumption, power consumption,
    completion time, and cost as the most significant dimensions for evaluation, as
    illustrated in Table 6. Figure 6. Visualization of performance metrics used in
    IoE. Table 6. Performance metrics in primary studies. 4.5. RQ5: What Are the Limitations
    in Each IoE Innovation? In the realm of Internet of Everything (IoE) research,
    several research works across various domains have made significant contributions,
    but they are not without their limitations. These limitations, when analyzed collectively,
    provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by researchers in harnessing
    the potential of the IoE. The limitations identified in most of the research works
    are summarized below. 4.5.1. Storage Challenges Several research works, such as
    [16], highlight the challenge of high storage usage when collecting data in IoE
    applications. The sheer volume of data generated by IoE devices can lead to storage
    constraints, impacting the scalability and long-term feasibility of solutions.
    Limited storage capacity, as observed in [17], can result in extended data transfer
    times to the cloud. This limitation hampers the timely availability of critical
    information, potentially impacting decision making processes. 4.5.2. Computation
    Overhead Computation-intensive tasks, driven by multiple scheduling algorithms,
    as can be seen in [19,33], can lead to a high computational overhead. This limit
    affects the efficiency and real-time performance of IoE systems, especially in
    resource-constrained environments. In IoE systems, especially those involving
    financial transactions, drawbacks related to latency, as identified in [42], can
    impact the overall user experience. Transaction processing delays may deter users
    from adopting IoE solutions. 4.5.3. Power Supply Assessment The research work
    [55] emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive assessment of power supply systems
    in IoE. Neglecting to evaluate the continuity and quality of power supplies can
    lead to disruptions in IoE applications, particularly in scenarios where uninterrupted
    power is crucial. 4.5.4. Lack of Assessment Some research, including [20], has
    limitations in terms of assessment. Failure to evaluate factors such as user experience,
    cost, and delay can result in incomplete insights into the overall performance
    and feasibility of IoE solutions. 4.5.5. Data Size Effect The impact of the data
    size on performance [34], as mentioned in [37], can be a significant disadvantage.
    The researcher overlooked and underestimated the need for efficient data handling
    and processing techniques in IoE applications. 4.5.6. Cost-Intensive Technologies
    High costs associated with infrastructure, such as core cloud connectivity via
    high-speed optical links pose a limitation in terms of the scalability and affordability
    of IoE deployments, as in [34]. Nevertheless, Ref. [29] used blockchain technology,
    known for its cost-intensive nature. Hence, implementing such technologies, as
    [29,34] do, can lead to high expenses, making scalability and cost-effectiveness
    challenging. 4.5.7. Technical Feasibility The research work [48] focuses on business
    model management but may not be directly applicable at the technical infrastructure
    level. This constraint highlights the need for aligning business models with technical
    feasibility. 4.5.8. Response Time Oversights Response time oversights, as noted
    in [19], can be resulted from extensive routing packets in networks. Equally,
    Ref. [27] focused on passing messages safely; however, the response time was not
    measured as well as in [39]. Failure to consider response times can impact the
    usability and efficiency of IoE environments. 4.5.9. Data Privacy, Accuracy, and
    Integration Ensuring data accuracy and fostering inter-agency collaboration are
    essential for data-driven decision making in the IoE. Research works in [22] overlooked
    the limitations associated with data accuracy and integration between different
    government agencies. Elsewhere, accuracy discussions, as omitted in [53], are
    critical, especially in applications where precision is paramount. Data privacy
    in [31] needs to be addressed comprehensively to ensure the trustworthiness of
    IoE systems. This research is closely linked to security concerns, as discussed
    in [65], where data integrity emerges as a prominent issue in various cloud computing
    scenarios, necessitating the implementation of robust security strategies to tackle
    this challenge. 4.5.10. Extensive Network Network elements, such as the case discussed
    in [39], disregarded the heavy utilization of the network, while the research
    work in [46] describes the omission of the packet loss adversely affected the
    network’s heavy usage in their research contributions. 4.5.11. Adaptability Dhaya
    and Kanthavel focused on the requirement for adaptive adaptability to a variety
    of platforms and contexts, neglecting the limitations of pre-defined approaches
    in multi-data-center systems [28]. 4.5.12. Limited Data Ingestion Conversely,
    studies conducted by [27,43,57] exhibit limitations related to restricted data
    acquisition, primarily centered on indoor data obtained from sensing devices.
    Broadening the scope of data sources has the potential to enrich the range of
    applications within the Internet of Everything (IoE) [66]. Below is a summary
    in Table 7, and Figure 7 presents limitations of individual research works. The
    lines and circles in Figure 7 illustrate the limitations of the IoE, along with
    the total number of primary studies that have identified similar research gaps
    in this area. Figure 7. Limitation in IoE Innovations. Table 7. Limitation of
    IoE innovation based on the primary studies. 4.6. RQ6: What Are the Trends and

  description: The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to become a driving force
    in the evolution of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, autonomous continuous
    monitoring and control platforms, and low-power consumption devices. Conventionally,
    these devices are battery-operated. The battery lifespan degrades faster in the
    case of continuous monitoring devices. Limited battery lifetime motivates us to
    investigate an eco-friendly solution to solve the issue of limited battery life
    and frequent replacement. Energy harvesting (EH) is a key-enabling technique that
    provides a viable solution to the challenge at hand. EH minimizes battery dependence
    by collecting energy from ambient sources. Although several studies have been
    conducted on EH-IoT networks, a tutorial on a possible mapping between the use
    cases/application to the IoT devices and the IoT devices to EH power source still
    needs to be included. To address this gap, we classify IoT devices based on their
    applications. Based on the different interfacing sections of layer architecture
    design of IoT device, this paper tries to fill the gap between IoT applications
    and the self-sustainable IoT system design. Next, each interfacing section is
    categorized into layer architecture of IoT device to study layer-specific power
    requirements (or demand) versus EH sources (or supply). We have considered various
    applications like agriculture, healthcare, industry, city, security, transportation,
    and water management. Further, we discuss different energy sources to harness
    ambient energy and the method to store the harvested energy. Then, the widely
    used standards and the various steps taken for the interoperability and compatibility
    of EH-IoT are outlined to understand the elements of the EH interface. Finally,
    we point out future research issues requiring specific attention for deploying
    self-sustainable IoT-based delay-limited applications.

  description: Agriculture automation is a primary issue and a rapidly developing
    field for the nation. The global population is growing swiftly, so there is a
    severe need to fulfill food demand. Traditional farming methods are insufficient
    to meet the rising demand, so they pressure using fertilizers to increase crop
    productivity. That fall impacts agricultural activity; sometimes, land stays barren
    and lacks fertility. This paper is focused on the deep analysis of smart farming-related
    components such as the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless communication technology,
    sensors, and hardware. There is serious concern about selecting technology, sensors,
    and hardware in the different agriculture practices. This may result in an increase
    in mechanization among various agricultural practices in an easy way. This paper
    provides a systematic extensive review of the implication of automation in agriculture.
    And addressed how agricultural operations may benefit from modern sensors, wireless
    communication technologies, and hardware. Although, major challenges and components
    have been discussed. Moreover, future applications for crop health, human health,
    and machine health are also addressed in this study.

    business sectors want to increase their productivity to meet the needs of a growing
    human population and tackle existing challenges such as climate change, food scarcity,
    energy, labour and environmental issues including water quality, biodiversity
    and soil health [1,2]. At the same time, digital transformation is seen to deliver
    beneficial opportunities for the agricultural sector [3,4]. For instance, digitalization
    explicitly underpins all objectives under the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP:
    2023-27) which will be supported by the development of a European data space for
    agriculture [5]. Agriculture has delivered innovations for centuries. The development
    and adoption of sensors has allowed precision farming to collect unprecedented
    resolution of spatiotemporal information about the agricultural system [6]. Using
    additional smart technologies along with effective use of data can increase production
    efficiency [7] and in this context, digital technologies such as cloud and edge
    computing, Blockchain (BC), Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data and Internet
    of Things (IoT) are growing in public use [8]. These technologies along with remote
    sensing and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) could support farmers
    through increased performance and efficiency of farming systems, with utilization
    of the most effective farm management strategies. The technologies convert complex
    data into actionable knowledge and support integrated, real time decision-making
    approaches [9,10]. This potential to analyse and understand farm data through
    digitalization scenarios may help to develop more profitable, productive, and
    sustainable farming strategies in agriculture. Digital technologies in smart farming,
    based on application of big data analysis, IoT, AI, remote sensing, robotic and
    smart sensors can help to use real time information accurately and improve yield
    as well as productivity [11,12]. In this context, data driven approaches using
    large quantities of sensor-based generated data (big data) can be used to develop
    early warning, farm management and decision-making systems for improved soil characteristics,
    water use efficiency, yields, and health assessments of crop, animal and horticultural
    products. In digital farming, big data is changing the traditional approaches
    and along with machine learning techniques can provide high performance information
    to unravel, quantify and understand data intensive processes in farm operations
    [13]. It can also benefit the financial management and development of smart agriculture
    systems [14] of the future. The data generated and used in digital farming is
    wide ranging. It can be categorized as climate, soil and water, crop and animal,
    bio security, genomic, farm management and remote sensing data sets [15,16] which
    are obtained from various sources such as on farm sensors, wearable sensors, drone
    and multi-platform remote sensing, weather stations, farm machinery and robots.
    By using digitalization approaches for instance, characterization of soils has
    moved from coarse categorizations to detailed lateral, vertical, and temporal
    levels as well as information of individual soil properties and components such
    as texture, structure, pH, macro and micro nutrients, water content, organic matter
    content and carbon bixation etc. [17]. Digital farming solutions such as app and
    web-based software coupled with machine learning techniques are now able to improve,
    for example, sustainable precision irrigation [18]. If improvements are made to
    reduce the existing challenges, machine learning has a promising potential to
    cope with agricultural big data [9,19]. The IoT and digitalization approaches
    have been used to improve crop productivity and reduce grain losses. Smart digital
    technologies based on mobile apps are now able to provide prediction models for
    yield, productivity and health of a crop using historical data sets and weather
    forecasts and can link to the latest government support and compliance schemes
    related to farmers and farming [20]. Information from soil, weather, irrigation,
    plant growth and health status, use of fertilizer and herbicides can now be fused
    to provide crop management strategies to farmers using smart digital technologies
    and advanced data analytics techniques. Combining smart digital tools with farm
    machinery and autonomous machines will help farmers to improve precision and increase
    technical efficiency and their knowledge for better overall farm management [21,22].
    In precision livestock farming, digitalization can also support farmers to predict
    disease, mitigation pandemic crises, analyse livestock welfare and provide information
    about individual and group animal behaviour, change in housing conditions, impact
    of climate change on animals, etc. [23]. Currently digital farm equipment such
    as yield prediction tools and informed decision making tools [24] or wearable
    virtual fencing devices [25] are available for use in precision agriculture. However,
    there is often poor understanding and utilization of the data. The need to learn
    new technological skills and data interpretation is an additional barrier for
    farmers who need a trusted, simple, single point of access to relevant, concise
    and reliable information that can assist with farm management and improve sustainability
    [26]. Multiple data sources (including multi-sensor data, meteorological and Earth
    Observation data, map services and historical data sets) differ in format and
    time interval and require integration. Therefore, there is a need to develop a
    concept that enables addressing the multiple challenges of combining and using
    divergent data sources, including large national and farm-based sensor data sets.
    This requires: understanding the current data sets, data sources, and analysis
    methods and development of new techniques; structures for management of the data
    and its governance; and use of appropriate data technologies to add value. Ultimately
    this will demonstrate the utility and value of upscaled data for more economically
    resilient and environmentally sustainable farm management. The overall objective
    of the paper is to perform a comprehensive literature review of the state of the
    art for the adoption of smart farming through the use of integrated digital data
    and sensor-based systems, and to present a data fusion concept for an integrated
    smart farming system, where information from different sources including ground
    based and earth observation is integrated to enable the efficient and sustainable
    use of resources. This could also lead to increased environmental and economic
    performance, thus contributing to an overall increase in the sustainability and
    resilience of the agricultural sector. The proposed concept is to: • integrate
    real time data and strengthen the capacity for monitoring of production and agri-environmental
    conditions; • integrate and manage data from multiple sources from ground, proximal
    and remote sensing • develop integrated data platform that can bring crop, pasture,
    tree, animal and environmental (air, soil, water) data together into a single
    point access hub; • use AI effectively in smart farming to analyse and classify
    data, find patterns which can predict phenomena and enable the development of
    smart farming digital solutions; and • develop a decision support systems (DSS)
    that utilises multiple data sources and mobile sensor integrated platforms with
    the potential to be robust and reliable under a wide range of possible farming
    scenarios. 2. Methodology This paper was based on a literature review and concept
    development approach. For the literature review, search strings were determined
    and databases were identified for retrieving relevant peer-reviewed papers. The
    main databases include Scopus; Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Considering
    different aspects of smart agriculture, five search strings were determined and
    Table 1 presents the search results from the Scopus database which was done on
    October 7, 2022. It was the main database used as it covers peer-reviewed publications
    from thousands of international publishers, including Elsevier. The search was
    done considering Title, Abstracts, and Keywords for each publication without limiting
    the publication duration. Most relevant papers were identified via reading the
    titles, abstracts, and conclusions. Complete review of the relevant papers was
    carried out for different focus areas (see Table 1) of smart agriculture. The
    literature review in this study was supplemented also with grey literature such
    as relevant project reports, online information related to the projects, and additional
    recommended recent literatures. Table 1. Literature search strings used for different

    review work was followed by concept development to promote the integrated use
    of smart technologies and enhance smart farming [27]. The concept development
    was done integrating the results of literature review, experiences, and expertise
    from different aspects: digital sensors, data collection and analysis, application
    of AI, Data platform and BC, DSS, and data governance and security. The proposed
    concept has been further discussed along with its perceived implications. 3. Literature
    review 3.1. Major technologies for smart agriculture systems Major digital technologies
    for the development and implementation of smart agriculture system include AI,
    big data, cloud and edge computing, smart sensors, IoT, BC, satellites and robotics
    [[2], [8], [12], [27]]. AI is applied in smart agriculture using technologies
    such as machine learning and deep learning [28]. Machine learning is a crucial
    technology with different models that enable users to have effective DSSs. It
    enables farmers to make fast decision e.g. automating and optimizing water and
    soil management, crop disease detection, pesticide use, livestock management etc.
    [[2], [8], [29]]. Deep learning is being introduced in smart agriculture and used
    to process images and data and handle complex problems [30]. IoT links different
    objects through internet using smart technologies such as Bluetooth, wireless
    sensor network etc. and enables humans to efficiently control the linked objects
    [[2], [8]]. Robotics are designed to mimic human movements and perform tasks.
    They are very important to perform some agricultural activities even under complex
    conditions. Cloud computing offers services such as cloud storage and access to
    data. To tackle problems related to centralized mode of cloud computing, edge
    computing is emerging as efficient data processing and it works in combination
    with IoT and cloud services [[2], [11]]. Recently, cloud and edge computing techniques
    are widely being applied in smart agriculture e.g. for weather prediction and
    acquisition of agricultural data. Big data technology, with its advanced analytics
    models, operates on a massive data gathered from different sources e.g. ground
    and airborne sensors. With massive amounts of agricultural data, big data helps
    to make accurate predictions in smart agriculture. BC is a distributed digital
    ledger technology with a potential application in smart agriculture e.g. for developing
    more traceable agri-food supply chains [8]. The above mentioned digital technologies
    applied in smart agriculture operate using the built-in smart sensors [12]. 3.2.
    Challenges in smart agriculture Agricultural data is scarce and individual data
    makes the accounting of agricultural stocks and fluxes challenging, leading to
    uncertainties in agricultural performance indicators and the environmental footprint
    [31]. Even though the agriculture sector has been lagging behind regarding application
    of new smart technologies, especially at pre-harvest and post-harvest stages [32],
    in recent years, it is undergoing a new ‘green revolution’ triggered by the exponentially
    increasing use of information and communication technologies [33]. Regarding the
    digital transformation in agriculture and rural areas there are projects that
    assessed: implementation of sensors for crops [34,35]; dairy farming to improve
    decision making on farms [36]; food safety and security [37,38]; use of robotics
    and drones in crop production [39]; remote sensing [40]; analytics and communication
    technologies for agricultural sustainability [41]; open digital platform and network
    of digital innovation in agriculture [42,43]; and e-tools and good practices for
    e-governance to facilitate data and information flow [44,45]. Furthermore, the
    Copernicus program has enabled large amounts of free and detailed satellite imagery,
    which can be used to scale up data-driven solutions [46]. However, harmonization
    and pre-processing of the large data volumes are required before they can be used
    in large-scale agricultural applications, due to missing data, noise, mismatches
    in scales, scopes, and formats. Data of different modalities are often stored
    without being used and the integration and use of these data requires further
    investments and research [47]. Although there are many efforts to apply smart
    agriculture, there are still challenges that need to be addressed through additional
    research. 3.2.1. Problems related to isolated sensors and processing of multiple
    data sets Off the shelf and fully integrated digital farm management systems are
    not yet available. This reduces the value of data generated from single sensors.
    Application of multiple real time data sources, multi-sensor data, and non-sensory
    data from third party organizations can help to create a more comprehensive data
    inventory. However, every additional data source will provide data in a different
    format, and in different time intervals, thus leading to the challenge of harmonising
    and processing groups of data. An integrated data platform enables the combined
    use of pre-processed data from different sources. To address this challenge, many
    advanced methods are built around data fusion that uses e.g. neural networks at
    the core [48]. Current digital systems also focus on different types of data (location,
    weather, behaviour and use of territory, yields, health, etc.), using different
    technologies to collect local data and create a network. Therefore, there is a
    need for integrated and cross-cutting methodologies to develop continuous and
    cost-effective real time monitoring tools with associated advanced statistical
    models, AI, and sensor-based techniques. 3.2.2. Challenges related to data-driven
    solutions for value addition when collecting data in agriculture There is a significant
    emphasis towards the techniques of data collection aspects, while the practical
    use of the acquired data is often limited to basic threshold monitoring and trend
    reporting with less actual solutions to real-life problems [49]. Added values
    could be increased via applying novel AI and machine learning approaches and provide
    practical support for the farmers’ decision making. Data value could be added
    through improving data accuracy, interoperability, data storage, computational
    power, and farmers’ effective use of the data technologies. The new concept will
    enable smallholders to gain access to relevant data and services. 3.2.3. Increasing
    demand for use of digitalization in agriculture Consumer and societal demand for
    higher quality food products and related information has increased [50]. For long-term
    sustainability potential and traceability, digitization of the agriculture sector
    should be promoted and integrated with training and awareness creation as well
    as effective information flow [51]. More development and application of digital
    tools is expected to increase agricultural productivity, sustainability, and reduction
    of food losses [52,53]. 3.2.4. Data uncertainties in large-scale agricultural
    applications End-user perspectives operating in isolation are insufficient for
    successful real-world big data applications in agriculture [49]. The proposed
    concept will apply a systems-based approach to co-develop integrated data solutions.
    This will require agricultural and big data expertise to engage in a holistic
    and interdisciplinary process, develop a common language to communicate effectively,
    and reduce the uncertainties and inconsistencies of multi-faceted farming systems.
    3.3. Sensors and data generation and collection Different agricultural data sets
    from, for example climate, soil and water, crop and animal, bio security, genomic,
    farm management and remote sensing are often segregated in “silos” [47]. The effort
    of harmonising and providing various data sources for advancing digitised farming
    has only started, with useful examples such as the FaST-EU Space Data for Sustainable
    Farming [54]. The application of smart technologies and the efficient use of agricultural
    data resources should be advanced through integration, storing, managing, and
    sharing of the data. Different data sources provide the data in different formats
    and at different time intervals, hence requiring harmonization of the data streams,
    e.g. interpolation, and different types of pre-processing to enable a combined
    use. For instance, the continuous flow of earth observation data can be used to
    develop models that are responsive to phenological changes in variable weather
    conditions. The effective combination of both terrestrial and aerial platforms
    enables the combined use of very high spatial and temporal resolution data that
    can suggest optimal use of limited farm resources. Satellite images provide accurate
    information at a large scale that can be used to monitor the status of crops and
    animals, e.g., crop growth stage and yield [55]. There are also various DSS developed,
    based on satellite data, for example CropSAT, that provides vegetation index maps
    from Sentinel-2 data [56]. 3.4. Application of AI on data integration and analysis
    During this last decade different studies have been carried out to use data to
    interpret the past and predict the future and design DSS tools, through use of
    constant monitoring or specific big data science enquiries [57,58]. The increasing
    amount of agricultural data enables more accurate models of higher complexity
    leading to increased process understanding. This data-driven development has been
    demonstrated in many recent works, e.g., AI classification tasks, where state-of-the-art
    machine learning (e.g., deep learning) methods typically require larger amounts
    of data than classical model-based approaches. Advanced methods are built around
    data fusion that uses neural networks at its core [[48], [59], [60]]. Data fusion
    techniques combine data from multiple sensors, and related information from associated
    databases, to achieve improved accuracies and more specific inferences than could
    be achieved by the use of a single sensor alone [61]. The biggest advantage of
    data fusion is the possibility to fuse multi-modular and heterogeneous data sets.
    Despite the considerable efforts taken by the researchers and software developers
    to create systems for comprehensive farm data analysis, there is still a lack
    of a unified, customizable and flexible solution [60]. It is hard to find a universal
    system which would be able to operate with different data inputs and would have
    flexible data processing options. The proposed concept aims to develop an enhanced
    data platform that can be considered as a decision-making tool with simple and
    fast data entry (manual or automatic) powered by flexible and detailed reporting.
    3.5. Application of Blockchain technology Recent research studies have investigated
    how to apply smart technologies such as BC and Smart Contracts for traceability
    and security of food products [62]; agricultural supply chain management, land
    registry and management, and agricultural insurance as part of flood impacts adaptation
    strategy in rural areas. Data and information are very important to promote the
    use of digital technologies and implement smarter farming approaches, increase
    agricultural productivity and sustainability and reduce waste of resources [[27],
    [62], [63], [64]]. The ICT facilitates the data gathering, storage, process, analysis
    and use of data for timely decision-making processes [63]. However, the ICT does
    not avoid bias in the collection and use of data leading to less trust amongst
    different stakeholders that should use the data e.g. in the Agri-food sector.
    BC technology is an effective tool to avoid such bias through distributing the
    data management to a number of participants (e.g. network nodes), increasing transparency,
    and making data manipulation difficult within the BC environment [63,64]. The
    BC is an immutable distributed digital ledger. It provides a constant flow of
    credible data. In smart agriculture, as the number of inter-connected devices
    for information gathering is increasing, the complexity of data security increases.
    To address this challenge, it is important to develop a system that integrates
    the IoT system with the BC. This enables a more transparent, reliable, secure,
    and de-centralized data storage service and an automated and optimized management
    of agriculture systems [65]. The BC technology is an example of emerging technologies
    with huge potential to positively impact the agriculture sector, but it is energy-intensive
    and not well established and not widely applied yet in the agriculture sector.
    This BC enhances the generation, storing, governing, sharing, using, and tracing
    the relevant data resources and further advance the smart and sustainable agriculture
    in Europe. 3.6. Data governance and data security Data plays an essential role
    in agriculture and application of one data source is insufficient for comprehensive
    analysis and optimal decision making. Application of multiple data sources, including
    multi-sensor data, data from third party organizations (e.g. climate and environmental
    data, mapping services) and historical data sets can help to create a comprehensive
    overview of the agricultural entity. Thus a data fusion method can be applied
    to combine data from various sources with the main aim to get more value from
    collected data. Agricultural data and their use for better decision-making and
    innovation are at the core of the digital transformation of agriculture, but fragmented,
    not full and unclear data governance arrangements may decrease farmers’ willingness
    to adopt digital solutions in their daily operations [66,67]. Data governance
    is considered as a set of processes, standards and guidelines that defines how
    the data assets are managed [68]. It involves establishing rules for data collection,
    storage, usage, sharing, and security to ensure that data is accurate, consistent,
    and trustworthy. Data security measures should include access controls, encryption,
    firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection and prevention systems, backup
    and recovery systems, and security policies and procedures. 3.7. DSS opportunities
    and challenges The continuous flow of earth observation data can be used to develop
    models that are responsive to phenological changes in variable weather conditions.
    The effective combination of both terrestrial and aerial platforms enables the
    combined use of very high spatial and temporal resolution data that can suggest
    optimal use of limited farm resources. Satellite images provide accurate information
    at a large scale that can be used to monitor the status of crops and animals,
    e.g., crop growth stage and yield [55]. There are also various DSS developed,
    based on satellite data, for example CropSAT, that provides vegetation index maps
    from Sentinel-2 data [56]. However, there are problems related to digital systems
    such as limited knowledge of stakeholders, high costs of sensor networks to collect
    high spatiotemporal data, heterogeneity in grassland and arable crop, lack of
    available technologies for real-time in-situ crop and sward qualitative data measurement.
    Smart technologies can assess inter- and intra-field spatial and temporal variability
    in crop and animal production systems [69], but need to be developed and implemented
    with effective DSSs. The effective application of advanced smart technologies
    enables to perform real time observations and measurements of spatial and temporal
    variability. It can increase the economic competitiveness of farms, e.g., through
    reducing the labour requirement and repetitive tasks on livestock farms. As shown
    by Streefkerk et al. [70] seasonal forecast in combination with local knowledge
    can increase the resilience of rain fed agriculture during dry periods and support
    agricultural decisions. Similarly, DSSs are now available for use by grassland
    farmers for the purposes of crop, grassland and animal management [71].  Some
    DSSs have utilized algorithms to continuously train a model to simulate growth
    factors between measurement dates on pasture. Also a fully transferable DSS for
    crop irrigation was developed by Bonfante et al. [72]. DSS have several components,
    and one of the most important is the graphical user interface, which is the communication
    between the system itself and the end-user [73]. However, farmers’ acceptance
    and uptake of DSS is still relatively low [74] and multiple factors that restrict
    the wider implementation of DSS. This may be because farmers do not necessarily
    have knowledge of sensors, ICT and data management and analysis [75]. Moreover,
    DSS are used Farmers need to adopt a different mindset towards these systems,
    and there are multiple factors that restrict their use of DSS, such as the performance
    of the system, its ease of use, trust in the DSS output, and the system cost makes
    farmers critical towards the acceptance of DSS [76]. Next to that farmers need
    to adopt a different mindset towards DSS, when implementing a system, a participatory
    approach is need to successfully implement these farmer supporting systems [70,75].
    4. Concept development 4.1. General overview of proposed concept Based on the
    literature assessment, the concept depicted in Fig. 1 has been proposed for an
    integrated smart farming system. In this system, the information from different
    sources including earth observation is managed to enable the efficient and sustainable
    use of resources. The concept is structured into five blocks: (I) agricultural
    systems (at local, regional, and global levels); (II) data sources (real-time
    sensor data from the agricultural system, historical data, and open science data
    together with input from the users); (III) the data platform; (IV) data sharing;
    and (V) Blockchain. Three phases are included in the concept: real-time data collection
    from the system using different sensors; data integration and analysis; and application
    by data sharing and upscaling to regional and global levels to be used by stakeholders.
    Processed data could be shared with stakeholders via different interfaces, platforms,
    and BC which can also facilitate closing the feedback loop with the farm by performing
    direct refinements or providing new input values for the data platform. Download

    Overview of proposed concept with agricultural system (I), data sources (II),
    data platform (III), data sharing (IV) and Blockchain (V). The concept focuses
    on different levels of smart agriculture and apply upscaling for the approaches
    developed, starting from the local farms with vast amounts of local data of the
    highest detail, which could also be applicable at the regional and global level
    by connecting Earth Observation data and remote sensing methods at various levels.
    This provides opportunity to monitor at farm level energy consumption and emissions
    levels, to comply with European environmental standards and minimise the ecological
    footprint and maximise biodiversity. 4.2. Data collection methodologies The conceptual
    system monitors and assesses local variables of farming systems (livestock, both
    indoor and outdoor), crops and horticulture farming, including weather patterns.
    The data collection covers different entities, objects and sensors to be used
    for real-time on-farm data collection in combination with historical data. Smart
    sensors and their combinations could cover desired use-cases and demonstrations.  End
    user and stakeholder inputs are also considered as valuable inputs. In addition,
    earth observation data from satellites and drones can monitor the large-scale
    and local processes. Sufficient and relevant data could be generated from local
    sensors, drones and satellites together with monitoring devices used for farm,
    livestock and environment monitoring. Within the concept, different sensor systems
    are evaluated, and some could be selected for inclusion to the data collection
    activities. In the first phase, in a co-design, smart sensors, pertinent variables
    and data communication could be determined. The IoT integrated sensors also need
    to be evaluated, installed, and managed. Moreover, the frequency of measurement
    can be determined in line with the information need from animals, crops, grass
    trees'' perspective in relation to the environmental conditions. In the concept,
    a mobile smart platform is central, where sensors could be included for data collection
    at the farming level. The sensors are connected to the IoT networks to provide
    high spatial and temporal data of different variables. Earth Observation could
    be used to provide continuous monitoring data of the farms at different scales.
    The concept uses airborne platforms e.g., drones with LiDAR or optical sensors
    to collect multi-variable and high-resolution spatial data. Drones can be equipped
    with weatherproof sensors to ensure data collection in all weather conditions.
    Furthermore, satellite data from optical (e.g. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 (10–30
    m every 5 days) and radar sensors (e.g., Sentinel-1, NISAR, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) proved
    wall-to-wall coverage, and high resolution images from World View and Pleiades
    can rapidly provide additional information at higher resolution. In order to make
    more comprehensive models, open data sets available on open-access repositories
    [77], national open data services (current and historic data of meteorological,
    environmental and farming variables) or Copernicus datasets  [78] could be used.
    The concept explores the combined use of satellite images with high-resolution
    drone imagery (resolutions of approximately three centimetres) in super resolution
    the AI algorithms to get very high-resolution data from the entire satellite covered
    areas. The collected data (by the project and open data sets) will be delivered
    to data analysis. For the data analysis and DSS model development historical data
    from the target farms will also be used. Examples of the available data to include:
    metadata on sites, grass growth data, grass quality data, animal performance data.
    4.3. Data platform The data analysis and transformation process take place in
    the remote data platform specially built for data fusion and processing purposes.
    The data platform could include various mechanisms and approaches for diverse
    and comprehensive data analysis including the AI and advanced statistical algorithms.
    Important features from the datasets could be extracted and fused to deliver the
    best inputs for decision-making scenarios.  The data platform contains several
    interconnected components, including data integration pipeline, DSS and business
    models. These components could be used for supplying valuable insights and knowledge
    for the end users and stakeholders enabling efficient farm management and operation,
    evaluation of the effectiveness of the resource consumption, policy making and
    ecosystem monitoring on global scale. The data platform is considered as a scalable
    system (see Fig. 2) for distributed and flexible processing of different agricultural,
    livestock and environmental object data. The data platform acts as an intermediary
    between data providers (various measurement systems and data sets, historical
    data, available on other data platforms) and data consumers (reporting, modeling
    and third-party systems), and provides customizable facilities for organizing
    data storage (such as data warehousing), processing and analysis pipelines and
    result sharing. A unified agricultural object data platform could be used for
    decision support, data analysis and process optimization. Existing systems, open
    data sets and available on-farm generated data can be combined and fused to the
    integrated platform. Information and DSS tools will be designed to be accessible
    and understandable for farmers. Download : Download high-res image (218KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Conceptual illustration of the data platform.
    A data platform acts as an integration layer between data sources, processing
    algorithms, and target data consumers. It provides flexible orchestration tools
    for running various components for the platform in a unified manner. The integration
    engine provides scalable infrastructure for storing incoming (raw) and already
    processed data, including essential metadata. An important aspect of the data
    platform is data governance. Ensuring the controlled and appropriate access to
    the sensitive data is essential for successful cooperation with external stakeholders.
    Batches of historical and pre-collected datasets and real-time streams from IoT
    devices are considered as primary data inputs to the data platform. Various types
    of data processing frameworks are supported by the data platform, including low
    level data sanitation and error filtering up to the more sophisticated business
    and AI/machine learning models and decision support components. Data processing
    results are supplied to data consumers in form of reports and analytic summaries,
    categorised data marts or as exported/shared data sets. Within the concept, the
    data platform could be established as a cloud-based data storage and processing
    unit with capabilities to combine different data sources including systems and
    available on-farm generated data. The proposed platform follows best practice
    in distributed and asynchronous data processing by utilising multi-agent techniques
    in conjunction with real-time data warehousing. The proposed concept provides
    an approach for successful data fusion within the farm using different data sources:
    (a) Data from on-site farm management systems, including long-term observations),
    wearable sensors for plant (e.g. sap flow to estimate transpiration) and livestock
    (i.e. sensors to collect welfare and health information); (b) External data sets
    (including remote sensing information, historical data sets and environmental
    monitoring); (c) Farmers’ input and specific knowledge. All data gathered can
    be fused in the data platform, providing standardised data exchange interfaces
    for stakeholders to support decision making. This may have a positive effect by
    increasing data efficiency, reducing analysis time, and costs. 4.4. AI application
    for data integration and analysis The AI models along with statistical techniques
    can extract information and patterns from the sensor data and detect phenomena.
    In the proposed concept the AI methodologies can provide a framework for feature/metric
    selection to reduce the number of dynamic variables from pre-processed sensor
    data. Development of analytics and machine learning algorithms enable asset state
    (farm) prediction for a given input state (Fig. 3). The outputs of these models
    can be validated using the sensor data. In this context, the historical and data
    collected through the sensors on ground, aerial sensor, and satellite data can
    be used for training of the AI models. The output of digital data processing and
    integration models could be utilized to the actual farming system. Therefore,
    the validated models could be robust enough. In this context to analyse the obtained
    information from different sources descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics
    and predictive analytics with the possibility to forecast future phenomena in
    different farming situations can be developed. Forecasting dynamic models could
    be developed to predict crop dynamics, like seasonality and trends. Selection
    of the most adequate land surface dynamics model will be done e.g. by means of
    the Q test of Ljung-Box, and the Schwarz and Akaike information criteria. The
    accuracy of the forecasting procedure can be evaluated to improve the performance
    of the developed models in the proposed concept. Download : Download high-res

    approach for smart farming. 4.5. Edge and cloud computing Within the proposed
    system, two computing paradigms will be evaluated. Where feasible edge computing
    could be used to reduce latency and provide more processing of data closer to
    the farm, as a data provider [79]. Application of edge computing involves placing
    of service provisioning, data, and intelligence closer to users and monitoring
    devices. Benefits of edge computing can be seen when computing and making analysis
    of real-time data. One of the motivations for edge computing is use of data intensive
    sensors and the need for fast response times from the farmer e.g., audio and video
    monitoring of animals, pests, or weather extremes such low temperatures or rainfall
    events affecting crops. Significant volumes of the data should be processed before
    obtaining the value of the monitored variables, as well as alerting the farmer
    to appropriate (even rapid) action if an anomaly is detected, especially if animal
    health or mobility or crop health is affected. Another motivation to apply edge
    computing in precision farming is related to data privacy and security [80]. Farmers
    are usually not willing to share the details about their farming processes due
    to business specific knowledge. In this case edge computing provides a compromise
    where the farmer can implement own data processing pipelines without sharing implementation
    details, while still being able to exchange information with cloud infrastructure.
    In most of farms, there is little need for decisions to be made in real-time when
    each millisecond is crucial, thus another paradigm of cloud computing can be made
    applicable. Within the proposed concept open-source platforms can be evaluated,
    compared, and further adapted as required. Cloud and edge computing need not compete
    but can be employed selectively.  Within the proposed concept, functions which
    can be handled by the computing split between the end device and local network
    resources will be done at the edge, while big data applications that benefit from
    aggregating data from everywhere and running it using different analytics approaches
    and machine learning algorithms will stay in the cloud. 4.6. Application of Blockchain
    technology In order to avoid malpractice and ensure trust and transparency in
    data handling and sharing, BC technology could be a robust and effective option
    [81]. This will provide a tamper-proof and immutable data storage mechanism for
    critical data sources and a constant flow of credible data. Smart contracts could
    be designed to run the events accordingly to form a reliable agreement model for
    the system. With data on a BC, the system will build different analysis models
    based on the need of the respective farming model, incorporating smart contracts
    for monitoring and control. For large volume data, distributed data storage mechanisms
    need be integrated with BC [82,83]. In the concept, the application of BC could
    enhance the business contracts with high standards of trust amongst trade partners
    as well as product traceability due to the advanced and reliable data/information
    processing and sharing system. 4.7. Decision support system The main purpose of
    a data platform is to provide decision-makers with accurate, timely information
    needed to make the right choices and decisions. Therefore, the development of
    the DSS is a crucial part of the proposed concept, as success of the data analysis
    can be evaluated by the effective application of the proposed decisions to the
    end-users. The main task of a DSS is to assist the end users and stakeholders
    in decision making and it aims to improve the overall farm‘s operation and management
    processes [84]. The DSS itself does not make decisions in isolation, rather it
    provides several alternatives to choose from. It should be emphasized that the
    end user is the main decision maker and is responsible for the actions taken.
    The process of the DSS operation will involve combination of data from various
    sources (sensory data, farmers input, crop, animal data, etc.) that might be analyzed
    and run through a collection of models (statistical, machine learning, etc.) allowing
    to better understand solutions for a specific farm related problems (e.g., management
    of water resources, low-input farming, management of grazing plans, improving
    livestock performance, health and welfare, increasing crop yield, environmental
    condition). Therefore, the data to be analyzed need to be retrieved, stored and
    organized in a way that facilitates decision making for the specific contexts.
    The DSS will also provide a user interface (UI) that is an intermediary between
    the system and the end user. In general, the UI can be implemented in various
    forms (e.g., command line, UI with graphical elements) and highly depends on the
    end user''s needs. Therefore, the UI within the proposed concept considers the
    end users’ technical skills and competences, together with the integrated BC technology
    allow for transparency, security and easy understanding of processes which create
    trust in the DSS. The DSS to be developed has different parts that support various
    decisions based on data analysis. For example, grassland management decision support
    for the farmer and tools to make decisions about animal health, welfare, and/or
    reproduction [85]. Effective use of the DSS can be contributed to more sustainable
    and resilient farming systems across a range of climatic conditions. 4.8. Governance
    and data security The Governance systems proposed in this study can ensure consistent,
    reliable, and accurate data for: farmers - for management and decision making
    purposes; the actors in agri-food supply chain - for assurance, marketing and
    payment purposes; and Government agents- for proving the delivery of “public goods”
    for environmental farming schemes. It enables development of a unified agricultural
    object data warehouse that can be developed and used for DSS along with solutions
    for data analysis and optimization. The data warehouse will act as an intermediary
    between data providers and users to provide customizable facilities for data storage,
    organization, processing, analysis and sharing the generated knowledge. The proposed
    system promotes the design and deployment of robust systems to ensure that farmers’
    data is used ethically and appropriately with agreements from the participating
    farmers regarding data use.  These systems will be designed to be scalable as
    the volume and sources of data increase [86]. 5. Discussion 5.1. Data valorization
    As climate change is generating significant interest in the development of specific
    tools and models adjusted for each type of crop and land-based livestock, the
    proposed solution enables users to rectify one of the bigger disadvantages of
    advanced machine learning techniques e.g., deep learning applied in various agriculture
    fields such as discontinuity and non-integrated data. The application of the proposed
    concept could generate accurate and reliable farm management information from
    the integration of different data sets, by receiving real-time and continuous
    information on selected variables. For instance, in recent years, big data was
    generated in various parts of Europe, but was specific to the site, crop, or research
    program theme. Attempts were made to aggregate these data and present in a friendly
    form for the users (farmers, researchers, government officials, business and other
    related stakeholders) but are still far from general use and valorization. A data
    warehouse concept along with integrated AI and analytic models, which is a new
    way of doing smart and digital farm management systems could deliver a robust
    solution in this regard. As a result of this farmers can be able to make decision-making
    scenarios easier, which will result in the resource and cost reductions from the
    farming and technology providing sides. The system enhances data warehouse concept
    with all the specific features and methods/ algorithms and tools for valorising
    the historical data, working with them, and responding to the present and future
    challenges and opportunities in farming systems. There are also added benefits
    due to the fact that the integrated data set and digital solution tools will feature
    high-resolution models co-designed with the user data, spatial fields data and
    data derived from satellite. The historic data in combination with real-time environmental
    monitoring and farming systems creates new data streams. The reliability of integrated
    data use might be increased due to the development of models based on remote and
    ground-based datasets covering climate, meteorological, environmental and farm
    conditions. Efficient use of farm data increased due to the development of algorithms
    for processing the Earth observation data to enable estimation of variables or
    parameters required in the DSS. Broader adoption of improved monitoring and DSS
    systems, based on quality data, will also provide better decision-making, not
    only for farmers but will also serve as a basis for policy makers. 5.2. Farm productivity
    and competitiveness The proposed solution could enable the generation of new data,
    knowledge and practices in agri-food systems supported with advanced smart technologies.
    This will lead to increased competitiveness of smart farms through improved profitability,
    environmental sustainability, and social acceptability. Multiple benefits such
    as farm productivity, competitiveness, product quality and safety, health and
    welfare, best practice, traceability of products and consumer acceptability will
    be increased. The farm management can be improved by applying integrated, cross-cutting
    and multi-actor approach methodologies; emerging digital technologies; data generated
    using smart sensors (including both, ground, and aerial (drones and satellite);
    and advanced statistical models and AI models. Productivity, resilience, competitiveness
    and environmental performance of crop, horticulture and livestock farming can
    be significantly increased by the provision of low-cost and reliable novel hard-
    and software, data analysis, smart sensors application and optimized precision
    farming management practices. The new solution can also create training opportunities
    for farmers, practitioners, and professionals and increase scientific knowledge
    base on smart farming systems in order to enhance the productivity and competitiveness
    of smart farm systems. 5.3. Effective monitoring of farm operations and decision
    making The continuous monitoring of real time data and integrated use with the
    historic data in combination with newly developed models will improve the understanding
    of environmental processes and farming practices. In addition, as there is limitation
    of data management system across spatial and temporal resolutions, the unprecedented
    spatial and temporal process could lead to novel scientific knowledge and sharing
    it [87]. The advanced AI-based techniques and complementary management support
    systems enhance process understanding, smart farming systems and allow better
    estimation of uncertainties. As a result, it is possible to develop novel farm
    operation practices and monitoring which allow for more efficient use of resources
    (e.g., energy, water, soil, nutrients and pesticides, fodder, labour, investments,
    etc.) and targeted interventions when needed (e.g., pest control or veterinary).
    Continuous measurements of environmental variables and animal health, welfare,
    reproduction and productivity can play an important role in enhancing transparency,
    traceability, and monitoring along food supply chains, adding value for producers
    and consumers alike. The proposed solution brings together important work tools
    needed to make real-time decisions. It can contribute to optimal decisions in
    critical conditions by providing timely, high resolution and up-to-date information.
    It processes data from ground sensors, drones, and satellites, bringing complete
    identification of phonological stages, real-time pests and diseases pressure,
    plant and soil nutrients correlated with the data taken from the local weather
    stations, according to a customized algorithm on crop species to be analyzed.
    5.4. Farm business models The development of cutting-edge digital technology for
    monitoring farm productivity, animal health and welfare places smart farms at
    a competitive advantage, opens business opportunities for manufacturers and strengthens
    the agriculture sector as business options for new generations. The proposed solution
    has the possibility to design farm business model (FBM) frameworks (upscaling)
    for trusted third party industry organizations and act as trusted data brokers.
    For example, the innovative FBMs could create values through: (i) Strong Networking-
    by facilitating the formation of novel networks of farms empowered with advanced
    digital tools (smart farming). Farm networks enable farmers to mobilise and use
    the resources collectively with focus on profitability and sustainability of farm
    systems [88,89]. (ii) Increased accessibility to data resources- by developing
    systems for resource sharing as well as accessibility and efficient use of resources
    (e.g. data, smart tools, and other resources) for farmers and other stakeholders.
    (iii) Increased inclusivity- by enabling all stakeholders to have fair and guaranteed
    representation in decision making, specifically for farmers. (iv) Adaptive Marketing
    system- by creating a new way of marketing of agricultural products that can benefit
    farmers and consumers [90]. Due to their potential advantages, climate-smart agriculture
    and digital technologies are attracting more investment in recent years. The proposed
    solution can take smart agriculture beyond the state-of-the-art creating favourable
    conditions for innovative FBMs. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the
    profitability of the increasing investments in smart agriculture [91]. Application
    of the proposed solution enables to examine the innovative FBMs using integrated
    cost-benefit analysis (CBA) approach to evaluate the financial profitability for
    farmers as well as the environmental and social benefits to the society as a whole
    [92,93]. The CBA enables capturing the ‘true’ cost and benefits (e.g., broader
    human and livestock welfare effects) including externalities (Garnett et al.,
    2018; [94,95]). 5.5. Sustainability of smart farming systems Climate changes,
    market approaches, demand for healthier products, and labour force depletion in
    agriculture have increased pressure to the agriculture industry. Agricultural
    production faces challenges such as climate variability, land degradation, loss
    of ecosystem functioning in combination with an increase in global population
    and dietary changes. Agriculture generates significant negative environmental
    impacts, and, at the same time, the sector is vulnerable to short term weather
    phenomena and long-term climate change [96]. Changes in climate, in average temperatures
    and rainfall, together with the increase in extreme events in the short and long
    term, are already affecting crop yields around the world. To avoid possible losses,
    it is necessary to provide ‘early warning’ information to farmers. Climate change
    mitigation and adaptation have been a global challenge for this generation [97].
    The application of the ICT elements in agriculture gives the chance for paradigm
    shifts at the farm, processor, logistics, and consumer levels [98]. The proposed
    concept enables more efficient use of resources, promotes the economic competitiveness
    of farmers, protects biodiversity and mitigates climate fluctuations. It harnesses
    digital and geospatial technologies to enable the re-design of agricultural systems
    with increased sustainability performance [53]. It improves farming operations
    such as planning and management of crop and animal production through more efficient
    use of resources (material and human) and open access to digital data and tools
    (multi-actor platform, DSS).Through the development of a multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder,
    whole-farm approach, it is possible to significantly increase production efficiency,
    resource utilization and animal welfare whilst reducing emissions, and thus improve
    competitiveness, environmental performance and public image of agricultural farming.
    However, with the implementation of the concept, further study is required to
    evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance considering material
    and economic flows not only from the aspects of agricultural activities but also
    the aspects of major technological solutions and related infrastructures such
    as the IoT, BC, remote sensing tools, and DSS platforms. The sustainability of
    smart farming systems with advanced data integration and real time processing
    could be evaluated using a life cycle analysis approach while considering smart
    farm systems at local and regional levels [99]. This could lead to more efficient
    use of the local on-farm and regional resources (optimizing grazing calendars,
    improving crop rotations, increasing the on-farm feedstuff production, pasture
    yield, reducing feeding inputs, etc.) [100]. 5.6. Increased resilience of farming
    systems The proposed concept could increase resilience of farming systems by managing
    current status and forecasting future events. Based on the data and modeling outcomes,
    unplanned events can be anticipated which will increase the resilience of farming
    systems. It enables farmers also to diversify their production systems by adopting
    more sustainable farming practices. The integrated data set, DSS with options
    of edge and cloud computing, multi-actor platform, on-line management tool, and
    the farm business models enable long term positive impacts. The proposed solution
    allows to accurately accounting the different stocks and fluxes of a farm system
    allowing to considerably reduce resource demand and wastes in both small-scale
    and intensive farming with direct impact from different aspects, e.g., water and
    energy resources, nutrients, land use, above and below ground biodiversity, and
    GHG emission. Creating data from farm impact assessments and operational monitoring
    available to public authorities may reduce the need to carry out additional environmental
    monitoring saving public financial resources. The enhanced transparency of the
    operational conditions of farming could help rural communities to make informed
    decisions on issues that affect their neighbourhood or their livelihood. The newly
    developed, innovative smart technologies can be applied to the broader agricultural
    sector [101]. This will give many opportunities for technology providers, to create
    high value jobs and develop new market products based on digital solutions. All
    measures and integrated smart technologies could directly contribute to traceability
    and increased consumer acceptability of food products. Farmers can provide well-priced
    products with increased food quality and safety contributing to sustainable Farm-to-Fork
    (F2F) strategies. For instance, in the F2F under the European Green Deal, Europe
    desires an increase in environmental standards as well as the efficiency of food
    production as part of the Commission''s agenda to achieve the United Nations’
    Sustainable Development Goals [101,102]. Effective information flow enables the
    achievement of multiple benefits for animal and crop productivity, competitiveness
    and best farm practices which could contribute to the future of the agricultural
    sector. Productivity, resilience, competitiveness and environmental performance
    of smart farms can be superior to conventional ones [96,103]. Meanwhile, production
    costs, feedstuff purchase and GHG emissions will be reduced, increasing complementarity
    between crop production and livestock [100]. The implementation of the proposed
    concept could face some challenges: (I) The gap that sometimes exists between
    the farmers and the technology providers in terms of explaining the information
    relevance, usefulness, reliability and ease of use; (II) Resistance of the older
    generation of farmers who have more difficulty to adapt to the use of new digital
    technologies, new sources of information; (III) difficulty to move from partitioned
    systems to an integrated approach; and (IV) unexpected restrictions on uptake
    of novel digital technologies by regulatory environment; cost of the new technologies.
    In order to further strengthen the resilience of smart farming systems, the above
    mentioned challenges and other potential barriers should be identified during
    implementation and performance evaluation of the proposed concept and further
    investigated in post-ante studies from different aspects contributing to the transition
    to sustainable food systems. 5.7. Limitations and future scope of this study In
    this study, there is a limitation due to the fact that there could be some papers
    and documents not captured in the review part. Although the major digital technologies
    for smart agriculture have been discussed briefly, the limitations of each technology
    have not been covered. The practical development and testing are out of the scope
    of the study. Future studies will include the design, test and practical demonstration
    of the proposed concept with its major features. The application of smart digital
    technologies for efficient collection, handling and sharing, integration and analysis,
    and governance of agricultural big data will be studied in detail. The future
    scope includes also a detailed assessment of sustainability performance of the
    proposed concept and related innovative farm business models. 6. Conclusion Agricultural
    business sectors can harness the benefits of smart technologies and increase their
    productivity to meet the needs of a growing human population and tackle the existing
    challenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity and other environmental
    issues. However, there are challenges to understand and efficiently use different
    types of agricultural data from multiple sources and not integrated. This paper
    presents the concept proposed to facilitate the full integration of digital technologies
    to enhance future smart and sustainable agricultural systems. The proposed concept
    enables capturing real time agricultural data, integrating and managing data from
    multiple sources using novel agri-tech solutions, using AI, building governance
    systems that manage high volumes and multiple sources of agricultural data, and
    developing a digital DSS for farmers and a range of industry stakeholders. In
    this work, literature review and concept development approaches have been used.
    Firstly, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to investigate the state
    of the art of the adoption of smart farming through the use of integrated digital
    data and sensor-based systems through participation of different experts. Secondly,
    the proposed concept was theoretically developed based on the results of literature
    review, experiences, and expertise from different aspects: digital sensors; data
    management; application of smart technologies such as AI, IoT, and BC; DSSs; data
    governance and security; and sustainability analysis. The proposed solution has
    the potential to provide: a data collection method, a data handling and sharing
    platform, an AI application for data analysis, edge and cloud computing, DSSs
    to facilitate decision making process, application of BC, and a governance and
    data security system. Implementation of the proposed concept has the potential
    to deliver significant positive implications as it could improve valorization
    of agricultural data; farm productivity; farm monitoring and decision-making ability;
    and innovation in farm business models. It could also lead to increased environmental
    and economic performance, thus contributing to an overall increase in the competitiveness,
    sustainability, and resilience of the agricultural sector. The detailed studies
    on practical development and demonstration of the proposed concept and its sustainability
    performance will be future research directions of this work. In the short term,
    this study will benefit the researchers and developers of smart tools while in
    long term it will be useful for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers
    supporting the transition to smarter and more sustainable agriculture systems.

    (RPL) 1. Introduction The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) within the
    agriculture sector has advanced significantly, as evidenced by its incorporation
    into various commercial applications such as monitoring weather conditions, soil
    moisture, temperature, fertility, and crop growth, as well as weed and pest detection,
    animal intrusion, irrigation control, and supply chain and food waste management.
    By deploying IoT sensors, farmers can reduce human effort and increase operational
    efficiency in monitoring their farms. Furthermore, sensors use communication channels
    to transmit the obtained status information into consolidated, scalable data repositories
    [1]. The application of data-processing algorithms on collected data can create
    opportunities for the development of further innovations and data-driven services,
    such as decision-making applications that can be combined with IoT actuators to
    act on physical objects (e.g., turning on a water pump) with minimal or no farmer
    intervention. However, sensor integration into industrial-scale frameworks requires
    a large volume of constrained sensor devices, resulting in a self-contained network
    known as a wireless sensor network (WSN) [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Despite the existence
    of these technologies and services, they are not always deployed. In WSNs, four
    constrained elements are used to organize the internal structure of any sensor
    device: (1) sensing element (such as a horse heartbeat signal sensor); (2) limited
    computation power (e.g., main memory and central processing unit (CPU)); (3) short-distance,
    limited-bandwidth radio transceiver; and (4) limited battery power. These constraints
    make it challenging to integrate such a sensor network into the agriculture sector,
    in terms of meeting the scalability and performance requirements of the harsh
    environments of agricultural farms [8,9,10]. In this study, the 6LowPAN and Routing
    protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) were considered in assessing the
    performance of the WSN. The evaluation results of the RPL protocol in the two
    farming scenarios were modeled and simulated using COOJA, a realistic WSN simulator.
    The first scenario represents an olive tree farm with an integrated WSN that uses
    fixed-position sensor nodes and settings, while the other scenario represents
    a horse training stable, with each horse equipped with a sensor node representing
    the WSN in a mobile case. This approach helps ensure the ability to capture the
    impact of mobility in both scenarios and provides a realistic comparison of networking
    performance indices by sharing the simulation settings for both fixed and mobile
    nodes, with the main difference being node mobility. This paper characterized
    different aspects of the performance requirements in the two farming scenarios
    by comparing: (1) average power consumption; (2) average radio duty cycle; and
    (3) connectivity degrees of the sensor network graph. A new approach was proposed
    to model and simulate moving animals within the COOJA simulator, adopting the
    random waypoint model (RWP) to represent horse movements. The aims of this study
    are twofold: to assess the performance scalability of WSN in the agriculture sector
    and to provide a classification framework for studying IoT in the agriculture
    sector. Several performance metrics, such as network graph connectivity and power
    consumption, were evaluated. Furthermore, the stationary configuration and mobility
    covered both animal and plant farms. The main contributions of this study can
    be summarized as follows: (1) introducing performance assessment metrics for stationary
    and mobile scenarios in 6LowPAN networks; (2) introducing a novel holistic IoT
    ecosystem suitable for the precision agriculture domain that satisfies the requirements
    for both studied scenarios; (3) introducing a new classification approach of IoT
    in agriculture based on several factors. The main originality of this research
    is the assessment of the performance scalability of WSNs in the agriculture sector,
    along with the development of a classification framework for studying IoT in agriculture.
    The study evaluates performance metrics such as network graph connectivity and
    power consumption for both stationary and mobile scenarios in 6LowPAN networks
    and proposes a new approach for simulating moving animals within the COOJA simulator.
    Additionally, the paper introduces a novel holistic IoT ecosystem suitable for
    precision agriculture that satisfies the requirements for both the studied scenarios.
    This paper presented a framework for integrating IoT systems in precision agriculture.
    The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related research works and
    draws a conclusion on how this work helps to fill the gap in the current state
    of the art. Section 3 describes the proposed framework that effectively combines
    an array of sensor measurements, communication technologies, middleware, and applications
    to provide automated decision-making support. Section 4 describes how the proposed
    framework was experimentally validated and tested through simulation, using two
    application scenarios: monitoring olive tree farms and stables for horse training.
    The results obtained through simulation demonstrate the suitability of the proposed
    framework for both fixed and mobile scenarios, providing efficient communication
    performance and low latency. Additionally, Section 5 discusses how the results
    show the advantages of using the RPL protocol for routing in mobile and fixed
    sensor networks, which supports dynamic topologies and improves the overall network
    performance. Section 6 highlights the several practical implications for precision
    agriculture by providing an efficient monitoring and management solution for agricultural
    and livestock farms. 2. Related Works There has been a growing interest in understanding
    the best approaches for integrating IoT solutions within the agricultural sector.
    This interest can be broadly categorized into three stages: (1) Vertical studies
    that examine the best practices and technical guidelines for using IoT-enabling
    technologies such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), gateways, communication
    platforms, and middleware in production farms [3,11,12]. (2) Horizontal studies
    that investigate approaches to bridge gaps among the vertical studies by discussing
    standardization, interoperability issues, large-scale prototyping, and system
    of systems approach [1]. (3) Business-driven studies that focus on integrating
    the entire chain of agriculture, wherein social and technical guidelines and frameworks
    are considered, such as farm-to-fork and traceability for food-chain-related studies
    [13]. IoT and AI state-of-the-art solutions in agriculture have been discussed
    in [14,15]. The RPL protocol has been widely investigated in vertical studies
    focusing on several IoT sectors and applications (e.g., home and building automation,
    urban environments, and industrial applications). However, few research studies
    have examined how RPL behaves in other application domains, such as agriculture.
    For example, the authors in [16] examined the behavior of RPL for precision agriculture
    using a methodology similar to that used in this work; they proposed an extension
    model and presented preliminary network performance measurements of RPL. This
    study further investigates and demonstrates how the RPL behaves in two precision
    agriculture use cases (i.e., stationary and mobile). Many attempts have been made
    to build functional architectures for IoT applications suitable for plant and
    crop field monitoring and management [13,17,18]. Sensors for collecting information
    about the environment, soil, and water level are combined with geographical information
    systems (GISs). The captured parameters are stored in centralized databases using
    data management software. Web and mobile applications provide farmers with easy
    access to these databases. Several studies have proposed using IoT applications
    for monitoring animals, such as using sensor readings to track their health, behavior,
    and nutrition. These readings can be transferred to a centralized server for storage
    and further processing, providing valuable insights to farmers and animal trainers.
    They can then use this information to optimize their cost and time investments
    and achieve more value-added products [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Similarly, various
    proposed IoT systems have been proposed for monitoring peat forests, such as environmental
    conditions and potentially managing disasters. These systems often use solar power
    and communicate with monitoring centers through LoRa networks. Additionally, some
    studies have proposed using high-resolution satellite imagery to identify changes
    in forest viability and detect foliar diseases. These systems aim to provide early
    warning systems for fires, pest control, or deforestation [25,27,28,29]. In livestock
    farming, a wide range of factors to consider, such as wool and skin, depending
    on the type and number of farm animals. Studies have proposed solutions such as
    support systems for disease diagnosis and treatment, non-contact temperature measurement
    for early disease detection, and IoT monitoring systems for tracking animal behavior
    and health in large-scale pig farms. These systems can provide animal health recommendations
    to farmers in rural areas where veterinary access is difficult [30,31,32,33].
    This study examined the performance of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in two different
    agricultural scenarios: olive tree farms with fixed-position sensor nodes and
    a horse training stable with mobile sensor nodes. The sensors were used to monitor
    the physical condition of the horses, aiming to improve their health and well-being
    while also collecting high-precision measurements. The experiments adopted a random
    waypoint model to simulate the movement of the horses in the second scenario.
    Our evaluation measures included average power consumption, radio duty cycle,
    and sensor network connectivity levels. The paper proposed a new approach for
    simulating moving animals using the COOJA simulator. Despite the limitations imposed
    by the constrained nature of WSNs, extending their lifespan remains a critical
    challenge. Various techniques, such as power optimization algorithms, low-power
    communications, and reactive sensor networks, have been proposed to address this
    issue [34,35,36,37]. However, studies that compare the performance of WSNs in
    fixed and mobile deployment scenarios in the agriculture sector are limited. Furthermore,
    the implementation of IoT technologies such as WSNs in the agriculture industry
    has been slower compared to other domains, indicating a need for further research
    in this area to promote wider and faster diffusion of IoT in the sector [38,39,40,41,42].
    IoT integration within the agriculture sector has matured, as evidenced by its
    extension into several commercial applications. There has been a growing interest
    in understanding the best approaches for integrating IoT solutions within the
    agricultural sector, which can be broadly categorized into three stages: (1) vertical
    studies that examine the best practices and technical guidelines for using IoT-enabling
    technologies such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs); (2) horizontal studies that
    investigate approaches to bridge gaps among the vertical studies; and (3) business-driven
    studies that focus on integrating the entire chain of agriculture. This study
    examined the performance of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in two different agricultural
    scenarios: olive tree farms with fixed-position sensor nodes and a horse training
    stable with mobile sensor nodes. Our proposed system builds upon these existing
    technologies by incorporating machine learning and data analysis techniques to
    provide farmers with real-time recommendations on crop management practices. By
    analyzing data from various sources, including remote sensing [43] and ground-based
    sensors [44], our system can provide farmers with a comprehensive view of their
    fields and make recommendations tailored to their specific needs. Furthermore,
    our system aims to be user-friendly and accessible, requiring minimal technical
    knowledge to operate. By providing easy-to-understand recommendations through
    a user-friendly interface, we aim to make precision agriculture more accessible
    to a wider range of farmers. In conclusion, our proposed system builds upon the
    strengths of existing precision agriculture systems while addressing their limitations,
    with the ultimate goal of improving efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing
    crop yields for farmers. The state-of-the-art precision agriculture systems involve
    the use of advanced technologies such as sensors, GPS, robotics, and data analytics
    to optimize crop production and reduce costs. Remote sensing and ground-based
    sensor systems are commonly used to monitor crop health, soil moisture, and other
    environmental factors. Variable rate application systems use this data to adjust
    inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and water according to the specific needs
    of different parts of a field. Autonomous agricultural equipment, such as drones
    and robots, are also being developed and used to automate planting, harvesting,
    and other tasks. In addition to these technologies, precision agriculture systems
    are also integrating machine learning and AI algorithms to analyze large volumes
    of data and make predictions about crop health and yield. This allows farmers
    to make data-driven decisions and optimize their operations for maximum efficiency
    and profitability. The research problems in precision agriculture systems primarily
    involve developing more accurate and reliable sensors, improving data analytics
    and modeling techniques, and addressing issues related to data privacy and security.
    Additionally, there is ongoing research in developing more advanced autonomous
    equipment and integrating multiple systems for a more comprehensive approach to
    precision agriculture. Overall, precision agriculture is a rapidly evolving field,
    with new technologies and techniques constantly emerging. The state-of-the-art
    is driven by a focus on improving efficiency, reducing waste, and increasing yields
    through the use of advanced technologies and data-driven decision making. Our
    proposed system advances the state of the art in precision agriculture by combining
    the benefits of both remote sensing and ground-based sensor systems. By using
    both satellite imagery and ground-based sensors, our system can provide a more
    comprehensive view of crop health and environmental factors, with greater detail
    and accuracy than either system alone. Additionally, our system utilizes machine
    learning algorithms to analyze the data and provide real-time recommendations
    for crop management, further improving efficiency and yields. Overall, our proposed
    system offers a more advanced and integrated approach to precision agriculture
    that can help farmers make more informed decisions and optimize crop production.
    3. Overview of Precision Agriculture This section covers the topic of precision
    agriculture and its applications, the use of advanced information and communication
    technology (ICT) in transforming the agricultural industry, and the advantages
    of utilizing IoT-enabled technologies to enhance precision agriculture. Precision
    agriculture is a modern approach to managing farming and cultivation that utilizes
    ICT to improve production yield, quality, and efficiency [45]. This integration
    of ICT involves optimizing the entire farming process chain, from monitoring plant
    and animal health and growth to observing the environment, applying fertilizers,
    managing water irrigation, and deploying sensors on tractors to collect data on
    soil moisture and crop growth using drones and GPS technology [46]. Decision support
    systems then analyze the collected data to inform farming practices and improve
    overall efficiency. Precision agriculture, which utilizes advanced ICT to improve
    production yield, quality, and efficiency, can greatly benefit from integrating
    IoT in crop and animal farms. In crop farms, such as olive tree farms, IoT allows
    farmers to monitor the growth and health of their plants and collect data such
    as temperature, rainfall, leaf water potential, and overall plant health. This
    information can prevent diseases and pests from affecting the yield. In animal
    farms, IoT sensors can be used to monitor the health and performance of the animals,
    allowing farmers to gather data on the herd’s health, welfare, and physical location.
    For example, in a horse training stable, smart sensors and tags can provide information
    on each horse’s temperature, health, activity, nutrition, and collective herd
    information. This can help farmers identify sick animals and separate them from
    the herd to prevent contamination and reduce labor costs by using technologies
    such as drones for real-time livestock tracking. The application of an IoT-based
    system can have a significant impact on the efficiency of farming operations in
    both olive tree and horse stable management. In the case of olive tree farming,
    an IoT-based system can be used to monitor and control irrigation, fertilizer
    application, and pest management. The system can be designed to collect data on
    soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental factors, which can be used
    to determine the optimal irrigation schedule and fertilizer application rates.
    This can lead to more efficient water and fertilizer use, reduce costs, and increase
    crop yields. In horse stable management, an IoT-based system can be used to monitor
    the health and behavior of horses, as well as the temperature and humidity levels
    in the stable. This can help detect early signs of illness or injury in horses,
    and provide insights into their behavior patterns. The system can also be used
    to automate feeding and watering schedules, which can reduce labor costs and ensure
    that horses receive the proper nutrition. Overall, the application of an IoT-based
    system can help farmers make data-driven decisions, automate tasks, and optimize
    resource use, leading to increased efficiency and profitability in both olive
    tree and horse stable management. 3.1. The Proposed System Model This paper provides
    a reference framework to facilitate the development of precision agriculture applications.
    The proposed model considers heterogeneous sensors and network-enabling technologies
    for near-real-time network access to status information about a pool of agricultural
    resources. These resources include trees, animals, water pumps, applications,
    and other services. These resources can be controlled with minimal management
    effort or farmer interaction. By using this system, farmers can benefit in multiple
    ways: 1. Real-time monitoring: The proposed system allows farmers to monitor their
    crops and livestock in real time, which enables them to take prompt action in
    case of any abnormalities or issues. 2. Automated decision making: The system
    uses data analysis to provide farmers with insights and recommendations for optimizing
    their operations, such as determining the ideal time for planting or harvesting
    or identifying the best feeding and watering schedule for their livestock. 3.
    Reduced labor costs: The system allows farmers to automate many of their tasks,
    such as irrigation and pest control, which reduces the need for labor-intensive
    manual work. 4. Improved crop and animal health: The system allows farmers to
    monitor the health of their crops and animals more closely, which enables them
    to identify and address issues more quickly. 5. Increased yield and revenue: By
    using precision agriculture techniques, farmers can improve their crop yields
    and animal health, leading to increased revenue. 6. Resource optimization: The
    proposed system can also help farmers optimize their use of resources, such as
    water and fertilizers, which can reduce costs and minimize environmental impact.
    The proposed system model for precision agriculture comprises three main layers,
    as shown in Figure 1: devices and platforms, communication layers, and application
    layers. Figure 1. Proposed IoT system model for precision agriculture, showing
    the relationship between various entities such as sensors, network-enabling technologies,
    and agricultural resources for real-time monitoring and control. I. The application
    layer includes user applications, data analysis, and dashboards used to monitor
    and optimize precision operations. The Big Data and analytics module consist of
    a data warehouse storage, which runs at the application layer. This component
    contains the technology and services necessary to integrate and archive data from
    multiple sensors and applications, enabling the IoT system to derive and deliver
    value from its data assets. II. The communication layer offers real-time connectivity
    and enables communication between devices and platforms. This includes sensors
    to sensors, sensors to gateways, and gateways to servers within the IoT ecosystem.
    The framework combines several heterogeneous communication technologies, such
    as IEEE 802.4.15, 6lowPAN, and COAP. III. The devices and platforms layer is the
    foundation of the IoT ecosystem infrastructure. These layers include system components
    such as sensors, gateways, and server platforms. Sensors are devices that capture
    the status information about physical world objects and convert them into digital
    data for transmission and processing. The main goal of the gateway’s platform
    is to aggregate heterogeneous data sources with different communication standards,
    given that an array of sensor devices is required to collect data about plants,
    water, environments, animals, and soil, among others. Servers host user applications
    and data repositories and provide unified access APIs for other systems and users.
    The three main layers of the proposed system model, devices and platforms, communication
    layers, and application layers, interact to perform the high-level operations
    of precision agriculture. The devices and platforms layer is the foundation of
    the IoT ecosystem infrastructure, including system components such as sensors,
    gateways, and server platforms. These devices capture the status information about
    physical world objects and convert them into digital data for transmission and
    processing. The communication layer offers real-time connectivity and enables
    communication between devices and platforms. It includes the network protocols
    required to transfer digital information from the sensor to the application layer.
    The application layer comprises user applications, data analysis, and dashboards
    used to monitor and optimize precision operations. The artificial intelligence
    module hosts machine learning models to predict and anticipate anomalies and actions
    to support the automation process. Remote Sensing hosts applications to analyze
    images coming from satellites and drones. All these layers work together to enable
    farmers to monitor and optimize their crops and livestock, leading to more efficient
    and productive farming operations. 3.2. Precision Agriculture Applications For
    example, an application such as horse monitoring is essential for several reasons,
    such as horses being prone to sudden illnesses such as colic, which can be fatal.
    Therefore, monitoring horses remotely and constantly is essential to be aware
    of their condition and function as quickly as possible in an emergency. For this
    task, WSNs play a decisive role, allowing owners and/or breeders to monitor the
    vital signs and anxiety of the horses or the stable environmental conditions that
    can influence the horses’ comfort. The utilization of WSN technology for farm
    animal monitoring has received considerable research attention. Research has focused
    on monitoring the behavioral preferences of cattle using a combination of GPS,
    satellite imagery, and WSNs. Wireless sensor technology has been used for horses
    to analyze gait (to identify lameness) and detect foaling time. Monitoring cows
    and pasture time on a new grass strip using Zigbee technology has already been
    addressed [47]. IoT systems for horse management, which is a WSN-based system
    that provides a solution for equine real-time monitoring, allows farmers to access
    and evaluate vital health signs and behavioral and environmental measurements
    remotely while being connected to the Internet. In addition to monitoring, the
    system comprises additional functionalities (i.e., registering and alerting and
    remote video streaming). Many sensors have been developed in recent years for
    such horse stables; these sensors can be used to monitor various conditions. The
    following are some mobility-support sensors that can be used for horse monitoring:
    (1) motion sensors; (2) blood pressure sensors; (3) heartbeat sensors; (4) colic
    sensors [48,49]. A commercially available sensor board can be used to use these
    sensors. For example, some boards support up to 16 sensor plugs on the same board,
    which can help create a single node that can measure many physical parameters
    [50,51,52,53]. A second practical example is IoT for olive trees, which integrates
    IoT devices to manage irrigation, fertilization, and pest control on plant structures.
    This system helps to detect the disease in its early stages and the risk of the
    disease spreading in the field by determining the right amount and time of additional
    olive tree irrigation and tree changes caused by agricultural pests. The system
    relies on temperature and humidity sensors on the ground and cameras that take
    pictures of the trees. The data generated by these devices are sent to a database
    server through web services and analyzed. This system sends instructions to decide,
    such as the amount of irrigation and fertilization, the time to water, and the
    precise infection treatment. For example, Libelium’s Waspmote Plug & Sense! Sensor
    Platform is a commercially available sensor board used for best control in an
    olive tree farm. For Example, Libelium’s boards support up to 16 sensor branches
    on a single board so that a node can measure multiple parameters [29]. 3.3. Communications
    Protocols The communication layer in the proposed system model facilitates interactions
    among various IoT subsystems using a variety of network protocols. For example,
    the application layer utilizes lightweight protocols and architectures, such as
    JSON and REST, encapsulated over HTTP/COAP at the network layer. Additionally,
    reliable and unreliable protocols are supported at the transport layer, including
    TCP and UDP. Constrained devices communicate using 6LowPAN, IPv6, and RPL for
    routing data packets. Routing among network nodes is achieved through the RPL
    protocol, which dynamically builds a destination-oriented directed acyclic graph
    (DODAG) at the sink node. This protocol supports static topologies and mobile
    nodes and enables efficient traffic flow toward the sink node [54]. JSON (JavaScript
    Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans
    to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset
    of the JavaScript Programming Language. It is commonly used to transmit data between
    a server and a web application, as well as between different systems. JSON is
    also language-independent and can be used in any programming language. REST (Representational
    State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to
    create web services. It is based on the principles of the HTTP protocol, which
    is used to transfer data over the internet. RESTful web services are characterized
    by their ability to be accessed by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and their
    support for the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). RESTful web services
    are lightweight, easy to implement, and easily consumed by many clients, including
    web browsers, mobile devices, and other systems. JSON and REST are commonly used
    together in IoT systems to transfer data in a lightweight, easy-to-use format
    that a wide range of devices and systems can access. HTTP/COAP (Constrained Application
    Protocol) is a communications protocol used at the network layer for IoT systems.
    HTTP is a widely-used protocol for web communication and is typically used for
    web-based applications. COAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with
    constrained nodes and networks in the IoT. It is designed to use fewer network
    resources and less bandwidth than HTTP and is optimized for use in low-power and
    lossy networks, such as those found in IoT systems. It uses DODAG to build routes
    and support static typologies and mobile nodes. DODAG is a data structure used
    in RPL to build and maintain routes in a low-power and lossy network such as an
    IoT network. The DODAG is built and maintained by a root node, also known as a
    sink node, which acts as the central point of the network and is responsible for
    forwarding data packets to their intended destinations. The DODAG is essentially
    a tree structure where each node in the network has a specific parent node, and
    all nodes point toward the root node. The DODAG is directed, meaning that data
    flows in a specific direction towards the root node, and is acyclic, meaning there
    are no loops in the data flow. The RPL protocol uses the DODAG to determine the
    optimal routes for data packets, considering factors such as network congestion,
    energy efficiency, and link quality. The DODAG also allows for dynamic adjustments
    to the routes as network conditions change. 3.4. Devices and Platforms This layer
    of the proposed system model comprises the sensor platform and associated sensing
    technologies. Sensors capture and digitize the measurement parameters of physical
    objects and their environments, such as plants, animals, soil, and water. Precision
    applications in agriculture require the identification of specific measurement
    parameters and corresponding sensors. The overall characteristics of the IoT ecosystem,
    including hardware, operating systems, and network stack protocols, also play
    a role in determining the sensor computing platforms. The identification of measurement
    parameter requirements is influenced by three factors: the type of animal or plant
    being considered (e.g., horse, dog, rice, palm, or olive tree), the farm environment
    where the species are studied (such as large arable fields, small/medium-sized
    arable farms, animals in the field or house, indoor horticulture, greenhouses,
    beehives, fishery and aquaculture, and leisure agriculture [55]), and the specific
    applications being used (such as monitoring livestock food supply chain, tracking,
    traceability, early warning systems, and pest management). Figure 2 illustrates
    these factors. Figure 2. Process of identifying the measurement parameters requirements.
    Table 1 summarizes commonly used plant sensory data in precision agriculture.
    The information is adapted from the primary vendor, Libelum, in the IoT domain.
    This list is useful for IoT system developers to optimize their applications and
    make informed decisions about sensor selection. The data type of the sensor is
    also provided to aid in programming. Table 1. Sensory Data used plant sensory
    data in precision agriculture. Sensor device platforms, as shown in Table 2, are
    built from hardware and software components. The functional element of the software
    is responsible for managing the underlying hardware platform and providing a set
    of services for upper-layer applications. Operating systems (OS) play a crucial
    role in the functionality of the sensor device platform. The OS kernel, which
    is the core component of the OS, includes a scheduler that manages resource sharing
    among users, such as CPU, main memory, and I/O device operations. Additionally,
    the programming model of the OS, such as threading, supports concurrency and enables
    efficient resource management [56]. Table 2. Sensors Platforms for IoT in precision
    agriculture. 4. Experiments and Simulation The proposed framework’s overall aim
    is to enhance the effective planning and implementation of an IoT System for process
    management in precision agriculture applications. It provides guidelines and best
    practices for IoT development and implementation practitioners. To validate the
    proposed framework, two application scenarios were used: the first scenario is
    an olive tree farm where the WSN nodes are fixed in the soil and on the tree,
    forming a stationary network. The second scenario represents a horse stable where
    the animals are moving and the WSN nodes need to be attached to horses to be able
    to monitor the health and nutrition status, forming a mobile and changing network
    structure. Therefore, it is important to compare the dynamic behaviors for both
    cases to understand the impact on the network’s DODAG. One of the main limitations
    in the validation process is the difficulty in implementing all the components
    of the proposed system. Therefore, sub-components of the system were experimentally
    validated and tested, while other components were analyzed conceptually. This
    approach allows for a thorough examination of the proposed framework’s performance
    and scalability in a simulated environment, as well as its suitability for edge
    and fog platforms in terms of packet delivery ratio, power consumption, and packet
    delivery rates. The above processes are enabled by data sources from the sensors
    allocated in the two application scenarios. The simulation results demonstrated
    acceptable performance, and thus, the two scenarios were selected to take part
    in the final framework. Overall, the framework was assessed by creating a simulated
    test that primarily aimed to measure communication performance and latency, and
    comparing the efficiency and reliability of RPL protocol for fixed and mobile
    scenarios. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for fixed and mobile nodes have some
    key differences that need to be considered when designing and implementing them.
    In a WSN for fixed nodes, such as in an olive farm, the sensor nodes are typically
    placed in a stationary manner, either in the soil or on the trees. These nodes
    form a stationary network structure that is relatively stable and predictable.
    On the other hand, in a WSN for mobile nodes, such as in a horse stable, the sensor
    nodes need to be attached to the animals and are constantly moving. This results
    in a mobile and changing network structure that is more dynamic and less predictable.
    It is important to compare the dynamic behaviors of both cases to understand the
    impact on the network and the performance of the routing protocol used, such as
    the destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) in the RPL protocol. By
    validating both cases, the practitioners can better understand the limitations
    and challenges of implementing IoT systems for precision agriculture and identify
    the most suitable solutions for different scenarios. The fixed sensor nodes in
    the olive tree, as shown in Figure 3, farm scenario form a stationary network,
    whereas the mobile sensor nodes attached to the horses in the stable scenario
    form a dynamic and constantly changing network structure, as shown in Figure 4.
    This allows us to compare the dynamic behaviors of the network in both cases and
    understand the impact on the RPL protocol’s destination-oriented directed acyclic
    graph (DODAG) formation. By validating both scenarios, the experiments aim to
    demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed framework in different
    precision agriculture environments and provide insights for future development
    and optimization of IoT systems in precision agriculture. Figure 3. IoT system
    for monitoring olive trees in a fixed position. Figure 4. IoT System for horse
    monitoring. The experiment is designed to measure the communication performance
    and latency of the system, comparing the efficiency and reliability of the RPL
    protocol in both fixed and mobile scenarios. Each scenario was evaluated individually
    within the overall framework and yielded acceptable performance; hence, they were
    selected to take part in the final framework. The system assessment results have
    shown the suitability of our implementation for edge and fog platforms in terms
    of packet delivery ratio, power consumption, and packet delivery rates that demonstrate
    the advantages of improving mobile and fixed sensor networks. The simulation tool
    used for this work is the COOJA simulator, a JAVA-based simulator for Contiki
    OS. The COOJAs mobility plugin needs to be enabled because it is not supported
    by default; it must include information about mobility positions for each node
    during the simulation. Therefore, the mobile node speed was set to 3.33 m/s. All
    node information regarding mobility positions was saved in a file and loaded before
    the simulation process started in the simulator. In all simulations, sensors that
    communicated with a central sink node completed data gathering and aggregation.
    The monitoring unit (MU), a central unit, works as a gateway between the users
    and the sensors, considering the typical physical configuration of a horse farm.
    The MU is a set of customized sensors for each horse on the farm; equine sensors
    in the horse stable are assembled in the sensor node. The horse is equipped with
    airflow, heart rate, body temperature, speed, indicator movements, and colic sensors.
    Each sensor node can read multiple parameters and communicate directly with the
    central point. The base station is plugged into the MU, which is the system’s
    central unit and implements all users’ and administrators’ functionalities, communicating
    between sensor nodes, and connecting the system with the Internet and cellular
    networks. 4.1. Simulation Software: Contiki and COOJA The experimentation utilized
    wireless sensor nodes that were built on the open-source, highly portable, multi-tasking
    operating system, Contiki [57]. This operating system is specifically designed
    for memory-efficient networked embedded systems and wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
    It is capable of running on microcontrollers with minimal memory resources, with
    a typical configuration of 2 kB of RAM and 40 kB of ROM. The use of Contiki in
    our sensor nodes allowed for efficient resource management and ensured compatibility
    with the low-power requirements of our precision agriculture applications. Contiki
    was selected as the operating system for the sensor nodes and used C as the programming
    language. Contiki has many advantages over other sensor-network operating systems;
    for example, it includes an embedded simulation tool, COOJA, which can compile
    and simulate application software conveniently and quickly [41]. For simulation,
    a single sink node was assumed in each application and 36 normal nodes. The sink
    node is assumed to be fixed in the olive farm case and mobile in the horse farm
    case. The static nodes were simulated in COOJA using 36 clients and a single server
    (Sky Mote IPv6 RPL-UDP). The mobile nodes were modeled using a WSN 6lowPan in
    COOJA, where the mobility model was modeled using RWM. The data analysis and processing
    server were fixed at the simulation area’s center. Finally, the simulation duration
    was set as 4 h. Table 3 and Table 4, summarize all used summation parameters.
    Table 3. Sensors Platforms and Simulation Settings. Table 4. Sensors Platforms
    and Sensors Data Parameters. 4.2. Experiment Mobility Model for Both Scenarios
    In the first set of experiments conducted at the olive tree farm, experiments
    deployed a wireless sensor network consisting of 36 static nodes, each representing
    a tree equipped with a sensor board. The nodes were distributed on a grid and
    strategically placed within different squared areas of 25 m × 25 m, 50 m × 50
    m, 75 m × 75 m, and 100 m × 100 m. The sink node, which serves as the central
    point for data collection and transmission, was located at the center of the simulation
    area. This configuration allowed us to evaluate the network performance and assess
    the impact of node density and area coverage on the overall system performance.
    The density and coverage of nodes in a wireless sensor network (WSN) can have
    a significant impact on the overall system performance. A higher node density
    results in a more extensive coverage area, which can improve the accuracy of data
    collection and increase the chances of successful data transmission. However,
    a higher node density also increases the number of nodes that need to be maintained
    and managed, which can increase the complexity of the system and reduce overall
    performance. Additionally, a higher node density can lead to increased interference
    between nodes, which can negatively impact the system’s communication performance.
    On the other hand, a lower node density can result in lower coverage areas, which
    can reduce the accuracy of data collection and decrease the chances of successful
    data transmission. Therefore, the optimal node density and coverage will depend
    on the specific requirements of the application and must be carefully considered
    during the design and deployment of the WSN. In the second set of experiments,
    the focus is on mobile horse farms and the impact of node density and area coverage
    on the overall system performance. The experiments are conducted using the same
    grid-based areas as in the first set, with dimensions of 25 m × 25 m, 50 m × 50
    m, 75 m × 75 m, and 100 m × 100 m. However, in this scenario, 36 nodes representing
    sensor boards mounted on horses are used, and the nodes are made to move based
    on the random waypoint model (RWP) [58]. The sink node remains static and is located
    at the center of the simulation area. The random waypoint model (RWP) is a commonly
    used mobility model in wireless sensor networks (WSN) and mobile ad hoc networks
    (MANET) simulations. The RWP model simulates a scenario where nodes move randomly
    within a defined area, with each node having a destination point chosen randomly
    and a random speed between a defined minimum and maximum value. The node then
    moves towards the destination point at the chosen speed, pauses for a random amount
    of time upon reaching the destination, and then chooses a new destination point.
    This model is used to simulate a variety of mobile scenarios, such as vehicular
    networks or animal tracking, and allows researchers to study the impact of mobility
    on network performance, such as connectivity, throughput, and delay. The RWP mobility
    model distributes the nodes randomly within predefined simulation areas after
    the start of the simulation. At the beginning of the simulation run, every mobile
    node remained in its location for a certain random period (i.e., a pause time),
    and this was uniformly chosen between 0–60 s. Once this time expires, it moves
    to a random location within a simulation area and at a speed uniformly distributed
    between minspeed and maxspeed. The mobile node then moves to the newly selected
    destination location at the selected speed. The node pauses for the specified
    pause time before repeating the same process when it arrives. The node chooses
    a new speed and destination combination and then moves again after the completion
    of the pause time. The simulation setting for the speed of the mobile nodes is
    uniformly selected between 1 and 2 m/s. This model is used in several simulation
    studies and is closer to simulating a horse’s movement. The impact of mobility
    on performance can be significant in wireless sensor networks for mobile applications
    such as horse monitoring. As the nodes move, the network topology changes and
    the routing paths may need to be recalculated. This can lead to increased network
    overhead, decreased packet delivery ratio, and increased power consumption. Additionally,
    the moving nodes may experience varying levels of signal strength and interference,
    leading to further challenges in maintaining stable communication. Thus, it is
    essential to consider the impact of mobility on the overall system performance
    in wireless sensor networks for mobile applications. 4.3. Simulation Flow Chart
    Figure 5 presents the flowchart of the suggested simulation sessions, starting
    with determining the mobility parameters and then generating the corresponding
    mobility file that will be loaded to the simulator once the simulation is started.
    The nodes can be mobile nodes or static, stationary nodes. Next, the system measures
    the sensor set data parameters, as in Table 4. The packets are created and sent
    after sensors collect the data, and the WSN can work as a relay in multi-hop communication;
    therefore, it can forward (broadcast) the received packet to its neighbors. Figure
    5. Simulation Flowchart. 4.4. Data Analysis After collecting the data, a Python
    script was developed using the Pandas library for data analysis and Matplotlib
    for plotting charts. The collected data from the simulation was processed and
    analyzed using statistical methods to obtain the necessary metrics for further
    analysis. The script was used to calculate the sensor network graph’s average
    power consumption, radio duty cycle, and connectivity degrees. The simulation
    was run five times, and the average of the obtained data was taken for further
    analysis. The results were then plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the data
    trends and compare different scenarios. 5. Results Analysis and Discussion The
    results of the experiments conducted in both scenarios were analyzed to evaluate
    the overall performance of the proposed framework. The results demonstrated that
    the proposed framework is suitable for both fixed and mobile scenarios, providing
    efficient communication performance and low latency. Additionally, the results
    showed the advantages of using RPL protocol for routing in mobile and fixed sensor
    networks, which supports dynamic topologies and improves the overall network performance.
    The results also highlighted the impact of node density and area coverage on the
    overall system performance in the fixed scenario, as well as the impact of mobility
    on the performance in the mobile scenario. The random waypoint model used to simulate
    the movement of horses in the stable scenario was found to be suitable to simulate
    the movement of horses. Overall, the proposed framework is a promising solution
    for precision agriculture applications and can be further enhanced by incorporating
    more advanced technologies and techniques to improve its performance and scalability.
    Using simulation as a validation method for the proposed framework in precision
    agriculture applications offers several advantages. One of the key advantages
    is the ability to realistically compare the networking performance indices of
    both fixed and mobile nodes using the same simulation settings. By combining these
    two scenarios, the simulation allows us to capture the effect of mobility on both
    applications, and thus provide a comprehensive understanding of the system’s behavior
    in different scenarios. Moreover, using a software simulator such as COOJA enables
    us to test the system in a controlled environment, which can minimize the cost
    and complexity of implementing the system in a real-world setting. Furthermore,
    the simulation results can be easily replicated and verified, providing a high
    level of confidence in the validity of the results. The first set of results compares
    the performance of the proposed framework in a fixed IoT application scenario,
    where a single static sink node is utilized to collect sensor data from 36 static
    nodes distributed in different square areas of 25 m × 25 m, 50 m × 50 m, 75 m
    × 75 m, and 100 m × 100 m. The second set of results, on the other hand, represents
    a mobile IoT application scenario, where a single static sink node is utilized
    to collect sensor data from 36 mobile nodes that move based on the random waypoint
    model (RWP). In order to compare the performance of both scenarios, experiments
    used the hop count metric as a measure of the number of hops along the path between
    a node and the destination. Figure 6 shows a comparison of the average end-to-end
    packet delivery ratio (PDR) between the mobile nodes and the sink node, calculated
    over five runs for a 4-h duration for each run. This metric is used to evaluate
    the reliability of the network in delivering data packets from the source to the
    destination. Figure 6. Data delivery ratio for trees vs. animals. When all nodes
    are static, as with trees, all packets sent to the sink node from a node follow
    the same path; therefore, the hop count is fixed for all delivered packets. 𝐻𝑆(𝑖)=
    ℎ 𝑖 (1) 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝐻𝑆= 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚 𝐻𝑆(𝑖) (2) In Equation (1), 𝐻𝑆(𝑖) represents the
    hop count for all packets sent from node i to the sink, whereas Equation (2) calculates
    the average hop count for all successful packets sent from all m static source
    nodes to the sink. The network topology keeps changing for the hop count in the
    mobile scenario; therefore, the packets sent to the sink from a node may follow
    different paths and result in different hop counts for different packets. 𝐻𝑀(𝑖,𝑘)=
    ℎ 𝑖𝑘 (3) 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝐻𝑀= 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑚 𝐻𝑀(𝑖,𝑘) (4) In Equation (3), 𝐻𝑀(𝑖,𝑘) represents
    the hop count for packet k sent by node I, which is successfully received at the
    sink node. Equation (4) calculates the average hop count for all n successful
    packets sent from all m mobile source nodes to the sink. In these equations, 𝑃𝐷𝑅
    is defined as the ratio of data packets received by the destination to those generated
    by the source; it is mathematically defined by Equation (5). 𝑃𝐷𝑅= 𝑅 𝑆 (5) where
    S represents the sum of all data packets generated by all sources and R represents
    the sum of all correctly received data packets at the sink node. Further, the
    results consider the common term “end-to-end delay”, which indicates the average
    time required for a data packet to be transmitted across the network from the
    source to the destination, and it is mathematically presented as Equation (6).
    𝐸𝐸𝐷= 𝑇 𝑁 (6) where T represents the summation of time spent to deliver all successfully,
    N received packets to the sink by all source nodes in the network. In addition,
    experiments consider network connectivity, which represents the percentage of
    all nodes that can deliver at least one packet to the sink, and it varies from
    100% to 0%. Figure 6 shows the average PDR for different cases. PDR in the static
    case is always higher than the PDR in the mobile case for different simulation
    areas. Here, PDR increases while moving from the dense network 25×25 to a less
    dense network when the congestion level decreases. Further, the PDR is worse for
    a spare network ( 100×100 . There are no path details from all nodes to the sink,
    and some nodes become isolated because of the poor graph connectivity, and the
    poor PDR for mobile nodes 50×50 and 75×75 compared to static nodes result from
    the frequent changes in the network topology with mobile nodes. The RPL route
    reconfiguration cannot cope with the fast network topology changes that result
    in connectivity loss and, therefore, the failure in the delivery of the data when
    mobile sensor nodes move out of the transmission range of the parent nodes. The
    mobility of sensor nodes in WSNs provided new challenges in packet delivery ratio
    and energy consumption because the positions of sensor and sink nodes continue
    to change, resulting in connection failure. Therefore, the node cannot send packets
    to the parent and is dropped. As shown in Figure 7, experiments map the node to
    the number of hops; experiments increase the delay with an increase in the number
    of hops. The delay does not decrease for the nodes at one hop from the sink; however,
    the delay decreases considerably for nodes on the periphery, especially for those
    far away from the DAG root. This is a general observation for a very dense network,
    which is not present in our case. The average number of neighbor node density
    = the average number of neighbors. Further, the term “dense networks” defines
    networks with many nodes within a small area, and such networks affect network
    performance. In high-density networks, nodes are required to send many more messages
    to check the availability of the network where the congestion and collision between
    packets are very high and result in an increase in the transmission delay; this
    requires more resources. Figure 7. Data delay for trees vs. animals. As shown
    in Figure 8, the red values represent the percentage of time for which the node
    stayed in the listening mode and listened to the radio messages exchanged by the
    other nodes. The average listening percentage is approximately 1.75%. The blue
    values indicate the percentage of time the node stayed in transmission mode, i.e.,
    when the node sent packets to other nodes. The average transmission rate was approximately
    2.5%. The network graph represents links between the sender and sinks nodes, as
    shown in Table 5. Figure 8. Duty Cycle Percentage for Random nodes = [1, 15, 31,
    40]. Table 5. Network Connectivity Parameters. In Figure 9, each bar on the Y-axis
    indicates the average total power composite of the four power elements (LPM, CPU,
    radio listen, and radio transmit). The link power management (LPM) represents
    low power, equal to 0.1 mW. The CPU computer programming unit was 0.85 mW, whereas
    the average radio listening power was 2.75 mW. Further, the average radio transmission
    power was 3 mW. Figure 9. Instantaneous Power Consumption for nodes = [1, 15,
    31, 40]. 6. Practical and Research Implications The proposed framework for integrating
    IoT systems in precision agriculture provides a comprehensive solution for the
    effective planning and implementation of IoT systems in precision agriculture
    applications. The proposed system effectively combines an array of sensor measurements,
    communication technologies, middleware, and applications to provide automated
    decision-making support. The experimental results obtained through simulation
    demonstrate the suitability of the proposed framework for both fixed and mobile
    scenarios, providing efficient communication performance and low latency. Additionally,
    the results show the advantages of using RPL protocol for routing in mobile and
    fixed sensor networks, which supports dynamic topologies and improves the overall
    network performance. This research has several practical implications for precision
    agriculture. First, the proposed framework provides an efficient solution for
    monitoring and managing agricultural and livestock farms. The system can be used
    to collect essential information from the fields, such as plant health and soil
    moisture levels, and transmit it to a specific application for analysis and decision-making.
    This can help farmers improve crop yields, reduce water usage, and prevent crop
    damage. Furthermore, automated machine learning can also be used to model the
    sensor data to predict the condition and needs of the crops. Additionally, this
    research has important research implications. The proposed framework is a promising
    solution for precision agriculture and can be further enhanced by incorporating
    more advanced technologies and techniques to improve its performance and scalability.
    The experimental results obtained through simulation provide a foundation for
    further research on the performance of IoT systems in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    the proposed framework can be extended to other application domains that require
    efficient data collection and management, such as smart cities and industrial
    IoT. A limitation of this methodology was the use of only simulation to validate
    the framework; hence, the results may not be exactly the same as those obtained
    in a real-world setting. However, using simulation as a validation method for
    the proposed framework in precision agriculture applications offers several advantages,
    such as the ability to realistically compare the networking performance indices
    of both fixed and mobile nodes using the same simulation settings. Additionally,
    the simulation results can be easily replicated and verified, providing a high
    level of confidence in the validity of the results. One potential area for future
    improvement in this study is the integration of automated machine learning (AutoML)
    techniques to model the sensor data collected by the IoT system. By applying AutoML
    algorithms, the proposed framework can automatically identify patterns and anomalies
    in the sensor data and predict the condition and needs of the crops. This can
    help farmers make more accurate and timely decisions about crop management, such
    as when to water, fertilize, or apply pesticides. Additionally, by automating
    the modeling process, the proposed framework can provide more accurate predictions
    with less human intervention, reducing the time and resources required for manual
    data analysis. Overall, the integration of AutoML techniques can help to improve
    the performance and scalability of the proposed framework, making it even more
    useful for precision agriculture applications. Future improvements include testing
    the proposed framework in a real-world setting to validate the simulation results,
    as well as investigating the use of more advanced technologies and techniques,
    such as machine learning, to improve the performance and scalability of the proposed
    framework. Additionally, more work needs to be performed to evaluate the proposed
    framework in different network topologies and environments to understand its behavior
    in different scenarios. 7. Discussion The proposed framework for integrating IoT
    systems in precision agriculture was evaluated in two different scenarios: a fixed
    IoT application scenario in olive tree farms and a mobile IoT application scenario
    in horse stables. The results of the experiments conducted in both scenarios were
    analyzed to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed framework. In the
    fixed scenario, the results highlighted the impact of node density and area coverage
    on the overall system performance. The average end-to-end packet delivery ratio
    (PDR) between the nodes and the sink node was calculated over five runs for a
    4-h duration for each run, as shown in Figure 7. The results indicate that as
    the node density increases, the PDR also increases, indicating that a higher node
    density results in better network performance. Similarly, as the area coverage
    increases, the PDR also increases, indicating that a larger coverage area results
    in better network performance. In the mobile scenario, the results highlighted
    the impact of mobility on performance. The mobile nodes were simulated using the
    random waypoint model (RWP), which distributes the nodes randomly within predefined
    simulation areas after the start of the simulation. The simulation setting for
    the speed of the mobile nodes was uniformly selected between 1 and 2 m/s. The
    hop count metric was used to evaluate the reliability of the network in delivering
    data packets from the source to the destination. The results indicate that as
    the mobility of the nodes increases, the hop count also increases, indicating
    that a higher mobility results in a higher hop count and a lower PDR. The simulation
    results showed that the proposed framework is suitable for both fixed and mobile
    scenarios, providing efficient communication performance and low latency. The
    results also highlighted the impact of node density and area coverage on the overall
    system performance in the fixed scenario, as well as the impact of mobility on
    the performance in the mobile scenario. The simulation results are a promising
    solution for precision agriculture applications and can be further enhanced by
    incorporating more advanced technologies and techniques to improve its performance
    and scalability. It is important to note that using simulation as a validation
    method for the proposed framework in precision agriculture applications offers
    several advantages. One of the key advantages is the ability to realistically
    compare the networking performance indices of both fixed and mobile nodes using
    the same simulation settings. By combining these two scenarios, the simulation
    allows us to capture the effect of mobility on both applications, and thus provide
    a comprehensive understanding of the system’s behavior in different scenarios.
    Moreover, using a software simulator such as COOJA enables us to test the system
    in a controlled environment, which can minimize the cost and complexity of implementing
    the system in a real-world setting. Furthermore, the simulation results can be
    easily replicated and verified, providing a high level of confidence in the validity
    of the results. 8. Conclusions In conclusion, the proposed framework for integrating
    IoT systems in precision agriculture applications is a promising solution for
    managing agricultural and livestock farms. The simulation results obtained using
    the COOJA simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in
    both fixed and mobile scenarios. The results also indicate that network connectivity
    and average hop count play crucial roles in the performance of RPL in precision
    agriculture applications. Additionally, the best end-to-end packet delivery probability
    was achieved for network scenarios of 75 × 75 and 100 × 100 for both the olive
    tree and horse stable scenarios. The results also demonstrate that the average
    end-to-end delay is directly proportional to the average hop count. As the network
    becomes denser with a decrease in the network area, there is an increase in network
    connectivity and a decrease in hop count. This research can serve as a foundation
    for future studies to enhance the performance and scalability of the proposed
    framework. One limitation of this methodology is that the simulation results may
    not fully represent the real-world performance of the proposed framework in precision
    agriculture applications. This is because the simulation does not take into account
    various real-world factors that may affect the performance of the system, such
    as environmental conditions, human factors, and unexpected failures. Therefore,
    further validation of the proposed framework in real-world settings is necessary
    to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in precision agriculture applications.
    In terms of future improvements, incorporating advanced technologies such as machine
    learning algorithms and edge computing can enhance the performance and scalability
    of the proposed framework. Additionally, integrating more sophisticated sensor
    technologies such as drones and cameras can provide a more comprehensive understanding
    of the farm environment. Furthermore, incorporating a more dynamic mobility model
    for the mobile scenario can provide a more realistic representation of the movement
    of animals in precision agriculture applications. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    for sustainable food production Article 04 September 2017 A Review on the Effect
    of Soil Compaction and its Management for Sustainable Crop Production Article
    Open access 24 November 2021 1 Introduction Agricultural sector in India contributes
    to around 18% to the GDP and provides jobs to more than 60% of India’s workforce
    [1, 2]. The resilience of farming community during adversities of climate change
    is extremely significant when around 70% of the rural population just sustains
    through mere income from agriculture [3]. With increase in population, adapting
    emerging technologies in agriculture is inevitable to improve the living standard
    of majority of population and sustaining agriculture to an extent. Internet of
    Things (IoT) is one of the recently emerged technology in which a network of sensors
    collects the information and later it is processed and analyzed to provide better
    services to the user. Smart agriculture is one of the most prominent applications
    of IoT. The primary focus of approaching smart agriculture through the IoT, is
    to increase agricultural productivity and enhance the return on investment. Implementing
    the IoT systems is a revolutionary approach in the traditional agriculture industry,
    because of the requisite actions that are essential to modify and reorient the
    agricultural systems. India as one of the largest agricultural communities in
    the world, endows plenty of opportunities in the area of smart agriculture for
    researchers as well as entrepreneurs [4]. A report by NASSCOM reveals that, nearly
    500 start-ups were registered by Indian entrepreneurs, with a funding of more
    than $ 248 million [5]. There is a huge challenge in implementing the smart agricultural
    applications in remote villages in India, particularly, satisfying the needs of
    local people. For example, cultivation of rice is done by poor and illiterate
    people, who follow the traditional methods. If there is a mechanism, which could
    automate the irrigation, identify the soil quality, predict the weather conditions
    as well as price, it will help the farmers in decision making. This process can
    be automated using machine learning methods by learning from previous experience.
    In this era of digitization, agriculture also must be driven up through innovations
    tremendously to reach out to small and marginal farmers. Also, some of the existing
    IoT-based smart agriculture makes use of the proprietary based wireless sensor
    networks, to collect the sensing data. With this, interoperability among the heterogeneous
    sensor networks becomes a challenging task. Thus, the future focus of the researchers
    is upon, how to replace the existing IPv4-based WSNs to emerging IPv6-based networks
    (using 6LoWPAN standards), so that the smart sensors can be connected directly
    to the Internet. Another important aspect is that majority of the applications
    (even IoT/sensor based) developed as mentioned in the literature, are either simulation
    or experimental. Very few of the applications are developed and implemented in
    real-time for the benefit for farmers in remote villages in India. In most of
    the rural localities of India, the cultivation of any crops is done using traditional
    methods received from previous generation. So, the purpose of this study is to
    survey the existing agricultural applications, and to come up with automated solutions
    for irrigation, identifying soil quality, soil moisture, pH level, predicting
    weather conditions, etc. using IoT. The notion of optimality is gaining importance
    in agriculture than before, as the climatic changes and other attributes of profitability
    calls for optimal usage of water, fertilizers and other resources. And in herein
    lies the relevance of our work. The list of abbreviations used in the paper are
    listed in  Table 1. Table 1 List of abbreviations Full size table The rest of
    this paper is organized as follows; Sect. 2 describes existing taxonomies in smart
    agriculture and proposed taxonomy is described in Sect. 3. Reference architecture
    for smart agriculture applications is listed in Sect. 4. Section 5 elaborates
    technologies used in smart agriculture applications and Sect. 6 mentions other
    recent technologies used by IoT systems. Section 7 includes miscellaneous issues
    to be considered while implementing an IoT system in agriculture. Section 8 gives
    an idea about current improvements in Indian Farming Scenario. Section 9 describes
    the proposed architecture for smart agriculture applications along with prototype
    implementations. Section 10 lists the open problems identified as part of the
    study and Sect. 11 concludes the paper. 2 Existing Taxonomy of Smart Agricultural
    Applications There has been a tremendous changeover in adoption of farming practices
    over past few years, and beyond doubt IoT and its related technologies is the
    reason behind the change. The number of research papers and reviews evolved out
    during last five years proves the profound transformation. Some of the papers
    which encompass the overview of IoT and detailed analysis of relevant technologies,
    practices and the challenges around is described in this section. Surveys generally
    classifies the study related to IoT as layers of architecture, conceptual frameworks,
    technologies used, components of IoT and applications especially in smart agriculture.
    Several taxonomies of architecture have been described by [6, 7] and others. Description
    of several use cases diagrams and holistic implementation view was presented by
    Popovic et al. [8]. A large number of surveys have included the comparative study
    of communication technologies used. Latest survey by Tang et al. [9] describes
    5G for IoT and discusses its architecture. It has also been commonplace to include
    the procedure of reviewing papers and categorising them into different diagrammatic
    representations based on the methods used or by the solutions provided. It is
    worth mentioning the systematic study in [10] which provides an overall picture
    of development in particular area of IoT through ML. Other components of reviews
    comprise of the types of sensors, hardware platforms, could platforms etc. To
    understand the concepts behind IoT better, certain studies classified the work
    penetrating through layers of middleware and interoperability. For instance, Tzounis
    et al. [11] gives an overall picture of recent developments which ensures interoperability
    among various platforms. Meanwhile certain studies include the available commercial
    solutions also. For example, Abbasi et al. [12] lists various Smartphone apps
    and Antony et al. [13] says about available solution scenarios in selected countries.
    Besides the techniques, most of the works mentions existing challenges and concludes
    that, the wide scope of IoT in agriculture will be the driving factor for upcoming
    years. The authors also identify that when small farm growers are considered,
    the initial cost hinders farmers from adopting IoT technologies [13]. The prevailing
    taxonomies are classified in a timeline and presented below in Fig. 1. Fig. 1
    Timeline of existing surveys Full size image 3 Taxonomy of Smart Agricultural
    Applications In this section, we focus on a comprehensive study of the existing
    agricultural applications, covering all the aspects such as irrigation, soil quality,
    weather prediction, price prediction and plant health monitoring (Fig. 2). Fig.

    ways of irrigation in cultivating crops. For instance, the scarcity of water is
    an important aspect to be considered for the areas especially remote villages
    in India where rainfall is scarce. Even with long years of experience and well-informed
    intuitions, it is a bit hard to irrigate at the right moment when crop exactly
    needs water in required amounts. This demands a smart mechanism to use the water
    carefully and intelligently, depending on the type of crop. One of the greatest
    problems the world faces is water scarcity [31] and as agriculture is the main
    aspect for production of food which requires a large amount of water, we are in
    need of a solution that provides optimal water usage. Some of the problems we
    have been facing in irrigation sector in India [32] are as follows. Regional imbalance
    in rainfall and water availability Inferior utilization of available facilities
    Poor Irrigation Efficiency Rapidly growing demand for water Water Resources facing
    challenges from Climatic Changes There are other common issues prevailing among
    farmers. The methods of irrigation have to be chosen according to the land and
    crop types [33]. It will be difficult to measure the water content by perception
    through eyes. Some crops require some definite amount of water to give high yielding.
    This expert knowledge of water-need of crops and their yield in response to water
    have to be considered while irrigating fields [34]. Surface irrigation always
    cost higher labor charges and the increasing per-day labor charges possess another
    major challenge faced by small scale farmers. Most smart irrigation systems use
    soil moisture monitoring devices that are extremely useful to automate irrigation
    based on water requirements. Chen et al. [35] studied the tendency of change in
    soil temperature and moisture at various soil levels for crops to efficiently
    utilize water. Tensiometers and granular matrix sensors can be deployed as they
    could be calibrated easily, and readings could be directly used for scheduling
    irrigation [36]. Some of the applications [37,38,39] and research works [40,41,42,43]
    developed in the area of smart irrigation and monitoring system using IoT concepts,
    used the following elements commonly, are shown in Table 2. These are implemented
    in wide basis across the country to automate irrigation, and in some cases, fertigation.
    Table 2 Irrigation and monitoring techniques Full size table Energy optimization
    is a key success factor in case of any IoT systems. Using WSNs, it is possible
    to monitor a lot of factors that are required to increase yield. A study on TDMA-based
    MAC protocol for collecting data such as soil moisture and temperature for energy
    efficient model for irrigation was conducted in [44]. The MAC protocol is found
    to be considerable in consuming energy. Two data transmission approaches were
    compared. By the direct communication approach, all sensor nodes transmit data
    directly to the base station without the use of a header node, ensuring collision
    free transmission. But this approach is good only when the base station is nearby.
    An improvement to this system was by using the aggregation process by which the
    network''s total energy consumption is minimized. The simulation results show
    that the aggregation approach outperforms the direct communication method in terms
    of efficiency. It increased residual energy by 10% and throughput by 13%. The
    use of a fully automated drip irrigation system managed by an ARM9 processor was
    listed in article on sustainable agriculture [45]. The mechanism used to turn
    on and off the valves automatically, depending on the plant''s water requirements.
    The system also monitored for pH level and nitrogen contents of the soil periodically.
    Integration of GSM module enabled to send SMS to the consumer if there is an occurrence
    of any irregular conditions. It helped controlling activities. So, if the appropriate
    amount of water is irrigated, only a small amount of water is lost through unwanted
    percolation to the depths. Viani et al. [46] proposed an integration of fuzzy
    logic with wireless sensor networks to make a decision support system for saving
    water usage in irrigating the crops. It uses farmer’s experience to sort out the
    best irrigation strategies. A soil classifier is formed based on ML technique
    for each soil type, when nodes are placed for sensors at different positions.
    From the monitored data, optimal requirement of water is calculated by the system,
    according to the soil and water stress. A set of conditional statements forms
    the database for fuzzy rules, which is mainly the subjective knowledge from farmers.
    The soil potential, rain level and root stock resistance form the input to fuzzy
    engine. Based on these values the decision support system is triggered by using
    multi-Threshold technique. A function obtains the diffusion rate of water in the
    soil. Then water content is calculated from the soil response already known by
    the equation where the relation of water content in soil is coined by Van Genuchten
    method. The time interval between two consecutive decision support system executions
    is calculated and an estimation based on it is used for triggering the solution.
    So, this system supports routine irrigation without any specific inputs. Another
    aspect which can be considered is to evaluate spatial variations in water status
    of crops by thermal remote sensing [47]. Information from this system could be
    used for managing irrigation schedules. For non-irrigated crops, farmers could
    make use of remote sensing data to refrain from expensive Nitrogen applications,
    which forms the largest input in majority of crops. A summary of these studies
    is provided in Table 3 below. Table 3 Summary of smart irrigation systems in literature
    Full size table 3.2 Smart Soil Quality Monitoring System Apart from irrigation,
    there are certain components which have influence over the cultivation by the
    local farmers. In particular, the quality of the soil is an important factor to
    be considered during cultivation of any crops for getting good yields. Unfortunately,
    this is ignored by many of the farmers in the local villages. One of the reasons
    is that most of the farmers in the local villages are illiterate and the government
    agencies are not showing any interest to motivate the farmers about the quality
    of the soil before cultivation. The main factors which affect the soil quality
    are pH value, Nitrogen content and the effect of pesticides. Soil pH is an indication
    of the soil acidity or alkalinity, which is an important factor in soil health
    by affecting crops directly in case of yields, suitability and other factors like
    soil micro-organisms [48]. pH value of soil has to be monitored for a long term
    to keep the quality of soil. Another essential factor for plant growth is nutrients
    in soil. Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium are the primary elements vital for
    the plant growth [49,50,51,52]. Secondary nutrients such as Calcium and Magnesium
    and micronutrients such as Boron are also adequate to meet goals according to
    each crop. Plants require nitrogen more than any other nutrients and in most of
    the cases, the nitrogen content in the soil is very less and the plants are forced
    to take nitrogen in organic forms [53]. An overuse of fertilizer could create
    a lower value of pH and in that case, it is advisable not to use fertilizers even
    though it is required. So, there is a tradeoff between fertilizers and pH values,
    and knowing the right proportion and when to use fertilizers appropriately would
    make things balanced. For example, in turmeric cultivation, the process of nitrification
    must not be done if pH value is less than 5. If pH goes higher than 6 then nitrification
    should be done rapidly [54]. Although some of the farmers in the local villages
    use NPK (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium), a proper study is not performed before
    using the fertilizers. Some researchers [49, 50, 55] have identified the importance
    of nitrogen in soil quality, but developing a smart solution for helping farmers
    particularly in the context of remote villages in India is still a challenging
    task to be addressed. Leaf blade analysis is one of the methods to evaluate these
    contents of crops [56]. An IoT tool kit for identification of NPK in soil was
    provided by [57]. Another widely used approach for nutrient analysis is remote
    sensing, where spectrometry comes into practice to analyze various vegetation
    indices which are calculated based on the observation of RGB of image [46]. Both
    air and ground based multispectral and hyper spectral remote sensing techniques
    are adopted in identifying spatial variations in status of nitrogen in crops to
    apply Nitrogen [47]. Other major properties of soil such as water holding capacity,
    bulk density, structure, water infiltration rate, pH, soil depth, landscape features
    and the quantity of the crop residue can also have tremendous impact on cultivation
    of crops. Soil properties like texture, salinity, presence of organic matter and
    status of nutrients may vary even within fields. Ground based sensors also works
    well for finding quality of soil. Soil pH sensor, humidity sensors, soil compaction
    sensors, soil nitrate sensors and sensors for finding soil organic matter and
    electrical conductivity helps to get unambiguous data about soil [58]. A wireless
    underground sensor system was used in precision agricultural system [59]. The
    communication range seemed to be improved by 400% compared to conventional antenna
    designs but spatiotemporal factors have effects on the communication channel.
    General methods used for finding other properties are as follows. Reflectance
    measurements over fields are used to predict equations for texture components
    of soil such as clay, sand, or silt. Regression relationships have also found
    successful to rate the presence of organic matter in soil. Soils affected by salt
    are better identified by using thermal data and L-band microwave data in analysis
    of reflectance. Another issue affecting soil quality is the use of pesticides
    [52]. Although, whether to use pesticides in cultivation is an open question for
    many decades, it is true that it affects soil quality (either positively or negatively).
    Many of the farmers use pesticides blindly without any proper guidance. In Fact,
    they are not aware of the time it is to be used and amount of the pesticides to
    be applied [58]. Knowing the right composition of soil is significant to meet
    crop goals as well as to maintain a sustainable ecosystem. Often intercropping
    of legumes pave way for increasing soil fertility and it also enhances green cover
    crops and agroforestry [60]. A sudden shift from traditional agriculture to a
    modern profit-intensive method of farming results in an increased production of
    crop residue. Mismanagement of crop residue like burning proves to bring about
    environmental hazards. But an effective management of it could increase soil efficiency.
    Differentiating crop residue and soil from imagery through reflectance method
    was quite difficult as they look similar. So, pairing of advanced indices like
    Cellulose Absorption Index and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index are used
    to discriminate soil and crop residue [58]. The exploitation of animal manure
    or crop residue is widely adopted by farmers as a measure to increase crop yield,
    it is indeed good, provided soil quality does not get tampered by the extensive
    usage of it. Hence farming is in need of adequate improvements and soil management
    is of at most importance. A large number of surveys were conducted which serves
    as a good basis of works regarding monitoring soil quality in smart agriculture
    [6, 10, 20]. The smart and miniaturized Electro chemical sensors which are able
    to detect multiple soil parameters form an effective component of smart farming
    system. Along with IoT they form a smart diagnostic system for soil quality assessment
    [59]. Remote sensing was one of the vastly used strategies to support decision
    making in agricultural systems for improving crop yield and nitrogen status monitoring,
    but it requires processing of a large amount of data and hence machine learning
    was chosen as a method for this. Chlingaryan et al. [17] reviews various machine
    learning algorithms used for different applications and suggests the following
    facts: The back-propagation neural networks work good for identifying significant
    vegetation indices. Efficiency in feature segregation and reduction of error maps
    can be best enabled with the help of CNN. Gaussian Processes are extremely useful
    to predict leaf characteristics and Least Square SVM is suggested as the most
    suitable method to calculate the amount of nitrogen in soil [17]. A fertilizer
    regulation model was implemented by the authors of AgriTalk [54] taking real time
    data about electrical conductivity, pH and soil moisture. Quadratic equations
    were formed to get the relation of NPK with electrical conductivity and were used
    as control functions and these were applied in a three-layer neural network model
    to predict yield when the input and weight of the neuron in hidden layer was provided.
    Iteration of this equation was repeated until it converged. AI mechanisms were
    also used for controlling pests based on the environment factors such as pest
    number, temperature, humidity, wind speed and so on and evolved a relationship
    between insect egg hatching period, temperature and humidity. Depending on ultraviolet
    (UV) radiolytic oxidation pest degradation rate was evaluated so as to predict
    the time for pesticide spray. So, these methods deployed an effective way which
    contributed to sustainability also. Kumar et al. [61] proposed a model which predicts
    the best suitable crop and the required fertilizers by using a linear predictive
    model and the best crop is predicted with advisory of fertilizers by analyzing
    location and area of land. It claims an accuracy of 85%. The inventions and predictions
    for agricultural sector should reach farmers on time to be fruitful. An Indian
    version of helping farmers via GSM SMS services for adopting suitable crops for
    their land was proposed in [62] using an IoT system through NodeMCU and classified
    crops for soil types using SVM. A summary of the smart soil quality monitoring
    systems in the literature is provided in Table 4 below. 3.3 Smart Weather Prediction
    System In traditional agriculture in India, the farmers are not aware of the weather
    forecasts by the authorized people. Consider the scenario where a farmer wants
    to prepare land for cultivating rice. There may be chances that rain may come
    at the end of the day, which will spoil the efforts put-forth by him for the entire
    day. Instead, if he could be informed about the chance of rain before he starts
    preparation, it would help to save energy and money. Recent studies show that
    IoT weather station modules which are deployed in the concerned environments analyse
    data with accurate results, as compared to that from metrological stations using
    GIS. For resolving much of the difficulties in planning and execution of crop
    cultivation in rural areas, a genuine weather prediction system would suffice.
    Adoghe et al. [63] harnessed solar power for working and integrated sensors and
    embedded PIC18F4520 controlling units for making the microclimate forecast. The
    measurements for making the project were obtained from anemometer, thermometer,
    resistor for denoting light and wind vane. The processed output was displayed
    on an LCD unit as well as in the form of SMS. Machine learning techniques seem
    to provide better results than the statistical methods for weather prediction.
    Radhika et al. proposed a SVM based application for weather prediction [64]. By
    considering maximum temperatures of a location for previous n days, daily maximum
    temperature is predicted using nonlinear regression methods. Chavan et al. [65],
    suggested that Neural Network-based algorithms are not feasible with IoT applications
    due Table 4 Summary of smart soil quality monitoring systems in literature Full
    size table to significant amount of energy requirements and analysed that the
    time series based and structural algorithms such as Linear Regression, Multi Linear
    Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and auto regressive Integrated
    Moving Average (ARIMA) are suitable for weather forecasting [65]. A prediction
    method was adopted by making use of Fast Fourier Transforms and Genetic algorithms
    [66]. It enabled the client to upload environmental parameters to the cloud for
    training models using an android device and the best subsets of parameters were
    obtained from the algorithm. It is followed by the application of mathematical
    transformations to get the best predictive results for weather forecasts which
    in turn can be used by growers to regulate farming practices. There is a general
    consensus among scientists that data mining models do better than traditional
    statistical methods in case of predictions. Kiran et al. [67], investigated the
    differential impact of higher order approaches of Neural networks in forecasting
    climate. Intricate structures are still completely unsolved by these artificial
    networks. Meanwhile actuation techniques which are adaptive are likely to be more
    beneficial than traditional network architectures for solving complex problems.
    So, the authors are trying to form an IoT system along with data science for predicting
    rainfall considering levels of penetration. It has conclusively been shown by
    Zhu et al. [68] that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are extremely useful for
    time series-based analysis and hence in weather predictions. The authors have
    evaluated various deep learning models, it describes about a model named NARXnet
    where attributes of weather for previous days could be used for predicting particular
    day’s climate. Another study showed that an LSTM algorithm could predict attributes
    of weather ahead up to 4 days. It was trained using samples of fifteen years.
    However, these studies suggest that recurrent networks are highly effectual for
    forecasting parameters of weather. Below listed a summary of the smart soil weather
    prediction systems in the literature (Table 5). 3.4 Smart Price Prediction System
    Despite of all advancements in this era of digitisation, still there are people
    from remote areas who do not look upon any market trends so as to know how they
    could make a profitable deal. Most of the farmers in the local villages in India
    are unable to make a profit from their crops. Some farmers use to target festival
    seasons, aiming to sell their products at higher prices. For example, Onam is
    a local festival in Kerala, state. The farmers who cultivate banana usually plans
    to sell it during the festival days. However, most of the time, they end up getting
    a lower price, even less than their cost required for cultivation, whereas the
    consumers have to pay more during such times. There are many reasons for this,
    including the huge profit taken by the intermediary people and other economic
    aspects. Crop price prediction is always a tedious task when there is a considerable
    amount of time –series data which are volatile and nonlinear. Smart agriculture
    always has its scope in improving the benefits of farmers in addition to improving
    the farming methods. It is great to ensure that using newest technologies in agriculture
    also helps farmers to sell their products in a better way and at a smart time.
    Demir [69] developed a model named AgriTrade which incorporates some features
    for soil detection and calculating the best crop suitable to be grown in a particular
    area. One of the major contributions of this research is price forecasting, so
    that farmers can wait to sell their products to get maximum profit. Machine learning
    algorithm, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to predict prices of
    a single crop. It makes use of the error rate and current value for generating
    values later. Despite the high rate of change of prices, this method provides
    accurate results. Selecting suitable crop is done by evaluating many values including
    historic features of that area and the project also provides option for incentivizing
    farmers for adopting the predicted crop cultivation according to their farmland.
    Several Price prediction mechanisms have been developed since the last few decades
    and recent studies show that integrated models of hybrid neural networks work
    better than single algorithms. When the previous work implemented price prediction
    of a single crop, Yin et al. [70] presented a STL-ATTLSTM method which combines
    an attention method on long-short term memory (LSTM) after pre-processing through
    the STL method for predicting prices of five different crops. In this model, weights
    according to significance is provided for all input variables and considers various
    factors like volume of trade, cost of the items and weather predictions to forecast
    crop prices. Basically, STL can handle seasonality to a great extent and users
    can control the rate of changes. Apart from that it is highly recommended to use
    it when there is presence of outliers. LSTM helps to solve problems based on previously
    solved steps. The attention mechanism considers the complete input sentence each
    time the output is predicted. Remainder component value method was used against
    the lag in predicting time-series data. This model performed best with an average
    MAPE of only 7%. Varun et al. [71] proposed a model which predicts agricultural
    yield, and also attempts to predict the crop prices based on prior years data
    using Naive Bayesian Algorithm, the attributes such as date, rainfall, yield,
    humidity, maximum trade, minimum trade, wind speed, nature of soil, temperature
    and sunlight are considered. Rajeswari et al. [72] used crop price dataset to
    introduce a predictive model based on Hybrid Association rule-based decision tree
    algorithm (HADT). Generation of the association rules that would result in a single
    attribute with the introduction of constraint is used in constructing the classifier.
    Table 5 Summary of smart weather prediction systems in literature Full size table
    In a further crop price prediction and forecasting system [73] using decision
    tree regression, and support vector regression algorithm, the system forecasts
    price for a year. It uses rainfall, minimum support price and cultivation costs
    as parameters for prediction. A price prediction model for vegetables with non-linear
    time series using Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) was proposed by Nasira
    et al. [74]. It used a normalization method to standardize the data and proposes
    three-layer network for weekly price prediction. It also used Levenberg–Marquardt
    algorithm over gradient decent algorithm for optimization. The study claims 89.2%
    accuracy and 10.8 MSE on the larger data set. Sabu et al. [75] predicted the monthly
    prices of Arecanut in Kerala using SARIMA. Holt-Winters Seasonal method and LSTM
    neural network were also compared to find the best suited model. Multiple linear
    regression method was used to find the missing values. Analysis says that the
    LSTM model fits the data better in predicting the monthly prices of Arecanut in
    Kerala. Accuracy of agricultural future price prediction is important for policy
    makers as well as government bodies. An Ensemble Empirical mode decomposition
    technique to decompose agricultural produce prices using SVM, NN and ARIMA models
    were presented by Fang et al. [76]. The study gave importance for unstable components
    and finds the combined model using SVM, NN and ARIMA with EEMD method is more
    suitable for such environments than using individual models. A summary of the
    smart price prediction systems in the literature is provided in Table 6 below.
    3.5 Plant Health Monitoring Plant health monitoring forms a significant factor
    in precision agriculture and smart farming. This could be done in various categories
    like evaluating vegetation indices, soil quality estimation, disease prevention
    and detection and its result would require application of various solutions like
    fertilizers, pesticides, and other mitigation techniques. Meanwhile it is highly
    recommended to keep up the notion of sustainability rather than just making profit
    or meeting crop goals. Shafi et al. [20] implemented a WSN based agricultural
    system which uses spectral images of crops to monitor plant health by evaluating
    certain vegetation indices like NDVI, GDVI and SAVI. And the authors focus on
    reducing the effect of soil reflectance when images were captured through UAV
    for remote sensing. This IoT based system offered prolonged lifetime for proper
    communication facilities. Master nodes get data from slave nodes with the help
    of NRF module and transmit data to the back-end server using GSM technology. Alerts
    were generated and made useful to end users with the help of web and mobile services.
    Authors have also listed several kinds of sensors such as soil moisture sensors,
    Hydra Probe II soil sensor, EC sensor, pogo sensor(portable), temperature sensors,
    leaf wetness sensors, hydrogen, chlorophyll, photosynthesis sensors, Compact weather
    sensor, Met Station One, humidity and hand-held photosynthesis sensors. In addition
    to this, a beginner would get an overall idea of several network technologies,
    UAV methods along with a comparison of existing PA techniques. Kamruzzaman et
    al. [77] proposed a system for promoting greenness using IoT and Cloud storage.
    Data was analyzed based on ARIMA algorithm and predicted values analyzing soil
    and air quality. Data was gathered from four different locations and utilized
    MySQL and Web interface for analysis and processing. Solar energy was also harnessed
    in the system. By monitoring more than eight features and analyzing them, the
    system enabled monitoring plant health as well as soil and air quality and claims
    an accuracy of 99.13%. Plant disease detection methods are one of the major contributions
    to the agriculture world. Sarangdhar et al. [78], addressed detection of certain
    diseases in cotton and it has an accuracy of 83.26%. This system encompasses an
    IoT based system where collected data from several sensors and machine learning
    were used to detect disease categories. SVM was used with nonlinear Gaussian kernel
    to find the best hyperplane. The field work was assisted by a robotic assembly
    to collect data from different spots and the system also provided android application
    for efficient usage. The detection and management of fungal disease finds its
    relevance in monitoring the health of any crops and preventing them by proper
    prediction mechanisms is a smart way to improve agricultural efficiency. An IoT
    system for sending required real-time data to the cloud using hardware programmed
    in C and writing API which made use of Google maps to access location of the sensors
    was presented in [79]. Wi-Fi module was implemented to send data to the cloud
    which in turn was pre-processed and analyzed by SVMr which proves to be highly
    optimal in predicting short-term environmental conditions more than that done
    by other methods like Random Forests, Ridge regression and an ensemble regression
    method. Thus, by predicting environmental conditions, the chance for spreading
    of fungal spores can be understood by the users. Even though it has error rates
    up to 2%, the model could be made more accurate by enabling more data sets for
    training and use. AgriPrediction [80], is a medium range wireless IoT system to
    predict crop dysfunctions and helping farmers to take proactive measures was implemented.
    It made use of LoRa technology to implement the prototype and ARIMA was used for
    prediction model. Energy consumption was evaluated in a real field providing solar
    energy for working. The growth of Arugala crop was analyzed by using this system
    and it finds plausible. Table 6 Summary of smart price prediction systems in literature
    Full size table A myriad of IoT systems utilizing the technologies for particular
    areas of agriculture are discussed so far. Some works incorporating holistic requirements
    of farms are presented now. A smart agriculture system which can accommodate many
    IoT devices to provide automatic correlation of data for analysis of crop performance
    and its recommendations using the features of semantic web principles was presented
    in the year 2016 [81]. Its features also included calculating crop performance
    and forecasts and storing the data in cloud. It allows a ‘bring-your-own’ IoT
    sensor principle and enhances scalable data analytics which allows anyone to analyze
    data regarding plant performance with the help of a web-based laboratory. The
    framework made use of a particular application which helps to identify and analyze
    plant properties and features according to the inputs provided for it. The data
    from IoT devices was annotated in resource description framework formats using
    linked data and Semantic Sensor Ontology (SSN) to process information by computers.
    The sensor discovery functions enable matching and reasoning methods using the
    Scheduler and Service Delivery and Utility Manager of OpenIoT. This paper greatly
    addressed challenges in making up of a large scale IoT system. Adesipo et al.
    [82], shares the idea of a smart village project by automating agriculture through
    feasible solutions for alleviating losses in farming meanwhile monitoring for
    diseases and multiplying crop production. A cost-effective method to increase
    productivity of crops by using IoT in farming was implemented by Dong et al. [83].
    It made use of WSN for collecting data from three different locations and then
    a decision was made in web-based storage by using association rules to find the
    relationship between values so as to predict and control the required amount of
    humidity and water to optimize crop production. It also implemented an irrigation
    system which is able to work both automatically and manually. A summary of plant
    health monitoring systems in the literature is provided in Table 7 below. Table
    7 Summary of plant health monitoring systems in literature Full size table 4 Reference
    Architecture for Smart Agriculture Applications Billions of devices are being
    inherently connected in IoT systems and it is estimated to be 75Billion by 2025
    [84]. So, there is always a need for reference architecture to ensure scalability.
    According to ITU_T recommendation, architecture [85] of an IoT system consists
    of Application Layer, Service support and Application Support layer, Network Layer
    and the device and gateway capabilities making the Device layer. All these layers
    have management capabilities and should also ensure security concerns [86]. The
    application layer might consist of vendor’s dashboards where sensing of operations
    as well as the monitoring of different tasks occur. The second layer includes
    the web services and Cloud data management features used by the end users and
    analysts. The network layer encompasses a myriad of wired and wireless interfaces
    that connect to machines and sensors with the cloud and the device layer includes
    capabilities for the sensors and actuators. The terminals on the machines at operational
    side might process data and would work as a gateway itself [87]. Reference architecture
    provided by Fremantle [88] consists of several layers such as Client/external
    communications layer, Event processing and analytics layer, Aggregation/bus layer,
    relevant transports layer and the layer for devices. Also, it specifies cross
    cutting layers of Device management and Identity and Access management. Among
    the lightweight protocols, MQTT and CoAP are the suggested protocols for IoT systems.
    HTTP and web sockets are costly in terms of space and power usage. Aggregation/Bus
    layer has main duties to support, aggregate and combine communications via different
    devices and gateways and it also ensures the bridging and transformation between
    different protocols and adapting into legacy ones. It also does two security functions
    like validating brokers and resource access scopes along with policy enforcement.
    Various functions of different layers of the reference architecture are shown
    in the Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Functions of reference layers Full size image 5 Technologies
    Used in Smart Agriculture Applications Nowadays, IoT systems are adopted in almost
    every major field such as acquiring data about Weather, Environment, processes,
    positions, and images and much more. Data transmissions could be enabled using
    WSN, M2M, GSM, SDN etc. Usually, data storage is made possible through database
    engines, cluster management and Data processing engines with the help of Data
    ingest APIs and Big data APIs. The next stage of Analysis is done through various
    elements of Data APIs, R engine, Octave/MATLAB, Python, SciPy and other Google
    Applications. Finally, Actions are augmented at the prototyping testbeds with
    the help of Real-time messaging, Web/mobile applications and dashboards. Implementation
    perspectives of an IoT based system was presented by Popovic et al. [8] which
    shows high level use cases, system components implementation details and prototyping
    with respect to precision agriculture. It also depicts how a private cloud can
    be used to enable an efficient IoT system. A beginner can go through this paper
    to get an overall picture of how things are getting implemented in an IoT based
    system. The following paragraphs shows the technologies studied [11] by various
    researchers. A typical agricultural IoT network [7] follows an architecture in
    layers comprises of the physical and MAC Layer, Adaptation Layer, Transport Layer,
    Network Layer and Application layer. In application layer, among the protocols
    like AMQP, CoAP, MQTT and HTTP, MQTT is the most efficient one in terms of bandwidth
    and power consumption. The aggregation of agricultural information forms an indispensable
    task of the transport layers. Both TCP and UDP protocols can be chosen according
    to the requirements. The transmission of information at the application layer
    is done by the network layer. Apart from IPV4 and IPV6, RPL is also regarded while
    using 6LoWPAN. The Adaptation layer has to implement interoperability, fragmentation
    and reassembly techniques. Among these technologies, the most commonly utilized
    ones in the device layer are Wireless sensor networks and Near field Communications.
    The most common wireless communication technologies in use are Cellular (GSM,
    3G, 4G), 6LoWPAN, ZigBee (widely used for precision agriculture applications and
    is based on 802.15.4 standard), BLE (Bluetooth smart Technology), RFID, Wi-Fi
    and Lora WAN (operating on LoRa network) [20]. 6LoWPAN was a competitor to ZigBee,
    by merging the abilities of Low Power Wireless Personal Area Network technologies
    [89, 90] such as LoRa (Long Range), Sigfox and Weightless. Wireless Embedded internet
    is made possible by 6LoWPAN which also has favorable properties like open standards,
    better integration into internet and scalable data transmission [89]. As long
    as IoT systems are considered, constraints of low power, low-bandwidth and low
    memory are always crucial, and these abilities are featured by the 6LoWPAN to
    use IPV6 protocol. But methods to run it are a few and there are various other
    challenges associated with it. Many applications of IPV6 and 6LoWPAN in communication
    and network layers are facilitated by various protocols such as 802.15.4 for wireless
    standards, ZigBee, Sigfox etc. to communicate with each other or to gateway through
    which data are usually forwarded to a remote storage place [7]. Nowadays IoT systems
    and WSN relay on LoRa Technology and Lora WAN (proposed MAC for LoRa even though
    its physical layer may work with any MAC layer) as they promise long range services
    [91, 92]. These technologies can be deployed in wide geographic area to collect
    sensor data. LoRa is a wireless WAN which can communicate up to 30 km [80] utilizes
    minimal energy and has modest data rates up to 50kbps per channel. Other emergent
    LPWAN communication technologies such as Sigfox, LTE-M and Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT),
    working in the spectrum between that of cellular networks and short-range transmission
    are also suitable for some IoT solutions [93]. Sigfox is an energy efficient and
    adequate technique for low-capacity message applications. NB-IoT and LTE-M could
    be deployed by M2M and IoT solutions, but they need a public infrastructure for
    communication which could be rarely met in rural areas. Among these, the low power
    NB-IoT makes sense due to economic benefit, energy efficiency and efficient use
    of spectrum, even the ‘guard bands’ of LTE not making any issues of interference.
    Along with the aging of 2G, smaller size of NB-IoT devices and its reach and coverage
    even underground or inside buildings makes it very promising technology [94].
    In order to achieve optimization in communications, resources and processes, it
    is prevailing to use non-IP protocol stacks for machine-to-machine operations
    which could be either adopted in Adaptation layers or to implement whole communication
    stack or for both [92]. Except for TDMA operations, ZigBee provides full communication
    stack at low power consumption rate for WSN. Another Non-IP based solution is
    BLE, which provides ten times higher range than the normal Bluetooth. When Z-Wave
    (ZigBee like mesh Technology) [89] integrates solutions majorly for home applications
    [95], EPCglobal gives a better solution for UHF RFID machines. An emerging network,
    MIOTY, based on the ETSI TS 103 357 specifications is also a solution for providing
    a low power wide area network [96]. Majority of the systems in agricultural IoT
    make use of wireless systems in fields. Temperatures and humidity would affect
    the radio wave propagations and hence choosing nodes, distances among them, antenna
    height and frequency at which they are enabled should be done in such a way that
    their working will not be tampered while using wireless transceivers [11]. 5.1
    Studies About Improving WSN Wireless sensor technologies are widely used by researchers
    in the area of agriculture. A usual WSN consists of a low power microcontroller
    module, sensor modules and an RF communication module. But when there are a large
    number of distributed sensor nodes over a large area memory capacity, transmission
    energy and processing power is always a matter of consideration. Power dissipation
    of nodes in WSNs has to be considered. Various methods have been presented for
    improving network lifetime such as reducing overhead by using Small Overhead Routing
    Protocol, implementing Cooperative routing with the help of a relay node and deploying
    ad-hoc which autonomously organize clusters [97, 98]. Some algorithms presented
    for improving data transmission efficiency uses approaches like predicting cluster
    head for a dynamic clustering, distributed uniform clustering algorithm and a
    tree-cluster based data gathering algorithm [99, 100]. In these approaches the
    WSN was divided into various clusters, and they had a head node and most of the
    time nodes went to sleep mode in order to provide a prolonged lifetime. Another
    approach was a low energy adaptive clustering where random rotation of role of
    cluster heads was implemented in order to balance energy consumption [101]. A
    significant improvement to this method was seen when the process of cluster head
    selection was centralized [102]. A solution by decreasing distance between communicating
    nodes and hence improving network lifetime was sorted out using a fuzzy decision-making
    k-means technique for finding optimal cluster head and it improved energy efficiency
    [103]. Most of the works were done as simulations. For large sized farming land,
    a framework was presented which used an optimal decision function for selecting
    accurate cluster heads [104]. It increased successful ratio of packets and computed
    wireless signal strength. This work also considered about data security by adopting
    secret keys using the linear congruential generator while memory and processing
    time requirements were optimized. The optimization function was calculated based
    on SNR and the distance to base station. 5.2 Addressing Connectivity Issues From
    the literature it is evident that there have been very few papers dealing with
    IoT systems for rural areas. The lack of network connectivity often remains as
    a problem for deploying of the systems in remote areas. There are situations when
    communication encounters disruptions and delays. However, researchers suggest
    opportunistic techniques as one of the methods to deal with connectivity problems
    in agricultural domain. Touseau et al. [105] presented opportunistic computing
    and Web of things in Smart Agriculture to improve agricultural methods. In order
    to balance the lack of semantic and logical descriptions, Web of Things (WoT)
    is presented as a better solution. ASAWoO, a WoT platform that enables opportunistic
    networking, make use of REST services and provides logical extensions through
    which physical objects could be controlled and coordinated. It is able to be deployed
    on objects, gateways or in cloud infrastructure. The devices involved in agriculture,
    when they lack connectivity or undergoes power failure, are likely to fall in
    the category of D-MANET and hence Delay Tolerant Networks could provide a solution
    for this. The experiment shows that it can compensate for poor network infrastructures.
    Kulatunga et al. [106] presented a delay-tolerant networking system for data mulling
    from grazing fields to a gateway node which enables fog computing. They used ANT+
    for a wide terrain without a network infrastructure and offered a DTN integrated
    data dissemination method by using Data Mulling Cows algorithm. 6 Recent Technologies
    Used Along with IoT in Smart Agriculture IoT as a mainstream technology uses various
    other technologies for efficient working [11]. Technologies of cloud computing
    and fog computing is being used to access sufficient resources to analyse, store
    and retrieve extreme abundance of data involved and used. Big Data is being used
    to manage and analyse data to make sufficient predictions, automate processes
    and make tremendous improvements. Along with IoT, Big data analysis has been gaining
    a significant role in Agriculture. There is huge scope of IoT systems combining
    analytics for the betterment of aspects in life. And in agribusiness, its scope
    ranges from crop production to food supply chain [14]. Several tools and methods
    are adopted for various problems in the agricultural industry based on three dimensions
    of Big Data—volume, velocity and variety [107]. In the recent years, AI and ML
    has crept as major solutions for agriculture [22] such as forecasting crop production
    [29], plant disorder identification [10], crop management including nutrient response
    and seed rate management using CNN [108] and so on. Now researchers are incorporating
    Artificial Intelligence upon Internet of things so as to take decisions and actions
    without any human intervention [21]. Linet al. [109], proposed a solution, AItalk
    which implements AI within network applications in existing IoT framework and
    forming like a cyber IoT device. AI application is being distributed as connected
    modules and hence making it simplified where supervised ML solves IoT problems
    when features are obtained from sensors and remote controllers are deployed as
    labels. Prediction time is not more than 2 ms and Communication overhead is less
    than 30 ms. Machine learning techniques have put forth numerous solutions in agriculture
    data sets and practices. A Scientific study comparing various algorithms for designing
    of tasks ranging from forecasting of harvests to correction and construction of
    wrong sensor data were analyzed by Balducci et al. [18]. Various tasks that can
    be achieved by using ML techniques and designing them were explicitly described
    and experimentally evaluated in that work. Liakos et al. [10], conducted an excellent
    review and illustrates about the solutions provided by ML in the production sector.
    The authors have classified the utilization of ML in farming data into certain
    clusters and finds practicing of ML techniques in crop management as 61%, 20%
    of techniques for yield prediction, 22% for disease detection,10% works in water
    management and another 10% of ML techniques applied in soil management. Authors
    find that SVM and ANN are the mostly adapted techniques in ML. In the yield prediction
    section, most of the works focused on sketching production, evaluation of profit,
    monitoring demand and supply and efforts for improving yield, etc. Ramos et al.
    [110] found a solution for counting automatically the coffee fruits on branch
    based on machine vision techniques. The basic idea is to capture the image of
    the coffee tree and classify and detect the fruits focusing the image processing
    techniques. Built on the information of the number of fruits, linear estimation
    was applied to sort fruits into harvestable or not. The authors have claimed that
    the proposed system achieves correlation accuracy more than 90 percent in the
    early stages of coffee development. Avendano et al. [111] also worked in the similar
    domain. They have classified the different plant parts and stages of fruits from
    the branches of coffee with help of SVM classifier. Authors claim that their method
    achieves 82% precision and 79% recall for the classification. Peng et al. [112]
    studied and found a similar system of flowering events of coffee using image segmentation
    techniques and SVM classifier. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 84
    percentage (Recall), 74 percentage (Precision). Tellaeche et al. [113] presented
    a decision support system with classification using Fuzzy k-means algorithm feeding
    to Bayesian classifier. Meyer et al. [114] used fuzzy clusters to classify regions
    and plants. Klompenburg et al. [29] summarizes the evaluation matrices for ML
    algorithms. As AI and IoT have progressively emerged in several applications and
    are together called as AIoT, the huge data volume requires innovative architecture
    to handle them. The basic three models when incorporating AI and ML in IoT are
    the Abstracted AI, Centralized AI Approach and Edge approach [14, 115, 116]. The
    two solutions for processing the massive influx of collected data from IoT devices
    are edge Computing and Fog computing which are effectively having same functionalities
    of driving components and brilliance to analysis platforms, which are placed at,
    or near to, the origin place of data rather than carrying everything to the cloud.
    Fog computing moves the processing in fog nodes or IoT gateway that are situated
    near or into hardware of LAN while in edge computing, processing happens on sensors
    or very close to sensors [117]. Edge computing techniques can enable machine learning
    models on hardware so as to solve the low performance problems in IoT systems.
    The post cloud approach can be used to improve latency and jitter is by using
    Edge computing. Debauche et al. [117] proposed a new architecture to implement
    micro services deployed on nodes including Nvidia Jetson Nano and Odroid N2 at
    edge level adapting AI methods. Cloud servers host ontology repository, Semantic
    reasoner, MQTT Broker and containers orchestrator, trained neural networks and
    ETL (Extraction Transformation Load). The edge micro-cluster hosts MQTT client,
    Semantic reasoned, Tiny Neural Networks to predict events, Micro services to validate,
    compress and cure data and the container engine, and the data collection is achieved
    by IoT nodes. No significant improvement was found in Nano compared with TeslaP100.
    Capra et al. [118] details of the architecture of Edge based server and computation.
    The authors foresee the development of Edge computing requires variety of innovative
    solutions in IoT devices hardware and software needs. Software defined network
    turns out to be a recently incorporated concept where a network programmer can
    dynamically manage and control the work behavior through interfaces whether simulation
    or real-time environments. The availability of IoT devices and the responses from
    data Center networks determines the ability of SDN [119]. Data centers are industrial
    infrastructure for dynamic computing and storage. The Data Center Network has
    to manage enormous number of elements in network and need to achieve auto configuration,
    resource allocation and security, and manage energy consumption. 7 Miscellaneous
    Issues Some factors need to be considered while implementing an IoT system which
    can go a long way is mentioned in this section. 7.1 Interoperability One of the
    main goals of any IoT ecosystems is achieving interoperability between systems
    and components. The need for interoperability of heterogeneous components fostered
    innovation of appropriate tools such as middleware mechanisms for combining cloud
    computing with generic networks and service-oriented architectures. Advancing
    research finds various conceptual levels of interoperability [120], which are
    as follows. Technical Interoperability deals with communication protocols and
    its required infrastructure. Syntactic level is associated with encodings and
    formats of data. Semantic level enables understanding of information exchanged
    through the system. Efficiency of organisations to communicate information across
    various systems is what is coined as organisational interoperability. A good note
    about IoT gateways was done by Nobrega et al. [93]. A summary of research carried
    out in academic as well as commercial sector for achieving standardisation and
    advancements for providing interoperable gateways turn out to be indicated in
    Table 8. Table 8 Summary of providing solutions of IoT gateways Full size table
    7.2 Security Although there is no standardised and unified version of IoT, many
    solutions are being implemented in agricultural systems [136]. In general, the
    security requirements of a system are authentication, confidentiality, integrity,
    data privacy, availability of services and authorization and accounting. Blockchain
    technology is been widely accepted as a measure to provide security in IoT systems
    and one of such paradigm was projected by Devi et al. [137]. In addition to this,
    the architecture incorporating security was presented for agricultural systems.
    In an IoT system, threats could be there in form of physical attacks, Impersonation,
    Denial of Service, Routing besets, stakes in data transmission and applying malefic
    code [138]. Trust management works as a wonderful property for providing some
    security aspects as in case of web-based collaborative platforms. Apart from that
    Built-in Security of devices and building add-on securities to those of securities
    provided in traditional computer systems has to be involved. Cryptographic techniques,
    light weight algorithms, Encryption algorithms, Black network solution, TLS, Secure
    MQTT solution, Lithe solution, protocols like WAP2, IPsec, SEND, Compressed IPsec
    and DTLS are some of the methods adopted for providing security in various levels
    of IoT models. A further method was proposed to identify the anomalies in an IoT
    system adopting the help of machine learning [139]. Neural networks were trained
    to detect unsound data points in the system. R programming was used to develop
    an artificial neural network system for prognosis of harmful nodes. The model
    was leveled at normal operations from devices and sensors of the system. They
    used a 5-layer neural network and the testing showed that their system proved
    to be scalable by having an accuracy of 99%. Hence this method is also useful
    in IoT gateways to offer security. 7.3 Threats A major threat in remote areas
    is the encounter of wild animals. Sometimes it becomes alarming to crop, people
    and systems implemented in plantations. Most remote areas of India have got to
    address these issues either due to wild animals or rodents. There must be effective
    measures against attack of these threats. Giordano et al. [140] implemented a
    Repeller systems which produces ultrasound (using Infrared sensors and solar power),
    when an animal is detected. The system was made using RIOT operating system along
    with the support of 6LoWPAN, RPL, IPV6, CoAP, IEEE 802.15.4 and UDP. A wildlife
    monitoring system was proposed using LoRa for connectivity and Opportunistic sensing
    with the help of BLE. It assumes that the wild animals are enabled with in-built
    sensors. The pre-processing of data was designed to be done locally among nodes
    and collaborative decision making was done. The system promises coverage of large
    area along with high network lifetime and throughput [141]. 8 Current Improvements
    in Indian Farming Scenario Farmers have very slowly started to adopt developments
    of Industry 4.0 revolution and there are various companies in India providing
    IoT solutions to farmers. Many firms have started using IoT and associated emerging
    technologies in a linear phase in farming sector alongside the inventions of miniaturised
    sensors, Machine Learning and data analytics. The blockchain technology is also
    used for a better supply chain management in India. Tech giants like Microsoft,
    IBM and Cisco are providing emerging technologies to Indian agriculture sector.
    Microsoft deployed a sowing app in Andhra Pradesh which brought about 30% increase
    crop yield on an average per hector. Cisco has developed an IoT Platform for monitoring
    environmental factors and enables supporting services to aquaculture sector in
    Kerala [142]. The Indian government has provided Kisan Suvidha, an android app
    for free which aims at assisting growers with required weather data of consecutive
    five days, market prices, dealers, and plant protection. Meanwhile ISRO offers
    Bhuvan, a platform for helping agricultural sector with weather predictions and
    pest monitoring [143]. The information obtained from available resources will
    be effective only if the growers embrace technology and by the digitalization
    of farmlands for which reliable connectivity is a crucial requisite. IoT, Remote
    sensing and 3D scanning is widely being utilized by several start-ups to build
    crop metrics over large area. In the meantime, some companies have also seen an
    exceptional rise in the use of its mobile and web-based applications by farmers
    due to limitations in workforce due to the pandemic [144]. SenseGrass, has developed
    as an IoT sensor collecting 18 parameters to monitor plant health [145]. The device
    is plug and play and it do not require any technician for setup like other IoT
    offerings. The hardware is required to be inserted in the land and turned on.
    This device works on the cellular network and does not require Wi-Fi. Onebasket,
    a start-up based in Hyderabad, ensures traceability and standardization of agricultural
    produce modernizing the Agri supply chains in such a way that farmers can directly
    reach consumers [146]. Aqua Connect is an aquaculture start-up which assists shrimp
    farmers to improve yield through maintaining water quality and shrimp health by
    utilizing AI and remote sensing techniques [147]. E-commerce firms has been spurring
    for various marketing assistance like e-SANTA, which connects aqua farmers and
    the buyers, enabling farmers to get a better price and vendors could directly
    purchase quality products [148]. Opencube Labs based in Bangalore, has built a
    handy device which aids monitoring agricultural features and calculates NVDI for
    crop health monitoring. AgNext has data harvesting techniques by combining features
    of ML, AI and IoT making better predictions and attends to customize solutions
    to crops. Along with the computer vision technology the quality of commodities
    is assessed with higher accuracy levels in no time [149]. Apart from these, a
    lot of start-ups have sprung up with solutions of smart watering system which
    are usually GSM-based and allows controlling the schedules remotely. End users
    are reported when systems are triggered. Most of these use Wi-Fi or GSM for communication.
    Various success stories have been reported across the country and majority of
    them are indoor and protected environment farming systems. But one of those third-generation
    farmers of India, from Bihar, having 60 acres of land using micro-irrigation drips
    and sprinklers, and 35 acres are fully automated [150]. The control room serves
    to irrigate and monitor farm activities. The tanks supply fertilizers and pesticides.
    The input given decides when to irrigate how much fertilizer and other supplements
    have to be mixed. A wireless broadband Internet allows the irrigation system to
    be controlled from anywhere across the world through a mobile or laptop. The CCTV
    cameras help monitoring the farm. However, all of these technologies are majorly
    adopted by the generation Z or those people who are influenced by technological
    inventions. Most of growers who are millennials and people in rural areas are
    still continuing with the traditional methods of farming. Moreover, the numbers
    of people who can afford the capital investments to migrate to smart agriculture
    are few in number. Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers welfare of India have launched
    a mechanization mission to increase production and enable rapid field work at
    appropriate time. It aims at providing various training and demonstration of machinery
    to promote farm modernization. Financial assistance for implementing mechanization,
    provision of hiring centres and monetary assistance for hiring machinery for marginal
    farmers are the strategies of the mission. Post-harvest technology is also associated
    with this effort. ICAR institutions and other institutions identified by the states
    are the agencies for implementing the components [151]. Ministry had launched
    other schemes also such as NMSA to promote better farming practices, PMFBY merges
    crop insurance plans, PMKSY for efficient irrigation activities, PKVY for fostering
    organic farming, Funding schemes for encouraging Micro irrigation systems etc.
    In the motive of making ‘One Market’ for whole India, e-NAM is a digital assistance
    that connect mandis in an online marketing portal for marketing agricultural produce
    and in turn effectively decreases dealing costs, bridges asymmetries in information
    and helps market expansion connecting more than 18 states and union Territories
    of India. Other provisions like Kisan Credit Cards which helps to credit for expenditures
    and soil health card to resolve nutrient deficiencies are present. PM-Kusum is
    a scheme promoting use of solar and other renewable energy sources [152, 153].
    9 Proposed Architecture for Smart Agriculture Although, there are various applications
    and research works developed and published in the area of smart agriculture system
    using IoT concepts, we strongly believed that developing a smart agriculture system
    for helping farmers in remote villages still have scope for improvement and customization.
    Providing a real-time monitoring system on the field will help monitoring processes
    along with improvements in yield. The solicited architecture is illustrated by
    the Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Architecture for smart agriculture Full size image Monitoring
    soil quality is another important requirement for the healthy growth of the plants
    and to know the NPK (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) composition of the soil. Normally
    soil testing rematerializes the nutrient inadequacies, which may help to focus
    the precise needs of plants. Mineral deficiencies are accompanied by certain symptoms,
    some of which may be perspicuous whereas others much ambiguous. However, providing
    a real-time monitoring of the soil quality will help to maximize yield, reduce
    disease, and optimize resources. In many cases, a farmer''s upturn relies on the
    standards of the produce, which subsequently clings to the plant health. Hence,
    detection of disease plays an instrumental part in agriculture. In order to identify
    plant diseases at an early phase, use of automated diagnostics is advantageous.
    The distinct symptoms can be identified from different plant parts using an automated
    system employing the image processing techniques. It is also helpful to take proactive
    measures in case of forecasting chance of certain diseases. In the subsequent
    subsections, we will discuss some part of the proposed architecture, we have implemented
    such as smart irrigation and price prediction. 9.1 Prototype for Smart Irrigation
    Technique Smart irrigation is an efficient solution for problems faced in traditional
    irrigation. It reduces cost of production by reducing labour charges. We can schedule
    the watering and allow the process to go on until soil moisture reaches a particular
    threshold. Irrigation can be automated depending on the rate of evaporation, moisture
    in the soil, water consumption by plants, weather conditions etc. It could be
    able to extract the information about the predicted weather from internet and
    make changes accordingly. A huge portion of water in India is turning to account
    on agricultural usage [154]. By using Smart irrigation, the wastage of water can
    be reduced which saves both water and money of the farmer. In this study, we have
    developed a prototype of smart irrigation system for remote villages. Apart from
    preserving the water, the proposed prototype can reduce the manual efforts for
    manual monitoring of the field conditions thereby saving the time and effort.
    The prototype developed is based on microcontroller and sensors are deployed to
    monitor the soil temperature and moisture. The deployed sensors will send the
    information to the microcontroller which is used for estimating the required water
    content. We have used ATMEGA328P microcontroller on the Arduino Uno platform for
    developing the prototype for smart irrigation system. The collected data is connected
    to the Internet using GSM-GPRS SIM900A modem, which allows the farmer to constantly
    monitor whether sprinklers in the field are on or off. As we mentioned earlier,
    we have used soil moisture sensor and soil temperature sensor as part of the prototype.
    The moisture sensor is used to determine the amount of volumetric water (moisture)
    in the soil. A threshold value is also set to compare the soil moisture value.
    We have also used the temperature (humidity) sensor to determine the temperature
    and relative humidity of the surrounding air. A rain sensor is also used to detect
    the rainfall. The proposed prototype is shown in Fig. 5. The automated drip irrigation
    system is managed by ARM9 processor. This will help to automatically turn on and
    off the valves of the sprinklers based on the information collected by the sensors.
    Fig. 5 Components of the prototype Full size image 9.2 Smart Prediction System
    As we discussed in Sect. 3.4, developing smart price prediction models will help
    the farmers to take appropriate decisions to sell their products in order to avoid
    the losses occurred in the current fluctuating market scenarios. Machine learning
    techniques are used as part of the price prediction models. As part of this research,
    we have developed two price prediction models; one is based on cotton and other
    is cardamom as crops. In this section, we will discuss about each of them. 9.2.1
    Price Prediction for Cotton As part of developing the price prediction model for
    cotton, we have collected the price and volume of cotton over seven years from
    Adoni market in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The data includes the
    price and volume of transactions from 2011 to 2017. The data about cotton daily
    prices is collected from a government operated portal called as Agmarket and the
    dataset consists of 5 columns and 1789 rows which covers the price (daily) and
    volume of 7 years. The purpose of the study is to develop a price prediction system,
    which helps the farmers (cotton) about the future prices based on historical data
    and planning their cultivation activities more precisely and efficiently. We performed
    a yearly analysis (Fig. 6) for prices with volume (quantity arrivals) and found
    that there is not much difference in price movement daily and visible aberration
    in the continuous daily data has led to further analysis to find the accurate
    relationship between price and volume trends. Fig. 6 Analysis of daily prices
    of cotton along with volume Full size image The ARIMA model [155] is used as the
    machine learning technique for price prediction. ARIMA, which is one of the most
    used models for forecasting time series data. In general, ARIMA (p, d, q) model
    uses three parameters, in which. p is the lag order which is the number of lag
    observations in the model, d is the degree of differencing and q is the order
    of moving average or the size of moving average window. Normally, ARIMA (0, 1,
    0) calculates non-seasonal difference and ARIMA (1, 1, 0) is used for weather-based
    predictions on autocorrelation of past values of the same time series. In our
    case, ARIMA (5, 1, 0) used means we have taken lag order for autoregression as
    5, and to make the time series stationary we have taken degree of differencing
    as 1. And a moving average window of size 0 is used in our model. With the help
    of ARIMA model, we predicted the price of cotton and the Fig. 7, shows the comparison
    between predicted (represented using red) and expected values (represented using
    blue). To validate the results, we have used RMSE score which is a measure to
    find the difference between expected and predicted value. The value of RMSE is
    253.74 and 163.023 for volume and price respectively. Fig. 7 Comparison of predicted
    and expected values Full size image 9.2.2 Price Prediction for Cardamom As part
    of this research, we developed a price prediction model for the spice cardamom.
    We collected the data over the period of nearly 40 years from the official website
    of the Spices Board of India from 1980 to 2019. We have used machine learning
    techniques for prediction of the prices of cardamom and to help the farmers (cardamom)
    to take better decisions to plan the cultivation and harvesting activities. The
    dataset contains the data as part of volume of cardamom auctioned at cardamom
    auction center of Cochin Spices Board. The above Fig. 8, shows the variation of
    prices over the course of 40 years. From the figure, we can analyze that there
    is a substantial difference in the price of the cardamom over years and it is
    not stable as well. Because of the irregularities in the continuous year’s data,
    we have proposed an ensemble-based price prediction model with two layers. In
    the first layer, we divided the dataset into clusters using Wald hierarchical
    clustering algorithms. In the second layer, we used ARIMA model over the clustered
    data for predicting the prices (Fig. 9). To validate the results, we have used
    RMSE and R2score and got a value of 263 and 0.09 respectively. Fig. 8 Analysis

    ARIMA model Full size image 10 Open Problems In the previous sections, we have
    described a comprehensive study on the smart agriculture, and we have identified
    that, there exists a plethora of projects for smart agriculture across the world.
    Apart from these, various projects have been declared by governing bodies for
    reaching to farmers on ground. Some of the major challenges and open problems
    are listed in this Section for the benefit of future researchers working in this
    domain. Lack of Connectivity: One of the major obstacles in getting the benefits
    of inventions and beneficial schemes is due to the lack of connectivity in remote
    as well as rural areas [156]. There must be more robust and consistent technologies
    [10] to meet the challenges and requirements of remote environments and rural
    farmers so that a proper connectivity can be established in a way such that farmers
    can deploy IoT systems. Awareness for farmers: Various subsidies, loans, insurance
    schemes and other benefits are available for farmers from government bodies to
    foster agriculture as well as to support in case of natural calamities [152].
    But most of the farmers are unaware about the schemes. Another aspect of connectivity
    is to ensure efficient methods for making benefits reach farmers along with the
    developed technical systems. Integration of crop market directly to farmer: Foremost
    requirement of any farmer is to get maximum price for their products. But usually,
    the profit in agricultural sector goes to the brokers, dealers and retailers.
    If a systematic guidance to planters about kind of crops, required fertilizers
    for optimal yield and market prices along with a support price can be provided,
    it would definitely help the farming community. Integrating crops supply chain
    with the international supply chain to process quality food, providing timely
    support and complete automation in agriculture with the help of robots would help
    growers level up according to the market trends [107]. Tremendous possibility
    of online farmer shops is also to be fostered along with such applications. Newer
    platforms and utilization of Cloud: Literature reveals that there is a huge dependency
    on WSN in adopting smart agriculture. Finding innovative network platforms and
    protocols is always welcomed in case of IoT. It has been proposed that future
    works would have to completely utilize the Cloud Technology and innovative approaches
    in connectivity have to come up so as to be bettered by the real potential of
    IoT systems [157] and to manage data effectively. Large scale drought/flood monitoring
    systems: There are various means of predicting and forecasting temperatures in
    regional scales. In a wider perspective it might be extremely useful if a prediction
    about drought or floods could help farmers to plan crop cultivation accordingly
    and so that proactive risk management measures can also be adopted. Regional monitoring
    systems would need the association of local authorities and researchers. Semantic
    interoperability: Incorporating the high-end technologies in the traditional productive
    agricultural sector calls for semantic interoperability [11] so that the farmers
    and agriculturist would find easy to understand and use heterogeneous products
    from different manufacturers. Newer methods of semantic annotation increasing
    overall efficiency of IoT systems are always welcomed. Open farm management: Precision
    agriculture and protected agriculture are flourishing a lot. There are still immense
    possibilities with large farm management which has not been widely adopted in
    India. Open farming systems with specific applications for computer aided, remotely
    monitored, advisory and decision support services for all sorts of crops in diverse
    farming community of India is a necessity to keep updated with the new era of
    digitization. Regionally pooled scientific data and advice would enhance research
    activities [14] and thus agricultural productivity. Knowledge-based agriculture:
    As a means to increase the amount and worth of the produce, knowledge-based agriculture
    has to be followed. It opens enormous possibilities of integration of automated
    data augmentation and analytics with the application of ML techniques [10] and
    Decision support systems. Hence more optimized and targeted applications for smart
    agricultural tasks have to be made up. Fusion: The combination of ML techniques
    and signal processing schemes can be integrated into hybrid systems so as to add
    up functionalities utilizing strengths and compensating flaws of individual systems
    [17]. Development of large open-source databases will also enhance progress in
    agricultural sector. Shi et al. [6] suggests that impactful cloud-based models,
    Big Data mining technologies for agriculture, algorithms enhancing fusion of data
    from multiple sources, distributed and intelligent processing and innovative lite
    versions of authentication mechanisms would pave the future headway. Data precision:
    As large amount of data is in the form of spectral images, the fluctuations in
    environmental conditions like rain and humidity affects these data. So innovative
    techniques for atmospheric correction and noise interpolation is an open problem
    for research [20]. Interoperability: A paramount problem faced by IoT in agriculture
    is the interoperability of equipment which is caused by variety of digital standards.
    This makes adoption of newer technologies in a slow phase and subsequently causing
    decreased agricultural production [20]. Newer methods and protocols are required
    to ensure interoperability in all reference layers of IoT so as to attain the
    true potential of that in farming. Cost-effective solutions: It is significant
    from the literature that the requisite of economic optimization in IoT systems,
    if they are to be adopted by poor and small-scale farmers [13]. This demands novel
    solutions in implementing plausible methodologies. The adoption of vertical farming
    and other means of pop-up farming (like hydroponics and aeroponics) [158] among
    small scale farmers is impending in the near future, provided existing techniques
    prevail to evolve in an affordable fashion. Resilience for farmers: There is an
    indispensable role for the research community to usher the lives of people who
    provide basic necessities for the mankind. The survival of farmers purely depends
    on their crops. Hence it is much worth to avoid total or partial crop losses due
    to unprecedented events like severe diseases caused in crops. Therefore, it is
    high time for breaking new grounds with expert technologies so as to take proactive
    measures to plan and manage unwanted situations from occurring by devising high
    precision prediction and forecasting systems [82]. Effective intercropping: Complementary
    crops and intercropping mechanisms have to be fostered among growers in order
    to increase profitability and as a measure to reduce the risk of unprecedented
    eventualities (natural or economical) which could happen when depending upon on
    a single variety of crop for livelihood. Intercropping mechanisms requires a wide
    knowledge of effectively choosing plants and needs information to be reported
    in a comprehensive manner [159]. Effective methods of intercropping could be experimented
    with the help of strategies sorted out through emerging techniques. SDN: Software
    Defined Network (SDN) was proposed as architecture to conduct academic experiments
    on data centric networks without affecting production traffic. More innovations
    are required in terms of traffic, transmission performance, flexible networking
    and bandwidth for synchronization and access of distributed servers in public
    and private clouds [119]. Traffic Engineering, load balancing and several other
    appliances are available to meet these needs. Security: Security of data and IoT
    systems is identified as an open problem by the whole IoT research community.
    Ensuring right data management to all aspects of security in multiple layers attracts
    interest of various researchers. 11 Conclusion The agriculture sector plays an
    important role in the world economic growth as well as a major source of employment
    for many people, particularly those residing in rural areas. In developing countries
    like, India, agriculture is the main tool to eliminate poverty and help people
    to raise income to achieve prosperity. As population increases, there is a need
    for automation in agriculture. The IoT based smart agriculture systems help to
    achieve more productivity (yield) and reduce the overhead cost. In this paper,
    we described some of the smart agricultural applications in detail and provided
    taxonomy for classification. We also proposed an architecture for smart agriculture
    system and developed smart price prediction system for cotton and cardamom farmers
    together with a prototype for smart irrigation. A detailed description of technical
    challenges and constraints for implementing smart agriculture systems is also
    described. Finally, a set of open problems has been listed to provide directions
    to the future researchers. Availability of data and materials All data generated

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the near future, the
    agricultural sector is called to face a significant challenge due to increasingly
    scarce resources, extreme weather conditions, a growing population, and a reduction
    in arable land [1]. Indeed, according to the FAO, by 2050, the world’s population
    will reach about 10 billion and, to be able to feed everyone, we will have to
    produce 70% more food [2], [3]. A practical and feasible solution is to move from
    the old farming concept to smart agriculture, with the adoption of information
    and communications technologies (ICTs) that help farmers to monitor, manage, and
    optimize their operations more effectively [4]. In particular, the introduction
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, every single step of agricultural
    production can be improved: from soil management to minimizing water consumption,
    from plant protection to animal health and farm automation [5], [6]. Smart devices
    located infields are able to collect information and control the evolution of
    the different processes at various production stages. Besides, the miniaturization
    of electronic components allows to implement IoT sensors with reduced form factor
    and energy consumption, monitoring many variables of interest, such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and direction, soil conditions, chemical concentrations,
    crop growth, and solar exposure, as well as possible damages caused by drought,
    hail, or flooding. IoT systems integrate all this and other data and turn it into
    useful statistics: for example, predictive analysis allows farmers to use the
    strictly necessary resources (water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) and only where
    there is a real need, e.g., for poorly irrigated areas of the field, weak or sick
    plants, etc. [7], [8]. Despite such potential benefits, the deployment of smart
    agriculture systems is still in its infancy. Indeed, an obstacle to the digitization
    of agriculture is the lack or limitations of Internet connectivity in many areas.
    In the literature, several communication protocols have been proposed, with different
    characteristics related to cost, coverage, power consumption, and reliability
    [9]. Among the available technologies (summarized in Fig. 1 in terms of power
    consumption and coverage range), low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), enlightened
    in a dashed box in Fig. 1 represent the best solution for supporting smart agriculture
    requirements. One of the most adopted LPWAN technology is LoRaWAN, which offers
    wide network coverage, built-in security, low cost, and limited power consumption
    during operation [10]. Fig. 1. Classification of wireless technologies: power
    consumption versus communication range [11]. Show All Indeed, LoRaWAN is an open
    system based on a very robust modulation (called LoRa), which provides several
    interesting features for covering rural areas with simple devices [9]. For such
    reasons, LoRa has been widely employed and tested in the agricultural field, connecting
    environmental sensors measuring temperature, air/soil moisture, etc., or to control
    different kinds of actuators (e.g., irrigation valves), and in applications, such
    as tractor communications, livestock monitoring, and location tracing [12], [13],
    [14]. Differently from existing surveys, which either treat LoRa together with
    all other IoT solutions or consider very specific technological aspects, we consider
    the adoption of these systems from an holistic perspective. For example, LoRa
    is cited in [5] in the general framework of IoT; [7] cites LoRa among the most
    promising technologies for agricultural IoT, and the same plan is followed by
    [8] which dedicated a Section to LoRa in Enabling Communication Technologies;
    similarly [15] includes LoRa in IoT communication protocols suitable for smart
    agriculture. On the other hand, [16] is specific to LoRa but is focused only on
    the protocol performance, [13] takes into consideration only the energy consumption
    of LoRa, [17] discusses the application of the technologies of industry 4.0 in
    the context of smart agriculture. Papers [18] and [19] deal with specific issues
    meaning the decision support system (DSS) and robotics in agriculture, respectively.
    Instead, in this article, we strive to provide a thorough and focused analysis
    on LoRa/LoRaWAN application in smart agriculture, offering a comprehensive view
    of the advancements and in-field applications of this IoT technology. LoRaWAN
    relies on LoRa modulation, a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, patented by
    Semtech [20]. It supports wireless connectivity with limited data rates over large
    areas and without the need of an operator. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart industry,
    smart home, smart city and, increasingly, in the smart agriculture environment.
    In the view of the authors of this article, LoRaWAN possesses five main strengths
    (low-cost, long-range, low-power, no-operator, and unlicensed spectrum) that can
    bridge the gap between smart agriculture and smart cities or industries. Moreover,
    several recent improvements on the resource allocation, channel access protocol,
    and network planning can enhance the efficiency of LoRaWAN networks, reducing
    capital and operational costs [21]. In rural areas, several experiments have demonstrated
    good coverage of LoRa [22], [23], [12]. Coverage ranges of up to 5 and 47 km have
    been obtained in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation
    conditions, respectively. In addition, in the case of NLOS propagation, the coverage
    range can be increased by using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [24], [25]. In
    terms of power consumption, LoRa offers up to 15 years of battery life to its
    devices. The low power consumption is a key feature of LoRa that makes it an ideal
    choice for smart agriculture applications. It was demonstrated experimentally
    that the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRa device may be six times that of
    a Wi-Fi device and two times that of a ZigBee device [26]. In this article, we
    provide a broad survey of LoRa-based smart agriculture systems, analyzing the
    state-of-the-art and highlighting for each solution the possible adoption of Machine
    Learning, control automation techniques, and energy autonomy features. We classify
    these works in four main categories: 1) irrigation systems; 2) plantation and
    crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring. These LoRa systems
    are analyzed in terms of scalability, interoperability, network architecture,
    energy efficiency, and point out some open issues which traverse most of the current
    smart agriculture systems. References have been selected based on recent papers
    dealing with smart agriculture; however, some contributions in different fields
    useful as a benchmark are cited as well. Finally, we present the lessons learned
    and draw future research directions which we think crucial for the success and
    widespread of such technologies. The remainder of this article is structured as
    follows. Section II provides an overview of LoRa technology and its perspectives
    in agriculture, while Section III offers a brief summary on smart agriculture
    applications and their main challenges. Section IV reports on general purpose
    LoRa-based IoT platforms applied to smart agriculture. Section V, instead, discusses
    specific vertical solutions for smart agriculture, according to the four above-mentioned
    categories. Lessons learned and future research directions are proposed in Section
    VI. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII. SECTION II. LoRa and Its Perspectives
    in Agriculture LoRa technology is a proprietary physical layer technology patented
    by Semtech, which is revealing as a promising solution for large-scale low-power
    IoT deployments, including smart agriculture applications. Indeed, by operating
    in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands and with
    a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, LoRa provides a cheap solution for supporting
    wireless connectivity with limited data rates (from 0.3 to 27 kb/s) in large areas
    and without the need of an operator. Moreover, LoRa transmissions are regulated
    by having a maximum transmission power of 25 mW (14 dBm) in the uplink, a configurable
    bandwidth of 125, 250, or 500 kHz, and a duty cycle of 0.1%, 1.0%, and 10%, which
    permit low energy consumption. In some scenarios, the battery of LoRa devices
    can last up to 15 years. Although LoRa technology is limited to the physical layer,
    different network solutions can be built on top of it, by exploiting its transmission
    interfaces. Among these, the most consolidated one is the open-source solution
    promoted by the LoRa Alliance, which is called LoRaWAN [27]. LoRaWAN networks
    are based on a simple star of star topology (Fig. 2): end-devices (EDs), such
    as sensors or actuators deployed infield, transmit packets on the wireless medium
    to fixed nodes called gateways (GWs), which, in turn, forward the collected packets
    to a central network server (NS) interacting with several application servers
    (ASs) [28]. The network infrastructure between GWs, NS, and ASs is typically based
    on a wired Internet technology, while EDs are not associated to a specific GW,
    which greatly simplifies implementation (e.g., in case of mobility [29]): in case
    a duplicate packet is simultaneously received by multiple GWs, the NS is responsible
    of filtering these packets and performs other simple decisions on network configuration.
    Fig. 2. LoRaWAN typical architecture. Show All To minimize the protocol complexity
    and the energy consumption, LoRaWAN employs a simple Aloha MAC protocol and defines
    three classes of devices (Fig. 3). Device classes represent different ways of
    managing the reception operations performed by the EDs. Class A devices, corresponding
    to the lowest energy profile, can receive downlink packets only in two time windows
    following the transmission of their own packet to the GW. In other words, devices
    can sleep all the time and downlink transmissions are triggered only after an
    uplink one. Class B devices add to this possibility a periodic scheduling of reception
    windows, by keeping a time synchronization with the GW. Finally, class C devices
    are constantly listening to the channel for downlink packets. Any time that a
    new packet is ready for transmission, devices attempt to transmit by randomly
    selecting one of the available channels in the ISM bands (e.g., in the 868 MHz
    there are 16 channels in Europe), together with a modulation parameter called
    spreading factor (SF). More into details, six different SFs are used in LoRa (from
    SF7 to SF12), which result in different symbol times and in almost orthogonal
    transmissions: when two signals modulated at different SFs overlap, the GW is
    able to decode both transmissions in a wide range of power ratios among the signals
    [30]. Unlike many other IoT technologies, the LoRaWAN specification offers dedicated
    end-to-end encryption to application providers, together with network-level security
    primitives, which allow sharing the same network among multitenant applications
    [31]. Fig. 3. LoRaWAN technology stack. Show All Summarizing, the ease of deployment
    with excellent coverage, the availability of devices with very low energy demand,
    and intrinsic security mechanisms make these systems very suitable for innovative
    agriculture applications. Indeed, several state-of-the-art IoT applications in
    smart agriculture are based on LoRa/LoRaWAN networks. For example, LoRa is used
    to connect sensor nodes measuring environmental parameters or to control different
    kinds of actuators (e.g., solenoid valve for irrigation purposes), and in applications
    such as livestock monitoring and location tracing [13], [10], [14]. These applications
    are not critical for data rates and latency, but often require to work in large
    rural areas, with limited access to energy grids and the Internet, and with decision
    mechanisms which benefit from data-driven learning. SECTION III. Smart Agriculture
    Applications and Challenges While industrial production processes have already
    become smarter and autonomous thanks to the implementation of the so called Industry
    4.0 concept, the integration of technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence
    (AI), robotics, and big data is more recent in agriculture. The availability of
    IoT technologies for supporting wireless connectivity in rural areas and controlling
    infields smart objects shows a great potential for improving the agricultural
    sector, toward the so called smart agriculture [17], [18], [19]. Indeed, farm
    monitoring and automation can make production more efficient and sustainable [7],
    by promptly detecting and reacting to water or moisture stress, wastes of raw
    materials, crops’ diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies, as well as problems
    related to the wellbeing of farm animals. The interest on the development of smart
    agriculture applications has been demonstrated by the recent commercialization
    of agricultural sensors and robots (called Agribots), specifically designed for
    reducing the intense physical labor traditionally required in agriculture [15].
    Apart from the availability of smart devices for interacting with the farm in
    the physical world, smart agriculture applications require to build a digital
    representation of the farm status and a decision logic based on the collected
    data. Different protocols can be envisioned both for providing the wireless connectivity
    to heterogeneous devices (from simple low-cost temperature sensors, to complex
    remote-controlled robots) and exporting data for analysis and decisions [32],
    [33]. Since a large amount of data can be produced by agricultural sensors, big
    data analysis can provide efficient monitoring and processing methods [34]. Data
    processing may involve various features such as data loading, validation, aggregation,
    prediction, classification, image or video processing, and data mining. Thus,
    based on the acquired data, DSSs can optimize the productivity and reduce the
    ecological footprint of the farm. Researchers recognize that digitization of farming
    processes and activities is an important challenge for the adoption of smart agriculture
    technologies [32], [35]. In particular, the major challenges to digitization in
    agriculture can be categorized as follows. Communication Issues: As we will detail
    later, large-scale implementations of IoT solutions require robust and secure
    network architectures. The reliability of communicating information still represents
    a challenge to be addressed in the agricultural context and justifies the adoption
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN technologies. Energy Management: The power supply in devices for
    smart agriculture is a significant challenge and energy harvesting systems are
    a relevant area of research. The main issue concerns the sensor’s power supply
    and how to optimize efficiently the power consumption. Moreover, distributed nodes
    can execute some computations (Edge computing) which consumes more energy, while
    sensor batteries have a limited capacity. Consequently, smart devices require
    efficient energy storage and supply. Data/Device Heterogeneity: In general, the
    agricultural data is produced by heterogeneous sensors (soil sensors, weather
    sensors, trunk sensors, leaf sensors, etc.). In addition, IoT devices generally
    use different network protocols and platforms. Thus, in addition to sensors heterogeneity,
    network and protocol heterogeneity should be considered as well. Getting these
    technologies to work together is often an issue, especially for unskilled farmers.
    Physical Deployments: Spatial deployment of devices on farms proves to be a significant
    challenge, especially when the entire farm needs to be monitored across a large
    area and with different application scenarios (soil, plants, trees, animals, etc.).
    Data Management: The difficulty of interpreting the data can be a huge barrier:
    indeed, numerous sensors are necessary and big data analysis could be required
    to better understand and forecast the unpredictability of agricultural ecosystems.
    Generic Platform: To promote the adoption of smart agriculture technologies is
    often required to develop user friendly software platforms. The challenge here
    is to build a universal platform that can be easily modified to support different
    types of monitoring ranging from specific crop to livestock. These challenges,
    together with the cost of infrastructure investment, the complexity of technologies,
    lack of farmers’ education and training, data ownership, and privacy and security
    concerns, has motivated the research and development of innovative platforms,
    specific network technologies, and new architectures for smart agriculture [32],
    [35]. SECTION IV. Generic LoRa-Based Platforms Since agricultural applications
    are widely different, varying from soil and air monitoring, to irrigation automation
    and livestock breeding, several general purpose IoT platforms have been adapted
    for farmers to accommodate all these applications together under a unified, easy
    to understand and simple to use interface. Therefore, in this section, we will
    discuss some of these LoRa-based platforms horizontally designed for smart agriculture,
    while in the next one, we will dig into more vertical and application-specific
    systems, focusing on the four reference scenarios depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
    Four reference applications in smart agriculture. Show All Generic and open IoT
    platforms can indeed help to digitize farms by integrating numerous agriculture
    applications, harmonizing specific sensing devices, actuators, and decision logics,
    which exhibit heterogeneous requirements in terms of network bandwidth, latency,
    sensors’ complexity, and energy requirements. A clear example is constituted by
    FIWARE [36], a powerful open-source platform, sponsored by the European Commission,
    that provides standardized interfaces for many different IoT sectors including
    agriculture. The FIWARE platform includes several parts called generic enablers
    (GEs), which provide components and reference implementations that support specific
    APIs, and can integrate data collected from heterogeneous sensors using different
    communication technologies, to create custom applications [37], [38]. Several
    GEs are available making it easier to interface with IoT systems, and the IoT
    Agent for LoRaWAN offers a bridge between LoRaWAN and the FIWARE Context Broker
    (the core component of the “Powered by FIWARE” platforms). Moreover, FIWARE can
    be combined with other third-party platforms to provide accessible tools to worldwide
    farmers and consumers too [39]. Another example is the work in [40] where low-cost,
    LoRa-based devices are used for soil temperature and humidity monitoring, and
    the data is processed and sent to the Cayenne IoT Platform for storage and visualization
    [41]. This platform is a drag and drop project builder for developers and engineers
    that can be used in different IoT applications. It encompasses cloud-based web
    applications as well as mobile apps for Android and IOS devices. Cayenne can integrate
    any tool into the library with a wide variety of IoT ready-to-use devices and
    connectivity options. Other LoRaWAN-based IoT platforms are more specific to the
    agricultural world, aiming at improving the management of generic farms in a highly
    customizable way. For example, the LoRaFarM platform [42] has a generally applicable
    “core” infrastructure, which can be completed with specialized ad-hoc modules
    depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements. The LoRaFarM platform
    derives its topological structure from the LoRaWAN architecture, since low-level
    communication patterns are built around the LoRaWAN technology (see Fig. 5). Hence,
    expansion modules can be added at farm level (or low level), if they include physical
    hardware to be installed in the deployment (sensors or actuators), as well as
    a high level, in case data processing is needed. The middleware, in the LoRaFarM
    domain, refers to the set of entities and technologies by which data coming from
    farm-level modules are collected, stored, and exposed to high-level modules. This
    middleware can be defined as a sort of “connecting layer” between the farm and
    the back-end domain. Fig. 5. LoRaFarM platform: levels and parallelism with LoRaWAN
    [42]. Show All One of the main advantages of the LoRaFarM platform is that heterogeneous
    subnetworks, in terms of capabilities (transmission range, data throughput, and
    energy consumption), can be incorporated without altering the platform structure
    and, thus, making it highly scalable, flexible, and suitable for a wide range
    of scenarios. Indeed, this gives the freedom to choose the most suitable communication
    protocols and traffic policy to monitor and control the farm different areas,
    such as greenhouses and fields. Messages between nodes employing different protocols
    are translated by a multiprotocol GateWay (mpGW), enabling communications between
    non-LoRaWAN-enabled nodes and the LoRaFarM middleware, in a seamless way. Its
    protocol translation functionality, the mpGW can be enriched with edge computing
    features, to process and aggregate sensor data. Moreover, LoRaFarM can be extended
    with new functionalities like data analysis and prediction of the evolution of
    environmental parameters to prevent plant diseases, relying on AI and Machine
    Learning techniques. Finally, the mySense environment proposed by Silva et al.
    [58] is a sensor data integration framework aimed to systematize data acquisition
    procedures to address common smart agriculture issues. It facilitates the use
    of low cost platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making available a set
    of free tools based on the do it yourself (DIY) concept. The mySense platform
    builds over a 4-layer technological structure (sensor nodes, crop field and sensor
    networks, cloud services and front-end applications) and is accordingly divided
    into four levels of operation: Level 1, for data collection using common data
    transfer technologies (ZigBee, GSM/GPRS, LoRa, etc.); Level 2, for GWs (possibly)
    running local tasks according to the fog or edge computing paradigms; Level 3
    for storing data in the cloud; and Level 4 for high-level applications. Data can
    arrive from any device provided that complies with the data formats allowed by
    the platform. Summary and Insights: This Section discussed LoRa-based platforms
    which can be exploited to unify different applications into one simple and easy-to-use
    platform. Platforms such as Fiware, Cayenne, LoRaFarM, and mySense provide standardized
    interfaces to integrate different agricultural applications with each other. These
    platforms provide ready-to-use solutions and connectivity between heterogeneous
    networks. With these platforms, LoRa can integrate and complement existing systems
    based on other network technologies (ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc.), making them highly
    scalable. SECTION V. Application-Specific LoRa Platforms In this section, we provide
    an in-depth review focusing four reference scenarios: 1) irrigation systems; 2)
    plantation and crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring,
    which broadly cover most of smart agriculture applications. A. Irrigation Systems
    Accurate monitoring of the soil water status allows to achieve seasonal water
    savings of up to 90% compared to traditional management, increasing productivity
    and introducing significant savings in energy costs for the water pumps management
    [59]. To improve water management in agriculture, it is necessary to analyze and
    monitor the complex water interactions that occur in field, following the concept
    of soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum systems [60]. Indeed, the knowledge of
    the water status of the SPA system plays a significant role for understanding
    the crop water stress and implement water saving mechanisms with a minimal effect
    on the production [59]. Measuring the evapotranspiration (ET), which refers to
    the amount of water that passes from the soil into the air due to the combined
    effect of plant transpiration and evaporation, is another complex task. Examples
    of these sensors are the lysimeters or sophisticated micro-meteorological sensors
    (e.g., Eddy covariance), whose cost and complexity limit their application to
    research studies [61]. Cheaper systems are the time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    technique or gravimetric methods [62], whose main limit is the difficulty in calibration
    and automation. Some LoRa-based irrigation systems are implemented using development
    boards such as Arduino, ESP32, Pycom, or STM32, e.g., [43], [44], [47], [48],
    [46], and [51]. Few of them also include energy harvesting modules, such as an
    hydroelectric generator, allowing them to operate for decades. For example, the
    LoRaWAN-based irrigation system in [51] comprises an energy-neutral irrigation
    node (Fig. 6) with the following modules: controller module, power module, irrigation
    module, and transmitter module. Fig. 6. Energy-neutral irrigation node described
    in [51]. Show All Exploiting AI and data coming from different sensor, such as
    air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, light intensity,
    etc. makes possible to develop and train specific irrigation models to calculate
    the exact amount of water to be distributed. For example, the works [54], [55],
    [56] provide machine-learning-based smart irrigation systems, all employing LoRa
    technology. In particular, in [55], a random forest classifier predicts the soil
    moisture and, thus, irrigation is planned accordingly. In [54], instead, multiple
    linear regression algorithm is employed to train the model using two highest correlation
    coefficient features: 1) light intensity and 2) soil humidity. Data is collected
    with a LoRa P2P network, which uses a master–slave and TDMA-based MAC protocol.
    Each slave node has a unique address and can transmit a packet in each of the
    reserved TDMA time slots. Alternatively, a Penman-Monteith-based irrigation model
    allows for an optimal irrigation strategy for different crop growth periods and
    uses the ET parameter to estimate the amount of water [63]. This solution requires
    an integration of actuators, sensors and a meteorological station in a LoRa network
    [49], [50]. In addition, third-party services such as weather information or fog
    computing may be needed to decide on irrigation schedules [57]. Since in LoRaWAN,
    the latency of downlink communication from GW to Class-A nodes (sensors or actuators)
    is relatively long (must first wait for an uplink transmission), few systems employ
    alternative Master/Slave protocols [52], [53], [54]. These protocols increase
    the stability of the LoRa irrigation system, avoiding packet collisions and, thus,
    can save water during the close command of the solenoid valve. Finally, AREThOU5A
    [43] is an example of a water management system that combines data collected from
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the field and satellite data provided by international
    weather forecast services, to achieve efficient water usage strategies for farmers.
    It employs a WSN with two different sensors for measuring the temperature and
    the soil moisture in field. A routing subsystem controls and routes the data and
    information through LoRaWAN and TCP/IP with SSL network interfaces. The LoRa network
    is used to collect data from the EDs and perform administration processes, while
    the TCP/IP SSL works as a bridge to the rest of the network architecture. Summary
    and Insights: Comparing the characteristics of different irrigation systems, summarized
    in Table I, it is relevant to note that most of these LoRa-based irrigation systems
    adopt temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors. However, albeit all cited
    papers are recently published, ML is used only in 1/3 of the applications. TABLE
    I LoRa-Based Irrigation System Comparison Furthermore, only 13% of these irrigation
    systems used an evapotranspiration-based methodology. This strategy, which is
    often expensive, may be accomplished by combining inexpensive sensors and AI (with
    a more comprehensive approach integrating meteorological variables measured by
    a weather station with variables measured by soil sensors into the system), significantly
    lowering the cost of direct evapotraspiration measurements. Such improvements
    could lead to more effective water management, with the simultaneous impact of
    decreasing water usage and increase crop output. Finally, LoRaWAN communications
    can be tuned to adapt the duty cycle and manage the system optimally: for example,
    when the irrigation system is not in use, sensor data could be collected every
    hour or even less, while when irrigation is taking place the measurements could
    be increased to every 5–10 min. This way, the use of water and energy could be
    further reduced [71]. B. Plantation and Crop Monitoring Plantation and crop monitoring
    requires a large number of sensors to obtain an effective control and, thus, increase
    productivity, especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous. For
    example, in order to optimize the production while minimizing the ecological footprint,
    it is necessary to control the injection of pesticides and fertilizers [72], [73],
    increasing yields up to 10% and saving fertilizers up to 37% [74]. Such control
    can be performed by varying the pesticides and fertilizer application rate over
    time and space. Crops do not always need a uniform application, as some areas
    have different requirements due to their location (sunlight, soil features, etc).
    Over-fertilization can deteriorate water quality, favor weed growth, and reduce
    profit. Vice-versa under-fertilization restricts yield or reduces crop quality
    [75]. The application rate can be modified based on weather impacts, nutrient
    availability, and seasonal cycles [73], [75]. Some optical or ultrasonic sensors
    indirectly assess the nutrient request (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.)
    of the crop at the time of application [72]. In addition, to reduce the loss of
    productivity in crops, surveillance systems can be adopted [76]. Providing visual
    monitoring to growers can prevent crops from getting damaged by intruders, ensure
    the field conditions or enable the detection of pests attacks remotely. Although
    there are plenty of devices which can be exploited for building a real-time visual
    monitoring system, deploying them in a wide area and over wireless channels can
    be challenging [77], [78], [79]. Table II summarizes the main characteristics
    of several plantation and crop monitoring systems, based on LoRa technology. The
    nodes used in these systems should be of small dimensions, self-sufficient in
    terms of energy, relatively cheap, and often able to acquire a large variety of
    parameters. For example, three different sensor nodes have been developed by Valente
    et al. [64] and tested in a vineyard field: node 1, with an ultrasonic anemometer
    (that measures the direction and speed of the wind) and a sensor that monitors
    bulk electrical conductivity, in addition to volumetric water content (by measuring
    soil permittivity) and soil and air temperature; node 2, an irrometer watermark
    soil water tension sensor; and node 3, an all-in-one weather station with 12 sensors
    to measure air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, barometric pressure,
    wind speed, gust and direction, solar radiation, precipitation, lightning strike
    counter, and distance. It should be remarked that each node contains sensors which
    differ for the sampling rate, accuracy, and supplied energy. The nodes send data
    using LoRaWAN to a GW that is connected to a the things network (TTN) server.
    In the TTN server, data is decoded and sent to the ThingSpeak [80] platform for
    visualization and possible analysis and aggregation. Fig. 7 summarizes the different
    blocks composing the nodes: 1) a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) applied to
    a photovoltaic source and connected with a storage system; 2) a dc/dc switching
    converter to interface the source with the storage system and loads; 3) the LoRaWAN
    module for communication; and 4) the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module
    to convert the signals available from sensors. TABLE II LoRa-Based Plantation
    and Crop Monitoring System Comparison Fig. 7. Block diagram of the sensor nodes
    taken from [64]. Show All In [66] a LoRa-based IoT monitoring system for starfruit
    plantation is presented. The LoRa network implemented includes three nodes and
    one master, and it can cover a range of 700 m. For optimal growth, starfruit plants
    need soil pH conditions between 5.5–7.5. Thus, thanks to the proposed LoRa system,
    the farmers can make important and precise decisions about how to grow the crop.
    Similarly, works [65], [67], [68], [69], [58] present solutions to increase production
    and fruit quality, with optimal use of resources through LoRa-based networks.
    The Smart Mushroom Cultivation is a system used to automatize the production of
    expensive mushrooms [67]. The smart system includes devices to monitor and control
    humidity and C O 2 levels through sensors and actuators all connected using LoRaWAN.
    The sensor nodes measure the ambient condition inside Mushroom House (humidity,
    temperature, and C O 2 ), and data is sent to the remote server for monitoring
    and analysis. An automatic control maintains the ambient conditions between the
    required levels. Finally, there are cases where anomaly detection near the sensor
    is required to allow decisions and actions as soon as possible. In this direction,
    Brunelli et al. [70] proposed a new paradigm of monitoring and pest detection
    to improve the performance of an apple orchard. They add intelligence to the LoRa
    nodes, shifting the detection of anomalies near the sensor. The application is
    developed on a low-energy platform powered by a solar panel, realizing an energy-autonomous
    system capable of operating unattended continuously over LoRa networks. Summary
    and Insights: Plantation and crop monitoring requires the control of numerous
    parameters, captured by different heterogeneous sensors deployed in the agricultural
    fields. Some of the sensors used in the cited papers are specific to the type
    of crop, while others (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) are deployed in almost
    all of the literature works. In addition, the use of AI is not yet widely adopted,
    and only three out of nine papers adopt automatic control for the implementation
    of DSSs. An innovative approach in this context would be to add intelligence to
    the LoRa nodes, while moving the DSS closer to the sensor. Finally, note that
    the maximum size of the LoRa payload is 250 bytes; this allows a wide variety
    of parameters to be monitored and transferred in a single packet. For example,
    Sacaleanu and Kiss [69] send eight agri-meteorological measurements in a single
    LoRa packet of only 16 bytes. C. Tree Monitoring Trees are essential in modern
    society and are widely applied in a great number of scenarios including soil erosion
    prevention, air purification, wood or fruit production. For supporting the managers
    of urban/rural green infrastructures and forests, it is important to constantly
    monitor the tree conditions, in terms of growth rate and failure risk, as well
    as micro-climate parameters in the tree surrounding areas. The analysis of this
    data allows the characterization of the trees functional responses to their environment
    and a prompt action in case of problems. Tree monitoring also requires reliable
    long-range communications in the presence of foliage, large sensor densification
    (i.e., one sensor per tree), and measurements of various physiological/biological
    parameters from specific locations (at the root, the trunk, or the branch) as
    a function of vegetation type to obtain accurate readings [83]. In these systems,
    it is also important to measure changes in position over time or instantaneous
    trunk accelerations. Table III summarizes the main characteristics of relevant
    Monitoring systems. TABLE III LoRa-Based Sensors Applications in Tree Farms One
    of the main properties to be measured is the water transport in the xylem of the
    trunk (called the sap flow). A possible measurement method is the Heat Balance
    Method, developed by Granier [91], [92], which is based on analyzing the temperature
    difference among two probes inserted into the stem wood at a 10 cm distance along
    the vertical trunk axis. The probe in the higher position is heated, while the
    lower one provides the stem wood reference temperature. The temperature difference
    generated between the probes represents an index of the transpiration activity
    of the plant, expressed as a variation of the flux density. This method can be
    used for accurate measurements of sap flow in plants, providing a reliable calibration
    procedure to relate the temperature difference to the actual sap flow [93]. For
    example, the TreeTalker (TT) [81] is a device that measures sapflow (water transport
    in the trunk), wood temperature and humidity, multispectral signature of light
    transmitted through the canopy, tree trunk radial growth, accelerations along
    a 3-D coordinate system used to detect tree movements, air temperature, and relative
    humidity, which can be additionally complemented by soil temperature and volumetric
    water content. A TT node is connected via LoRa wireless connection to a GW, that
    manages up to 48 devices in one cluster. The GW is, in turn, connected to the
    Internet via GPRS and sends data to a computer server. This technology can be
    applied to monitor the root plate tilt, as well as the flexion and the accelerations
    that tree trunks receive under the force of the wind for the evaluation of tree
    failure risk. Another solution to analyze the health condition of a tree consists
    on the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it is a well-known technique with
    a wide range of applications. EIS has been applied to characterize solids, liquids,
    both in the laboratory and industrial environments. Moreover, assessment of physiological
    states of some trees (pinus, chestnut, etc.) has also been studied. The method
    based on bioimpedance indexes allows determining three distinct physiological
    states: healthy and watered plants, plants with a high level of hydric stress,
    and plants with disease [94], [95], [96]. For example, Amaro et al. [82] integrated
    an EIS system in a sensor node to analyze the health condition of the tree and
    transfer the results through the LoRaWAN protocol. Finally, tree monitoring systems
    are often influenced by the presence of foliage which can severely impact wireless
    communication systems performance. This generally leads to node densification
    to increase coverage levels, especially in large areas, resulting in additional
    costs and constraining the design of LoRa systems in nonhomogeneous vegetation
    environments [84], [85], [97]. For such reasons, a small drone with a GW is sometimes
    required for collecting data from nodes and solving the Fresnel zone radio propagation
    issues encountered in tree farms [98], [86]. Summary and Insights: In this section,
    some methodologies for monitoring tree health have been discussed. It is important
    to highlight how LoRa can be easily integrated into these systems, e.g., to measure
    the lymph flow or bio-impedance of trees. In case the parameter to be monitored
    involves roots, it has been shown that LoRa can be used for under-ground or near-ground
    communications too [12], [99]. Finally, the use of drones for data collection
    has been exploited to solve the problem of foliage scattering. D. Livestock Monitoring
    System Smart livestock practices aim at improving the productive and reproductive
    parameters, feeding and handling of feces, producing a direct effect on the increment
    of the farmers’ income, and also better milk and meat production [100]. The implementation
    of these practices requires to monitor the general health conditions of the animals,
    by tracking some biological signals to be associated to symptoms of disease, estrus
    and calving [101]. Wearable sensor technologies provide the possibility of remotely
    managing individual animals facilitating urgent interventions, responding to time
    and labor-intensive concerns in a more efficient way [87]. In extensive livestock
    production systems, the absence of access to networking and animal contact presents
    a barrier to the effective use of these technologies. Wearable sensors, to be
    more practical for extensive management settings, must: 1) network over longer
    distances; 2) have reliable power supplies (preferably renewable); 3) be low-cost
    so that damaged and lost sensors are less economically impactful; and 4) transmit
    data in real time. For these reasons, LoRaWAN technology is indicated for above
    described applications, some of which are summarized in Table IV. Primarily, these
    systems are used to monitor the animal health, but by integrating LoRa technology
    with a GPS, remote grazing systems can be implemented [87], [88]. TABLE IV LoRa-Based
    Sensor Applications in Livestock Monitoring Animal monitoring can involve completely
    different scenarios; as a consequence, the LoRa network architecture could require
    a more specific design effort to work either in indoor or outdoor settings. For
    example, the work in [89] proposes two different versions of GWs: an indoor GW,
    designed for installation in sheltered areas such as barns and cowsheds and oriented
    toward dairy cattle livestock scenarios, and an outdoor version, more specific
    for open areas such as paddocks and pasture lands, and designed for beef cattle
    livestock scenarios. The indoor GW is conceived for monitoring several important
    physical parameters typical of the shed environment, such as temperature, relative
    humidity, illuminance, carbon dioxide (C O 2 ) , and ammonia (N H 3 ) concentration,
    while the main purpose of the outdoor GW is to manage nodes in remote areas, far
    from the shed, directly on the pasture land. In the open field scenario, weather
    parameters (temperature and humidity) are collected, for purposes of correlation
    with the animal health status. Moreover, in the presence of large herds, the high
    node density could cause an increase in collisions between sent packets. In such
    scenarios, a MAC layer that includes a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism could
    prevent as much as possible packet collisions among nodes. Indeed, LBT-based carrier-sense
    multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) can be incorporated with the
    physical layer of LoRa [89]. The CA mechanism is based on a random retransmission
    time that randomizes the access of the nodes to the wireless medium. The size
    of the pasture area is another factor to consider in deploying the LoRaWAN network.
    In particular, it has been shown that in large areas of pasture, the use of a
    mobile GW that moves along the track is a better solution than the use of one
    or more static GWs [90]. Contrarily, when the livestock area is not too large,
    using only one static GW is preferable because the data extraction rate value
    is high enough and the energy consumption is lower compared to multiple static
    GWs or one mobile GW. The instance of cattle monitoring in New Mexico, as described
    by Actility [102], is one of the successful illustrations of a large-scale LoRaWAN-enabled
    deployment. Due to the large size of these desert ranches (10000–20000 hectares)
    and the large number of cows to track (up to 7000), monitoring and obtaining information
    regarding cattle wellbeing can be time consuming and expensive. Indeed, while
    the cattle were previously followed using traditional GPS devices, the absence
    of reliable cellular connection throughout the whole grazing region made this
    method ineffective. These issues were solved with an off-the-shelf LoRaWAN solution
    because of its extensive range and good coverage. Finally, LoRa technology can
    be used for sharing the short text messages and voice messages in the absence
    of cellular coverage. For example, COWShED [103] is used for supporting livestock
    transhumance in Senegal. Summary and Insights: In this section, we showed how
    LoRa is used to collect information about the movements and health of livestock,
    as well as on the conditions of grassland. LoRa can also aid herders in achieving
    remote grazing by combining data with electronic fences, to identify whether animals
    have crossed it. In addition, LoRa has been used to monitor environmental parameters
    of barns, demonstrating how this technology can be adopted in both outdoor and
    indoor scenarios. Additionally, innovative MAC schemes, such as LBT method could
    be implemented to minimize packet collisions when big herds present, and to mitigate
    the limits on the effective duty cycle of channel occupation. Finally, in the
    absence of cellular coverage, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been used for large-scale
    cattle monitoring or even supporting livestock transhumance for text/voice messages.
    SECTION VI. Lessons Learned and Open Issues This Section discusses the lessons
    learned and the open research challenges for using LoRa technology in smart agriculture.
    According to the aim of this article, it was learned that, given the wide variety
    of sensors used in smart farming systems, different communication protocols need
    to be integrated, particularly when different platforms/vendors coexist and data
    must be collected from the various subsystems. In addition, since power supplies
    are frequently unavailable in a large agricultural area, nodes should be as energy
    self-sufficient as possible. Using local or edge data processing could mitigate
    this problem, optimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, keeping the logic on
    the Edge of the network could alleviate the hurdle on LoRa’s centralized communications
    (especially on the downlink). The development of interoperability in smart agriculture
    systems can also be accelerated by platforms such as FIWARE and Cayenne, while
    machine learning can be used to model and analyze technical problems, improving
    scalability of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion. The experience
    gained in Industry 4.0 can be transferred to agriculture, considering some peculiarities,
    including the need to cover large spaces that cannot be manned. In addition, there
    is the need to provide device power supply and data security (partially solved
    by leveraging on LoRaWAN built-in security schemes). Another significant factor
    is the initial cost of the system, which must be as low as possible since the
    pay-back time also depends on elements that cannot be predicted during the year,
    such as weather. Finally, it has been recognized that although ICT has long-term
    sustainability issues to be solved, they show great potential for improving the
    usage of natural resources, especially when cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are
    combined with IoT, AI, machine learning, and neuromorphic computing techniques
    [104]. Through the study carried out in this article, it is also possible to understand
    in which area LoRa has been applied and is emerging in recent years. In particular,
    among the application areas discussed in Section V, Fig. 8 shows in a pie chart
    that more than 40% of the analyzed studies focus on water management, while almost
    25% are dedicated on crop monitoring, followed by tree monitoring. This result
    is in line with recent market surveys on LPWANs (e.g., [105]), and other general
    studies on communications protocols for smart agriculture [9]. Fig. 8. Distribution
    of the LoRa papers according to smart agriculture application areas. Show All
    All this confirms the great potential of implementing smart agriculture solutions
    using IoT, and LoRa technology in particular. However, there are still some open
    issues that need to be faced: for example, LoRaWAN works quite well in uplink
    when it needs to collect data from sensors, while downlink connections might suffer
    high latency. In what follows, we briefly discuss future research directions related
    to downlink latency, energy management, device heterogeneity and interoperability,
    data management, and scalability. These open issues must be solved for LoRa systems
    to be widely adopted in smart agriculture. We conclude the Section with an eye
    on other wireless technologies, different from LoRa/LoRaWAN. A. LoRa Downlink
    Performance The downlink performance of LPWAN systems still represents a challenge
    since it is related to the energy consumption. In particular, LoRaWAN allows different
    tradeoffs between communication latency on the downlink channel and energy consumption.
    Nodes are classified by classes: they can receive only after an uplink transmission
    (Class A), or at regular time intervals (Class B), or at any time (Class C). The
    modern trend is to optimize energy efficiency, hence, data are transmitted only
    when necessary or periodically. According to the authors’ opinion, a further optimization
    could be retrieved by local data processing. As a matter of fact, even if nodes
    remain asleep most of the time, as in [57], or with scheduling intervals of reception
    windows of 10–20 min as in [48] and [50] or a few hours [58], local processing
    always lowers the data to be transmitted decreasing the transmission time; it
    has been successfully tested in [42] where edge processing on the GW allows a
    more effective control of the actuator nodes. This last approach improves also
    reliability since it allows farms to work even if the Internet connection of the
    LoRa GW is absent for a few hours. Reliability can also be improved by a Master/Slave
    access control method for the LoRa network [52], [53], [54]. Alternatively, for
    short-range communication, a Wake-up Radio (WuR) can be adopted. WuR technology
    is an ultralow-power receiver that is continuously listening to the channel while
    spending a few nanowatts or microwatts depending on the circuit’s design. WuRs
    work in parallel to the main LoRa transceiver and allow asynchronous wake-up of
    the nodes with low latency. With the LoRa-WuR scheme, the downlink latency can
    be reduced by almost 90% compared to the traditional LoRa protocol for a ten nodes
    cluster [106], [107]. B. Energy Efficiency Considerations In addition to downlink
    communication performance just explained, the energy consumption in an agricultural
    ED can include turning on booster pumps or solenoid valves, activating sensors
    over a long period, use of GPS and data transmission, etc. Nodes should be autonomous
    as much as possible since usually power supplies are not available in a wide agricultural
    area. Besides, the use of batteries needs to minimize disposal costs and pollution.
    Providing solutions to avoid the use of batteries by harvesting energy from the
    environment would encourage the deployment of wireless devices in smart agriculture.
    The use of different energy sources, such as solar energy, piezoelectricity, thermal,
    wind, water, and radiofrequency is consolidated [108]. However, making a device
    completely energy-neutral requires a thorough analysis of power consumption in
    different working states [109]. One facilitation is the availability of a renewable
    energy source as in [51]; on the other hand, a high energy consumption due to
    the heating of one probe as in [91] requires a different design or the remote
    monitoring of the energy available or harvested as in [110]. It is evident that
    there are many factors that influence the analysis of offering-demanding energy,
    it varies on a case-by-case basis and does not lend itself to systematic analysis;
    on the other hand, in this context, machine learning algorithms can give a significant
    contribution. Infact, the ML approach has been already successfully applied in
    different contexts allowing to implement an efficient renewable energy selection
    based on the geographic location [111], or to retrieve a good energy prediction
    [112]. An application example is given by the energy-neutral system for pest detection
    [70] which takes advantage of ML algorithms. C. Heterogeneity and Interoperability
    Smart agriculture systems are quite heterogeneous in terms of sensors and, in
    some cases, it is also required to integrate different communication technologies,
    e.g., when multiple platforms coexist and data arrives from different subsystems.
    LoRa platforms are used with ZigBee to implement hybrid communications managing
    different sensors clusters or with the IEEE 802.11s-based system to build a mesh
    networking architecture. The path for the integration of different technologies,
    such as cloud, IoT, and software-defined networking, with AI is proposed in [113]
    with the related challenges and opportunities. Assuring communications in heterogeneous
    smart agriculture systems is a critical issue that has been studied for example
    in [114], where LoRa and ZigBee hybrid communications are implemented. Precisely,
    two LoRa sensor clusters and two ZigBee sensor clusters are used and combined
    with two ZigBee-to-LoRa converters to communicate in a network managed by a LoRa
    GW. The token ring protocol in the ZigBee network and polling mechanism in the
    LoRa network is used. The system can work with a packet loss rate of less than
    0.5% when the communication distance is 630 m for the ZigBee network and 3.7 km
    for the LoRa network. An hybrid LoRa/IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networking architecture
    is proposed in [115], where an effective network protocol selection mechanism
    is developed to choose the right interface. Protocol selection is based on multiple
    parameters, including network communication interface type, GNSS position of the
    APs, RSSI of nearby nodes, type and amount of data to be transmitted. Large data
    to be transferred in a short time can rely on the IEEE 802.11s-based network while
    small data can be transmitted through a LoRa-based mesh network. Platforms such
    as FIWARE [116], Cayenne [41] and mySense [58], discussed in Section IV, can also
    give a push to achieve interoperability in the smart agriculture systems. The
    above described solutions can benefit of an “industry 4.0”-based approach where
    the integration of different protocols cooperate to address the needs of automating
    computing and technology processes [113], [18]. D. Machine Learning and Big Data
    Management The integration of big data analysis with machine learning can provide
    predictions about future outcomes, such as fruit quality or detect crops’ diseases
    using historical data, analytical techniques, and statistical modeling [117].
    The benefits of ML in the agriculture are relevant [118]. However, the deployment
    of models is the most challenging step to bring the ML algorithms in the production
    fields, and thanks to its advantages, LoRa technology could make a big contribution
    to taking this step. Collected data can be used to implement an intelligent system
    capable of supporting the identification of varieties and predicting the quality
    of the final product [64]. In fact, exploiting ML, the data can be used by the
    biologists to develop crop models and perform disease prediction [68]. The agricultural
    industry produces a large amount of data collected by heterogeneous sensors, so
    best practices should include the mechanisms to reduce the memory and time for
    data analysis. Thus, to pursue such objectives, edge computing models are also
    applied [119]. Distributed data process, such as MapReduce [120], may avoid bottlenecks
    when transferring all data to a single server, as in [121] where the proposed
    method adopts smart sensors to measure the soil quality indicators, while the
    preelaborated data is transmitted using the LoRaWAN protocol. The Apache Spark
    environment is then used to implement a parallel algorithm for statistical models
    based on the soil indicator data obtained from the experimental field. E. LoRa
    Scalability and Network Improvement As concerns scalability, some open points,
    shared with general applications, are recognized. For this reason, most of the
    reference literature does not directly address issues related to agriculture.
    Indeed, scalability is a key feature in LoRa networks due to its long-range and
    large number of devices can concurrently reach a given GW. The network scales
    quite well if dynamic transmission parameters are used, in combination with multiple
    sinks. However, the correct behavior of the NS is not easy to be evaluated [122].
    In fact, the NS presents some challenges from the point of view of its optimization,
    such as processing duplicate packets or packets from other networks, or bringing
    down the entire network in case of Internet connection loss. LoRa networks are
    bound by strict legal requirements, particularly where no LBT schemes are utilized.
    The transmission duty cycle (TDC) regulates the ISM bands to determine the maximum
    time that the band can be occupied, typically bounded to 1%. This implies that
    devices may not occupy the ISM band for more than 36 s per hour, forbidding the
    transmission of new packets when this limit is attained [123]. Machine learning
    can be applied to model and analyze technical problems, improving the scalability
    of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion [124]. Further developments
    could include enhanced ADR mechanisms, optimization of GW locations, and interference
    cancelation techniques [125]. Finally, some challenges remain such as the widespread
    adoption of multihop communications in LoRaWAN. Literature has shown that multihop
    or mesh topologies can extend the coverage of LoRaWAN networks and improve energy
    efficiency in certain scenarios [126]. These solutions propose intermediate nodes
    to forward messages to other EDs to extend the coverage. Other open points include
    the use of GWs as intermediate nodes, GW-to-GW communications, and practical large-scale
    deployment of LoRaWAN mesh networks. F. Other Communication Technologies The choice
    of a specific communication technology is central to the performance of IoT-based
    agricultural applications. Other than LoRa, many standards for wireless communications
    can be employed, including Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, RFID, Sigfox, and NB-IoT.
    Some of them work well in the short-range (within 100 m), while others are more
    useful to cover long distances (up to tens of kilometers). Examples of the former
    are Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and passive and active RFID systems, while in the
    latter, standards are Sigfox and NB-IoT (and LoRa of course). As discussed previously,
    the deployment of a massive number of IoT devices might cause interference problems
    especially for technologies using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRa. On the other hand, IoT devices operating with a licensed spectrum
    eliminate interference problems but might increase costs significantly. Several
    papers have analyzed different aspects of wireless communication protocols for
    smart agriculture, studying possible applications and comparing their performance.
    For example, ZigBee-based smart agriculture systems are described in [127], [128],
    [129], [130], and [131]. The biggest challenges for ZigBee networks are the limited
    range and increased power consumption (compared to LPWANs) and relatively low
    data rate (e.g., compared to BLE or WiFi). Therefore, ZigBee is better suited
    for small-scale scenarios [130], while the use of this protocol is not suitable
    when the agricultural area is vast and the distance between sensor nodes is large.
    On the other hand, the works [132], [133], [134], [135] represent successful examples
    of NB-IoT applications in smart agriculture. Indeed, extensive coverage, adaptable
    power consumption (depending on the mode of operation), and low interference among
    nodes, are features that make NB-IoT an interesting protocol for various agricultural
    systems [136]. However, NB-IoT employs licensed frequency channels, which results
    in higher subscription prices for the associated system even if it offers a higher
    data throughput than LoRa. Moreover, when there is an existing LTE infrastructure
    already in place, the need for hardware update may be another source of expense
    for such a system. This might be a drawback in the context of smart agriculture
    if the projected return on investment is not high enough to cover these costs
    [137]. Overall, the choice of the communication technology in smart agriculture
    needs to consider many factors and requirements, such as support for roaming,
    suitability of technology to small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale deployments,
    geographical location, costs, etc. For example, it has been shown that Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN excel on network capacity, battery lifetime, and cost, whereas NB-IoT
    achieves higher quality of service and lower latency [27]. Finally, while LoRaWAN
    has been considered the most suitable communication network for IoT in smart agriculture
    [16], it is still difficult to tell which technology will dominate the market,
    or if several technologies will coexist, perhaps specializing on different application
    domains. SECTION VII. Conclusion Although the expected transition to smart agriculture
    has already begun, researchers around the world are still looking for new solutions
    to improve agricultural productivity through IoT architectures. Indeed, albeit
    applications in agriculture can benefit from the experience gained in Industry
    4.0, they require specific knowledge regarding sensor management, energy optimization,
    and data processing. LoRa technology is widely adopted, as it allows building
    an autonomous network that meets some of the requirements of the smart agriculture,
    such as low-power and long-range communication. The adoption of LoRa-based systems
    in agriculture results in an effective way to improve the connectivity of farms,
    encourage the deployment of DSSs and consequently improve their management, leading
    the agricultural sector toward smart agriculture. In order to provide a more focused
    and comprehensive view of the applications in the field, in this article, we restricted
    our focus to LoRa/LoRaWAN technology and its uses in the context of smart agriculture.
    We presented many LoRa applications in the field, and we discussed some open issues
    and research areas for future improvements. The main challenges analyzed using
    LoRa Technology in smart agriculture, are: latency on the downlink channel, energy
    management, heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices, data management,
    and scalability. All of these can benefit from the use of machine learning algorithms.
    Indeed, AI and edge computing are still scarcely used but related algorithms and
    technologies are now mature and may be successfully applied in this field. Finally,
    the optimization of multiple GW locations and multihop topologies to extend the
    coverage of LoRa networks have been recently tested to further improve the performance
    and coverage. NOTE Open Access funding provided by ‘Università degli Studi di

    10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3299441 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Acombat system,
    as a type of system-of-systems (SoS), contains computational subsystems to perform
    a wide range of military functions. In an underwater vessel, for example, an inertial
    navigation system (INS) enhances the computational accuracy of its orientation
    and velocity based on data from other subsystems such as electromagnetic log and
    global position subsystems [1]. For effective development of a combat system,
    it should be built and integrated using the V process, which is a standardized
    framework to develop complex systems such as combat systems [2]. The V process,
    illustrated in Figure 1, provides a structured and systematic approach for combat
    system development [3], [4], [5], [6]. The key concept of the V process is that
    each phase of development is paired with a corresponding verification and evaluation
    phase. For example, the left side of the V process represents the decomposition
    of operational requirements into system/subsystem requirements, components design,
    and production design. The right side of the V process involves validation and
    evaluation (V&E) of the system at various levels, starting from individual components
    and subsystems and progressing to the entire system. With the V&E activities,
    combat system developers [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]
    can ensure that each phase of development is properly verified before moving on
    to the next phase. It also reduces the risk of costly errors in the final system.
    FIGURE 1. V&E application to system engineering. Show All To perform the V&E activities
    for combat system engineering, both simulation data and real-world data should
    be obtained. Simulation data are mainly used in requirements analysis phases [17],
    [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. Simulations enable the creation of controlled
    environments where various scenarios can be tested repeatedly. Thus, in the requirement
    analysis phase, combat system engineers can evaluate the performance of combat
    systems under different conditions, including rare or dangerous situations that
    may be impractical to replicate in real-world testing. On the other hand, real
    data [24], [25], [26], [27], [28] obtained from development and operational evaluation
    phases provide a more accurate representation of the system performance in actual
    operational conditions. By combining simulation data and real data, combat system
    engineers can leverage the benefits of both approaches. Simulations enable cost-effective
    and controlled testing in various scenarios, whereas real data provide validation,
    realistic assessment, and confirmation of performance in actual operational conditions.
    This combined approach enhances the overall V&E activities and helps ensure the
    readiness and effectiveness of combat systems. Because combat systems have complex
    structures, having a data-based V&E system that can be utilized for all phases
    of the V process is important [29]. Research in the last decade has focused on
    data from each stage of the V&E system. Some researchers have studied validation
    using only simulation data, whereas others have used real data to evaluate the
    performance of actual systems. This is meaningful for individual phases of the
    V process, but the overall perspective of SoS requires V&E results from all phases.
    For the development of a successful combat system, experimental results based
    on limited information and knowledge from the initial requirements analysis to
    the operational test phase must be utilized. This article proposes a data-driven
    V&E system (DVES) that covers V&E activities in all phases of the V process. The
    DVES consists of two components: a data collection module and a V&E module. The
    data collection module has an interface for real data collection and a file system
    for collecting simulation results. Here, the data collection module interoperates
    with other systems using data distribution service (DDS) and Transmission Control
    Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) communication interfaces. It also has the
    support to include modeling information for the integration of simulated and real
    data. The V&E module validates and evaluates both simulated and real data. In
    the validation function, operational validation can be performed by utilizing
    the B-spline method. This approach ensures effective operational validation of
    the target system. In the evaluation function, performance evaluation metrics
    can be calculated using the HARVERSINE of the target system. The V&E function
    is designed to be modular, which has the advantage of reusability and easy maintenance
    even if the target system changes. To make V&E even more effective, we leveraged
    the Unity 3D engine to visualize the results. In the experiments on the proposed
    system, V&E was performed in all stages of the V process in the submarine hardware-in-loop
    simulation (HILS) environment. The experiments utilized simulation data and real
    data. First, the simulation scenario utilized data from a simulated torpedo engagement
    between a submarine and a surface ship to verify the attack pattern of the torpedo
    and the evasive maneuvers of the surface ship. The engagement simulation was used
    to perform optimal strategy analysis. The scenario utilizing real data performed
    V&E of the submarine radar performance evaluation and the launch test of the shipboard
    torpedo. The proposed system could generate baseline indicators for radar performance
    evaluation and compare the results of the integrated test phase with the requirements
    analysis information of the shipboard torpedo. These results confirmed that the
    proposed system can be utilized throughout the V process, and it is expected to
    be utilized in actual combat systems. The remainder of this paper is organized
    as follows. Section II summarizes related work on V&E systems. Section III describes
    the design and implementation of the proposed DVES, and Section IV reports the
    experiments and results. Finally, we summarize the conclusions in Section V. SECTION
    II. Related Work System development of V&E uses simulation-based and real data
    to analyze and test systems [7], [31]. Various studies have been conducted over
    the past decade to obtain V&E indicators. Table 1 summarizes the previous research
    related to the present study. This section describes the application of V&E based
    on data generated by HILS or combat engineering systems. TABLE 1 Related Works
    on Validation & Evaluation Systems Most V&E approaches have been applied to systems
    before development [30], [31]. For example, Ke et al. [32] developed a subsystem
    that combines an HILS of antiaircraft missiles and used it to conduct simulation
    training evaluations of antiaircraft missiles. Similarly, Zulkefli and Mohd [33]
    developed a subsystem for evaluating and analyzing the fuel consumption and emissions
    of vehicles in combination with an HILS testbed of connected vehicles. The evaluation
    items included a real engine, an engine-loading device, and a virtual powertrain
    model. The above studies developed separate subsystems for evaluating simulation
    data, similar to the method proposed in this study. Yang et al. [34] built a HILS
    testbed of a guided bomb and a system to evaluate the control model of the bomb
    and to analyze the sequence diagram. They focused on evaluating the performance
    of the target system by establishing HILS testbeds. In addition, they evaluated
    their solutions through simulations rather than by developing V&E systems. Therefore,
    researchers [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38] have focused on simulation
    data and performed V&E, although these works have been limited because performing
    V&E on various systems is difficult. From the perspective of real combat system
    engineering, V&E is performed after developing the target system. For example,
    Seo et al. [7] proposed an interface validation system for the interoperability
    of combat systems. The system interfaces during design and after implementation
    helped verify the corresponding system of systems. Dai et al. [24] introduced
    a data-based least-squares support vector machine to build a combat effect evaluation
    model for real combat systems, achieving higher accuracy than conventional combat
    training evaluation systems. Zhang et al. [31] and Ding et al. [37] proposed neural-network-based
    combat evaluation models for cooperative combat between underwater unmanned vehicles.
    They basically combined a neural network with fuzzy logic to analyze and evaluate
    cooperative combat patterns of underwater unmanned vehicles to improve the system
    accuracy. These studies focused on collecting and evaluating data generated by
    real combat systems to improve their performance. Therefore, they developed V&E
    systems using real data for evaluation and further improvement. Our research team
    has conducted various studies on V&E systems. For the success of the proposed
    DVES, we studied most activities in V&E for combat system engineering. For example,
    we performed a requirement analysis of combat systems and studied several methods
    of data-based V&E, such as data analysis [39], [40], [41], [42], interoperability
    between systems [7], [31], simulation modeling [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37],
    [38], and programming based on a 3D Unity engine [43], [44], [45], [46], [47],
    [48], [49], [50]. These studies enabled us to collect real and simulation-based
    data in an integrated environment and improved the effectiveness of V&E through
    3D visualization, which is different from previous studies. SECTION III. Integrated
    V&E System This section details the proposed DVES, system architectures for V&E,
    and main components. A. Overview Figure 2 shows the configuration of the proposed
    DVES and target system. It is a HILS system composed of subsystems for simulating
    real submarines, such as a global positioning system (GPS) simulator, a floating
    table simulator, a seabed control simulator, a multifunction command console,
    and databases. The submarine HILS generates simulation data similar to those of
    the actual system, or the collected real data can be identical to those of the
    actual system. For example, a GPS simulator can generate both simulation and real
    navigation data of parameters such as location and speed. The resulting database
    can transmit the collected real data through the network data bus. FIGURE 2. Schematic
    of the proposed DVES for combat system engineering. Show All The proposed DVES
    comprises subsystems of simulators and data collection modules with databases
    from the actual system and V&E modules. A data collection module has functions
    of network interfacing and data classification for interoperability with HILS
    networks, enabling data collection for interoperation with the HILS internal simulators.
    Thereafter, V&E of simulation and real data can be performed using the V&E module.
    The DVES is implemented as a modular and hierarchical structure for easy interoperation
    with other systems. B. Architecture and Methodology of DVES The DVES has a hierarchical
    structure comprising the V&E and data collection modules, as shown in Figure 3.
    FIGURE 3. Overall DVES configuration. Show All First, the data collection module
    uses the DDS middleware in the function to collect data for analysis in the actual
    system or HILS. The collected data are divided into simulation and real data and
    are classified by preprocessing. The data are then transferred to the V&E module
    by a data transfer function using TCP/IP communication. The V&E module sets the
    parameters to be validated or evaluated by the V&E parameter setup function. The
    parameters define the appearance of the visualization object, standard coordinate
    system, standard time, and number of systems to collect data or load scenarios.
    The data analysis function distinguishes whether the collected data are intended
    for validation or evaluation for subsequent processing. Validation enables highly
    effective validation by applying a B-spline interpolation model for missing values
    between data. Finally, the evaluation function evaluates the system using distance,
    position, and azimuth performance-evaluation equations. 1) Data Collection Module
    The data collection module comprises three steps, as shown in Figure 4. The first
    step is data collection, which consists of DDS interoperation for data collection
    and message collection logic. For DDS interoperability, messages are collected
    through connection with the DDS data bus by defining DDS interoperability settings
    and message modeling. The second step is preprocessing, which includes message
    parsing, classification, and transformation logic of the collected data. The collected
    data are divided into simulation and real data, and analysis data are reconstructed
    according to a specific format. The data collection module may perform preprocessing
    to reduce the computational load in the V&E module. In the third step, the collected
    data are transmitted to the V&E module, and interactions using TCP/IP and data
    transmission logic are performed. If data collection is not complete, steps 1–3
    are repeated. FIGURE 4. Operational flowchart of the data collection module. Show
    All 2) V&E Module The main functions of the V&E module are the V&E of data (simulation
    and collected real data) generated during the system development. Therefore, the
    V&E module consists of V&E functions. This structure is hierarchical and easy
    to expand, modify, and use to supplement the interface of the target system. Figure
    5 shows a brief description of a maneuver validation scenario for a submarine.
    The validation function verifies the system according to the following steps:
    1) creation of a validation environment, 2) validation analysis, and 3) result
    visualization. Specifically, step 1 generates a list of event times in the object
    and environment settings for validation using messages received from the data
    collection module. FIGURE 5. Brief description of the scenario for maneuver validation
    of a submarine. Show All Reference coordinate settings, object icons, and initial
    positions are set for verification. The event time list also includes information
    about the positions and postures of the main objects and sub-objects by time.
    After validation is started, time proceeds according to the internal time management
    module, which extracts events to perform the validation analysis and result visualization.
    In steps 2 and 3, the generated events are sequentially visualized; in this case,
    the time resolution between the data is highly important. A low simulation resolution
    or low sampling rate of the data can lead to accurate verification failures, and
    the operator deduces the empty value between the current and subsequent data.
    Therefore, the low-resolution problem of the verification data should be minimized
    via a theoretical background, and in this study, B-spline interpolation [51] was
    interpolated as empty data. ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ N i,0 (u)={ 1, 0,

    (u),u∈[ u 1 , u n ] (1) (2) View Source To validate effective behavior, interpolation
    between data is essential. Interpolation is generally utilized to estimate values
    between data. The data of combat systems for behavioral verification are often
    data with long-term sampling periods or long-time intervals between movement points.
    Therefore, interpolation is effective for behavioral validation. The proposed
    system utilizes B-spline curves to estimate the six degrees of freedom of the
    combat system. Similar equations to the B-spline curve include the Bezier and
    Lagrange spline curves. Compared with the above equation, the B-spline curve has
    no limit on the minimum number of control points for curve generation and can
    produce a curve closer to the control point. First, we define the subdivided curve
    as u . Equation (1) is the basic correction of the p-order B-spline equation for
    u . Then, the basic form of the p-order B-spline equation can be defined through
    N i,p (u) using (1), as shown in (2). It is easy to implement and has excellent
    algorithm performance by calling the base function in recursive form. Figure 6
    shows a brief description of a scenario for evaluating the subsystems of a submarine.
    The evaluation utilizes the HARVERSINE algorithm and consists of three steps:
    1) collecting and selecting evaluation data, 2) computing evaluation losses, and
    3) evaluation and visualization. Step 1 selects the items to be evaluated from
    the data received from the data collection module. The evaluation items consist
    of azimuth-error, distance-error, and position-error evaluation items. Subsequently,
    the data corresponding to the error calculated based on the evaluated items are
    collected. FIGURE 6. Brief description of a scenario for the evaluation of the
    subsystems of a submarine. Show All First, the azimuth error is calculated from
    the difference between the azimuth angle of the detection target and that in the
    actual direction to determine the difference between the detection and measurement
    angles. The distance error is obtained based on the location of the target detected
    in the test box and the actual location of the target box. The above two items
    are mainly used to assess radar or GPS detection and navigation errors. Finally,
    the position error is calculated from the position of the test ship and the actual
    position error of the test ship, and it predicts the position of the test ship
    only using an INS without GPS. The bearing evaluation can be quantified as follows:
    ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ f i = cos ϕ i ⋅sin θ i −sin ϕ i ⋅cos θ i ⋅cos( ε i − λ i ) sin(

    bearing at time i . a e bearing,i : Accumulated RMSE of the measured bearing until
    time i Equation (3) is used to calculate the azimuth ( B exp,i ) from the latitude
    ( ϕ,θ ) and longitude ( λ,ε ) of the target submarine collected by the radar or
    GPS. It utilizes the HAVERSINE equation to calculate the position of the target
    submarine relative to the test submarine. For example, if B exp,i = 49.8 ∘ , the
    target line is located at 49.8° clockwise from the test submarine. However, as
    B exp,i is calculated, comparison with the true value ( B ref ) reveals the error.
    The error between B exp,i and B ref is calculated as shown in (4), and the radar
    accuracy is obtained using the absolute value for measuring the target error.
    Equation (5) is the root-mean-square error (RMSE) obtained from radar data and
    enables continuous checking of the accumulated errors throughout sensor data collection.

    distance between two points in the WGS-84 coordinate system, based on the latitude
    ( ϕ,θ ) and longitude ( λ,ε ) of the test and target lines. The units of D exp,i
    are nautical miles. The ratio of the distance error ( ce dist,i ) can be calculated
    using (7), and the error between the true and measured position values is calculated
    as to what the error is for the true position value. Equation (8) confirms the
    accumulated mean error of the distance error rates ( ae dist,i ) calculated using
    (7). Figure 7 shows the data used for V&E through message modeling for V&E in
    combat systems. In this study, platform and event messages were considered. Platform
    messages contain attitude and navigation data. Attitude data can represent yaw,
    pitch, and roll of the target object. Navigation data can represent information
    such as the identification number, location, altitude, and speed of the target
    object. Attitude and navigation data can be utilized to indicate the behavior
    of the target system or the detection radius of the sensor. Platform and detection
    messages update data by identifying platform data and identifiers. Finally, event
    messages should be displayed on the screen at a specific time and should include
    phrases mainly employed to analyze the operating procedures of the combat system.
    FIGURE 7. Message modeling diagram for combat system engineering. Show All C.
    Implementation of DVES Figure 8 shows the architecture of the proposed DVES for
    implementation. The DVES mainly consists of network interfaces and modules for
    data collection, visualization, and data-based V&E. The network interface interoperates
    with actual systems or HILS environments for V&E. We use DDS middleware to connect
    to many systems in a 1: N connection; however, this approach can cause high message-loss
    rates. To compensate for the message loss, we applied a quality-of-service policy
    in the DDS. Consequently, the DVES ensures significantly high reliability in interoperability
    V&E. FIGURE 8. Architecture for DVES implementation. Show All Data collection
    is conducted using a module that categorizes received messages and a detailed
    model that loads simulation scenarios. Detailed models for visualization consist
    of a model, view, and controller, which represent the back end and front end,
    respectively. The back end consists of detailed models such as objects, messages,
    and playback speeds. The front end is implemented as a detailed model directly
    controlled by the screen shown to the operator and consists of modules such as
    mini-maps, views, or file controllers. Finally, the V&E module performs V&E by
    inheriting the model described above. As described in Section III-B, DVES facilitates
    the expansion and maintenance of each model owing to its modular and hierarchical
    structure. Figure 9 shows an implementation screenshot based on the design described
    in Section III-B. Figure 9(a) shows the main user interface of DVES, where region
    A represents the main toolbar of the proposed system. The main toolbar allows
    users to set options for V&E by setting the purpose and type of V&E and the visualization
    point of view. Region B in Figure 9(a) represents the replay player for data analysis.
    In this area, you can visualize the overall length and playback time of the replayed
    scenario and set the playback speed for efficiency in V&E. The information in
    regions A and B allows operators to gain insights into V&E. Region C in Figure
    9(b) represents the sub-toolbar. In the sub-toolbar, the operator can select detailed
    options for V&E. The operator can set the six degrees of freedom of the platform,
    whether to visualize event messages, etc. Consequently, the operator can effectively
    customize the visualization screen of the scenario for each evaluation and validation.
    Region D visualizes the details set up by the sub-toolbar: it shows the six degrees
    of freedom of the platform, its identification number, and V&E metrics. The operator
    can use them to guide V&E. FIGURE 9. Example of DVES menu and data visualization.

    IV. Experiments and Results We conducted experiments to collect data generated
    from complex HILS environments for V&E. The HILS environment of the submarine
    used for the experiments is shown in Figure 10. The established HILS environment
    uses a DDS interface for communication between simulators. Each simulator in a
    HILS environment consists of a database, data publisher, and DVES. First, the
    database stores information collected from the real submarine data. Then, the
    data publisher subscribes to the data from the database and republishes it for
    use by DVES. FIGURE 10. Experimental setup for V&E. Show All A. Experimental Scenarios
    The experiments conducted in this study aimed to validate and evaluate the data
    using scenarios with simulation or real data. The detailed scenarios are described
    in Table 2. In the simulation scenario, the combat effect of the torpedo performance
    improvement project was also analyzed, and the real data were tested based on
    the existing data studied by Hanwha Ocean corporation [41]. The simulation data
    compared and analyzed offense and defense-engagement scenarios of submarine surface
    ships and submarines. The development and operation stages were validated and
    evaluated using real data, and the development V&E analyzed the detection and
    measurement accuracy of the subsystems. Moreover, operational V&E validated and
    evaluated torpedo launch procedure tests. TABLE 2 Experimental Scenarios for Testing
    DVES Figure 11 shows the diagrams of the experiment scenarios listed in Table
    2. Figures 11(a) and 11(b) illustrate torpedo engagement scenarios between a surface
    ship and a submarine. FIGURE 11. Schematics of experimental scenarios. (a) Submarine
    operation including attack tactics of launching fire-and-forget and wire-guided
    torpedoes. (b) Surface ship operation including defensive tactics such as launching,
    countermeasures, and evasive maneuvering. (c) Bearing accuracy evaluation. (d)
    Engagement procedure evaluation using multiple wire-guided torpedoes. Show All
    These scenarios allow for behavioral validation of the torpedo engagement scenario.
    In general, torpedoes are categorized into straight torpedoes, pattern torpedoes,
    and wire-guided torpedoes based on their guidance method. A detailed engagement
    scenario is shown below. When the surface ship detects the torpedo, an acoustic
    decoy is fired to disturb the torpedo target and perform evasive maneuvering.
    Figure 11(b) illustrates the use of a wire-guided torpedo directed by a sonar
    mounted in the submarine to outperform the sonar mounted in the torpedo and successfully
    hit the target. The submarine is connected to the torpedo through a wire, such
    that it can be tracked without disturbance by the acoustic decoy. The subsystems
    used in submarines include navigation and detection sensors, such as a GPS, INS,
    and radar. Figure 11(c) shows the locations of targets according to radar, the
    submarine sonar, and the bearing of the target ship evaluated from a test ship.
    The evaluation provides the error between the true and test bearing. Figure 11(d)
    illustrates the operation test of the developed torpedo, with the suitability,
    efficiency, viability, fatality, and safety of the system being evaluated based
    on the test results. In this experiment, the torpedo launch procedure was tested
    as an evaluation scenario to determine the correct operation. The procedure test
    for torpedoes was used to verify that an event was triggered at each stage after
    the torpedo was launched. The parameters for each scenario were defined according
    to the experiment, as listed in Table 3. The requirements and operational validation
    scenarios mainly included detailed models to visualize information related to
    the maneuver model of the object (i.e., surface ship, submarine, torpedo, or decoy)
    and sensor (i.e., sonar) model. The development V&E scenarios added mathematical
    models to the existing models to calculate the bearing accuracies of radar sensors.
    The operation V&E scenarios were used to verify the system behavior according
    to the procedure designed mainly for testing the launch procedure of wire-guided
    torpedoes. The existing object model and event message visualization were used
    to monitor the procedure after torpedo launch to support analysis. TABLE 3 Experimental
    Parameters B. Simulation Data-Based V&E Figure 12 presents the results of a simulation
    validation of the evasive maneuver of a surface ship using DVES. Figure 12(a)
    shows the initial phase of the simulation. The submarine detected the surface
    ship as a target and fired a sonar-equipped torpedo to detect the target. The
    acoustic detection system of the surface ship detected the approach of the torpedo
    and fired a total of three acoustic decoys, which confused the detection system
    and gave the torpedo three more targets. The torpedo then used target assignment
    to track the most probable target. FIGURE 12. DVES screenshots of surface ship
    evasive maneuvers. (a) Submarine target detection. (b) Surface ship evasive maneuvers.
    Show All In addition to using acoustic decoys to evade torpedo attacks, surface
    ships also find it effective to utilize evasive maneuvers simultaneously. Figure
    12(b) illustrates the use of acoustic decoys and evasive maneuvers in the middle
    of the simulation. The evasive maneuver primarily directs the position of the
    surface ship away from the torpedo; therefore, the surface ship is excluded from
    the target of the acoustic decoy and is spared from the torpedo attack. Figure
    12 shows that the simulation validated and analyzed the acoustic decoy utilization
    tactics and evasive maneuvering tactics of the surface ship. For example, questions
    such as whether the timing of the acoustic decoy launch of the surface ship was
    appropriate or whether the evasive maneuvering approach was appropriate based
    on the torpedo position can be analyzed. This is expected to enable operators
    to analyze tactical simulations more efficiently. Figure 13 presents the validation
    results of an attack scenario against a wire-guided torpedo that overcomes the
    weaknesses of a straight torpedo. Wire-guided torpedoes can utilize the acoustic
    detection system of a submarine to guide them to the desired target. This is possible
    because the performance of the acoustic system of the submarine is better than
    that of the acoustic system of the torpedo. FIGURE 13. DVES screenshots of submarine
    attack tactics. (a) Evasive maneuvers of suspicious ships using decoys. (b) Attack
    using a wired-guided torpedo. Show All Figure 13(a) demonstrates that at the beginning
    of the simulation, the torpedo approached the detection radius of the surface
    ship and fired an acoustic decoy as an evasive maneuver; however, the torpedo
    target was wired to the submarine and could not be jammed, assigning the surface
    ship as the target. After that, the surface ship could not evade the torpedo,
    even if it utilized evasive maneuver tactics. In the end, the torpedo traced and
    caught the surface ship, validating the effectiveness of wire-guided torpedoes
    in jamming. C. Real Data-Based V&E Real data were also used in the V&E of combat
    systems to obtain experimental results, as illustrated in Figs. 14 and 15. In
    Figure 14, the test line detects the target line, calculates the azimuth measured
    through the evaluation model, and displays the measured azimuth and direction
    (green and red lines, respectively). The lower part of Figure 14(a) shows the
    V&E scenario measured from time t= t 0 to time t= t 0 + t 1 , and the upper part
    shows that the same scenario was performed using the proposed system. Figures
    14(b) and 14(c) present the results of the radar performance evaluation. The time
    series shown in Figure 14(b) is the radar performance evaluation obtained using
    (3) and (4), which reveals the error between the detected and actual values of
    the radar. FIGURE 14. DVES screenshots for measuring the bearing accuracy of sensors.
    (a) Evaluation scenario for radar’s accuracy. (b) Measured evaluation loss ( ce
    bearing ) of radar. (c) Measured total evaluation loss ( ae bearing ) of radar.
    Show All FIGURE 15. DVES screenshot of engagement procedure using multiple wire-guided
    torpedoes. Show All The current error is an important factor that can evaluate
    the performance of the radar at the current point in time. However, not only the
    current error in the performance evaluation, but also the accumulated error is
    necessary because the accumulated error is the evaluation index for the unit time
    of the experiment. The accumulated performance evaluation of the radar is depicted
    in Figure 14(c), showing that the performance is good at the beginning and gradually
    degrades after time t= t 0 . To further explain Figure 14, at t= t 0 , the reference
    bearing and the current bearing point to the same target; therefore, a slight
    error can be observed between the detected vessel and the target vessel. If the
    test line is moved and the reference bearing is updated, the current bearing must
    also be updated. However, the current bearing has not changed at all, and accordingly,
    the c e bearing and a e bearing values rapidly increase. Table 4 shows the calculated
    values and performance evaluation indicators of the radar from t= t 0 to t= t
    0 + t 1 , indicating that the current bearing does not change. In Table 4, the
    largest values of the current and cumulative calculation errors are displayed
    in red for use in the performance requirements. Moreover, simply by analyzing
    using the evaluation indies c e bearing and a e bearing , it is not possible to
    know exactly which system is the problem. This information only be obtained by
    analyzing the raw data of the sensor. However, the proposed system can help operators
    make decisions by simultaneously visualizing all real, multivariate data. TABLE
    4 Experimental Results Extracted from DVES Furthermore, through the above experiments,
    the cumulative performance evaluation index of the sensors can be measured using
    the system proposed in this study, which can be utilized in the system test phase
    of the V process. Consequently, the proposed system can also be utilized to set
    the performance criteria required for systems to be developed in the future. A
    launched torpedo may detect the host submarine and attack it. This situation can
    be prevented by performing the fire-and-forget operation. At some distance, a
    launched torpedo does not detect any object to prevent self-attack, which is an
    important procedure to avoid attacking the host submarine. After the torpedo travels
    a certain distance, it starts detecting the target using its sonar and selects
    a guidance method. Torpedo induction is divided into collision-path and bearing-rider
    methods. If the speed and path of the target are known, the collision-path method
    predicts the foreground angle and induces it to the impact point of the target.
    The bearing-rider method induces torpedoes to be placed on the target defense
    line if they know the target direction. In the corresponding experimental scenario,
    we used the collision-path method for the torpedo to adjust the depth, speed,
    and guidance modes depending on the target location. Then, the operator selected
    detection through a wired or internal detection sensor and hit the target. The
    above procedure test involved the following items: 1) safety distance passed,
    2) torpedo sonar active, 3) guidance with collision path method, 4) desired depth
    of 5 m, 5) high desired speed, and 6) internal guidance. Figure 15 shows the results
    of the system evaluation by generating events over the torpedo-launch procedure.
    In Figure 15, event 1 represents that the safety distance has been passed and
    the torpedo sonar is active, and event 2 represents the guidance method, desired
    depth, desired speed, and guidance mode. All steps of the torpedo launch procedure
    were sequentially and correctly performed. D. Discussion This experiment was conducted
    to confirm V&E for all phases of the V process for a combat system. For this experiment,
    simulation data for the combat system requirements and real data from a combat
    system were used. The simulation data validated the torpedo engagement effectiveness
    of surface ships and submarines. The experiment successfully validated the evasive
    maneuvering tactics of surface ships and the detection jamming tactics using acoustic
    decoys, as well as the attack tactics using wire-guided torpedoes of submarines.
    The experiment utilized the Unity Engine and was more effective because detailed
    parameters such as the six degrees of freedom of the attitude and speed of the
    object could be expressed in a 3D environment. The results showed that the requirement
    analysis procedure of the V process was successfully performed. Next, the real
    data were used to evaluate the performance of the radar and the integrated operation
    system. This experiment had two characteristics. First, by utilizing the interoperable
    collection module, data from the actual system can be acquired in real time for
    V&E. Second, both mathematical and graphical analysis of performance evaluation
    is possible by utilizing the V&E module. The radar performance evaluation experiment
    simultaneously displayed the computational and graphical results of the HARVERSINE
    algorithm, enabling the operator to analyze the results of the performance evaluation
    more intuitively. In addition, the torpedo launch procedure test visualized the
    behavior of multiple subsystems operating in accordance with the procedure through
    event messages and guided lines, which has a positive effect on the integrated
    operation test. The results of this study are significant because they demonstrate
    that both simulated and real data can be used to validate and evaluate the V process
    lifecycle of combat engineering systems. This objective can be achieved not only
    by validating and evaluating simulation data and real data independently, but
    also by validating and evaluating combined data. It can also be utilized in all
    phases of the V process, reducing the overall development time and cost by eliminating
    the need to configure separate software based on data. SECTION V. Conclusion In
    this paper, we proposed a DVES that can be applied to all phases of the V process
    of a combat system. DVES consists of a data collection module and a V&E module.
    The data collection module consists of a file system for acquiring simulation
    data and a DDS interface for acquiring real data. By utilizing the DDS interface,
    various subsystems can be expanded to increase the scope of V&E. In addition,
    the V&E module consists of a mathematical analysis model and a graphical model
    using Unity and has the advantage of being extendable to various mathematical
    models or graphical models by utilizing a hierarchical and modular design. Simulation
    and real data from a submarine were used in the experiment. The experimental scenarios
    consisted of analyzing the impact of a simulated torpedo engagement between a
    submarine and a ship, evaluating the radar performance of the submarine, and testing
    torpedo launches. The experiment enabled analysis of items such as the maneuvering
    strategy, sensor accuracy, and operating procedures of the target system. However,
    verification of all items was limited because 3D modeling similar to a real scenario
    was not applied. Nevertheless, we could intuitively analyze the maneuvering strategies,
    performance evaluation indicators, and procedural events, which are essential
    for verifying combat systems. This proved that DVES can be utilized from the requirement
    analysis step to the system integration step. In addition, because both simulated
    and real data can be validated and evaluated, it can be expanded to various V&E
    scenarios in the future and will be highly valuable for reducing the system development
    period and cost by helping overcome the existing weaknesses through the integration
    of data-based V&E systems. Further, because combat systems are part of cyber-physical
    systems, the proposed DVES is expected to be applicable to large and complex cyber-physical
    systems. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the research fund of Hanyang

    The global food system is currently under pressure due to rising population, economic
    growth, land degradation, and increased demand for animal-based products (Keating
    et al., 2014; Lal, 2013). For example, global food production needs to be increased
    by about 70% to ensure food security for an estimated world population of more
    than 9.7 billion people in 2050 (Cole et al., 2018; FAO, 2017). Further, climate
    change is projected to affect global food production and efforts to increase food
    productivity. Notably, crop production across the globe has already experienced
    negative effects from warming temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns,
    and increased extreme weather events (IPCC, 2022; Paudel et al., 2014). This will
    likely be exacerbated by climate change in the future (Hasegawa et al., 2021;
    Lobell et al., 2008; Rosenzweig & Parry, 1994). As such, researchers, scientists,
    policymakers, and organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO) call for a radical transformation in global agricultural
    and food systems. Therefore, improved technologies that aim at enhancing production
    and supply-chain efficiencies under a resource-constrained environment are crucial
    to ensuring food security in the face of climate change (FAO, 2017). One such
    technology is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently shown the potential
    to provide solutions to several challenges associated with increased agricultural
    productivity under climatic changes and variability (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer Uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture (Source:
    Salam, 2022, used with permission). Although there is no single definition of
    IoT, it could be broadly described as a system of devices, software programs,
    sensors, and other technologies that are either connected or are able to become
    connected via the Internet to exchange information and data (Borgia, 2014). The
    first application of IoT is believed to be an information-sharing network used
    by US defense sectors in 1969, then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency
    Network. The chronological timeline detailing the evolution process of various
    technologies within IoT since 1969 is summarized in Table 1 (Balas et al., 2019).
    In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of common
    devices that might be considered to be a part of the IoT framework, including
    cell phones, televisions, thermostats, vehicles, refrigerators, home lighting
    systems, and smart watches among many others. Such IoT infrastructure is projected
    to substantially impact the global economy, with more than 100 billion connections
    (Huawei Technologies Co., 2015) and a financial impact of more than $11 trillion
    by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). Their impact is largely apparent in the agricultural
    sector, which currently contributes up to 60% of the national gross domestic product
    in many countries (The World Bank, 2019). TABLE 1. Chronological evolution of
    the technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Year Evolution Reference

    and controlling distant objects such as water levels in tanks in crop fields Rajalakshmi
    and Mahalakshmi (2016) The use of IoT in agriculture emerged due to advancements
    in data science, remote sensing, and computer technologies, and the need for optimizing
    decisions regarding agricultural management practices (King, 2017). Specifically,
    IoT use in precision and smart agriculture is notable with applications in data-informed,
    site-specific, and real-time management and decision-making. International Society
    of Precision Agriculture defines precision agriculture as “a management strategy
    that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and
    combines it with other information to support management decisions according to
    estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality,
    profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” Smart agriculture
    refers to farming using softwares, sensors, automation, and data technologies.
    Digital agriculture seeks to utilize data from precision farming and the power
    of Artificial Intelligence. Digital agricultural technologies and the use of IoT
    are illustrated in Figure 1. Development of pilot research farms is already underway
    in several countries to determine the feasibility of IoT-informed decision-making
    for improving the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production. Some
    examples include the Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture
    (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2017) and SmartAgriHubs (Chatzikostas
    et al., 2019) and SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos et al., 2012) in Europe. Yet, the adaptation
    of IoT technology in the agricultural sector is still in its infancy (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). IoT enables us to gather information from enclosed proximity to
    the physical location using fog computing, edge computing, communication protocols,
    and sensor technologies. They show potential in improving decision-making and
    productivity in various stages of agricultural production. Examples include the
    use of wireless in-field sensors in improving the measurement of soil moisture
    and permittivity (Salam, 2020; Bogena et al., 2010), autonomous precision irrigation
    systems (Dong et al., 2013), and identification and tracking of livestock animals
    (Trotter et al., 2010). Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and new remote
    sensing approaches (e.g., PlanetLab) are increasingly used in IoT. For example,
    UAVs have been used for plant height estimation (Anthony et al., 2014; Herwitz
    et al., 2004), biomass estimation (Sinha et al., 2015), crop yield prediction
    (Ashapure et al., 2020; Panday et al., 2020), detection of weeds (De Castro et
    al., 2017), soil nitrogen management (Ballester et al., 2017), crop disease detection
    (Sugiura et al., 2016), and estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) (Hunt et al.,
    2008). Despite the growing interest of the agricultural research community in
    integrating IoT-enabled devices into production, to date, such technologies are
    not widely adopted by producers due to concerns associated with cost and return
    on investment (Narwane et al., 2022; Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). More specifically,
    there is a need to understand the benefits and utilities of IoT from different
    perspectives (users, developers, and researchers) to fully utilize its potential
    to improve crop production under limited resources and climate change. Therefore,
    in this paper, we review existing literature and discuss the concepts, applications,
    potential challenges, and opportunities associated with IoT with a specific focus
    on its application in digital agriculture. First, we provide the concepts and
    technical details of different components of IoT, followed by its applications
    in digital agriculture, and associated challenges and opportunities. Overall,
    this review is expected to provide useful insights into how IoT could be integrated
    into the smart agriculture framework for improving crop productivity and food
    security in the face of climatic change and variability. Core Ideas Different
    platforms, sensors, and structures of IoT in digital agriculture were reviewed.
    The application of IoT in data management, interoperability, and precision farming
    was reviewed. Potential of IoT to improve agricultural quality and productivity
    was highlighted. Challenges and opportunities of IoT in digital agriculture were
    discussed. 2 COMPONENTS OF THE IOT The key components of the IoT include IoT platforms,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the IoT structure. An IoT platform can be
    defined as an on-premises software suite or a cloud service (IoT platform as a
    service [PaaS]) that monitors and may manage and control different kinds of endpoints,
    generally through apps installed on the platform. Similarly, WSN refers to an
    infrastructure-less wireless network that is installed ad hoc in a large number
    of wireless sensors to monitor system, physical, or environmental factors. The
    structure of IoT largely consists of devices, network structure, and cloud technology
    that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other. These components are discussed
    separately below. 2.1 IoT platforms IoT platforms provide proprietary or open-source
    suite for controlling devices and data in IoT system. Various IoT platforms, both
    proprietary and open source, are currently available to handle data from diverse
    sources using different devices. They serve functions like ingestion, filtering,
    aggregation, storing, and computation of data (Jayaraman et al., 2016). These
    platforms support specific microcontrollers, transceivers, data and extension
    memory, and programming. Some select platforms in agriculture are available from
    Tzounis et al. (2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 2.1.1 FarmBot FarmBot
    is an open-source precision agricultural project platform that consists of a farming
    machine, software, and a repository for farming data. The three main components
    of FarmBot include mechanisms for seed planting, a nutrient delivery system, and
    a universal tool mounting system. FarmBot is generally used in urban farming for
    monitoring plant growth parameters and predicting a suitable harvest date at a
    future point in time (Nugraha et al., 2020). FarmBot can plant seeds with a regular
    watering schedule and can be remotely accessed with ease from Internet-connected
    devices (Murdyantoro et al., 2019). It takes the location of each plant into account
    to facilitate essential nutrients and water application for optimal plant growth
    based on feedback from the online database of records from various agricultural
    fields. The main purpose of FarmBot technology is to optimize the quality and
    quantity of agricultural produce and to enhance resource efficiency. Arduino,
    an open-source hardware and software company, which manufactures microcontrollers,
    is used to control the FarmBot and is connected to the Internet using a Raspberry
    Pi 3 board. A decision support system (DSS) has been implemented to help in data-driven
    design, access to the open repository, and real-time control of the parameters.
    An Android application can be designed to monitor the stepper motor location to
    carry out different farm operations, plant seeds using the vacuum pump in the
    field, and capture images. 2.1.2 Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost
    computer chip capable of being used with a computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
    The basic structure of a Raspberry Pi includes random access memory (RAM), a processor,
    USB ports, general purpose input/output pins, an Ethernet port, a full HDMI port,
    a camera interface, a display interface, and a micro SD card slot (Balamurugan
    et al., 2017). The Raspberry Pi has been used in a wide variety of applications
    in agricultural systems. The growing availability of Raspberry Pi with high processing
    capacity has enabled many remote sensing tasks in agriculture, including crop
    imaging, determination of soil fertility, crop yield estimation, and spraying
    of fertilizers (Mathe et al., 2022). Flores et al. (2016) utilized a Raspberry
    Pi as a local server to display the relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture,
    soil electrical conductivity, and soil pH through the use of a graphical user
    interface. Kamath et al. (2019) used a Raspberry Pi to monitor weeds in paddy
    crops and Bluetooth 4.0 to send data to remote base station using visual sensor
    nodes. These sensor readings were then processed using machine learning models
    (e.g., support vector machines and random forests) to distinguish weeds from paddy
    crops using shape features. 2.1.3 IRIS Mote An IRIS Mote (Crossbow) is a computing
    system consisting of a microcomputer plus one or more sensors that are connected
    wirelessly via a radio link. The IRIS Mote has one of the highest communication
    ranges (close to 500 m) using a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless module. It also
    includes an Intel XScale processor, 8 KB of RAM, 512 KB of flash memory, and a
    transmission rate of 250 kbps. The expansion connector has eight channel analog
    inputs. The IRIS Mote handles task scheduling and input/output processing (Liu
    et al., 2015) using an open-source TinyOS operating system based on an ATMega1281
    low-power microcontroller (Sivagami et al., 2010). The transmission current of
    IRIS Mote is 10–17 mA, whereas the receiver current is 16 mA. The indoor communication
    range of the device is greater than 300 m, and the outdoor communication range
    is greater than 50 m (Narayanan et al., 2016). The underground communication range
    is reduced to less than 30 m due to interference in radio frequency communication.
    The IRIS Mote is used in small agricultural fields to monitor climatic and hydrologic
    parameters like rain, sunlight, humidity, and temperature of a system. 2.1.4 Zolertia
    The Zolertia Z1 Mote (Zolertia S.L., Barcelona, Spain) is a platform designed
    for WSNs. It is compatible with TinyOS, OpenWSN, and RIOT OS. It supports analog
    and digital sensors and includes an MSP432 microcontroller, 8 KB of RAM, and 92
    KB of flash memory. It can operate in the temperature range of −25 to −85°C. It
    is designed to work in the range of 0.3–3.6 V, powered by two 1.5 V AA standard
    batteries (Zolertia, 2010). Agricultural use of Zolertia has previously been reported
    in greenhouse-based tomato farming, where the attenuation of radio waves in the
    2.4 GHz freeband was measured using a received signal strength indicator (Cama-Pinto
    et al., 2021). Zolertia Z1 Mote has also been used in determining agro-climatic
    variables like temperature and soil moisture in cassava (Manihot spp.) production
    (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018). 2.1.5 Node MicroController Unit Node MicroController
    Unit (NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform with an ESP8266 microcontroller
    and Wi-Fi system on chip (SoC) from Expressif Systems, and hardware, which runs
    on an ESP-12 module. This firmware runs on Lua scripting language (Vanaja et al.,
    2018). It functions the same way as a Raspberry Pi in the case of agricultural
    applications and may be connected to various sensors for real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature. In one study, NodeMCU
    was used to monitor the environmental conditions of indoor greenhouses (Wan et
    al., 2019). A cloud-based platform has been used to store the environmental sensor
    readings and has been used for automatic irrigation systems for controlling agriculture
    pumps and remote monitoring systems resulting in increased economic benefits (Bentabet,
    2020). 2.1.6 Intel Galileo/Edison The Intel Galileo (Intel) board is based on
    Intel architecture (Intel Quark SoC X1000, 400 MHz processor) and is designed
    to have powerful functionalities with minimum power consumption. This allows users
    to apply shields compatible with Intel Galileo and extend the functionality of
    the board. It comprises two levels—legacy controlled blocks and microbuses. The
    legacy-controlled blocks are used for specific functions using dedicated channels.
    It has a dedicated point-to-point connection to connect to standard modules like
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SIM card modules for cell phones. The issues of these boards
    within agriculture are similar to that of the Raspberry Pi (Silpa et al., 2018).
    These boards are used in a house environment monitoring system, which helps in
    producing high-quality crops with minimal labor costs (Ajith et al., 2020). Some
    other applications are observed in the monitoring of soil pH and nutrients of
    cultivated crops (Sakthisudhan et al., 2019). 2.2 Wireless sensor network WSN
    is an important component of IoT, and its use in the agricultural sector has been
    widely discussed (Mahbub, 2020; Sanjeevi et al., 2020). A WSN is a wireless network
    consisting of spatially distributed sensors and sensor nodes to monitor physical
    or environmental conditions and transfer data to a base station. These systems
    are often inexpensive, scalable, and consist of mobile nodes (Kiani & Seyyedabbasi,
    2018). Briefly, the WSN system consists of two major components, sensor nodes
    and sink nodes (base station) (Kocakulak & Butun, 2017). The sensor node consists
    of a power unit, a sensing unit, and a computing unit. These nodes may be placed
    inside or outside an agricultural field to continuously feed data to the base
    station. Depending on the ad hoc system configuration or network type, the sensor
    node could behave as a data originator or router. Sensor nodes can collect real-time
    physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, or motion
    time and produce sensory data (Pottie, 1998; Senouci & Mellouk, 2016). At the
    same time, the sink node collects sensor data and communicates with the end user
    via a direct connection. This connection between the sensor and sink nodes is
    established via the Internet, satellite, or any wireless link, and the data is
    accessed through an app or end-user interface. 2.3 IoT structure IoT structure
    is a system that helps in connecting objects to the Internet through information-sensing
    equipment to establish data exchange and communication and to monitor and manage
    digital systems (Ye et al., 2014). To achieve such functions, IoT uses the perception,
    network, and application layers, as well as the security strategy for each layer,
    as a part of its framework (Gou et al., 2013). The IoT structural hierarchy is
    shown in Figure 2 (Zhong et al., 2015), but more generalized structural components
    are discussed in sub-sections below. Different layers within the hierarchy are
    crucial to address issues like computational loss, poor access control, data leaks,
    malware risks, and cyberattacks (apriorit.com/dev-blog). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Hierarchy of the Internet of Things (IoT) structure. 2.3.1 The perception
    layer The perception layer is the foundation of IoT and is the interface between
    the physical world and the digital world. This layer functions as “nerve endings”
    collecting measured signals and transporting those signals to the rest of the
    system (Yang et al., 2012). It uses radio frequency identification technology,
    barcode technology, sensor, and positioning technology to complete information
    collection and helps in controlling the perception by the actuators. The main
    security issues in a perception layer are related to information collection and
    transmission as most sensors have a simple structure and processor and do not
    have complex security protection capabilities (Zhao & Ge, 2013). 2.3.2 The network
    layer The network layer is generally composed of two layers—the network access
    layer and the network transmission layer. The access layer consists of a base
    station node and a gateway. Current methods of network access are Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc,
    Mesh, and Zigbee. The network transmission layer is responsible for the transmission
    and exchange of information, including satellite, mobile, and optical fiber communication
    networks. It is analogous to a person''s nervous system and brain, which are used
    to transmit and cope with the information from the perception layer. The most
    common security issues in a network layer occur when a number of malicious nodes
    send data at the same time, which may lead to a denial of service attack (Bello
    et al., 2017). 2.3.3 The application layer The application layer is generally
    composed of two layers—the application support layer and the application presentation
    layer. The support layer is responsible for data storage, information processing,
    and the exchange of information. The presentation layer is used for processing
    data from the application support layer. It uses technology with multimedia, virtual
    reality, and human–computer interfaces to connect the IoT and the user. The main
    security issues concerning the application layer may include data access permission,
    identity authentication, data protection and recovery, big data handling, and
    software vulnerabilities, among others (Karagiannis et al., 2015). 3 APPLICATIONS
    OF IOT IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE Digital agriculture is directly linked with IoT.
    Indeed, IoT offers multiple applications in the production, circulation, and modernization
    of farming businesses (Chen & Jin, 2012; Ozdogan et al., 2017). The term “digital
    agriculture” refers to the on-farm and off-farm uses and applications of data
    based on location, weather, energy use, or other factor using sensors, machines,
    or satellites to monitor animals, plants, or soil (Klerkx et al., 2019). It integrates
    concepts from precision and smart farming. The basic framework (Tang et al., 2002)
    of digital agriculture includes: Agricultural databases that include information
    about farmlands, climatic conditions, and socioeconomic background that relates
    agricultural activities to the human society. Real-time monitoring and updating
    of information in the database about meteorology, vegetation, and soil information
    on and under the ground using in situ and satellite-based sensors. A network transmission
    and processing system to analyze collected information, make decisions, and transfer
    signals in controlling the functions of agricultural machinery. The actuation
    framework that includes digitized sowing and harvesting devices enabled with Geographic
    Information System and Global Position Satellite systems. Different crop, soil,
    and weather sensors are increasingly used in monitoring plant growth, diseases,
    pests, yield, weather variables (temperature, humidity, rain, air, etc.), and
    soil physical–chemical and hydraulic properties (Acharya et al., 2017; Sehgal
    et al., 2005). Sensors are used in real-time monitoring and reporting of agricultural
    parameters in the value chain, cloud computing, and integration of these processes
    with advanced technologies like UAVs and satellites to enable highly efficient,
    qualitative, profitable, and environmentally sound agricultural decision-making.
    Sensor-based data is also utilized in formulating predictive models to forecast
    crop yield (Supit et al., 2012). Some applications of IoT systems in digital agriculture
    are discussed as follows. 3.1 UAVs in digital agriculture Traditionally, satellites
    have been used to detect spectral responses from plants and soil (Dematte et al.,
    2018). However, satellite data is often of coarse resolution that is not applicable
    for canopy and plot scale applications and is not available regularly due to cloud
    cover and sensor property. UAVs provide a noninvasive and cost-effective approach
    to collect data at a much finer scale at the desired time scale. UAVs are defined
    as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft,
    its associated remote pilot station(s), the required command and control links,
    and any other system elements as may be required, at any point during flight operation”
    (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO). UAV-derived images can be processed
    to monitor and predict plant growth parameters, disease and pest incidence, yield,
    and different soil physical and hydraulic properties. Nowadays, smart technologies
    have been built into UAVs by integrating open-source technology, autonomous programs,
    smart sensors, and payloads (Puri et al., 2017). Different hyperspectral, multispectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can be mounted to the UAVs for
    near real-time monitoring of vegetation conditions, extraction of soil and vegetation
    indices (Ni et al., 2018), and predicting LAI. For example, multispectral sensors
    are increasingly used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index,
    normalized difference red-edge index, leaf water content index, soil-adjusted
    vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, tile drainage, and plant water status
    by capturing the reflectance including those in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave
    regions of the electromagnetic radiation (Tables 2 and 3). TABLE 2. Different
    sensors used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their advantages and disadvantages
    (Modified from Acharya et al., 2021). Sensors Advantages Disadvantages Red/green/blue
    (RGB) Portable, common, relatively inexpensive, provide high-quality RGB images
    for ortho-imagery and digital surface model, easy to integrate with different
    platforms Wider bandwidth and lower spectral resolution lack geometric and radiometric
    calibration Multispectral Multiple wavelengths allow geometric reconstruction
    and radiometric calibration Relatively costly, image processing relatively complex
    compared to RGB, radiometric, and atmospheric corrections may be required, limited
    compatibility to UAVs Hyperspectral High spectral resolution data across various
    wavelengths of the visible and near infrared spectrum Higher cost than multispectral,
    low signal-to-noise ratio, limited compatibility with standard UAVs and flight
    control software packages, radiometric and atmospheric corrections may be required
    Microwave High spatial resolution, useful under low visibility weather conditions
    (e.g., cloud cover) Sensitive to surface roughness Thermal Sense a wide range
    of temperatures, relatively cheaper Thermally sensitive, vignetting effects, low
    spatial resolution, radiometric corrections required, sensitive to change in surface
    roughness LiDAR Generates dense cloud points, high-quality data, direct geometric
    measurements Higher cost, limited compatibility with UAVs, requires ground filtering

    factor; NIR, near-infrared; R, red. There are several types of UAV systems used
    for agricultural applications (Table 4; Acharya et al., 2021). Two widely used
    UAVs include fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs (Dileep et al., 2020). Fixed-wing
    UAVs use airplane-like wings to generate lift and to move forward. Some of their
    properties include lower cost, higher endurance, and greater flight speed as compared
    to rotary-wing UAVs. Contrastingly, rotary-wing UAVs use rotor blades and are
    characterized by vertical takeoff and landing capacity, lower flight altitude,
    and lower flight speed. UAVs may be used for mid-season crop health monitoring
    of vegetative indices using near-infrared and other regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum that cannot be sensed by the human eye (Table 3; Cancela et al., 2019;
    Ren et al., 2020; Veroustraete, 2015). Pathak et al. (2020) reported the use of
    UAVs in spraying herbicides on up to 20–40 ha per day and to further eradicate
    farmers’ direct contact with poisonous chemicals and hazardous operational conditions.
    UAVs can be used to generate variable-rate application maps from the images to
    determine the strength of nutrient uptake in a single field. This has the potential
    to further minimize fertilizer costs and optimize crop yield (Kulbacki et al.,
    2018). UAV-based LiDAR systems and software have shown potential in stitching
    together thousands of high-quality aerial photographs to develop 3D maps for monitoring
    soil erosion and developing conservation strategies (Acharya et al., 2021). More
    recently, new types of aerial imagery and satellite (e.g., PlanetLab) have shown
    tremendous potential in monitoring crops, making informed decisions, and increasing
    yield (Cai et al., 2019). TABLE 4. Applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)

    software and Agribotix imaging for high-resolution aerial imaging and field and
    crop monitoring 3.2 Cloud-based information communication technology (ICT) systems
    The main purpose of cloud-based information communication technology (ICT) systems
    is to provide tools to software developers to develop a variety of cloud-based
    services to monitor plant growth parameters and predict crop yield (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012). This infrastructure consists of data collection, statistical analysis,
    and the creation of commands to control farming equipment. In a practical setup,
    data is generally transferred from a local farm management system to the cloud
    repository associated with the monitoring service in order to keep track of the
    farm activities. The data is subsequently analyzed by an expert online system
    such as an e-agriculturist, and outputs are made directly available to the farmers.
    An ICT system has three major components (Patil et al., 2012). The first is an
    information collection layer, which consists of a sensor-based climatic and agricultural
    dataset. Data may include but is not limited to air temperature, relative humidity,
    air pressure, atmospheric gas concentrations; names, models, and prices of agricultural
    products; operating status of agricultural equipment, and locations of agricultural
    products. The second layer is the transport or network layer, which is responsible
    for transmitting and processing data received from the sensor layer above. Finally,
    the application layer analyzes and processes information to cultivate digital
    awareness. One of the leading examples of a cloud-based ICT system is GeoFarmer
    (Eitzinger et al., 2019). GeoFarmer consists of a modular design, which is interoperable
    through an application programming interface. It follows open access standards
    regarding existing tools and technologies and the system is designed and developed
    in accordance with user needs. Further, the entire process and lessons learned
    in the development process are documented. Similar software architecture has been
    defined in FIWARE, an open-source platform for a smart digital future, which focuses
    on agricultural sensors with reprogrammable firmware and a set of interfaces already
    embedded in the General Packet Radio Service board. Cloud-based systems have been
    applied to monitor pesticide use and safety in vegetable crops (Qian et al., 2018).
    Interfaces of such systems consist of guidelines for pesticide purchasing and
    application, optimal harvest time estimation, and a feedback system formulation
    to monitor the health of vegetables. A mobile-based cloud architecture was implemented
    through AgroMobile (Prasad et al., 2013), which enhances smart agricultural practices
    with the help of image processing techniques, image visualization, and cloud-based
    data processing. A similar precision agriculture technique using cloud computing
    has been proposed in enhancing the capacity for special education leadership for
    aggregate farming in the cloud (Castillejo et al., 2020) to increase efficiency
    and productivity and reduce labor costs. Other applications include quality control
    in greenhouse production, and monitoring soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature
    in agricultural plots. 3.3 Big data in agriculture Big data refers to datasets
    that are too large to be analyzed by traditional data processing software and
    applications. The integration of big data technologies and best farming practices
    has the potential to facilitate improved crop production, plant protection, postharvest
    analysis, and environmental conservation. The major applications of big data in
    different topologies of digital agriculture are available from Sarker et al. (2019)
    and are briefly discussed here. The first application of big data is in precision
    agriculture. Thus, data collected using sensor-enabled hardware and software tools
    is used for assessing, controlling, and improving crop management, crop performance,
    and environmental quality. The second application is prescription agriculture,
    where big data is used to prescribe agronomic practices for optimizing yield.
    The third application is in enterprise agriculture, which includes the agribusiness
    platform and links field data to inventory, logistics, machinery, and profit.
    Finally, the fourth application is in automated agriculture, where farm data and
    environmental data are used to automate agriculture through robotic technologies.
    The data lifecycle in agriculture consists of data generation, warehousing, cleaning,
    annotation, and processing to optimize or improve agricultural production while
    maintaining the quality of the environment (Chaterji et al., 2020). In the following
    section, we briefly describe each of these steps. Data generation may involve
    the use of site-specific or public data. Site-specific datasets, such as soil
    nutrient composition and fertilizer usage, are generally privately held. Examples
    of public data may include topographic or soil textural information of a location.
    Data warehousing allows the data to be integrated from multiple sources and then
    restructured for improved performance. Data annotation is a data labeling technique
    that translates an encoded value to raw data. Because classical WSNs have limitations
    in interpreting and understanding the context of raw sensor data, annotation is
    highly recommended for end-user applications (Khan et al., 2015). On the other
    hand, getting rid of the corrupt or inaccurate values from the tables is a very
    important step in processing and helps to eradicate outliers from the dataset.
    Finally, processing imagery data results in more useful formats, which is largely
    accomplished by using a variety of analysis techniques such as Artificial Intelligence.
    Despite the considerable importance of big data in modernizing agriculture, a
    dearth of publicly available, high-quality datasets remains a formidable challenge
    to farming using alternate techniques. A combination of machine learning and IoT
    may be crucial in filling those gaps and in designing interactive wireless sensor–actuator
    networks for the commercial application of alternative farming systems (e.g.,
    Aquaponics) (Dhal et al., 2022a, 2022b; Dhal, Jungbluth, et al., 2022). 3.4 Digital
    twins in agriculture Digital twins generally refer to a digital replica of real-world
    entities mirroring their behavior and states over the entire lifetime in a virtual
    world. It is generally a standardization of real-world variables and can be used
    irrespective of place, time, and human observation (Botín-Sanabria et al., 2022).
    A digital twin in agriculture has been described as a multi-physical, multi-scale,
    and probabilistic simulation model of complex production. It uses a combination
    of in situ sensors and physical models to mirror physical life. Information from
    sensors and satellite data is taken as input to design digital twins (Verdouw
    et al., 2021) and is utilized in reproducing historical statistics and predicting
    future values. The process involves data integration, Artificial Intelligence,
    and machine learning. Digital twins show potential for aiding in planning and
    managing soil operations, irrigation, robotics, and farm machineries (Nasirahmadi
    & Hensel, 2022). WSNs in farmlands and cloud servers that run machine learning
    algorithms can detect plant diseases, weed clusters, and nutrient deficiencies
    (Angin et al., 2020). Indeed, significant progress has been made in using digital
    twins in the field of arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture,
    and livestock rearing (Howard et al., 2020; Verdouw et al., 2017). For example,
    digital twins have been designed to monitor the health of cows (Bos taurus) and
    pigs (Sus domesticus), model firmness and loss of vitamin content in mango (Mangifera
    indica), identify diseases and pests in olives (Olea europaea) and other crops,
    assist in fleet management and tracking machinery, and identify pesticide exposure
    in bees (Apis mellifera) (Pylianidis et al., 2021). These applications of the
    digital twins within the agricultural sector have been observed in seven major
    fields: real-time monitoring of data, energy consumption analysis, system failure
    analysis and prediction, optimization of resources, behavioral analysis, technological
    integration, and virtual maintenance (Angin et al., 2020). More recently, the
    concept of digital twins has been applied in postharvest management by categorizing
    simulations into three stages: input, throughput, and output (Dyck et al., 2022).
    This enables monitoring of moisture and temperature of grain to ensure safe storage
    and movement within the elevator. Further, a sensor network could be used in storage
    to ensure the optimal quality of grains. 4 ADVANTAGES OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE
    The demand for agricultural products will increase as the global population grows
    and as climate change occurs (Bradshaw & Brook, 2014). IoT shows the potential
    to lower the impact of these challenges while meeting this demand for agricultural
    products. Indeed, IoT offers a potential solution to increase agricultural efficiency
    and productivity while saving time, labor, and money. Because of the cost and
    time effectiveness of IoT systems, the use and installation of IoT devices in
    the agricultural industry are increasing by nearly 20% annually and are expected
    to reach 225 million devices by 2024 (Elijah et al., 2018). In addition, the expansion
    of cellular service and 5G connectivity introduced by satellite and cellular network
    companies in rural areas have boosted the use of IoT in recent years (Di et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2022). The advancement of IoT connectivity to personal and
    portable electronic items, such as cell phones, iPads, and tablets, along with
    the introduction of advanced WSNs and machine learning facilitates real-time data
    retrieval, processing, and decision-making. The advantages of IoT in agriculture
    include interoperability, wide advantages of WSN, and data management using cloud
    and fog computing. In the following section, we discuss these advantages in detail.
    4.1 Interoperability The data collected through WSNs and sensor nodes is made
    available using apps, equipment, and products to communicate and process them
    in a way that does not require any involvement from end users, which is called
    interoperability (Tzounis et al., 2017). In other words, interoperability is the
    data communication approach that allows using different information systems to
    transfer and comprehend information. The interoperability process consists of
    two methods. The first method makes the data available through a local area network
    or a wide area network. The second method shares the data via software or hardware
    between different systems and machines. In the utilization of IoT, interoperability
    plays a vital role in facilitating and exchanging effectively organized data between
    information systems. Interoperability provides multiple benefits, such as system
    adaptability, better productivity, data unity, improved data protection, fewer
    errors, and lower data acquisition costs. The interoperability functionality includes
    three approaches, which include syntactical, structural, and semantical approaches
    (Aydin & Aydin, 2020). Syntactic interoperability allows the use of two or more
    systems simultaneously to communicate and share data even if the interface or
    language is not the same. Structural interoperability defines the standard data
    exchange format from one system to another to understand the information clearly.
    Moreover, semantic interoperability allows connecting two or more systems and
    sharing data between them in a meaningful way. 4.2 Smart irrigation and decision
    support The use of sensors and communication technologies, microcontrollers, and
    actuators has the potential to improve water use efficiency, reduce the cost of
    irrigation, and increase crop productivity (Abbasi et al., 2019). For example,
    UAVs are increasingly used in monitoring plant water use efficiency, which provides
    a base to select plant varieties for breeding and crop improvement, particularly
    in water-limited systems. Soil moisture sensors using capacitance or frequency
    domain technology are able to continuously monitor soil moisture in determining
    irrigation rate and time. Farmers may use mobile phones or wireless personal digital
    assistants to remotely control data loggers and monitor and analyze moisture for
    irrigation scheduling and automation. The applications of different machine learning
    algorithms in developing irrigation support systems are shown in Table 5. The
    irrigation DSS allows a weekly schedule to meet the irrigation water needs of
    a plantation based on inputs to a data-driven model. Some automated and smart
    irrigation systems using WSN, the Internet, cloud computing, and optimization
    tools are discussed in Krishnan et al. (2020) and Ramachandran et al. (2018),
    among others. TABLE 5. Application of machine learning techniques as decision

    Output variable: Irrigation schedules Machine learning model: Linear regression,
    random forest regression and support vector regression Torres-Sanchez et al. (2020)
    4.3 Smart greenhouse One application of WSNs includes the conversion of a traditional
    greenhouse into a “smart greenhouse” (Kodali et al., 2016). The sensors automatically
    adjust the greenhouse climatic conditions, such as air pressure, relative humidity,
    air temperature, and light conditions, according to a particular set of instructions.
    The real-time greenhouse environment may be monitored via email and SMS alerts
    on mobile phones. For example, the installation of soil moisture sensors in the
    greenhouse activates an irrigation system only when the soil is dry. Recently,
    the use of solar-powered IoT sensors (Hou & Gao, 2010) has made building smart
    greenhouses an inexpensive and popular choice. 4.4 Data management With an increase
    in the application of IoT in multiple sectors and high-performance computing trends,
    the conventional database system has failed to meet the need and demand for massive
    sensor-derived data storage. In this regard, cloud base and fogging data storage
    in IoT platforms play a vital role in managing, transferring, and analyzing data
    into meaningful information using analytical tools. Cloud and fog computing have
    their characteristics to process data burdens and preferences, but they supplement
    each other. Using predictive analytics, a farmer could better predict weather
    conditions, maintain crop quality, and enhance soil fertility to formulate better
    plans and decisions related to crop harvesting and enhance crop quality and productivity.
    4.4.1 Cloud computing Cloud-based data management provides an option for computing
    resources on a pay-per-use basis. It is an extension of cluster and grid computing
    that collects resources at one central place and utilizes them for high-performance
    computing employing wireless connections (Qian et al., 2009; Armburst et al.,
    2020; Dillon et al., 2010). Such a computing system could be divided into two
    parts: front end and backend. The front end consists of client devices, such as
    computers, cell phones, tablets, and iPads, whereas the backend consists of data
    storage and processing located far away from the client. Cloud computing architecture
    provides three types of services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    PaaS, and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Dempsey & Kelliher, 2018; Jagli et al.,
    2018; Laghari et al., 2016). IaaS platform is a remote data center that provides
    the right to change or configure storage capacity, processing power, and networking
    to their needs. PaaS provides a development platform for an application developer
    to create, test, and launch an application. SaaS deals with ready-made software
    tailored to various business needs and customer services. Cloud technology is
    also used to deliver mobile applications and is called mobile cloud computing
    (MCC). This method handles the information and relocates the storage from mobile
    devices to intense and centralized computing platforms situated in the cloud (Huang,
    2011). MCC takes the pressure off mobile devices by harnessing the power of cloud
    infrastructure. Many cloud service providers are compatible with Windows or Linux
    operating systems, such as Amazon Web Service, Server Space (ITGLOBAL), Microsoft
    Azure (Microsoft Corporation), Google Cloud Platform (Google LLC), IBM Cloud Services
    (International Business Machines Corporation), Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe Inc),
    and Dropbox (Dropbox Inc). 4.4.2 Fog computing The motivation behind fog computing
    is the need for real-time computing. It is an extension of cloud computing that
    consists of multiple edge nodes directly connected to the physical device. As
    the nodes are physically much closer to the device, it seems more advanced and
    provides better performance than cloud computing for handling user requests and
    emerging standards (Atlam et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017). Fog computing can
    include cloudlets, a small-scale and robust data center located at the edge of
    the network system to perform computation without sending it to a distant server.
    Thus, fog computing acts as an intermediary between computing hardware and a remote
    server, controls the information being sent to the server, and processes it locally.
    It supports heterogeneous devices to provide greater interoperability than cloud
    computing. However, the security and privacy concerns in Fog computing are big
    issues due to the prevalence of wireless networks from a business point of view
    compared to cloud computing and deserve further research (Khan et al., 2017).
    Because of attacks, such as jamming attacks, and sniffer attacks, numerous organizations
    are focusing on considerable research on the security issue of Fog computing,
    including Cisco, Microsoft Corporation, ARM Holding Plc, and Dell Inc. Farmers
    benefit from cloud and fog data management by registering into the system application.
    The application is often designed to store farmers’ details, agronomic marketing
    details, agronomic vendors, and agricultural service providers, such as fertilizer,
    pesticides, seed, and equipment, and information on the government''s scheme.
    Indeed, cloud and fog data management systems have both advantages and disadvantages
    (Table 6), which largely determine the choice of using one over another. TABLE
    6. Pros and cons of cloud and fog computing in Internet of Things (IoT). Cloud
    for IoT Fog for IoT Pros Cons Pros Cons Improved performance between IoT sensors
    and data processing system High latency because of the distance between client
    devices and data processing centers Low latency because users are geographically
    closer to Fog to get an instant response A more complicated system in data processing
    and storage/decentralized computing Storage capacity can be scalable to store
    and share enormous amounts of data Downtime due to interruption in network and
    multiple connected channels No issues with bandwidth and connection because multiple
    interconnected channels are involved in sending the data Additional expense requires
    routers, hubs, and gateways Virtual processing capabilities on demand via remote
    data center Security and privacy could be limited because thousands of gigabytes
    of data are being transferred simultaneously High security because numerous nodes
    are involved in the complex distribution system Potential for cyberattacks, such
    as jamming and sniffer due to the extension of network''s edge Reduced cost because
    of lower licensing fees than the cost of equipment and maintenance Rescheduling
    of failure management is slow Power efficiency and improved user experiences because
    each node runs efficiently and provides instant response to the users Limited
    scalability—because it cannot be scalable as the cloud 5 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
    OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE Data-driven agricultural practices are largely focused
    on precision, predictive, smarter, and efficient farming practices with minimal
    use of resources and enhanced agricultural automation (Ayaz et al., 2019; Patil
    et al., 2012). Therefore, the usage of IoT in agriculture is inevitable with the
    increasing demand for food, land, and changes in climatic conditions. However,
    IoT in agriculture presents several challenges. These challenges and opportunities
    are observed at different levels of data handling and analysis: Collection, data
    transmission, processing and storage, and the application of the data inferred
    (i.e., inference drawn from available data without much expense of resources;
    Tzounis et al., 2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 5.1 Data collection
    Different IoT sensors are typically designed for a particular agriculture practice
    (Dholu & Ghodinde, 2018). The use of such sensors in different locations and climates
    is often challenging and may require either modification in design or further
    calibration. An ideal sensor should be user-friendly, efficient, robust, and able
    to withstand variable weather conditions. Although experts in the field can set
    up, install, and connect equipment, the application of data by farmers on day-to-day
    basis demands skills and training. The collection of real-time data is increasingly
    important in precision farming and requires an active Internet connection, which
    further presents a major challenge in IoT applications in underdeveloped countries
    and rural areas in the United States (Federal Communications Commission, 2020).
    Although IoT has been widely used in the field of precision agriculture, only
    proprietary solutions are currently being implemented, which creates difficulties
    with device compatibility and connectivity. There is a pressing need to discover
    other approaches that employ interoperable hardware built on open standards and
    platforms. Lower priced alternatives to expensive proprietary solutions can be
    found in the form of many already available products that are built on open hardware,
    at least in part (Stočes et al., 2016). Scaling up the use of integrated IoT technologies
    beyond early adopters is important, especially by making existing solutions easier
    to use and more affordable, thereby improving their selection and use by farmers
    and food companies. Therefore, business models that work for small companies and
    systematic analysis of associated costs and benefits may be necessary. More effort
    is necessary in improving the utilization of IoT technologies in a wide range
    of climates, crops, and soils. Efforts could be centered on the development of
    IoT devices for harsh environments (open air, dirt, dust, moisture, animal manure,
    cold storage, hot cleaning treatments, etc.) and for natural objects (plants,
    animals, square meters of soil, perishable food products), which have limited
    ways to embed IoT devices in the objects themselves. This is especially true for
    devices that use new technologies because there has already been a lot of progress
    in adapting more mature technologies (Verdouw et al., 2017). Indeed, IoT includes
    a large variety of heterogeneous devices; therefore, it is challenging to achieve
    high levels of compatibility among devices if they employ dissimilar standards
    and protocols. In order to overcome such obstacles, standard IoT protocols ought
    to be designed (Abbasi et al., 2019). There are several challenges associated
    with UAV deployments in the agricultural sector, including limited flight durations
    (<1 h), small coverage area, high costs, large amounts of imagery data resulting
    from flights, and geometric and radiometric correction issues. Further, UAVs could
    interfere with civilian aircraft and generate safety issues. There are often stringent
    national laws issued by aviation authorities in each country regarding flying
    UAVs. Typically, the only permission granted is for educational or experimental
    purposes. In the United States, the maximum flight altitude is 120 m above ground
    level, and UAVs are not permitted to fly at night. Finally, processing large volumes
    of imagery data requires special skills, time, and software, often demanding the
    use of machine learning, communication technologies, and data repositories. 5.2
    Data transmission, storage, and processing IoT systems must communicate, store,
    and process the data they have acquired. Data transmission is made feasible with
    adequate connectivity. Many parts of the world, including the United States, have
    poor or no broadband and Internet connection. A significant obstacle to IoT applications
    is the access to internet. Presence of agricultural fields in distinct locations
    limits Internet use and other connectivity (Antony et al., 2020). The data collected
    from one agricultural landscape is often not applicable in other areas. Although
    proper storage and security of the collected data are important, the cost of storage
    and further analysis and processing of stored data to develop an inference for
    its application in the fields remains challenging. New technologies, such as Starlink
    (https://www.starlink.com), free TV band/channels, and other communication channels,
    could be exploited to substitute Internet at remote locations. Further, it is
    important to consider human factors when sharing and communicating information
    between farms, regions, and enterprises. 5.3 Data security Security of routing
    protocols is a major challenge in WSNs. Privacy issues in WSNs are either data-oriented
    or context-oriented. The former is largely associated with handling, preserving,
    and integrity of datasets. The latter deals with contextual information like location
    and time (Abbasi et al., 2019). Indeed, data security, anonymity, and privacy
    present both formidable challenges and opportunities to coordinate data transfer,
    availability, and usability securely for both small and large stakeholders. Agricultural
    data can be difficult to mine because of its volume, noise, gaps, and heterogeneity.
    This, however, provides opportunities for data imputation, standardization of
    IoT, integration of multiple domains, and collaborative research in sensor and
    communication technologies (Abbasi et al., 2019; Verdouw et al., 2017). There
    are opportunities for developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through
    new sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remotely sensing vehicles,
    communication technologies, and deep learning methods. 5.4 Application of the
    inferred data IoT provides a foundation for smart logistics, intelligent transportation,
    and affordable agricultural application to address climatic challenges, improve
    resource utilization and efficiency, and increased productivity (Chen & Jin, 2012).
    However, challenges remain in efficient data transmission systems and adaptation
    of outputs by farmers. Indeed, farmers must be technology savvy to understand
    and utilize information. Certain changes may be necessary at farmers’ fields,
    which may incur additional expenses for data collection or processing. Rural farmers
    are often hesitant to adopt new technology. The use of IoT in agriculture is challenging
    due to the complexity of agricultural fields and farming operations. Research
    in IoT is often constrained by short-term funding; thus, limiting data collection
    processes. Antony et al. (2020) reported that 2 to 3 years of funding in the agriculture
    sector is relatively ineffective as plants’ cropping cycle may vary with weather
    conditions. However, the need to feed the growing population has bestowed opportunities
    in utilizing recent advances in IoT (Mahanta et al., 2022) in greenhouse farming,
    vertical farming, hydroponic, and plant phenotyping. Nevertheless, we see a plethora
    of opportunities to utilize WSNs, digital twins, machine learning, and cloud computing
    in soil and crop monitoring, irrigation scheduling, water quality analysis, plant
    breeding, weed control, disease, and pest identification, pesticide spray, reuse
    and recycling of wastes, and livestock management. 6 CONCLUSION This paper reviewed
    the application of different IoT platforms, WSNs, and technologies like UAVs,
    cloud computing, and big data analytics in agricultural production systems and
    value chains, such as crop monitoring, irrigation support, weed and pest control,
    fertilizer application, and soil health assessment. The literature, in general,
    indicates the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and machine learning
    in automated and smart irrigation systems and agricultural decision support. Different
    red, green, and blue, hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR sensors could be
    mounted on UAVs for improved agricultural monitoring and forecasting to enable
    highly efficient, qualitative, and profitable farm products. Big data, data mining,
    and real-time analysis show promise to support and improve precision, prescription,
    enterprise, and automated agriculture. Cloud and fog data storage in IoT platforms,
    however, appear to be crucial in managing, transferring, and analyzing big agricultural
    data. This review also reveals opportunities in improving data security, anonymity,
    and usability, and developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through new
    sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remote vehicles, communication
    technologies, and deep learning methods. Overall, IoT can improve production levels,
    cost-effectiveness, product quality, safety, and traceability through innovation,
    automation, and control while advancing the much-needed digital transformation
    of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

    of decreased sizes and weights concentrated charges and amplified functionalities
    of various sensors and devices. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are attracting progressively
    general trendy varied variety of internal submissions (atmosphere monitoring,
    surveillance, photography, search-and-rescue, etc.) [1]. Through the marketplace
    develops and the diversity of applications increases, additional necessities are
    present-day being compulsory in spreading the flight variety and growing adaptability
    toward complex assignments of UAV structures [2]. UAV stands for Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle, which is commonly considered to be a drone or an aircraft with no pilot
    on board. UAVs can be remote-controlled aircraft [3]. The unmanned aerial vehicle
    contains cameras, sensors, communication belonging as well as other payload devices
    [4]. It was created for military usage, and civilian usage to protect the border.
    UAVs are widely used in the military [5]. Unmanned aircraft system manufacturing
    was started by the United States department of defense (DOD) in 2005 [6]. Presently,
    leading UAV manufacturing countries are the USA, Israel, China, Iran, and Russia
    [7]. Rustom series of Indian UAVs are under development [8]. The Building of a
    UAV is easier, it is less expensive and it can be created at a reasonable price.
    UAVs are made of essential components. There are two categories of UAV. ü Fixed
    Wing UAV ü Rotatory wing UAV Fixed and Rotatory wing UAV consists of their strength
    and weakness. 1.1. Fixed wing UAV Fixed-wing UAV drones have gained popularity
    in military and defense applications, and fixed-wing has high speed and heavy
    payload [9]. They are not suitable for stationary applications, because fixed-wing
    UAVs can''t do a close inspection. Fixed-wing UAV drones use a wing to lift themselves
    in the sky. Fixed-wing drones only use energy to go in a particular direction
    rather than remaining in one place in the air. The fixed-wing drone can go on
    long distances and cover larger areas. And fixed-wing UAV drone can spend up to
    16 h time in the sky because a fixed-wing UAV drone uses a gas engine rather than
    using an electric engine. 1.2. Rotatory wing UAV Rotatory-wing UAVs is known as
    quadcopters, hexacopter, tricopter, and helicopter are the kinds of rotatory wing
    UAV [10]. Rotatory wing UAV drone is designed for monitoring the ground situation
    from the air, for instance, detecting and tracking border state, surveillance
    of military equipment, and so on [11]. It has been specially created for remote
    surveillance. Rotatory-wing UAV drones have limited speed and payload rather to
    fixed-wing [12]. They can stay in a stationary position in the sky. This UAV can
    do a close inspection. The choice of UAV depends on the uses. UAVs are demonstrated
    to be a greatly adaptable stage for a variety of applications [13]. With propels
    in computation, sensor, communication, and organizing advances, the utilization
    of UAVs for military and civilian regions has gotten to be greatly well-known
    within the last two decades [14]. It could be a moderately simple errand to utilize
    UAV in an unmanned aerial framework for expanding communications extend and information
    conglomeration capability. For occasion, if all communication frameworks are destroyed
    in a perilous zone, and there is a sudden got to make organize between rescue
    groups, at that point UAV can effortlessly be utilized as a communication transfer
    between rescue groups to successfully arrange the rescue. This paper will address
    the topic of UAV and the start of the art of UAV. Further, it will explore UAV
    communication system design, a ground control station (GCS), sensor-based data
    processing, applications, and security. Limitations of previous work and challenges
    of future work are also discussed. Further, we discuss open research issues for
    future research direction and development in the field of UAV systems. This paper
    is organized into 8 sections. Section 2 is based on the UAV communication system,
    and Section 3 provides details of how UAVs are controlled by the ground control
    system. Section 4 provides data collection from sensors and processing by using
    UAV, Section 5 presents the detail of applications, and Section 6 is based on
    security. Section 7 provides an open research issue, and finally, in Section 8
    we conclude our work. 2. UAV communication system UAVs are made out of an assortment
    of fundamental parts [15]. While all segments agreeably play out a particular
    reason that adds to operational flight, the most significant segment is the interchanges
    frameworks. UAV interchange frameworks help rambles and their administrators to
    accomplish their ideal outcomes. Without these frameworks, not exclusively would
    unmanned flight be viewed as ridiculous, however, it would likewise make gathering
    and transmitting flying visuals and correspondence information unimaginable [16].
    As UAVs keep on situating themselves as the prevalent airborne information assortment
    stage over a wide assortment of ventures, their interchanges frameworks develop
    relatively insignificance. Without exceptionally versatile and solid interchanges
    frameworks, administrators are left with a distinct weakness in getting flying
    visuals and information [17]. The way things are, RF correspondences are the most
    enhanced answer for dependable UAV interchanges frameworks [18]. A mix of their
    little size, weight, limited force utilization, and strong correspondence interface
    makes them the most appropriate answer for most non-military personnel UAVs. Regular
    citizen UAV correspondences frameworks normally work on frequencies of 2.4 GHz
    and 5.8 GHz [19]. UAV correspondence frameworks work by utilizing one recurrence
    to control the elevated vehicle starting from the earliest stage of a remote pilot
    while the other recurrence is utilized to the bar or hand-off First-Person View
    (FPV) video. By using high-caliber, solid interchanges join, regular citizen UAVs
    can hand off airborne visuals and information to those on the ground easily, while
    as yet staying in flight. In resistance applications, various sorts of automatons
    are executed. Resistance rambles fluctuate extraordinarily from non-military personnel
    UAVs, as their missions are much of the time longer in length or require striking
    abilities notwithstanding giving flying visuals of the combat zone underneath.
    One worry in the utilization of automatons in barrier applications is the event
    of sign sticking. At the point when sign sticking is utilized, this cuts the remote
    pilot and activities based on visuals of what the automaton is seeing. While it
    appears to be an appalling situation, most barrier rambles are built to come back
    to base after lost correspondence contact. Barrier administrators have discovered
    another answer for potential sign sticking – repetitive onboard route frameworks
    that do not depend on GPS [20]. By disposing of accessible GPS information, sticking
    turns into an inconsistent event, permitting protection automatons to finish their
    missions and come back to base securely. 2.1. UAV communication design system
    The subject of the plan is a lightweight hand-propelled UAV with the most extreme
    take-off mass of up to 7kgs [21]. The UAV''s reason for existing is insight, observation,
    surveillance, and target following for the help of detachment and friends activities.
    Back-to-back, the UAV will be outfitted with a balanced camera payload [22]. The
    knowledge and observation missions can be flown self-sufficiently, along these
    lines the payload symbolism and flight progress down-joins are the prime capacities
    (assignments) of a UAV''s correspondence framework Stealthiness of a UAV ought
    to be verified by its shape, shading, and insignificant warm and commotion outflows
    [22]. Since the lightweight UAV will have just short continuance in the zone of
    battle tasks because of the weight-limited onboard power accessibility, electromagnetic
    stealthiness is not envisioned. Counteractive action of disguise assault on UAV,
    along these lines, UAV control by substances with different expectations, counteractive
    action of assault on UAV correspondence streams trustworthiness, for example,
    counteractive action of information inclusion, change, reordering, answer or deferral,
    as well as protection of the correspondence classification (listening in) is foreseen
    with a reasonable lightweight COTS recurrence jumping handsets, and confirmation
    techniques between the UAV and its UC. • Parts Used for better UAV communication:
    • We want better UAV communication related to the situation, we will have to use
    the best part for great connectivity to reach the proper signals. Sensor: The
    sensor is better for our UAV communication application because this sensor is
    very small and lightweight and has less battery consumption [23]. ü RF communication:
    RF frequency converters and RF filters and RF Bi-directional devices are also
    essential for UAVs [24,25]. ü Antennas: There should be high-performance antennas
    for unmanned aerial vehicle platforms. ü Propulsion: Engines, motors, LiPo batteries,
    propellers, and so on, these accessories help your project in moving.. ü Drone
    frame: This frame is composed of nylon and carbon fiber materials [26]. Because
    of this, it is a stronger and more suitable weight. The most essential component
    is the communication system. The UAV communication system assists drones and helps
    the operator to obtain the desired result. If we do not use this communication
    system in our drone, it will be difficult for us to achieve unmanned flight. We
    cannot give information about aerial and visual communication without this communication
    system. And it will be impossible for us to transmit data by making a collection
    of data either without this system. The civilian UAV communication system operates
    on frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz. UAV communication system is work by using
    frequencies to control the aerial vehicle from the ground. The author discussed
    the services of the UAV so that the Aerial communication platform can work on
    the UAV, and it cannot support the transmission of information in the Internet
    of Things (IoT) [27]. However, it consumes less power in wireless devices. On
    the other hand, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) can be enabled
    in the network where two subcarriers can be divided into transmission information
    and energy harvesting. The OFDM can UAV-Enabled network, so the sub-carriers are
    shared within two groups for transmitting the information and energy reaping.
    Similarly, Simultaneously Wireless Information and Power Transfer SWIPT technology
    is being proposed by the UAV trajectory and communication design scheme. Furthermore,
    the author used the divide and conquers technique to solve the original problem.
    The first Sub-Problem depends upon the user scheduling, subcarrier, and fixed
    UAV trajectory is enhanced power allocations. The second problem has a fixed UAV
    trajectory, which enhanced the user scheduling, subcarriers, and power separation.
    After that, both problems are solved step by step until the predefined accuracy
    is achieved. The author worked on the simulation results, so the proposed algorithm
    is working correctly. However, it does not guarantee the average harvested energy
    in the proposed scheme, but it also gives the best normal achievable rate compared
    to other flight modes. UAV enabled Network Communication for further consideration,
    where Employing Non-Orthogonal-Multiple-Access (NOMA) for many users [28]. The
    total power has been taken maximum and minimum ratio related to the total power
    and bandwidth with UAV height and width ray limitations. To solve the formulated
    problem, they have created the Path-Following Algorithm. Moreover, the Maximum
    and Minimum rates have been calculated for the orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
    and dirty paper coding (DPC), so the developed path following the algorithm has
    been solved. Furthermore, they have calculated the results, which show the NOMA
    outclass OMA and achieves results like DPC. After that, all parameters are connected
    jointly and observed together. When those results are compared with all parameters
    and make their interest in combined optimization, they have faced such types of
    issues and tackle them with inner convex. Based on these issues, they have proposed
    Path-Following-Algorithm for making a better solution. Regarding these solutions,
    they have collected positive and best results. An essential thing in these solutions
    they have used UAV-Enabled for physical layer security within the communication.
    They have focused on most of the things as necessary in communication. The UAV
    is driven by solar energy that enables multiple terrain users to use reliable
    communication services [29]. To enhance the system''s total performance within
    a specific period, they analyzed the 3D aerial trajectories'' standard configuration.
    The wireless resource allocation and initially considered an offline resource
    allocation method as a performance benchmark, presuming not having a considerable
    understanding of the channel gains. Algorithms are formulated as a non-convex
    mixing integer optimization problem that considers an ultimate energy storage
    capability, aerodynamic power usage, solar power production, and users’ quality
    of service (QoS) demand. Although the optimization problem has not been convex,
    it can be efficiently resolved using monotonic optimizations to achieve optimum
    3-dimensional trajectory and power and subcarrier allocation strategy and then
    concentrate on designing online algorithms where only real-time and statistical
    information about the channel gains are needed. The offline scheme drives the
    optimal online algorithm for allocating resources. It requires a high complexity
    of computing systems, therefore needed a sub-optimal iterative online scheme with
    low complexity, and based on successive convex approximation. The simulation outcomes
    show that both of the online programs provide a similar approach to the performance
    of the offline benchmark scheme and greatly surpass the two baseline schemes.
    3. UAV ground control station (GCS) Now missions are search-and-rescue and investigation,
    systems of UAV are typically obligatory to work in trendy complex environments
    although still presence able to preserve continuous communication with the ground
    controller station intended for the resolve of monitoring, reporting, and control
    [30]. Intended for instance, in high-density or precipitous urban areas, the communication
    between UAVs and the GCS can be effortlessly interrupted, producing the GCS to
    misplace real-time statistics feedback after the UAVs, foremost to task failure
    [31]. Besides assignment requires extended flight variety, the communication capacity
    also is intermittent by the detachment. Commercially obtainable up till now economical
    UAV communique solutions but have several confines that potentially delay their
    extensive application. Initially, the communication variety of main public UAV
    communication resolutions is reasonably short. Telemetry modules, for instance,
    3DR, XBee, Sik2, and extra Wi-Fi modules, which are mutual options for public
    UAVs, have communication varieties that are incomplete to insufficient kilometers
    [32]. Second, this one is problematic to find stable information links as soon
    as obstacles, for example, tall buildings, trees, or mountains distinct the UAVs
    & GSC. In circumstances discussed overhead, it can be problematic to broaden the
    mission through only one UAV organized, though keeping charge and organization
    intricacy necessities encountered. To connect the compensations of UAVs in the
    following circumstances and minimize problems at a similar period, a substitute
    resolution is to organize a multi-UAV organization, which might utilize inter-connectivity
    amongst manifold UAVs to preserve continuous statement among each UAV and minced
    control station. UAV communication transmits a solution that was established,
    that usages communication and directing to encompass communication variety and
    avoid problems by low-slung charge [33]. Impartial stood to progress and assessment
    proof-of-concept two-UAV organization, which established the capability to communicate
    wireless communication. This structure individually contained dual UAVs, then
    its strategy might put up adding additional UAVs. The edifice usages unique UAVs
    by way of statements to communicate a point and permits additional UAVs to function
    in parts wherever an unswerving message with a broken-up regulator cannot be recognized.
    This formation permits statements to stand recognized across difficulties or else
    ended reserve more than the diversity of the on-the-ship wireless transceiver,
    together that will be established in-ground tests far along. The distinctive application
    situation of the scheme is revealed. The organization uses a single UAV as a statement
    to communicate opinions and permits additional UAVs to work in ranges wherever
    communication through a pulverized regulator cannot be recognized. UAV stands
    for an unmanned aerial vehicle, this is a simple-view unmanned aircraft in which
    aircrew is removed and instead of its computer systems and radio-link are used.
    In reality, it is more complex than what is shown and this aircraft must be designed
    properly and perfectly for more efficiency. Although aircraft is the most important
    part of it. The main components of a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) are discussed
    below: • A Control Station (CS), which operates the system, actually it is the
    interface between the operator and the rest of the aircraft system. • The Aircraft
    carrying the payload which may be of many types. • The communication system between
    the CS (transmits control system input to the aircraft) and resend the data of
    payload (which may be of any type) to the CS (control station) this communication
    is done by the radio transmission. • Some extra equipment which may include maintenance
    and transportation items. 3.1. Development of GCS GCS is a system that is a human
    portable and easy-to-use station [34]. It is specially made for controlling the
    UAV and communication system and antenna. Its usual dimensions are 360 × 96 ×
    96 inches, triple-axle, A trailer is required which is used for loading and unloading
    the aircraft, and no other species used this trailer [35]. The trailer is consist
    of an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), an Environmental Control System (ECS)
    used for controlling thermal, providing air supply, and cooling, considering the
    main part of the aircraft, a pilot operator, a payload operator, workstations,
    synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Data exploitation, communications terminal, radio
    links, a camera for recording, because of the absence of onboard pilot on the
    crew, the camera provides the live imagery recording of all the missions. This
    camera is attached to GCS. Power to the GCS is supplied by either commercially
    available power or by 35 kW generators. The Pilot and payload operators (PPO)
    are the main part of GCS because they are providing a first-hand response to the
    air vehicle and sensory payload [36]. Data Exploitation Mission Planning and Communication
    (DEMPC) are used for communication [37]. The DEMPC workstations are used for the
    exploitation of data, mission planning, monitoring of the payload, and management
    of the system. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) works for monitoring and controlling
    the SAR data like limited exploitation [38], or the region-wise location either
    in which the region''s boundary vehicle is located. For voice/data Ground Control
    Station used High frequency, Ultra High Frequency, and Very High Frequency (HF/UHF/VHF).
    For hardware, connectivity stations used the TROJAN SPIRIT II satellite communication
    terminal. SATCOM is used for the intelligence connection of the GCS with the vehicle
    [39]. It has the feature of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) technology, using
    Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) so that it identifies the target from the aerial
    platform on the battlefield; it is controlled by the Ground Control System (GCS).
    It is the requirement of the military for the capability of finding the deep strike
    objectives. One GCS controls one predator. The basic plan was to make a GCS that
    controls the two predators at one time. One for Vehicles and one for Ku Band Link
    (it is the part of electromagnetic (EM) spectrum in the microwave ranges of frequencies
    from 12 to 18 gigahertz GHz), but it is not included in now a day''s plans. The
    development of the Ground Control System is now focusing on the ATR capability
    so that they are capable of imaging sensors onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) platform [40]. This system makes capable of the GCS giving Day/Night all-weather
    imaging at wide-area coverage to expect the search of the targets/enemies in any
    weather. It will be made by unique algorithms to automatically work with 99% efficiency.
    Now successfully Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is made that can detect and identify
    and locates six (6) high-value mobile targets at a time using a real-time strip
    map fine resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with onboard Automatic Target
    Recognition (ATR). The author has developed an android application named Ground
    Control Station, which displays an easy graphical interface for controlling the
    Unnamed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) [41]. In this application, the author has enhanced
    the quality of function so that the user can easily monitor GCS media. One of
    the most exciting things in GCS is to provide navigation information to easily
    find out the UAV device''s location on the map. After that, it can be configured
    as a flight controller like PID. For sending and receiving the data of both devices
    in half-duplex, the application can connect to the Multiwii-Flight-Controller.
    The author has tested the GCS, where he gets 96.12% data accuracy with a precision
    level of 0.7%. So the android application of GCS works accurately. Moreover, the
    GCS application''s detailed functionality is to navigate by showing the location
    based on one longitude and latitude data. After that, the GCS application has
    the IP Camera which can be connected through any local Wi-Fi connection. The author
    has measured the coverage of that Wi-Fi signal, so it found the low coverage where
    he has pointed some range like 0–100 m. The internet of things (IoT) has usually
    been a massive load of data and a broad range of coverage. Mobile-Edge-Computing
    (MEC) and UAV-Base Stations have recently appeared as exciting IoT technologies
    [42]. MEC-Based data processing network has been recommended. On the bottom layer,
    distributed sensors with local information produce raw data. UAV-BSs are used
    to gather data and execute initial data processing phases when moving as MEC servers.
    A central cloud obtains analyzed findings and carries out further assessments.
    The edge nodes can help stabilize delays to ensure data freshness for online processing
    requirements. Besides, restricted onboard energy also imposes limitations on the
    capacity to manipulate the edges. In low data rates, the amount of edge processing
    for energy efficiency is limited. With high data rates, bandwidth would be intelligently
    reserved for edge data deposition. Although hovering UAV-BSs has provided a broad
    and versatile range of services, this leads to a route planning dilemma. This
    issue is acknowledged, and comprehensive enhanced learning is applied in this
    article to design an algorithm for online route planning. Taking environmental
    measurements as inputs, a CNN network is equipped to forecast incentives for behavior.
    Its usefulness is confirmed in the enhancement of service coverage through simulations.
    The outcome would assist with the analysis of big data in future IoT [118,119].
    4. UAV sensors based data processing Within the UAV based information collection,
    there are three sorts of information are collected such as video stream, telemetry,
    and ancillary information [43]. Since the collected video is MPEG based encoding
    stream, to begin with, It should be encoded [44]. For the telemetry information
    which is recorded by GPS or INS (Inertial Navigation Framework) sensor, they are
    portrayed with a distinctive reference outline and require hence formally dressed
    [45]. Moreover, to pick up well-symbolized GCPs for move UAV framework or precision
    estimation of made orthoimage, the USGS DEM (Digital Height Show) and USGS DOQQ
    (Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle) reference picture, These are diverse in
    both outline venture and determination ought to be co-registered so that the intelligent
    estimation of 3D GCPS (Global Climate Points of view Framework) can be executed.
    Basically UAV is based on five sensors; 4.1. RGB sensor or camera Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAVs) is inaccessible controlling plane models and RGB cameras installed
    on the UAV, the cameras alongside the route sensors, Such as GPS or IMU constitute
    vital components of the UAV surveying system [46,47]. There are numerous ranges
    of RGB cameras accessible within the advertisement and are utilized for diverse
    applications. Selecting fitting RGB cameras for the installation on UAVs can be
    a key to victory. There are some common parameters for selecting RGB cameras.
    This incorporates the focal point of the camera (better focal point with less
    geometric mutilations), determination of the camera, and quality of Charged Couple
    Device (CCD)/Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) chips (pixel measure
    and clamor level). 4.2. Multispectral sensor or camera Multispectral cameras are
    lightweight [48]. They are one of the vital commonly utilized sensors in expansion
    to RGB cameras within the UAV sensors family. The work of this sensor is for experts
    on vegetation and agribusiness [49]. This camera is utilized to see the water
    level in farms such as leaf-level disease assessment [50]. An incredibly good
    thing about the multispectral sensor is to pick up information with tall determination
    (way better than 30 cm Ground Testing Separate (GCD)) that is regularly not feasible
    in conventional multispectral [51]. It is distinctive from RGB cameras, as a rule,
    multispectral cameras come with higher fetches due to extra equipment required
    for wiring extra groups to the RGB groups. 4.3. Hyperspectral sensor Hyperspectral
    sensors are utilized to capture pictures with hundreds of limit groups (5–10 nm
    transmission capacity) [52,53]. Most of the hyperspectral sensors are direct cluster
    cameras [54]. Hyperspectral sensors capture tall volumes of data which are greatly
    valuable for numerous applications [55]. More often than not, lightweight hyperspectral
    cameras come with half unearthly ranges (400 nm to 1100 nm or 1100 nm to 2500
    nm) as compared to aerial hyperspectral cameras. It is not troublesome for UAV
    based Hyperspectral sensors as with a few exertions in the flight plan and at
    the cost of the restricted ground scope. The determination of procured pictures
    can reach up to 2 cm to 5 cm levels or lower. 4.4. Thermal infrared sensor The
    sensor is additionally lightweight [56,57]. These are of the mid-range inactive
    sensors whose wavelength is between (3um to 35um). They are majorly utilized within
    the measurement of surface temperature and thermal outflows estimation. The fundamental
    issue of motor temperature and emissivity assurance is through the concentration
    and its conveyance. The utilization of thermal sensors is regularly utilized for
    real-time with an earlier choice of the qualified capture rate [58]. Thermal information
    can be utilized for numerous agrarian and natural applications and others utilize
    the thermal camera. Hypothetically, the geometric demonstration of a thermal camera
    is entirely proportionate to that of a standard point-of-view camera [59]. On
    the inverse hand, the warm film commonly goes beside a parcel of fewer textures
    than the RGB pictures and modern photogrammetry or structure from the movement
    strategy can come up short since of the deficiency of interest points. Subsequently,
    once the geometric perspectives of the camera square measure concerned, it''s
    counseled to claim an RGB camera stamp and stuck relative to the thermal camera
    and take pictures at the same time for the utilization of default the postures
    of the thermal camera. 4.5. LIDAR LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) Sensors
    are moreover known as one of the foremost exact ways for geometric information
    picking up [60]. These sensors are broadly utilized in ranger service, Social
    legacy, and Building Data Modeling (BIM). The portable, the scholarly world, and
    earthly LIDAR these days have been made in both the industry and the scholarly
    community. The GPS or IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors in UAVs are frequently
    wrong concerning the sensor determination, so that''s why the stage is additionally
    more unstable when flying. In this way, indeed with well-calibrated light-weight
    LIDAR sensors, the gotten reason clouds'' precision is generally low. It is detailed
    that profoundly exact UAV-borne LIDAR frameworks are as a rule coming with differential
    GPS stations [61]. Where the tall exactness GPS estimations are gain able. The
    fetching of LIDAR sensors is generally low. It is illustrated that UAVs are commonly
    used in several fields, and formation flights for UAVs are also steadily introduced
    [62]. However, several commonly-used UAVs are still hard to handle with the distributed
    theory of formation control. These models and control laws have been checked and
    validated in MATLAB/Simulink and exported to C++ code and implemented in the Qt-based
    simulation framework and Ground Control System (GCS) with the manual disruption
    of the communication. The simulation framework offers UAV state data, and the
    GCS depicts it as Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) for presenting state data and
    implementing control laws for formation flights. Any UAV can perform formation
    flights unchanged under centralized GCS control. The formation control algorithm
    is strongly correlated with the network topology, and a virtual-leader-based consensus
    formation control algorithm is implemented with a centralized structure. The GCS
    was responsible for the formation control algorithm and the surveillance of the
    UAV''s status to prevent collisions and act as an HMI to offer adequate user-friendly
    graphical user interface (GUI) information of UAV and minimize pilot workload.
    The UAV model and control algorithm was then translated to C++ code and implemented
    in the Qt-based simulation platform and GCS after validation on MATLAB/ Simulink.
    The GCS offers a user-friendly GUI and powerful management of UAVs. The isolation
    of GCS from the simulation framework enables it to be extended in the future to
    semi-physical or physical simulations. 4.6. UAV LiDAR sensor for forensic evidence
    detection UAVs are used for data collection using the LiDAR approach with high
    accuracy [113]. LiDAR systems in UAVs assist to improve the understanding and
    planning for urban infrastructure management and allow geometrical extraction
    and spectral detection. Photogrammetry is the study of science that measures photographs
    and provides information about the drawing, maps, and 3D models for objects of
    real-world scenarios. UAVs use LiDAR technology which uses Ultraviolet-rays, visible
    light, and IR light for close objects. The UAVs that used IR light for imaging
    are more suitable for forensic applications. UAVs having LiDAR systems are capable
    to collect high-quality photographs of the scene, and searching the evidence through
    videotaping for mapping and reconstruction of crime scene investigation. The conventional
    procedure of crime investigation is consuming time extensively, However, introducing
    the novel technique and application of UAV is a powerful tool for forensic investigations.
    The UAV can be used as a multipurpose tool for crime investigation through videotaping,
    photography, and searching evidence by examining the sites, and assessments where
    it is hard to reach, however, it is a tremendous technique to deploy the UAVs
    for forensic investigations [114]. 4.7. UAV swarm concept The UAV swarm concept
    presents a group of unmanned aerial vehicle UAV carries out robust operation in
    a self-organized way to complete the mission [115]. The current inclination of
    the development of UAVs and UAVs technology indicates that the swarm of UAVs spontaneously
    establishes communication, which is decentralized in nature. Several routing protocols
    and networking techniques were developed and studied to improve the performance
    of the network. To make ensure the stability, and dependability of unmanned aerial
    vehicles, numerous researchers provided different concepts, architectures, and
    topologies that have made significant progress for autonomous communication for
    the specific scenario. In addition, the strategies of UAV swarm collaboration
    play an important role in reliable communication. the decentralized approach to
    communication provides the platform for UAVs to communicate intelligently. Under
    the umbrella of decentralized architecture, the swarm of UAVs performs real-time
    communication in Adhoc mode by eliminating the restriction of communication range
    and infrastructure dependence. The decentralized architectures of a swarm of UAVs
    are single-group swarm ad-hoc networks (SGSAN), multi-group swarm Adhoc networks
    (MGSAN), and multilayer swarm Adhoc networks (MLSAN) [116]. The swarm of UAV communication
    made the progress towards cloud-based and satellite-based communication and triggers
    the information. The current trends of research focused on the security area of

    Fig. 4. UAV Swarm Concept [116]. 5. UAV applications After the invention of UAVs
    or drones, there is a dramatic change in some industries and businesses and this
    made so many works, procedures, and difficult things too easy. If we say that
    now drones can make your business, and your daily life work and some rescue organizations
    are widely used in the military for monitoring and some other purposes. 5.1. Aerial
    photography Drones are now widely used for capturing footage that can do the same
    work, which was done by highly expensive helicopters and cranes [63]. Fast and
    4k cameras, action cameras, and sci-fi scenes are filmed by aerial drones, making
    all this capturing and all other cinematography easier. This UAV or Drone flying
    device is also widely used for real estate and sports photography purposes. Journalists
    are now also taking this under consideration the usage of drones for capturing
    footage and videos in live telecasts. 5.2. Shipping & delivery Big E-Commerce
    giants like Amazon, Alibaba, DHL, and some other big eCommerce and delivery companies
    are in favor of drone delivery [64]. UAVs can save a lot of time can deliver on
    time in a short period, and will not be affected by any traffic conditions. Besides,
    they can also be used for small distances to deliver small parcels, meals, and
    some other orders which must be delivered [65]. 5.3. Natural scenery The interesting
    application of the UAV is to capture the natural scenery and locations, which
    we cannot reach there or cannot climb over this like coastlines and beaches, tops
    of the mountain, and islands in the sea. UAVs are used to map large and huge crowded
    places [66,67]. 5.4. Management of disaster UAV provides real-time quick response,
    whenever there is a natural or man-made incident like something or any disaster,
    to monitor that place from an aerial view and can navigate for the injured persons
    [68,69]. The equipment and devices used in these conditions are at high definitions
    and are less with high definitions of cameras, sensors, and radars to give exact
    information or view to rescue teams. Since the large vehicles or devices are like
    a helicopter cannot reach in narrow or cannot get an analyzed closeup view of
    any place. 5.5. Agriculture purposes UAV technologies are now also enabling farmers
    and are dramatically changing the industry of agriculture by Lessing Agriculture
    with modern technology farmers [70,71]. Agriculturalists are now using drones
    and UAV devices to monitor their large widespread corps in a very cheap and very
    effective way and can also react to the health of any corps by getting alarmed
    to the farmers with the sensors, which are attached to the drones. According to
    some reports now 80 percent of agriculture will be monitored by drones and UAV
    devices. 5.6. Weather forecast Drones are also developed to use for the monitoring
    of dangerous and sometimes unpredictable weather situations [72,73]. As these
    devices are cheap, so they can be sent into tornadoes and hurricanes so that specialists
    and weather forecasters got some new insights into the behavior of weather. Sensors
    used in drones are helping to detail weather parameters and check the situation
    and monitor the weather. 5.7. Wildlife monitoring Wildlife monitoring was a headache
    to monitor a whole park or any forest to prevent animals to be hunted or any unpredictable
    situation, but UAVs made it easy to monitor a whole area within seconds or minutes
    [74]. 5.8. Law enforcement Nowadays UAVs are also widely used for maintaining
    the law and enforcing the situation in the city [75,76]. It helps the organization,
    which has the responsibility to maintain law and order to enforce the situation
    in the city with the surveillance of large crowds and to make sure the safety
    of the public. They also help them to assist in the monitoring of the very criminal
    and illegal activities and things in the city. 5.9. Entertainment UAVs are being
    used to develop and provide entertainment for users and people so that they can
    also be used in nightclubs and for some entertainment purposes [77,78]. More than
    those artificial intelligence-based drones are used in several ways to capture
    your videos and photographs from a distance and can also be moved as you will
    step forward or backward. Other applications of commercial UAVs are parcel delivery
    or mapping and rescue. The analysis report provided by Tractica that the usage
    of multicopters and drones will increase in the future in the cooperate sector.
    For the current year, they estimate the market volume to be 392,000 drones worth
    US$1.6 billion. Sales and revenue are set to multiply by 2025. North America is
    by far the largest market for commercial drones, followed by Asia and Europe.

    according to Tractica [79]. 5.10. Military purpose UAVs'' military applications
    are specific for different operations, which provide intelligence about combat.
    It is used the concept of a swarm of UAVs to collect information about military
    operations. Slight unmanned aerial vehicles are used for bomb recognition. These
    UAVs were developed by the US to alert the military to save human beings. It can
    be used for reconnaissance of foes'' activity. UAVs are very important to perform
    surveillance of the larger geographical area. The swarm of UAVs can be deployed
    in unsafe areas for provisioning information about the security. UAV technology
    is the economical solution for these military applications in modern times [117].
    The author has investigated the performance of their Small-Sized and Mid-Sized
    UAVs, which tends to improve the automatic process with a higher degree of self-independence
    [80]. On the other side, it improves system issues and closed system solutions.
    Significantly, the survey shows the machine''s performances from the sensor data,
    which assesses the limited inheritance of the algorithm, we''re changing the environmental
    conditions with different types of function variations. They have collected the
    results, which show not much better reliability. The author has investigated the
    performance, so they have mentioned some critical parameters for collecting results.
    They have made predefined parameters that can improve the results, and it is expected
    maximum performance. These results'' essential objectives are to enhance the quality
    of flight routes for the UAV and agree to permit efficient using the sensor system.
    The author has used the Pareto optimization method to improve the flight route
    and Pareto''s actual method, which has been set for the current flight. The author
    has discussed the development of a decision-making multi-UAV architecture in conjunction
    with real UAVs and WSN experiments developed as part of the AWARE Project [81].
    Various tasks have also been mentioned in this document, including multiple UAV
    surveillance, sensor deployment, and confirmation of fire threats. To avoid redundancies,
    only discrete features have been emphasized, rather than defining the complete
    architecture''s operation for each task. The objectives'' execution addresses
    core problems in multi-UAV systems, including the distributed allocation of the
    task, dispute resolution, and plan refining. A collaborative framework has also
    been introduced for multi-UAV coordination in challenging situations like disaster
    management and national security. The trials show that its enhanced architecture
    enables us to carry out a broad range of activities: tracking, deployment of sensors,
    fire recognition, and extinction. The incorporation phase of autonomous vehicles
    from several manufacturers and study groups was one of the architecture''s main
    features, which allowed various types of UAVs to be integrated with the least
    development efforts during the AWARE project. However, various tasks implementation
    and shutting and restarting of the HMI framework have not impacted the platform
    output because of the distributed decision-making system. Due to any communication
    layer constraints'' unavailability, collaboration between the UAVs could be achieved
    through a distributed approach. 6. UAV security The UAVs use network of a service
    provider for data transmits to the organization and from the ground station [82].
    These UAVs use different types of communication technologies such as GPS, Infrared,
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee, but these network technologies are open to security
    attacks from hackers [83,84]. Recent reports are proof that security attacks were
    launched on a UAV to control its interface by “channel hop” attack. The WiFi and
    GPS Jammers are also used to launch attacks to destroy communication of UAVs,
    such attach are GPS spoofing 6, which is used to fool the receiver of data by
    sending fraudulent signals [85,86]. It makes data distorted for the program, which
    is running the UAV or devices or terminal, which is associated to open Wi-Fi systems
    in airplane terminals, cafes, and preparation stations. It extricates client data
    such as usernames, and passwords. The level of attack will proceed to rise, and
    manufacturers, as well as governments, should make a collective endeavor to defend
    these frameworks against attacks. Besides, regulations on transportation ought
    to be executed to give security rules and preparation ought to be given to clients
    of UAVs. The security officers should be conveyed to maintain the security of
    these devices and civilians utilizing them. Better regulation and limitations
    on utilization ought to be upheld by UAV manufacturers on their items. Privacy
    of individual information should be kept up, and security should be regarded to
    maintain a strategic distance from interruptions. 6.1. Hacking methods The term
    hacking is referred to controlling another system or network to copy or destroy
    data or use it for its benefit. Hacking attacks are mostly applied on wireless
    networks, and different hacking procedures are used to control the UAVs of a legitimate
    user [87]. Few hacking methods and attacks are given. 6.2. Trojan horse virus
    It is another type of attack on UAV, it could be malicious software or code monitor
    activity on the network and have negative impacts by destroying hard drives and
    records of a system [88]. This attack has a high impact not limited to one system
    but increased rapidly and creates more destruction. It provides facilities for
    the hacker to control systems from a remote location. The most efficient way to
    avoid these hazardous attacks is by using malware software within the system.
    6.3. Distributed denial of service A DDoS attack could be a large-scale interruption
    strategy performed by a have source that causes negative impacts to legitimate
    clients by withholding services once the attacker picks up get to the system,
    modern instruments can be utilized to pick up control of the have [89]. Infected
    systems proceed to search for other vulnerable systems and attack them. 6.4. Password
    theft Password theft is another way of breaching of security of UAVs. Passwords
    are based on the 8 to 16 characters of the keyboard and, they may consist of words,
    special characters, lowercase letters, and numbers to ensure security [90]. This
    major problem is that complex passwords are difficult to remember. However, complex
    passwords are also difficult to crack. Dictionary attacks check for open ports
    and utilize a list of common words from the dictionary to perform the attack.
    6.5. Man-In-The-Middle attacks This type of attack is launched to gain control
    of two parties’ communication middle networks for a copy or modification of sensitive
    data [91]. The client does not know about data manipulation, which is performed
    by the attacker. Typically MITM attacks are based on the scam email to misguide
    the client or emails which misguide the client to a fake site [92]. Other forms
    of MITM attacks are URL manipulation, the rogue domain name server (DNS) and address
    resolution protocol (ARP) poisoning, and duplication of media access control (MAC).
    6.6. Intrusion detection systems This is another way of attack to enter the system
    without the permission of the owner and utilize the resources or block the resources
    [93]. The system will be cheated due to attacks and give access permission to
    an intruder [94]. Intrusion detection is the act of supervising and identifying
    indications of abnormal activity. Mostly firewalls, encryption techniques, and
    authentication methods are used as the first barrier to a secure system. 6.7.
    Defense against hacking Many techniques are available to secure the UAVs from
    threats or access to information from a hacker, and prevention or action can be
    taken suitable actions when found attacks [95]. There are few solutions are given
    in this section that will be used for enhancing the security of UAVs. a) Encryption
    b) Defense against DDoS c) Intrusion detection systems (IDSs). 6.8. Encryption
    Encryption techniques are used to change the actual text into an unreadable form
    to secure information on the network [96]. Encryption encoded data that only can
    be read by the actual user. It is used as an obstacle against unauthorised activities
    by hiding information about resources such as card data, social security numbers,
    and debit cards. 6.9. Defense against DDoS attacks There are many methods are
    available to avoid DDoS such as preventive and reactive methods [97]. The reactive
    methods are used to recognize the attack and then prevent the damage. They are
    also called ‘‘Early Warning Systems’’ A database of well-known attacks is used
    to compare and identify incoming attacks. Similarly, the author has presented
    a protocol that is based on a stochastic game-based model [98]. So in this system,
    security is a significant problem where it cannot be aware of the attacker''s
    information, so it was the author''s challenge. He has used false data injection
    attacks through the operator, but still, it was a challenge. Therefore, he has
    built the model as a Delayed-Action-Game (DAG), which can easily use off-the-shelf
    tools and overcome the security-aware H-UAV model. On the other hand, he has worked
    on UAV''s hidden information range. After that, he implemented that protocol on
    real human activity that can easily find the operator''s geolocation. Moreover,
    the author has implemented the machine learning technique inside his model, where
    it has collected experimental data, which receives the geolocation task and process
    it with their geographical features. The author has represented his unique H-UAV
    protocol through the case study. So, in this case, study, experimental results
    have been tested and operated by humans. Such type of experimental results has
    been evaluated with subjective feedback. The DAG has performed parallel computation
    so it can reduce the time of processing. 7. Open research issues UAV networking
    is an important part of the system, which must be able to provide QoS services
    but still, no efficient routing protocol is available for better path communication
    [13]. The energy efficiency-based multicast routing protocols must be developed
    for communication because a high amount of energy is consumed during the data
    transmission and reception, and during UAV hovering. QoS service delivery is a
    big issue in UAV communication, so future research must design and develop new
    algorithms to avoid delay and reroute [99,100]. Link constancy is also a major
    issue in UAV communication because of the hovering of the UAV system, it causes
    problems connecting every time with the base station further research work is
    required in the area to improve link stability [101]. Nowadays, UAV systems are
    used in real-time video streaming in sports broadcasting, and service delivery
    with quality of experience (QoE) to end-users is an issue for service providers
    [102,103]. The QoE domain is based on the user''s satisfaction, so every organization
    adds this feature to get feedback from the user to improve services for them,
    they will remain a permanent customer but adding a QoE domain in the UAV system
    is also a major issue [104,105,120]. In this regard Laghari et al. Proposed a
    QoE model for a UAV environment for QoS service delivery, however, the proposed
    model is not implemented in a real-time environment [106]. UAV systems use the
    battery for hovering and energy purposes, with the battery they have a short time
    for the flight and also power consumption in communication and video recording
    cameras [107]. Limited energy of UAV is also a problem for real-time streaming
    and monitoring so the solar-based body of UAV system will be a better idea to
    implement to recharge in hovering time so it will also increase the time of operations
    in agriculture field where work is held in the day time [108]. Ground station
    control Checks again and again the reliability of the network''s architecture
    and simulates the controlling of vehicles [109]. Control of better UAV systems
    required the development of more efficient algorithms currently available did
    not sufficient for this operation [110]. The GCS must notify if vehicles are in
    collision with each other or any other substance and guide for an alternative
    path to avoid a collision, this also required more power GCS which controls all
    information with the improved user interface [111,112]. 8. Conclusion In this
    paper, we reviewed UAV systems and communication design, and methods used to connect
    and send data to the ground station. Further, we discussed data processing via
    sensors and applications with security. We provide key definitions and concepts
    of UAV systems and details of the development of communication systems and GCS.
    We provide reviews and analyses of the security of UAVs and the types of attacks
    that are launched to disturb the communication of the UAV system. Finally, open
    research areas are given for further development of the UAV system and communication,
    which leads to better UAV technology for the industry. Authors'' contributions

  description: Climate and environmental changes, as well as conflict events and violence,
    can have compounding impacts on livelihoods and the safety and security of population
    groups, particularly when multiple events are interrelated, coincide or occur
    in succession. How people are impacted depends on where they are located, how
    vulnerable they are, and the magnitude of the hazard. Although a significant amount
    of geospatial data is freely available, there has been a lack of user-friendly
    data tools allowing for integrated data-driven assessments of these complex climate-related
    security risks. Strata is such a tool, developed by a multidisciplinary team and
    co-designed with practitioners in the fields of peacebuilding, climate adaptation
    and environmental conservation. It addresses the need for making visible the available
    climate and conflict data via a web browser and allows a high level of analysis
    and customisation by users. Here we describe the process of co-developing the
    principles behind Strata, the data aggregation framework used, and the choice
    of datasets. Example outputs for Somalia, the pilot location, demonstrate how
    data is aggregated to produce hotspot maps and how these provide information on
    where impacts relating to climate, environmental and security stresses should
    be investigated, at a range of spatial scales. We reflect on challenges in co-designing
    Strata and pathways for continued development of the tool. We also highlight how
    user insights can be incorporated in this and similar tools, to ensure actionable
    data-driven insights within the context of available data and understandings of
    impact pathways.

    and environmental changes, as well as conflict events and violence, can have compounding
    impacts on livelihoods and the safety and security of population groups, particularly
    when multiple events are interrelated, coincide or occur in succession. How people
    are impacted depends on where they are located, how vulnerable they are, and the
    magnitude of the hazard. Although a significant amount of geospatial data is freely
    available, there has been a lack of user-friendly data tools allowing for integrated
    data-driven assessments of these complex climate-related security risks. Strata
    is such a tool, developed by a multidisciplinary team and co-designed with practitioners
    in the fields of peacebuilding, climate adaptation and environmental conservation.
    It addresses the need for making visible the available climate and conflict data
    via a web browser and allows a high level of analysis and customisation by users.
    Here we describe the process of co-developing the principles behind Strata, the
    data aggregation framework used, and the choice of datasets. Example outputs for
    Somalia, the pilot location, demonstrate how data is aggregated to produce hotspot
    maps and how these provide information on where impacts relating to climate, environmental
    and security stresses should be investigated, at a range of spatial scales. We
    reflect on challenges in co-designing Strata and pathways for continued development
    of the tool. We also highlight how user insights can be incorporated in this and
    similar tools, to ensure actionable data-driven insights within the context of
    available data and understandings of impact pathways. Previous article in issue

    Earth Engine 1. Introduction Environmental changes, extreme weather events, climate
    change, societal unrest and violent conflicts are all stresses that can have large
    impacts on livelihoods and the safety and security of populations. These, often
    interrelated, impacts can be particularly severe when multiple events occur at
    the same time (e.g. Anderson et al., 2021; Leonard et al., 2014) or in succession
    (e.g. Haile et al., 2019; Lwanga-Ntale & Owino, 2020). How such events impact
    people and contribute to risk depends not just on the stresses (also called hazards)
    occurring but also on the exposure, capacity and vulnerability of populations
    (Lavell et al., 2012). Therefore, to manage and reduce the impacts of events it
    is necessary to understand both where people are located relative to stresses
    and who is most vulnerable. As the scientific understanding of climate-related
    security risks has steadily increased over the past two decades (von Uexkull &
    Buhaug, 2021), the demand has grown for more and improved science-based decision-making,
    project design and implementation (Council of the European Union, 2020; United
    Nations, 2021). If decision-makers and field practitioners are to be able to use
    information about stresses, exposure and vulnerability, it needs to be accessible
    in tools which do not require prior technical expertise or vast amounts of training
    to use. Co-designing such tools with users can ensure this is achieved and that
    outputs are easy to interpret and apply to decisions and projects. Tools should
    also be customisable, providing users with options to specify what data is used,
    how it is converted to outputs, and the temporal and spatial extent of the analysis,
    so users can access the information they require for their specific context. Data
    is required at different timescales, depending on the decisions being considered,
    from historical information to current monitoring and future projections. Online
    data repositories such as Google''s Earth Engine offer access to petabytes of
    geospatial data across more than 700 datasets (Gorelick et al., 2017; Ilyushchenko
    et al., 2020), many of which are pertinent to the topics of environmental and
    climate-related stresses, human exposure and socioeconomic vulnerability. Unfortunately,
    to use Earth Engine requires coding skills and knowledge of what to do with the
    data. Tools that help users access and analyse this data without requiring coding
    expertise, or satellite data processing skills, are therefore required to support
    the decision makers who could take advantage of such data. In addition, it may
    be particularly useful for tools to allow users to aggregate data and view information
    from multiple data sources at once. This would allow users addressing the impacts
    of multiple types of environmental and security challenges to identify where stresses
    and vulnerabilities converge in space and time. Enabling an understanding of the
    various risks and possibilities for response across disciplines is essential (Holland
    & Tye, 2016; Hughes & Rees, 2016; Kappes et al., 2012), especially for those working
    in climate security. With this background in mind, the United Nations Environment
    Programme (UNEP), in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh and Earth
    Blox2, developed Strata3 as a web tool to provide user-friendly access to data
    and provide an aggregation framework to identify and monitor climate and security
    risks. Strata is aimed at two main user groups: (1) environmental practitioners
    and policy-makers looking to deliver conflict-sensitive climate and environmental
    programming in conflict-affected and fragile regions; and (2) political analysts
    and peace and security practitioners looking to deliver climate-sensitive conflict
    prevention and peacebuilding initiatives. Strata adopts a “hotspot” approach to
    provide information regarding where environmental, climate, and peace and security
    stresses overlap with exposed and vulnerable populations. In so doing, it aims
    to support decision-makers in addressing potential impacts. These areas where
    multiple stresses overlap with high levels of exposure and vulnerability are referred
    to as “hotspots” in Strata. The focus is on using available geospatial data to
    monitor the current situation using as up-to-date information as is available,
    and with a key focus on incorporating satellite information, rather than to develop
    a predictive early warning tool. It provides “situational awareness” rather than
    being “predictive”. Our approach also aims to ensure a customisable user platform
    so that users can tailor the hotspot analysis to their local context of interest.
    The web platform itself has been developed by Earth Blox who specialise in producing
    tools that allow no-code access to insights from satellite and geospatial data.
    Strata has initially been developed for Somalia as a pilot study, with plans to
    scale to other regions. In this paper we describe the theoretical background behind
    Strata and its method for aggregating stresses with exposure and vulnerability.
    We demonstrate example results provided by the platform and reflect on the co-design
    process with users and ongoing development plans. In section 2 we describe how
    hotspot mapping approaches have been used in other tools and what lessons Strata
    takes from these. Section 3 provides detailed descriptions of the co-design approach,
    hotspot framework and calculations, indicators and datasets. A discussion of the
    types of results produced by the Strata platform are in Section 4, and section
    5 reflects on challenges in co-designing such a tool, how to interpret the results
    and how the Strata platform will continue to develop. Conclusions are in Section
    6. 2. Climate, security and vulnerability hotspot mapping tools Hotspot mapping
    has often been used to identify locations that are particularly vulnerable to
    climate, environmental or security impacts. The maps often display an index aggregating
    information across multiple datasets characterising the stresses and vulnerabilities
    of interest (de Sherbinin, 2014). Various approaches have been used to create
    the aggregated indices. Busby et al. (2014) assessed climate security vulnerability
    across Africa using a summation approach to show how many indicators had passed
    a threshold, across measures of resilience, population, climate hazards, and governance
    and political violence. Ide et al. (2014) assessed where high exposure and vulnerability
    to climate change and a high risk of violent conflict were most likely to co-occur
    across Kenya and Uganda. The indicator data was also summed but, instead of using
    thresholds, grid cells across the region were ranked into quantiles. Midgley et
    al. (2011) also used a summation approach to combine climate exposure, sensitivity
    and adaptive capacity data layers to map climate risk and vulnerability hotspots
    in Southern Africa. These approaches can result in outputs that are relatively
    simple to interpret. However, they can lead to areas being flagged as a hotspot
    even when no climate hazards are flagged, or where very small populations are
    located (Busby et al., 2014). This may be misleading when the hotspots are framed
    as locations where decision makers should direct their attention because climate
    impacts are expected to be greatest, but there is no climate hazard or a very
    low population. Thornton et al. (2006) applied principal component analysis to
    determine the most important indicators characterizing vulnerability to climate
    change in Africa. While this avoids correlations between indicators, the new indicators
    are independent combinations of the original set and are not easily interpretable
    by users (Thornton et al., 2006). Kok et al. (2016) used cluster analysis to identify
    patterns in vulnerability data and locations with similar vulnerability profiles.
    This can help policymakers to identify which regions are in similar situations
    and where successful policy interventions may be transferable (Kok et al., 2016).
    However, this approach can be very computationally intensive, which potentially
    makes it less suitable for a customisable online tool that may need to be updated
    regularly. There already exist several online mapping tools designed to monitor
    multidimensional sets of climate and environmental-related risks at scale. These
    risks include food insecurity (Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET)4),
    water risks (Aqueduct5), reductions in agricultural production (Anomaly Hotspots
    of Agricultural Production (ASAP),6 Rembold et al. (2019)) and drought (Global
    Drought Observatory7). Some mapping tools focus on certain countries or regions,
    providing data particularly relevant to that location, such as the Food Security
    and Nutrition Analysis Unit – Somalia (FSNAU) Early Warning Early Action Dashboard8
    and the East Africa Hazards Watch tool.9 A more global perspective covering a
    range of environmental risks is provided by MapX10 (Lacroix et al., 2019) and
    Resource Watch.11 Focusing specifically on climate security, the Strauss Center''s
    Climate Change and African Political Stability (CCAPS) mapping tool12 was designed
    to visualize climate security risks across Africa from 1990 to 2016. Additionally,
    the visual explainer “How Climate Change Fuels Deadly Conflict”13 provides a snapshot
    (as of 2021) of current and future climate risk and conflict globally, as well
    as more detailed case studies in Africa. These existing tools demonstrate a number
    of features which we have taken forward into the development of Strata, including
    the ability to view and overlay different map layers, enabling comparisons over
    different time periods, and providing personalised dashboards with summary information
    for a country or specific issue. These tools also highlight the importance of
    clearly showing how data feeds into aggregated indices. However, a key limitation
    of each of these existing tools is that they do not offer much scope for users
    to interactively customise the inputs, thresholds, or outputs in the calculations.
    Tailoring analyses to local historical, political, cultural and environmental
    contexts and conditions is critical for practitioners in the climate and environmental
    security field, as they have the expert understanding of the interactions between
    stresses and how these impact people and their security in each locality. Strata
    therefore not only addresses the needs of analysts and project managers in the
    climate and environmental security fields by providing near-real time climate
    security data analysis, not available elsewhere, but provides this with a customisable
    approach where users can interact with and modify the analysis. Additionally,
    Strata improves on how population exposure and socioeconomic vulnerability are
    accounted for in hotspots alongside information on stresses. In a review of global
    climate change hotspot mapping approaches, de Sherbinin (2014) noted that while
    many hotspot maps were produced with the goal of being used by policy audiences,
    they tended to lack a specific audience and were not developed in response to
    particular needs from policymakers. Conversely, Strata has been developed in response
    to demand from, and in collaboration with, climate security practitioners at a
    specific international organisation (UNEP). Further, the team consulted with a
    broad audience of stakeholders related to environmental and climate risk monitoring
    (89 stakeholders from 48 organisations during 2020), leading to a focus on practitioners
    working on the nexus of peacebuilding, environmental restoration, and climate
    adaptation as the main targeted users. Most importantly, Strata was co-designed
    with those practitioners to ensure the information provided is relevant to the
    decisions they need to make (further detail on the co-design process is in Section
    3.1). 3. Methods 3.1. Case study and Co-design approach To ensure a strong user-centric
    co-design approach and develop Strata as a relevant tool for decision support
    from local to regional scale, only a small number of countries were considered
    for the first version. Consultations included participants from Somalia, Haiti
    and Colombia. To develop the platform itself, Somalia was chosen because of (1)
    its long history of experiencing climate-related security stresses including drought,
    floods, food insecurity, intercommunal and political conflict, and terrorism,
    as well as a highly vulnerable population (Funk, 2020; Human Rights Watch, 2021;
    Maxwell & Fitzpatrick, 2012; Maystadt & Ecker, 2014; UNDP, 2012; UNDP, 2018);
    (2) its limited accessibility for field data gathering and thus its dependency
    on remote sensing; (3) yet easy communication with stakeholders and potential
    users in international organisations and civil society organisations through UNEP''s
    advisor to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM). Co-design
    with end-users can ensure tools are able to support decision-making, increasing
    user productivity and satisfaction (Trischler et al., 2019). Strata adopted such
    an approach to ensure the tool is informed by end-users'' needs and, in particular,
    incorporates their feedback on the framework, indicators and datasets used. The
    Strata co-design process (summarised in Fig. 1) included an initial survey and
    follow up semi-structured interviews identifying what such a platform needed to
    include and what types of decisions are typically made that could use the support
    of spatial data (March–April 2021). This was followed by five co-design workshops
    to collect input and feedback on the design and content of the platform, the choice
    of method and the user interface (May–June 2021). Later workshops provided a demonstration
    and hands-on testing of the platform to collect feedback on its usability and
    outputs shown to inform further development (October 2021). Potential users of
    the platform involved in this process included representatives from UN organisations,
    NGOs and research organisations (a full list of organisations represented is in
    Appendix A, along with a selection of representative quotes from the surveys,
    interviews and workshops). Download : Download high-res image (432KB) Download

    surveys, interviews and workshops with the goal of each activity and the number
    of participants involved. (Many participants attended more than one activity and
    so the total number of participants is less than the sum across the activities.)
    While this means that the indicators selected for initial inclusion in Strata
    were of particular relevance to Somalia, the development of the platform and the
    approach taken were designed to allow for simple extension to other countries
    and regions. The co-design process included potential users working in countries
    other than Somalia, to ensure that the framework developed would be relevant to
    other regions. The risk and aggregation frameworks are generally applicable from
    local to global scales and the indicators developed for Somalia were, as much
    as possible, based on timely geospatial datasets available for most parts of the
    world. 3.2. Risk and hotspot framework The Convergence of Evidence approach (Cherlet
    et al., 2018; United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, 2017) was developed
    to identify locations where land degradation might be occurring, based on where
    indicators relevant to land degradation coincide. In this approach, the output
    is a simple summation of the number of indicators that cross some pre-defined
    critical thresholds. Areas of concern are those locations where the most thresholds
    have been crossed. We adopted a similar approach for Strata. Strata''s scoring
    framework is based on the summation of “red flags” that occur wherever climate,
    environmental, or security indicators cross pre-determined thresholds (we define
    an “indicator” to be a quantitative or qualitative geotagged dataset used to monitor
    these natural or socioeconomic characteristics, based on one, or a combination
    of, data layers. The indicators and their thresholds are described in section
    3.3). This creates a map of aggregated stress based on the indicators chosen.
    The aggregated stress map can then be scaled to account for population exposure
    and socioeconomic vulnerability, scaling the number of flags according to the
    relative exposure and vulnerability of the population compared to the rest of
    the country of interest (Fig. 2). In this way Strata''s hotspot framework is based
    on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change''s conceptualisation of risk
    as the combination of hazard (here called stress), exposure and vulnerability
    (Lavell et al., 2012). The calculations for the exposure and vulnerability scores
    are described in section 3.4, and these scores are optional inclusions in the
    hotspot maps. Download : Download high-res image (441KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Hotspot calculation used in Strata. The accumulation of “stressors”
    is additive, whereas accommodating for population exposure and socioeconomic vulnerability
    is multiplicative, scaling the hotspots. Exposure and vulnerability scores are
    both optional inclusions. The scoring ensures that a location will have at least
    one climate, environmental or security stress in order to be flagged, but the
    likely impact of the stress(es) will be scaled according to population exposure
    and socioeconomic vulnerability (where reliable data is available). This addresses
    issues raised by Busby et al. (2014) who used a purely additive approach which
    led to locations being identified as climate security vulnerability hotspots despite
    having very low populations or having very low climate-related risk. The Strata
    framework implicitly assumes that a location with more red flags is an area of
    greater concern than an area with fewer flags. One of the key reasons for choosing
    this scoring approach was to emphasise that Strata is not designed as a predictive
    modelling tool. It does not present an unambiguously modelled quantitative index
    of risk, but rather is merely aggregating relevant indicators from disparate data
    sources to draw attention to areas where multiple stresses are co-occurring. Strata
    does not weight across different stresses, nor does it accommodate non-linear
    interdependencies between stresses, so hotspots are perhaps best considered as
    “areas of concern” rather than “areas of higher risk.” This does not exclude the
    possibility that hotspots are indeed areas of higher risk, but we caution against
    making inferences or quantitative comparisons between hotspots that may be driven
    by different indicators. Our ambition is that users will use the dashboard output
    to interrogate the hotspots so that they can see what is causing high scores.
    Their own knowledge and understanding of the context then allows them to interpret
    the hotspot in a more locally framed way. This transparent approach also allows
    users to account for the non-linear effects of risk themselves. The cascading
    effects of climate change on social and political realities, including, for example,
    relationships between climate change, natural resources, and various levels of
    human insecurity (including violent conflict) are an important area of discussion
    (e.g. Gleditsch, 2021; von Uexkull and Buhaug, 2021). In particular, while climate
    may have an impact on conflict risk, there is low confidence in how this might
    occur, and other drivers are perceived to have much greater influences (Mach et
    al., 2019). Consequently due to limited generalizable principles in this area
    (Mach & Kraan, 2021), Strata focusses merely on identifying where indicators reach
    relevant thresholds rather than implying pathways between drivers and impacts.
    3.3. Indicators Strata categorizes its indicators into four “baskets” (collections
    of similar indicators): (1) Climate and environmental stress; (2) Peace and security;
    (3) Population exposure and (4) Socioeconomic vulnerability. The indicator selection
    process included reviewing scientific literature for relevant stresses and vulnerabilities
    in Somalia (as the test case country), identifying existing indicators used in
    other similar studies, and carrying out a survey and semi-structured interviews
    with end-users. This process generated a long list of indicators that were then
    prioritized during co-design workshops with end users. Indicators were also compared
    to data available in Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017), and other online
    data repositories, to determine where datasets with frequent and automatic updates
    were available with options for simple and fast uploading into Strata. We particularly
    focused on using satellite datasets with high spatial and temporal granularity.
    Table 1 shows the final indicators selected across the three baskets in this first
    version of Strata. Further detail of the datasets and variables used, thresholds
    applied, and spatial and temporal availability of the data are provided in Appendix
    B. Table 1. Indicators used in Strata, categorized into baskets. Note that users
    can modify thresholds and directionality for each indicator as appropriate. Basket

    Key indicators included in the prototype version of Strata to characterize climate
    and environmental stresses were drought (both meteorological and agricultural14),
    floods, heatwaves, sea level rise, deforestation and land degradation. Where possible,
    datasets were selected to allow up-to-date monitoring of conditions (e.g. daily
    rainfall estimates for monitoring meteorological drought). However, where this
    data was not available, modelled probabilities of events were used instead of
    observations (e.g. flood likelihood). The peace and security indicators identify
    where past violent events and demonstrations have occurred to highlight fragile
    localities. We are aware that the state of peace and security is contingent on
    a great many other variables, such as underlying tensions, societal or institutional
    resilience, and external influences. However, the current lack and limitations
    of subnational, geotagged data and proxies for peace and security conditions restrict
    us from portraying a more accurate picture. Data and event categorization is taken
    from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED; Raleigh et al.,
    2010), as it records the widest range of violent events and demonstrations due
    to its low threshold for data inclusion, compared to other conflict datasets.
    Most other datasets have fatality thresholds (e.g. 25 battle-related deaths or
    more) or thresholds around themes of violent events (e.g. civil wars), which means
    they leave out various types of unrest and violence that do not meet their particular
    threshold. ACLED namely also captures non-violent unrest such as protests (these
    can indicate junctures or precursors in periods of disorder (ACLED, 2021)), and
    since ACLED has no fatality threshold, we can include conflict events in Strata
    throughout its categories even if no fatalities have been recorded. In accordance
    with ACLED''s conflict event types, Strata events include battles, explosions/remote
    violence, violence against civilians, protests, and riots. The population exposure
    and socioeconomic vulnerability indicators provide relative comparisons across
    the region of interest. Exposure is currently considered in terms of the total
    population. Vulnerability indicators provide a broad selection of possible drivers
    of vulnerability to climate, environmental, peace and security stresses, rather
    than focusing on vulnerability relative to particular types of stress. This ensures
    the hotspot calculations can be applied to a wide range of stresses. However,
    users are also able to include or exclude indicators according to their understanding
    of what is most important in each context. The role of socioeconomic factors in
    driving vulnerability to climate and environmental changes is well-recognized,
    as a lack of ability to access resources, power relations, and poverty place more
    strain on coping behavior (Adger, 2006). However, socioeconomic aspects of vulnerability
    can be difficult to measure, with data often unavailable at relevant spatial scales
    which necessitates the development and use of proxies (de Sherbinin, 2014). In
    particular, as there can be large variations in households’ vulnerability, data
    is required at higher spatial resolutions than national level (Thornton et al.,
    2006). While studies often use household surveys to capture sub-national variation
    in vulnerability (e.g. Okpara et al., 2017), these can lack wide geographic coverage,
    are not available on a regular basis, are rarely available in conflict-affected
    regions, and are often derived using different methods making cross comparisons
    difficult. Therefore, Strata makes use of pre-existing socioeconomic datasets
    with high spatial resolution and global coverage (such as population age distributions
    and travel times to urban areas) where possible, and includes proxy indicators
    to represent socioeconomic factors not otherwise directly measurable. 3.4. Thresholds,
    and exposure and vulnerability scores The thresholds that determine if an indicator
    is classed as a red flag or not are a key component of hotspot scoring. Strata
    provides default thresholds for each indicator, however users can also adapt thresholds
    according to their context and based on their understanding of the conditions
    under which they might anticipate different impacts. Fig. 3 shows Strata''s user
    interface, including options for selecting indicators and adjusting thresholds.
    For example, thresholds might be changed during different times of the year (e.g.
    dry vs wet season), during certain events (e.g. an election), for different countries
    or locations within a country, or for different impacts (e.g. thresholds relevant
    for different crops). Appendix B provides details of default thresholds for each
    indicator. Download : Download high-res image (769KB) Download : Download full-size

    can be added for each indicator (Green = Environmental and climate stress, Orange
    = Peace and security, Blue = Socioeconomic vulnerability). (For interpretation
    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    Web version of this article.) The type of threshold used varies according to the
    different types of indicators and data available, and for some indicators multiple
    types of thresholds could be used. These can be broadly categorized into: ● Absolute
    thresholds. For some indicators there is a fixed value set as a threshold which
    determines when particular stresses might be experienced; this value is fixed
    across all locations. This is relevant where there are thresholds related to specific
    impacts, or where fixed thresholds have been chosen based on literature. Examples
    include temperature thresholds for heatwaves, land height above sea level for
    coastal inundation, or the number of protest event days within the past year.
    ● Thresholds relative to past conditions. For many indicators, the threshold is
    set to flag conditions that are significantly different than the historical conditions.
    This approach usually flags occurrences that are outside a percentile range based
    on historical data for the location. These thresholds ensure that the actual value
    of the threshold varies according to the bio-climatic conditions in each location,
    rather than being set across a large area average. Examples include thresholds
    applied to the vegetation index to determine drought as low vegetation conditions
    compared to normal, or flagging deforestation rates that are higher than usual
    for the location. These can be calculated with a high degree of spatial granularity,
    as defined by the input data. The capacity of Strata to calculate the historical
    trends for given locations and times is one of its important differentiating features.
    ● Thresholds relative to other locations. In cases where indicator data is only
    available at one point in time, or is updated very infrequently, thresholds are
    set to flag the locations with the values corresponding to highest level of stress
    or vulnerability across the country at that time, therefore flagging locations
    that are significantly more at risk than other locations (at the time the data
    is valid for). This approach usually flags locations where data is more than a
    particular number of standard deviations from the mean across the whole area.15
    Examples include population density and travel time to urban areas, which each
    flag locations more than one standard deviation above the mean calculated across
    the whole country. To account for the population exposed to climate and environmental
    stresses and peace and security stresses, we incorporated an exposure score (see
    Fig. 2). The calculation of the exposure score does not have a threshold associated
    with it. Instead, we adopt a comparative scale to identify the range of exposure
    within the country. The population data (number of people per grid cell) undergoes
    log-transformation and is then scaled across the area of interest from 0 to 1,
    i.e. from lowest to highest population, and therefore least-to-most exposed areas.
    The socioeconomic vulnerability score is based on several indicators, each with
    their own threshold. As socioeconomic data is often unavailable with a historical
    time series, temporal comparison is often not possible to determine which areas
    are more vulnerable than they have been previously. We therefore focus on identifying
    which areas are the most vulnerable within the country, based on the most recent
    available data for each indicator, taking the “thresholds relative to other locations”
    approach described above. The overall socioeconomic vulnerability score between
    0 and 1 is calculated as The higher scores represent the more vulnerable areas
    in the country. While users can modify the threshold applied to each indicator,
    as well as choose which indicators to include, they cannot change the weightings
    associated with the indicators. Weightings affect how much each indicator contributes
    to an overall score. Midgley et al. (2011) weighted indicators according to importance,
    confidence in accuracy, or spatial resolution. However, in Strata by default all
    indicators are equally weighted. This is chosen as the simplest approach to allow
    users to interpret the resulting Strata scores, to more easily allow for selecting
    and deselecting specific indicators, and to avoid any over-fitting. Over-fitting
    may be possible if one can change both the thresholds and the weightings, and
    some users could use this to apply bias to their analysis. 4. Hotspot maps for
    Somalia 4.1. Hotspot maps of the components of the Strata score Fig. 4 shows maps
    separated out into the four baskets: Climate and environmental stress, Peace and
    security, Population exposure and Socioeconomic vulnerability. These include all
    the indicators in Table 1 with their default thresholds applied, calculated for
    the period October–December 2016, the second rainy season of the year in Somalia
    (Deyr). In 2016 the Deyr season was reported to have failed, following poor rains
    in the first rainy season of the year (FEWS NET, 2017a). Correspondingly, the
    Climate and environmental stresses basket shows high values across much of the
    country indicating multiple indicators have passed thresholds. In particular,
    the drought indicators are flagged across large areas of the country (not shown
    here but users can view on the dashboard which of the particular indicators are
    flagged). The Peace and security basket shows many flags in the area broadly around
    Mogadishu and following the main roads in and out of this area. Population exposure
    is highest in and around Mogadishu as well as in the far north, while the Socioeconomic
    vulnerability score is highest around Mogadishu and central parts of Somalia.

    from 0 to 1. Maps from the Strata platform. 4.2. Hotspot maps of the overall Strata
    score Fig. 5 shows the hotspot maps for the overall Strata score: summing Climate
    and environmental and Peace and security stresses, and applying both the exposure
    and vulnerability scores, for the indicators as in Fig. 4 (i.e. all indicators
    in Table 1 with default thresholds applied). Users can choose whether or not to
    include the exposure and vulnerability scores in the hotspot maps. Users can also
    choose to view results as the raw score for each pixel (Fig. 5a), or with a heatmap
    applied (based on Gaussian kernels) to smooth out the data and emphasise that
    stresses in one pixel are likely to have impacts in neighbouring areas (Fig. 5b).
    The maps indicate that highest scores are located mainly in the area surrounding
    Mogadishu, with lower magnitude hotspots in other major settlements. Download

    listed in Table 1 and the exposure and vulnerability scores) for the period October
    to December 2016. Maps from the Strata platform. Fig. 5c shows the same data but
    aggregated to the district level. Users can view the output data at pixel scale,
    regional, and district levels on the Strata dashboard, as well as in tables and
    charts. Data is aggregated to the larger spatial scales by averaging the hotspot
    scores at pixel level across the area of interest. Where indicator thresholds
    are selected relative to the whole country, this is still calculated at a pixel
    scale, before aggregating the results. The highest score here is in the district
    of Banadir, where Mogadishu is located, with relatively high scores in the surrounding
    districts and further south in Jamaame, but lower scores elsewhere. The district
    map helps quickly identify areas experiencing greatest levels of stress, exposure
    and vulnerability. The pixel and heatmaps allow users to investigate where smaller
    scale stresses are located, which may not show up when averaged to larger spatial
    scales. For example, the hotspots around cities, where there are fewer stresses
    flagged than around Mogadishu, still have relatively high and vulnerable populations
    meaning these areas show up as hotspots on the higher spatial resolution maps.
    4.3. Climate security risk in Somalia Strata''s maps for October–December 2016
    show climate and environmental stresses across the country, but overall hotspots
    mainly around the Mogadishu area as this is where the climate and environmental
    stresses converge with past conflict events and a very high exposed and relatively
    vulnerable population. Elsewhere in Somalia the hotspot scores are generally lower.
    While parts of central Somalia to the north of Mogadishu are highly flagged for
    climate and environmental stresses, when combined with low peace and security
    flags and a relatively low population (despite having a high vulnerability score),
    this does not show as a hotspot when all indicators are taken into account. This
    shows how the hotspots highlight both where there are multiple stresses occurring
    but importantly also where exposed and potentially vulnerable populations are
    located relative to those stresses. However, the flexibility of the indicator
    framework means the user still has the option to exclude the exposure or vulnerability
    scores from the hotspots if they just want to focus on where the stresses are
    occurring. In reality, the situation in Somalia was declared a national disaster
    due to the drought in February 2017 (UNDP, 2018). Poor rains continued into 2017,
    and impacts included poor harvests, high food prices, food insecurity, livestock
    losses, and high internal displacement particularly into urban areas (FEWS, 2017b;
    Malik et al., 2020). Additionally, it was also reported that the drought may have
    exacerbated conflicts over resources, and a combination of drought and increasing
    conflict accelerated displacement (UNDP, 2018). Improved disaster risk management
    and social protection plans in place following the devastating 2011 drought, and
    the humanitarian response, were able to avert famine (Lwanga-Ntale & Owino, 2020;
    Malik et al., 2020). While Strata''s maps for October–December 2016 including
    all indicators highlight hotspots during this period, users could also select
    smaller subsets of indicators according to the decisions they are making. For
    example, if just ‘Drought (agricultural)’ and ‘Exposed population’ are included,
    much larger areas of the country are shown as hotspots (Fig. 6) as would be expected
    for this event. While this highlights where people are located relative to drought
    areas, it does not tell the user anything about who might be more vulnerable or
    who might be experiencing other stresses at the same time (e.g. conflict events),
    and therefore the flexibility to select indicators in Strata allows for these
    more detailed assessments relevant to the given context. Download : Download high-res

    from the Strata platform. 5. Discussion 5.1. Co-designing Strata A participatory
    co-design approach can help develop products that are directly informed by the
    local experts who would use them, and provide the most relevant information for
    their contexts, so it can be applied to decision making and build capacity for
    action (Carter et al., 2019; Dilling & Lemos, 2011; Shaw et al., 2009). We have
    used a co-design approach to develop Strata so that it is informed by user needs
    and requirements, incorporating local expert knowledge to identify key indicators
    (Miller et al., 2017). The ability to modify thresholds is also in response to
    user requests, while all indicators are weighted equally because users were concerned
    by having different weights as well as not seeing the need to adjust weightings.
    Users also informed the design of the platform, providing feedback on how they
    prefer to view data and tested the tool to report on the ease of use. They required
    transparency in how the data is used and how scores are calculated to enable them
    to interpret, understand, and use the results. Consequentially, Strata provides
    this detail via information on the platform itself, and in an associated guidebook.16
    Strata''s co-design process not only ensured the tool was driven by user needs,
    but it also built the capacity of those who would be using Strata, and the workshops
    acted as a space for risk science communication. There is evidence that co-design
    can lead to better uptake of a product (Carter et al., 2019), with capacity building
    an important element of this. However, we cannot yet demonstrate such effects
    as we will need to monitor how Strata is used by different stakeholders following
    its public launch. We will use a combination of approaches including surveys,
    semi-structured interviews, and usage statistics from the platform to evaluate
    Strata on its accuracy, uptake, relevance, usability and ethics. While a co-design
    process has these key benefits, it is time and resource heavy (e.g. Hirons et
    al., 2021; Miller et al., 2017; Vogel et al., 2016). There is a need for balance
    to ensure users can maximise their involvement in the process without requiring
    too large a time commitment (McBride et al., 2017). We found semi-structured interviews
    were very informative for gaining detailed insights into particular decision-making
    contexts, however they can only reach a relatively small audience and do not allow
    for group discussion and consensus building. We therefore primarily used workshops
    at key milestones in the design process for users to engage with, allowing users
    to choose which workshops to attend. For example, there were workshops following
    literature reviews to develop an initial long-list of indicators, and when a first
    prototype was available for trial. Within a large group of users people may think
    different indicators and thresholds are most relevant, depending on their particular
    context (Mittal et al., 2021). In Strata we addressed this by allowing users to
    include or exclude indicators and modify thresholds within the tool. There is
    also a need to balance user requirements with what is technically and scientifically
    possible within a tool, and we have not been able to incorporate all user requests
    within Strata at this point. For example, not all requested indicators have been
    included at this stage due to a lack of data availability, such as transhumance
    migratory patterns. Moreover, some desires could not be implemented in the indicators,
    primarily in the peace and security basket, due to ethical reasons. For instance,
    recruitment patterns of armed groups, presence of military factions, and presence
    of ethnic fractures were ranked high for inclusion during a workshop, but after
    ethical discussions with users on sensitivities around these themes and potential
    misuse of this data these variables were rejected. Additionally, some users wanted
    to be able to view uncertainty information on the platform, however this is not
    currently implemented and will require further development and discussion with
    users to determine how best to do this. Effectively communicating uncertainty
    can be difficult and complex, but is an important demand-driven challenge in risk
    modelling and assessments (Doyle et al., 2019). 5.2. Interpreting and validating
    hotspots The hotspot maps produced by Strata are intended as a first step in a
    decision-making process, highlighting locations users may want to investigate
    further. For climate change adaptation or nature conservation practitioners, hotspot
    maps can help identify where project areas coincide with conflict-affected and
    fragile regions. They can then work with peace and security experts to ensure
    that their environmental strategies do not unintentionally exacerbate pre-existing
    grievances or underlying conflict drivers. Strata can also help evaluate how hotspots
    vary over the lifecycle of a programme, such as changes in deforestation rates
    or the locations of populations especially vulnerable to climate impacts. Peace
    and security practitioners would be able to use Strata to ensure that conflict
    prevention and peacebuilding initiatives consider where security issues converge
    with environmental and climate stresses that may disrupt local livelihoods and
    economies. Other actions users could take based on Strata''s hotspots include
    identifying where adaptation measures may be required based on where climate stresses
    and vulnerable populations intersect, or planning interventions following the
    monitoring of drought and food security conditions. However, the hotspot maps
    do not provide all the information required for specific decision contexts. For
    instance, factors such as climate change adaptation efforts, social networks,
    and local conflict management institutions, which show considerable variation
    at local levels and shape resilience to climate stresses and conflict, are not
    measurable in existing quantitative datasets (Ide, 2017; Ide et al., 2014). Users
    will bring their own situational understanding to their interpretation of the
    data, based on expert knowledge, knowledge gathered from local networks, or through
    complementary research. Strata''s guidebook provides guidance on how to integrate
    and complement the quantitative data-driven maps with this qualitative in-depth
    understanding, so that they can nuance and better understand the data in local
    contexts. For example, users of the tool may have knowledge on location-specific
    factors with substantial local variation (e.g. where particularly vulnerable households
    are located within a community, or which communities have adaptive practices they
    can employ in the case of a hazard), which they can use to identify, within a
    hotspot region, those particular areas they understand to be more likely to suffer
    impacts of the stresses occurring. Where this qualitative contextual information
    is available, it would be useful for tools such as this to look at ways of providing
    it alongside quantitative maps to deepen situational understanding. In Strata''s
    case this could include information around adaptation strategies and existing
    peace negotiation mechanisms. In particular, quantitative data is not yet able
    to fully explain the conditions under which climate change might lead to security
    risks (Ide, 2017). While these pathways have been studied in a range of contexts
    (e.g. Scheffran et al., 2012; von Uexkull et al., 2016), these cannot be generalized
    across regions as these links depend on many local factors (the totality of which
    Strata is unable to map). Therefore, Strata does not highlight potential impact
    pathways or cascading effects between the stresses. It is up to the user to bring
    their own expert understanding of pathways and interactions in their specific
    region in order to interpret the data in this way (Ivits et al., 2019). For example,
    they may be aware of particular situations in which drought conditions can lead
    to conflict over the distribution of natural resources, or where there is a higher
    chance of unrest due to pre-existing intercommunal tensions. Further research
    is required to investigate how quantitative data tools are used alongside this
    contextual qualitative understanding in practice. Validating tools such as Strata
    can be challenging. Climate vulnerability maps are rarely validated (Preston et
    al., 2011) due to difficulties measuring vulnerability, with proxy data used for
    complex socio-ecological processes, a lack of definition of who or what is vulnerable,
    and the absence of observable data with which to validate future vulnerability
    (de Sherbinin et al., 2019). However, validation can be achieved using past observed
    events or expert perceptions of vulnerability (Preston et al., 2009), and stakeholder
    interviews or literature reviews to evaluate findings in specific locations (Ide
    et al., 2014). Strata''s aim is to support decision makers by bringing together
    otherwise disparate data in a clear and transparent way, and so validation should
    particularly consider what decisions it informs and how it informs them. Involving
    decision makers in an evaluation process allows for assessment of both the skill
    of the product and how it has benefited decision making (Hirons et al., 2021).
    Our validation approach following Strata''s launch will include following practitioners
    in their use of the tool to see whether the hotpots identify the regions they
    would expect and how they use the hotspot information. Case studies will also
    allow us to investigate (1) where hotspots correspond with large impacts on the
    ground; (2) where different thresholds or indicators could help highlight missing
    hotspots where impacts occurred; and, (3) where impacts were not seen in regions
    with mapped hotspots either due to factors not taken into account, such as adaptation
    strategies, or because interventions were carried out in response to monitoring
    the area. 5.3. Future developments Strata will continue to be developed in co-design
    with users. Future developments will include providing additional indicators in
    the platform, especially those particularly relevant for other countries and regions.
    These might include climate and environmental stresses such as tropical cyclones,
    wildfires and air pollution. Peace and security indicators could be extended to
    include data relating to resolution efforts, to indicate the various conflict
    management and peacebuilding efforts that are part of conflict dynamics. Also,
    conflict datasets other than ACLED, such as the Uppsala Conflict Data Program
    (UCDP) Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) data (Sundberg & Melander, 2013), could
    be added to provide alternative Peace and security indicators. Reporting accuracies
    vary across datasets and types of events, so it may be useful to include indications
    of confidence in each of the conflict datasets for comparison. Additional vulnerability
    indicators might include access to education or health-related indicators such
    as disease infection rates. Who or what is exposed to the stresses considered
    could be extended beyond the total population to include livestock, agricultural
    areas, the water sector, or specific subgroups of the population such as pastoralist
    communities, changing which locations are more likely to show up as hotspots.
    Alternative exposure and vulnerability indicators would be required in these cases.
    Strata could also be extended to include indicators relevant to applications beyond
    its initial focus on conflict-sensitive environmental programming and peacebuilding
    initiatives, such as data provision for monitoring the environmental impacts of
    companies and assets (Patterson et al., 2022). Furthermore, incorporating the
    functionality for users to upload their own datasets or draw their own indicator
    layers for their personal analyses may be possible, but would require consideration
    around data quality checking and caveats for use of the outputs. To build on Strata''s
    application as a monitoring tool, an alert system based on user-defined regions
    of interest and indicators could provide notifications according to the most up-to-date
    hotspot maps. Extending hotspot maps beyond the country boundaries may be useful
    when considering transboundary issues, such as river basin management and water
    stress. However, it is important to consider where different socioeconomic datasets
    are available in different countries as these can lead to discontinuities across
    international borders, which may or may not reflect actual differences (de Sherbinin,
    2014). Further work should also consider how to include information related to
    cascading effects of stresses to impacts on the population within the tool to
    deepen the information Strata provides to users, if there are specific contexts
    for which this understanding exists. In particular, this should consider where
    there may be cascading impacts across geographical areas, such as upstream land
    management impacting downstream flood risk or agricultural production impacting
    people in cities, and how this can be highlighted on the hotspot maps. Currently,
    Strata focuses on historical and present-day monitoring of stresses, however this
    will be extended to include future projections. In the workshops users asked for
    information about where and when risks may increase in the future to inform climate
    change adaptation planning and building resilience to anticipated disasters. Relevant
    indicators could include future changes in the likelihood of heatwaves, drought,
    and floods over coming decades from climate model simulations, or food security
    projections for the next few months from FEWS NET (FEWS, 2018). A range of plausible
    future scenarios can represent the uncertainty in future projections, and can
    be developed to ensure consistency between environmental and socioeconomic changes
    (e.g. Nicholls et al., 2008). However, climate change vulnerability studies employing
    future climate projections often show these alongside information about the current
    status of socioeconomic vulnerability due to data limitations (Preston et al.,
    2011). In Strata, if users select future projection indicators alongside current
    status indicators this will need to be clearly highlighted so users can interpret
    the maps appropriately, as well as identifying if the selected future projections
    could be inconsistent with each other. Climate vulnerability assessments and hotspot
    maps have tended to avoid addressing uncertainty, particularly quantitatively
    (de Sherbinin et al., 2019; Preston et al., 2011), compensating by describing
    results tentatively (de Sherbinin, 2014). In future versions, it may be useful
    for Strata to include an assessment of uncertainty, either quantitatively or qualitatively.
    Confidence in the datasets could be determined by the source of the data, how
    frequently the data is updated, or any uncertainty information provided with the
    dataset itself. Considerations will include how to combine confidence scores for
    different datasets within the hotspot scores, and how to visualize uncertainty
    on the hotspot maps. 6. Conclusion Strata is an online mapping tool, which has
    been developed in response to user needs for easy access to data and analysis
    on climate and security risks. Such data often lies in disparate sites, or requires
    coding skills to access. Strata brings this data together to identify hotspots
    where climate, environmental and security stresses are co-occurring alongside
    exposed and vulnerable populations. The hotspots are calculated using thresholds
    applied to indicators to determine how many are at a level suggesting a stress,
    with the data layers collated and processed by Earth Blox using Google''s Earth
    Engine as the back-end. The summed total number of stresses is scaled according
    to the relative exposure and vulnerability of the population in the location.
    This approach is customisable by users who can choose which indicators to include
    in their analysis and adjust thresholds according to their understanding of the
    local context. Strata has been initially developed for Somalia, and hotspot maps
    for 2016 demonstrate how the information can be used to draw attention to locations
    of co-occurring stresses that can alert users to investigate further. Strata will
    be extended in the future to include other countries and a larger range of indicators,
    with development continuing to employ a co-design process with potential users
    of the tool. Co-designing such a tool can be challenging, as users can have very
    specific requirements for detailed information, yet it needs to remain simple
    to use and applicable to a wide range of potential decision-making scenarios.
    However, through this process we have been able to balance these requirements,
    developing a hotspot framework relevant to a range of decision-making contexts
    but with customisable options for users so it can be tailored to specific contexts.
    While co-design can be time intensive, using a combination of interviews and workshops
    at different stages of the process allowed us to make the best use of participants’
    time and expertise. Working with potential users in this way can ensure actionable
    data-driven insights within the limits of data availability and understandings
    of stress-impact pathways. As a first-look tool, users of Strata can rapidly identify
    locations which may be of concern due to multiple stresses, before investigating
    these further with both the quantitative data they have available and their expert
    understandings of how and when impacts on people occur in those locations. There
    is, however, a need for further research across the broader risk communication
    sector into how qualitative information can be incorporated with such quantitative
    approaches, and how quantitative hotspots can be interpreted alongside local contextual
    knowledge in practice. Nevertheless, Strata is the first tool of its kind for
    climate security, providing openly-available, easy-to-use, data-driven, web-based,
    customisable data analysis and visualisation. It will ensure that users can make
    decisions to mitigate the impacts of climate, environmental and security stresses
    informed by the latest available data, bridging the science-to-policy gap apparent
    in the field of climate security. Declaration of competing interest The authors

    14 Meteorological drought refers to a reduction in rainfall, whereas agricultural
    drought refers to impacts on crops due to reduced moisture availability. 15 For
    such thresholds the data is converted to the z-score, Z=(x-μ)/σ, where x is the
    original value, and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation across the area
    of interest. This score converts the data to the number of standard deviations
    from the mean, and so a threshold of z-scores above 1 would flag data points more

    data processing; and datacenter and cloud, which use high-end apps to collect
    data, evaluate it, process it, and provide remedial solutions. This elegant combination
    provides excellent value in automatic action. In the future, IoT will continue

    based numerical models of the coupled water–energy cycle have emerged as powerful
    tools to address critical societal needs (Fatichi et al., 2016), including flood
    forecasting (Maidment, 2017), irrigation operation (Gibson et al., 2017), weather
    and climate prediction (Baker et al., 2017; Senatore et al., 2015), and evaluations
    of water scarcity (Zhou et al., 2016). Over the last 3 decades, several types
    of hydrologic models have been developed with different levels of conceptualization
    that often change with the domain size due to computational constraints. One class
    of models, denoted as regional or macroscale models, was originally designed to
    serve as land surface scheme of atmospheric models and is routinely used to simulate
    hydrologic processes in continental basins (>105 km2) at spatial resolutions of
    10 to 25 km (e.g., Lawrence et al., 2011; Liang et al., 1994; Niu et al., 2011).
    These processes include infiltration, evapotranspiration, runoff production, and
    snow accumulation and ablation that are typically simulated in a regular grid
    without considering lateral transfers across cells (Clark et al., 2015). In recent
    years, the National Water Model has combined a regional hydrologic model applied
    at the unprecedented resolution of 1 km with routing schemes to generate operational
    hydrologic predictions over the continental United States (Lahmers et al., 2019,
    2021). In many cases, hydrologic models are applied under prescribed meteorological
    forcings using an optimal set of parameters that are calibrated by minimizing
    differences between simulated streamflow and observations at one or more locations
    (e.g., Gou et al., 2021; Li et al., 2019; Nijssen et al., 1997; Xiao et al., 2018;
    Yun et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2017). While widely used, this approach has two
    important limitations. First, input and structural uncertainties are often not
    taken into account (Gupta and Govindaraju, 2019), causing an inflation of parametric
    uncertainty that can exacerbate the problem of equifinality (Beven and Binley,
    1992). Second, this calibration method relies only on an aggregated measure of
    the hydrologic response and does not consider the model''s ability to capture
    the spatially variable internal processes (Becker et al., 2019; Ajami et al.,
    2004). As a result of these two limitations, this calibration approach could cause
    the undesirable outcome that the model provides the right answer for the wrong
    physical reasons (Rajib et al., 2018; Tobin and Bennett, 2017), which can in turn
    induce wrong conclusions when the model is applied under nonstationary conditions
    due to changes in land cover and/or climate. Satellite remote sensors provide
    spatially distributed estimates of hydrologic states and fluxes, including soil
    moisture (Entekhabi et al., 2010; Njoku et al., 2003; Kerr et al., 2001), land
    surface temperature (LST; Shi and Bates, 2011; Wan and Dozier, 1996), snow cover
    fraction (SCF, Painter et al., 2009), evapotranspiration (Boschetti et al., 2019;
    Fisher et al., 2020), and changes in water storage (Tapley et al., 2004). These
    products can reduce parametric, structural, and input uncertainties in hydrologic
    models by including additional constraints in the calibration process (Wood et
    al., 2011; Fatichi et al., 2016; Ko et al., 2019). Despite this potential, the
    use of remote sensing products to reduce hydrologic simulation uncertainty has
    been explored in only a few studies. For instance, in studies by Corbari and Mancini
    (2014), Crow et al. (2003), and Zink et al. (2018), satellite LST was used with
    river discharge to calibrate model parameters, and it was found that including
    LST in the process improved the simulation of evapotranspiration as estimated
    by eddy covariance towers or other satellite products. This outcome was also found
    by Gutmann and Small (2010), who applied a regional model at 14 flux towers and
    showed that incorporating remotely sensed LST estimates in the calibration allowed
    the achievement of two-thirds of the improvements gained by ingesting more accurate
    ground LST data. In other efforts, satellite LST products have been used to verify
    the performance of hydrologic models, as done by Koch et al. (2016), with the
    North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS), Xiang et al. (2014), with
    the TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS), Xiang et al. (2017),
    with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Hydro model, and Wang et al. (2021),
    with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Finally, a few studies have
    enhanced streamflow simulations (Bennett et al., 2019; Bergeron et al., 2014;
    Tekeli et al., 2005) by improving the timing of snowmelt using remotely sensed
    snow cover fields. The Colorado River basin (CRB) is a regional watershed where
    hydrologic simulations are needed to support short- and long-term water management
    decisions. Its water resources are used by almost 40 million people in seven states
    of southwestern U.S. (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah,
    and Wyoming) to irrigate ∼22 000 km2 of land and to generate over 4200 MW of hydroelectric
    power (USBR, 2012). The mean annual discharge of the CRB is 20.2 km3, with high
    interannual variability resulting from large variations in climatic forcings (Christensen
    et al., 2004; Gautam and Mascaro, 2018). Until 2021, the CRB was able to meet
    the demand of all users by storing runoff in a large system of dams, mainly operated
    by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and transporting water through canals
    and aqueducts, including the Central Arizona Project. However, declines in the
    mean flow observed over the last 2 decades (Hoerling et al., 2019; Udall and Overpeck,
    2017), combined with increasing demands, led to the first-ever declaration of
    water shortages in the CRB in January 2022. The water cuts affecting users in
    Arizona and Nevada (CAP, 2021) are expected to become more severe in the near
    future and impact the agricultural sector (Mitchell et al., 2022; Norton et al.,
    2021). In previous studies on the hydrologic responses of the CRB using the VIC
    model, confidence in the model results was built mainly through comparisons against
    estimates of naturalized flow (e.g., Christensen et al., 2004; Vano et al., 2012,
    2014; Xiao et al., 2018). The CRB is characterized by a marked difference between
    the colder and wetter Upper Basin, where more than 90 % of streamflow is generated
    (Li et al., 2017), and the warmer and drier Lower Basin, with reduced runoff production
    due to low precipitation, high evaporative demand, and channel transmission losses
    (Rajagopalan et al., 2009). As a result of this large contrast, limiting the calibration
    of VIC to the use of naturalized flow in the Upper Basin may lead to uncertainty
    in its ability to simulate the spatiotemporal hydrologic response. The objective
    of this study is to improve the physical reliability of VIC simulations in the
    CRB by incorporating remotely sensed fields of LST and SCF obtained from the Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). LST is an important variable that
    impacts the coupled water–energy balance, while SCF provides information on snow
    conditions which are crucial for quantifying runoff generation. We start from
    a parameterization of VIC that led to good estimates of monthly discharge in the
    period 2003–2018. We then apply a stepwise procedure to reduce uncertainties in
    model forcings, parameters, and structure based on comparisons of simulated and
    remotely sensed LST and SCF fields. While based on VIC, the methods proposed here
    can provide guidance to refine the calibration and reduce uncertainties in other
    physically based hydrologic models and to identify areas for structural improvement.

    2 Study area and datasets 2.1 Study basin The CRB has a total area of approximately
    630 000 km2, covering seven states in United States and a small portion of Mexico.
    Here, we considered the drainage area above Imperial Dam, plus the Gila River
    (Fig. 1). The Colorado River Compact of 1922 divides the CRB into the Upper and
    Lower basins. As revealed by the land cover map shown in Fig. 1c, most of the
    basin is covered by shrub or scrub ecosystems (∼60 %), followed by various forest
    types (∼24 %). Table 1 summarizes the mean hydroclimatic and land surface features
    of the subbasins. The Upper Basin consists of the Green, Upper Colorado, Glen
    Canyon, and San Juan River subbasins. These higher-elevation subbasins (except
    Glen Canyon) receive more snowfall than the rest of the CRB, resulting in the
    presence of a significant snowpack (mean annual snow water equivalent, or SWE,
    ranges from 13.7 to 58.8 mm) that eventually leads to the generation of ∼90 %
    of the CRB runoff. While the Lower Basin receives about 60 % of the mean annual
    precipitation of the subbasins in the Upper Basin per unit area, its runoff ratio
    (i.e., the fraction of annual precipitation becoming runoff) is 3 times smaller
    than that of the Upper Basin. 2.2 Remote sensing and ground-based datasets We
    integrated different remotely sensed and ground-based data. Meteorological forcings
    were obtained from the gridded (0.0625∘ or ∼6 km) daily datasets of Livneh et
    al. (2013) and Su et al. (2021) for precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum
    temperature, and wind speed. We also used the Parameter-elevation Regressions
    on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) 30-year normal (Di Luzio et al., 2008) for
    temperature corrections. For assessing streamflow performance, we used monthly
    naturalized flow records from USBR at four interior locations of the Upper Basin.
    Note that this is the largest available resolution for the reconstructed naturalized
    flow, since the river is highly regulated. To improve the simulation of spatial
    patterns, we used two products from the Aqua MODIS sensor, i.e., daily LST (MYD11A1)
    and monthly SCF (MYD10CM). The LST product is available at 1 km resolution twice
    a day at about 13:00 LT (local time; daytime) and 01:00 LT (nighttime; Wan et
    al., 2021). The percent of missing data, largely due to cloud cover, varies from
    42 % to 95 %, with larger values in the winter season and July (Fig. S1 in the
    Supplement). Monthly SCF is provided at 0.05∘ (∼5 km) resolution as the average
    of SCF for days with a prescribed level of sky clearness (Hall and Riggs, 2021).
    Both MODIS products were aggregated to the 0.0625∘ scale used in the model. We
    also validated simulated and remotely sensed LST using measurements at 14 eddy
    covariance towers (Baldocchi et al., 2001) selected based on available data (>300 d
    during 2003–2018). The station locations are shown in Fig. S2, with 12 located
    in the Lower Basin at elevations from 987 to 2618 m. Five stations were forested,
    and the remaining were covered by a short canopy. We extracted records of observed
    longwave radiation at the stations and used them to compute LST, following Wang
    et al. (2021). We also used the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Multi-Resolution
    Land Characteristics (MRLC) rangeland and tree canopy cover products, which contain
    canopy cover fraction at 30 m resolution for forests and shrublands (Homer et
    al., 2020). Figure 2Schematic explaining how LST is computed in VIC (LSTV) as
    compared to MODIS (LSTM) in a pixel covered by short vegetation (tile A) and tall
    trees (tile B). fv is the vegetation fraction, Tair is the air temperature, Ts,
    Tf, and Tc are simulated temperatures for the surface, canopy, and canopy air,
    LWd,v is the downward longwave radiation from the canopy, and LWd is the downward
    longwave radiation from the atmosphere. The subscripts A and B refer to the variables
    in each tile. Download 3 Methods 3.1 The variable infiltration capacity model
    We used the VIC model version 5.0 (Hamman et al., 2018) to simulate the hydrologic
    response of the CRB from 2003 to 2018 at an hourly time step and 0.0625∘ resolution.
    VIC is a macroscale, physically based model that solves the water and energy balance
    on a regular grid. Land surface heterogeneity in each cell is modeled through
    land cover tiles, each with a single vegetation class on top of a three-layer
    soil column. The model requires meteorological forcings as inputs and returns
    outputs over the grid. Fluxes and state variables simulated at grid cells are
    calculated as the areal-weighted average of separate computations of the water
    and energy balances for each land cover tile. Here, we adopted the VIC version
    with the clumped vegetation scheme proposed by Bohn and Vivoni (2016), where the
    vegetation fraction (fv) accounts for spacing between plants in each tile. This
    modification allows simulating the energy balance with a higher fidelity, as shown
    by Bohn and Vivoni (2016), through the comparison with ground estimates of evapotranspiration
    in the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico. Table 2List of spatially variable
    forcings, vegetation and soil parameters, and state variables involved in the
    computation of the energy balance (symbols defined in the main text and Appendix
    A). Forcings and state variables vary each hour. Parameters are either constant
    in time or vary each month (denoted with an asterisk*). Download Print Version
    | Download XLSX Since our adjustment strategy is based on the comparison of simulated
    and remotely sensed LST and SCF, we describe how these variables are simulated
    using the schematic in Fig. 2. The governing equations are reported in Appendix
    A, while the most influential parameters are in Table 2. In our simulations, 16
    vegetation classes are used, which include four types of tall trees, namely deciduous
    forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, and woody wetlands. For other canopy types
    (e.g., tile A in Fig. 2), the energy balance is solved over a control volume that
    combines the fractions of vegetation (fv,A) and bare soil ( ) using a weighted
    aerodynamic resistance. A single surface temperature (Ts,A) is computed and assumed
    to be uniform over the tile and equal to the foliage temperature ( ). For tall
    trees (e.g., tile B in Fig. 2), a vegetated overstory and an understory without
    vegetation are introduced. If snow is absent, the overstory foliage temperature
    is assumed equal to air temperature ( ), and a single Ts,B in the understory is
    calculated with the scheme described above. When snow is present, Ts,B is calculated
    by solving the energy balance in the overstory, understory, and the atmosphere
    surrounding the canopy. Since the satellite sensor observes the top of the surface,
    the simulated LST by VIC (LSTV) that is compared against MODIS (LSTM) is the weighted
    average of foliage temperature in tiles with tall trees and the ground temperature
    in other tiles. In the case of Fig. 2, this leads to the following: where AA and
    AB are the areas of tiles A and B, respectively. To compute SCF in the grid cells,
    VIC allows the subdivision of each tile into elevation bands to capture changes
    in forcing temperature due to terrain heterogeneity. Elevation bands are the same
    for all tiles in a grid cell and limited typically to three bands in total. Given
    the mean elevation of each elevation band, the air temperature forcing is adjusted
    using a lapse rate of −6.5 ∘C km−1 and is then used to solve the energy balance
    within each tile. Depending on temperature and precipitation, snow may be simulated
    within a tile, and SWE is calculated. When SWE > 0, SCF is assumed to be 100 %,
    such that a tile within that elevation band is fully covered with snow; otherwise,
    SCF is 0, and the elevation band within the tile is snow-free (i.e., a binary
    outcome). SCF in the grid cell is the area-weighted average of the SCFs from all
    tiles and elevation bands. 3.2 Baseline simulation We created a first model parameterization,
    labeled as baseline, based on applications by Xiao et al. (2018) and Bohn and
    Vivoni (2019). Hourly gridded meteorological forcings were generated from the
    daily grids of Livneh et al. (2013) and Su et al. (2021), using MetSim (Bennett
    et al., 2020; Bohn et al., 2013; Bohn and Vivoni, 2019). Model parameters were
    obtained from Livneh et al. (2015), with a few updates as follows. Land surface
    parameters were based on MODIS and NLCD products from Bohn and Vivoni (2019),
    which include a land cover classification and climatological monthly means of
    leaf area index (LAI), fv, and albedo. We replaced the elevation data used in
    prior VIC studies with the 30 m United States Geological Survey (USGS) National
    Elevation Dataset (USGS, 2017). The model was tested against monthly naturalized
    streamflow records, by manually adjusting seven soil parameters that affect runoff
    production and the parameters controlling the relation between snow albedo with
    snow age. As shown in Fig. S3, under the baseline simulation, VIC captured the
    monthly streamflow in key subbasins of the Upper Basin, where most runoff is produced,
    and at the basin outlet well with a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) > 0.9. Figure

    with remote sensing products: overview of the stepwise calibration strategy The
    baseline simulation was aimed at reproducing the streamflow response and did not
    consider the model''s ability to capture spatial patterns of hydrologic variables.
    We designed a stepwise strategy aimed at reducing the three main sources of uncertainty
    in the simulation of LST and SCF. A schematic of the procedure is reported in
    Fig. 3; here, we provide an overview of the steps and describe the details of
    each step in the corresponding sections in Sect. 4. In the first step (“Forcing-adj”
    or forcing adjustment), we targeted input uncertainty and modified air temperature
    to reduce errors in nighttime LST. In the second step (“Veg-adj” or vegetation
    adjustment), we focused on modifying spatially variable vegetation parameters
    affecting daytime LST identified among those reported in Table 2. The first two
    steps were guided by metrics quantifying the agreement between simulated and remotely
    sensed LST, including the correlation coefficient (CC), root mean squared error
    (RMSE), and bias (mean LSTV–mean LSTM) between the (1) time series of daily LSTV
    and LSTM at each grid cell and (2) daily spatial maps. These metrics were obtained
    for both daytime and nighttime through comparisons at the MODIS overpass time.
    To further quantify the improvements in our calibration approach, for each step
    we computed the structural similarity index measure (SSIM; Wang and Bovik, 2002)
    and the SPAtial EFficiency (SPAEF) metric (Koch et al., 2018) between spatial
    maps of observed and simulated long-term climatological mean LST; these two metrics
    were chosen since they have been specifically designed to compare spatial patterns.
    After improving LST, we reduced structural uncertainty by modifying the computation
    of the snow energy balance in a step labeled as “Snow-adj” (or snow adjustment).
    As described above, when snow exists in tiles covered by tall trees, the downward
    longwave radiation into the understory (or ground) snowpack is assumed to originate
    from the overstory (indicated as LWd,v in Fig. 2; tile B). For areas without tall
    trees, the downward longwave radiation reaching the understory comes from the
    atmosphere (indicated as LWd). To account for this in the clumped canopy scheme,
    we modified the downward longwave radiation as the weighted average of [ ]. In
    addition, we adjusted the empirical relation controlling the change in albedo
    during snowmelt to reduce the bias between VIC and MODIS SCF. All modifications
    of the model parameters were performed via manual tuning. 4 Results 4.1 Comparison
    of VIC and MODIS LST with ground observations First, we provide an overview of
    the comparison among the time series of LST that were (1) observed at the 14 eddy
    covariance stations, (2) simulated by VIC, and (3) retrieved from MODIS at the
    co-located 6 km pixel. The error metrics for the 14 stations are summarized through
    box plots in Fig. 4a–c, while the time series of LST at a representative site
    for daytime and nighttime are shown in Fig. 4d and e. Station values and VIC simulations
    at the overpass times were extracted for comparison with MODIS. Dates with missing
    data in MODIS and station records were not considered. We find MODIS LST to be
    very strongly correlated with ground measurements (CC > 0.91) and characterized
    by RMSE from ∼1.5 to 5.3 ∘C. Bias is slightly positive (negative) during the daytime
    (nighttime), with a median of 0.3 ∘C (−1.6 ∘C). The error metrics for VIC reveal
    that performance degrades moderately with larger variability across the stations,
    where CC ranges from 0.70 to 0.95, the median RMSE is 6.3 ∘C (5.8 ∘C) for daytime
    (nighttime), and the median bias is 1.1 ∘C (−3.3 ∘C) for daytime (nighttime).
    The error metrics against ground data provide a reference for evaluating the model
    improvements, as discussed next. Figure 4(a–c) Box plots of CC, RMSE, and bias

    and their controls Figure 5 shows maps of CC, RMSE, and bias of the time series
    of LSTV and LSTM at each pixel for daytime and nighttime periods over the entire
    simulation from 2003 to 2018. To help the interpretation, box plots of the metrics
    in the grid cells within the CRB and three subbasins are presented in Fig. 6.
    Results for other subbasins are reported in Figs. S4–S6 and Table S1 in the Supplement.

    of LSTV and LSTM over 2003–2018 at each pixel. The top (bottom) row presents daytime
    (nighttime) comparisons. Figure 6Box plots of (a–d) CC, (e–h) RMSE, and (i–l)
    bias between time series of LSTV and LSTM in pixels of the entire CRB and of three
    representative subbasins. Box plots show the median, with 50 % and 90 % confidence
    intervals. Different simulations are plotted in different colors. Download Overall,
    CC is high (>0.8) throughout the CRB, with values like those found against station
    data. CC is relatively higher for daytime than nighttime. On the other hand, RMSE
    maps show that simulated LST matches better with MODIS during the nighttime, with
    values largely consistent with those found for stations. For both times of the
    day, RMSE is slightly larger in the Upper Basin. Results for RMSE suggest that
    model performance for LST is relatively better at nighttime without solar radiation
    forcing and tends to be better in drier and hotter regions in the Lower Basin.
    Bias maps reveal that simulations of LST during daytime (nighttime) are warmer
    (cooler) than MODIS observations in most of the CRB, with a median bias of 1.2 ∘C
    (−0.7 ∘C). These findings are largely consistent across the subbasins and with
    the station observations. Spatial patterns of the metrics are complex, suggesting
    that LST simulation errors are impacted by several model parameters and forcings.
    To gain insights into these controls, we computed the correlation coefficient
    between the maps of error metrics between the time series and key parameters or
    forcings involved in the energy balance. Model parameter maps were created by
    calculating the area-weighted averages within each grid cell. For monthly LAI,
    albedo, and fv, we computed the annual mean map. For Tair, we calculated the mean
    across the entire study period. Figure 7 summarizes the results in each subbasin
    for RMSE and bias using heatmaps (also see Fig. S7 for CC). For daytime LST, the
    key factors change across the subbasins, while results are more spatially uniform
    for nighttime LST. During daytime, we found that the Green and Upper Colorado
    subbasins dominated by snow and evergreen forests exhibit different controls compared
    to the other subbasins. Here, RMSE is highly correlated to fv and LAI, while bias
    is mainly controlled by Tair. In the other subbasins, albedo and, to a lesser
    extent, Tair are the dominant factors related to daytime RMSE. Different parameters
    affect the patterns of bias, including albedo in all subbasins, most vegetation
    parameters, root depth in the San Juan and Little Colorado, and Tair in the Little
    Colorado. Considering nighttime LST, Tair and, to a lower degree, soil depth are
    the main factors related to RMSE at all sites. Interestingly, nearly all parameters
    and Tair are linked to nighttime bias. This is explained by considering that Tair
    is correlated with elevation, and elevation is correlated with all other parameters
    (Fig. S8). Figure 7Heatmaps showing the Pearson correlation coefficient between
    (1) the spatial map of Tair or key soil and vegetation parameters involved in
    the energy balance and (2) the spatial map of the error metrics – (a, c) RMSE
    and (b, d) bias – between the time series of LSTM and LSTV for the baseline simulation.
    The correlation coefficients are computed for each subbasin. Symbols are explained
    in Table 2. Top (bottom) row is for daytime (nighttime) LST. Download Figure 8
    presents the intra-annual variability in the error metrics between daily pairs
    of LSTV vs. LSTM fields, shown as monthly averages. As found previously, CC is
    high for both times of the day and relatively higher for daytime, while RMSE is
    larger during the daytime. VIC simulations during the daytime are positively biased
    throughout the year, while bias changes sign for nighttime LST, being positive
    in winter and negative from April to July. In addition, both the RMSE and bias
    of daytime LST are higher from April to July. This indicates that simulated daytime
    LST degrades when incoming solar radiation is high, especially during snowmelt
    events after peak SWE, typically around the end of March. To corroborate this,
    we repeated the analyses in snow-dominated grid cells (mean annual maximum SWE > 30 mm)
    and for all other cells, finding higher daytime RMSE in April for snow-dominated
    cells than other cells, indicating that the LST during the ablation process is
    also more difficult to capture. Figure 8Time series of multiyear monthly average
    CC, RMSE, and bias between VIC and MODIS daily LST fields for the baseline simulation
    and each adjustment step. Download 4.3 Stepwise reduction in uncertainty in the
    simulation of LST and SCF 4.3.1 Forcing adjustment We first focused on the improvement
    in simulated LST at nighttime. Figure 7 indicates that Tair is a key input affecting
    the energy balance at nighttime. Alder and Hostetler (2019) compared two air temperature
    datasets, finding that Livneh et al. (2013) products tend to be colder than PRISM
    in the mountain areas of the CRB. Based on this, we adjusted the daily minimum
    and maximum Tair in Livneh et al. (2013) and Su et al. (2021) to match the climatological
    (1981–2010) monthly means from PRISM. If is the maximum or minimum daily Tair
    on day d and month m, then the bias-corrected value, , was obtained as follows:
    where and are the climatological monthly means of maximum or minimum Tair from
    PRISM and Livneh et al. (2013), respectively. Once we bias-corrected Tair, we
    regenerated the hourly forcings using MetSim. As shown in Fig. 9, the Forcing-adj
    simulations improved bias, which was reduced in most subbasins. The nighttime
    RMSE also slightly decreased throughout the basin. These outcomes are reflected
    in the time series of Fig. 8 that also show that improvements (lower RMSE and
    bias) occur largely in the warm season. On the other hand, the Forcing-adj simulations
    did not improve VIC performance during the daytime, only yielding a slight increase
    in bias (Figs. 6 and 8) that was fixed in the next steps. Figure 9Spatial maps
    of the RMSE and bias between time series of nighttime LSTV and LSTM during 2003–2018
    at each pixel for all steps. Top (bottom) row presents results of RMSE (bias).
    4.3.2 Vegetation parameter adjustment Figure 7 shows that both static and time-varying
    vegetation parameters affect the error metrics of LST. In the Veg-adj step, we
    modified a set of influential parameters by incorporating new datasets. We first
    replaced the climatological mean monthly values of LAI, albedo, and fv with yearly
    varying monthly estimates from MODIS. Second, we updated fv using new products
    from MRLC. In the baseline simulation, fv was derived from the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) retrieved from MODIS (Bohn and Vivoni, 2016, 2019). MRLC
    released 30 m grids of mean annual fv for major vegetation types in the CRB that
    were used to linearly rescale values of fv in the shrub and trees classes to match
    the annual climatology of MRLC as follows: where  is fv in month m used in the
    baseline simulation,  is the rescaled value, and and are long-term mean annual
    values of MRLC and the baseline parameters. Figure 7 indicates that rmin, rarc,
    d0, and z0 affect errors in the simulation of LST, especially in the Green and
    Upper Colorado subbasins. Distributed estimates for these parameters are not currently
    available. Thus, we adjusted their values to reduce the bias between daytime LSTV
    and LSTM, guided by the process equations reported in Appendix A. Reducing z0
    and d0 leads to lower aerodynamic resistance and higher sensible heat flux and,
    in turn, lower LSTV. Increases in rmin and rarc lead to lower values of latent
    heat flux and higher LSTV. Adjusting z0 has a greater impact than modifying the
    other parameters, such that the iteratively scaling of z0 in each pixel was performed
    at 25 %, 50 %, 150 %, or 250 %, depending on the daytime LST bias (Fig. 10). Changes
    were limited within physically plausible ranges. Next, we applied the same method
    to update d0, rmin, and rarc, but variations for these three parameters were minimal,
    as documented in Fig. S9. Figure 10Same as Fig. 9 but for daytime LST. The Veg-adj
    simulation did not lead to significant changes in model performance at nighttime,
    confirming that the dominating factor affecting nighttime LST was Tair. On the
    other hand, improvements in the simulation of daytime LST were remarkable. Figure
    6 shows that both RMSE and bias were reduced at all locations, both in terms of
    the median (∼0.9 ∘C) and variability in each subbasin (lower width of the confidence
    intervals), with values slightly higher than those found between MODIS and station
    observations (Fig. 4). These improvements were even more apparent in the maps
    of Fig. 10, which also showed that the complex spatial patterns of the errors
    in the baseline simulation have been replaced by more uniform and smoother patterns.
    The Veg-adj simulation also decreased large errors in the simulation of daytime
    LST from April to July, with lower RMSE, higher CC, and bias close to 0 ∘C throughout
    the year (Fig. 8). 4.3.3 Adjustment of snow dynamics The Snow-adj step was aimed
    at improving the simulation of SCF. We first modified the computation of longwave
    radiation for tall trees, which improved the simulation of SCF during the snow
    accumulation season. Next, a parameter of the relation controlling the decay of
    snow albedo was modified from 0.92 to 0.80, leading to an enhanced simulation
    of SCF in the ablation season. Figure 11 presents bias maps between simulated
    and observed mean monthly SCF and seasonality of SCF in snow-dominated cells for
    the baseline, Veg-adj, and Snow-adj simulations. Time series of SCF in 2 pixels
    are also shown to visualize differences in regions with positive and negative
    bias. In the baseline simulation, SCF bias was positive, which occurs mainly during
    May through October. Forcing corrections reduced SCF, as Tair was increased in
    mountainous areas. Adjustments in the Snow-adj step reduced bias in most locations
    during the accumulation and ablation seasons. When averaged over time and in the
    CRB, SCF bias was relatively small. When focusing on single pixels, however, the
    bias magnitude was larger, with differences in seasonality depending on location.
    For example, bias reached +20 % (Fig. 11c) from April to December and −20 % (Fig.
    11d) from November to March. As expected, Snow-adj changes mainly impacted LST
    simulations in mountains, while a marginal influence occurred in the rest of the
    CRB. Overall, the daytime LST bias map improved, while RMSE in mountain regions
    for both daytime and nighttime remained similar. To complete the model performance
    assessment, we reported, in Figs. S10 and S11, the maps of simulated and observed
    long-term climatology of monthly SCF in the snow season and LST, respectively,
    over 2003–2018. Error metrics between the maps are presented in Table S2, which
    shows that the overall trend of the metrics specifically designed to compare spatial
    patterns, SSIM and SPAEF, are in line with the changes in RMSE and bias that have
    been used in the rest of the paper. Figure 11(a) Spatial maps of bias between

    As shown previously (Corbari and Mancini, 2014; Crow et al., 2003), improving
    the simulation of hydrologic spatial patterns could affect streamflow performance
    since structural limitations and different degrees of conceptualization require
    further tuning. We investigated this in Fig. 12, using time series of monthly
    runoff in the Green and San Juan subbasins and the Upper Basin. Model performance
    is very good for baseline simulations, since its calibration was tailored to naturalized
    streamflow records. Forcing and vegetation parameter adjustments slightly lowered
    performance (changes in NSE ≤ 0.05), whereas changes for the snow adjustment led
    to streamflow overestimation in May in all subbasins, especially in the Green
    subbasin (NSE reduced to 0.57). Overall, simulated streamflow performance here
    is consistent with Tang and Lettenmaier (2010), who found that incorporating MODIS
    snow cover degrades streamflow metrics. We attribute this degradation in performance
    to a number of reasons. First, remotely sensed spatiotemporal data of SCF have
    limitations in its usefulness for tracking SWE, which is the modeled state variable
    more directly impacting streamflow. Second, VIC uses a binary scheme for depicting
    SCF in elevation bands within each time of each grid cell, limiting its accuracy
    in representing topographic variations. To address these limitations, enhancements
    are needed in both the 1simulation of snow physics and remote sensing of the spatial
    variation in snow depth or SWE at high spatiotemporal resolutions. In addition
    to streamflow, we explored the impacts of each calibration step on the water balance.
    For this aim, we computed the climatological monthly mean of the water balance
    components for the Upper Basin, where most runoff is generated. Results are presented
    in Fig. 13, which shows fluxes (P, ET, and RO; see the Fig. 13a caption for their
    definition) and changes in state variables (ΔSM and ΔSWE) for the baseline simulations
    (Fig. 13a) and the difference between a given variable simulated in each calibration
    step and the variable from the baseline simulation (Fig. 13b–d). The Forcing-adj
    and Veg-adj steps lead to small changes in ET and RO, with a decrease in both
    fluxes in the summer months and an increase in the other months. The modification
    of these fluxes is due to a change in the storage components, with (1) lower SWE
    (i.e., negative ΔSWE) and higher SM from November to February and (2) higher SWE
    and lower SM from March to July. The Snow-adj step modifies the seasonality of
    SWE compared to the baseline by increasing this storage component in February
    and March and reducing it in April and May. This, in turn, leads to an opposite
    behavior for SM, which is ultimately translated into a positive (negative) change
    in RO in May and June (July and August). In all cases, the changes in runoff occurred
    in a similar way for both the surface and underground components. 5 Summary and
    conclusions In this study, we made improvement to a regional hydrologic model
    in the Colorado River basin using MODIS observations of land surface temperature
    and snow cover. Based on the remotely sensed data, we corrected the meteorological
    forcings, updated the vegetation parameters, and revised snow-related processes
    to enhance the model performance. The adjustments increased the consistency between
    VIC and MODIS LST and SCF fields, thus enhancing credibility of the spatial simulations.
    Our conclusions are summarized as follows: MODIS products provided spatiotemporal
    information that can be used to identify uncertainties in a hydrologic model calibrated
    with streamflow records at a few locations. Although baseline simulation performance
    for LST was high (mostly CC > 0.8), spatial errors within the CRB were non-negligible.
    The baseline simulation had lower RMSE of LST for nighttime and cold season conditions.
    Baseline model discrepancies were primarily associated with energy exchanges at
    land surface during periods of higher solar radiation. Simulated nighttime LST
    values were dominated by the initial air temperature, such that improvements were
    obtained from forcing corrections. This led to a reduction in nighttime LST bias
    from −7 to 6 ∘C in the baseline case to −5 to 5 ∘C in the Forcing-adj simulation.
    Vegetation adjustments led to large improvements in daytime LST, with RMSE reductions
    from 7.5 to 2.5 ∘C, but were less effective at night. In addition, the range of
    daytime RMSE of LST was reduced from 4 to 10 ∘C in the baseline case to 2.5 to
    3.5 ∘C in the Veg-adj simulation. Updated snow physics reduced the negative bias
    in SCF during the accumulation season. We further adjusted melting snow albedo
    to improve performance in the ablation period. Unlike other modifications, runoff
    was substantially impacted by the lower snow albedo. Thus, the consistency between
    VIC and MODIS snow cover did not ensure an improved streamflow simulation, demonstrating
    the limitations of the regional application in accurately capturing the variation
    in SWE in mountainous areas. A possible solution to improve the spatial credibility
    of the hydrologic model without degrading streamflow performance is by incorporating
    satellite products and ground observations into a multi-objective calibration.
    Our work complements and expands efforts on validating physically based hydrologic
    simulations through remote sensing products. The adjustment steps led to the improvements
    in simulated LST that are in line with studies using hydrologic models with various
    levels of sophistication. For instance, simulations of Xiang et al. (2017) in
    a semiarid basin in northern Mexico found LST RMSE of 4.3 ∘C for the daytime and
    1.9 ∘C during the nighttime compared to MODIS. The hyperresolution (∼80 m) simulations
    of Ko et al. (2019) in the same basin resulted in bias of −1.4 ∘C and CC of 0.87,
    and the high-resolution simulations with VIC in central Arizona by Wang et al.
    (2021) yielded LST biases between −1.5 and 3.6 ∘C. To our knowledge, this study
    is the first to improve the simulated spatial patterns of hydrologic variables
    in the CRB using remote sensing products. By increasing the credibility of the
    spatial model outputs, this effort builds confidence in using regional hydrologic
    models for water resources predictions and decision-making under the ongoing megadrought
    in the Colorado River. Finally, we identified several future research avenues
    to further improve the fidelity of hydrologic models through the incorporation
    of remote sensing products. First, once the key parameters involved in the physical
    equations simulating a variable observed by satellite sensors have been identified
    as done here, a robust multiparameter sensitivity analysis could be conducted
    to investigate possible interactions among the parameters; this effort will help
    further refine the calibration. Second, automatic calibration strategies could
    be designed and applied to simultaneously target the simulation of multiple variables
    (here, LST and SCF). Appendix A We describe the solution of the energy balance
    in VIC, which leads to the computation of ground surface temperature (Ts) and
    canopy foliage temperature (Tf) used to compute the land surface temperature variable,
    LSTV, that is compared against the MODIS estimate, LSTM. We emphasize the main
    parameters and variables involved in the computation of these state variables.
    More detailed descriptions can be found in previous publications (Andreadis et
    al., 2009; Bohn and Vivoni, 2016; Cherkauer et al., 2003; Cherkauer and Lettenmaier,
    1999; Liang and Lettenmaier, 1994). We first illustrate the original algorithm
    introduced in the first version of VIC (Liang and Lettenmaier, 1994), then the
    snow overstory scheme introduced by Cherkauer and Lettenmaier (2003), and finally
    the clumped-canopy scheme implemented by Bohn and Vivoni (2016). A1 Original scheme
    from Liang and Lettenmaier (1994) In Liang and Lettenmaier (1994), the minimal
    unit of simulation is the tile with a homogeneous land cover, i.e., the big-leaf
    approach. The energy balance equation for the tile can be expressed as follows:
    where Rn is net radiation, SH is sensible heat flux, LH is latent heat flux, and
    GH is ground heat flux. The parameters and variables involved in the computation
    of each term are summarized in Table 2. Net radiation is determined by the following:
    where RS and RL are downward shortwave and longwave radiation, α is albedo, ε
    is surface emissivity (0.98 for water; 0.97 for other conditions), and σ is the
    Stefan–Boltzmann constant. The latent heat is computed as follows: where ρw is
    the density of liquid water, λv is the latent heat of vaporization, Ec is evaporation
    from wet canopy, Et is plant transpiration, and Eb is evaporation from surface
    soil moisture. For any given time, the maximum value of Ec, denoted as Ec,max,
    is calculated as follows: where W is the amount of canopy interception at a given
    time, Wmax is the maximum amount of water that the canopy can intercept (computed
    as 0.2 ⋅ LAI), rarc is the canopy architectural resistance, ra is the aerodynamic
    resistance, and Ep is the potential evaporation derived from the Penman–Monteith
    equation with a canopy resistance set to zero. This is calculated as follows:
    where Δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship,
    ρa is the air density, cp is the specific heat of air, δe is the vapor pressure
    deficit, γ is the psychrometric constant, and rs is the surface resistance. The
    aerodynamic resistance is calculated as follows: where u(z) is the wind speed
    at the measurement height z, and Cw is the transfer coefficient for water. This
    is defined as follows: where k is the von Kármán constant, z0 is the roughness
    length, d0 is the displacement height, and F(Ri) is a function of the Richardson
    number, Ri, that accounts for atmospheric stability. z0 and d0 have different
    values for each vegetation type and for bare soil and snow. Ri is defined as follows:
    where g is the gravitational acceleration, and Tair is the air temperature. When
    , ; otherwise, Ec is a fraction of Ec,max determined as a function of precipitation
    and W. The transpiration, Et, is calculated as follows: where the canopy resistance,
    rc, is related to the minimal stomatal resistance, rmin, via Gsm is the soil moisture
    stress factor depending on root zone water availability (depth dependent on vegetation
    type). Bare soil evaporation, Eb, is equal to Ep when the shallowest soil layer
    is saturated; otherwise, it is computed as follows: where As is the fraction of
    saturated soil. This is computed as follows (Zhao et al., 1980): where bi is the
    infiltration shape parameter, i0 is the current infiltration capacity determined
    by water availability, and im is the maximum infiltration capacity computed as
    the product between maximum soil moisture (equal to soil depth times porosity)
    and (1+bi). The sensible heat flux, SH, is given by the following: where ρa and
    c are the mass density and specific heat of air at constant pressure, respectively.
    The ground heat flux, GH, is calculated by the following: where T1 is the soil
    temperature at depth D1 (0.1 m here), and κ is the soil thermal conductivity.
    The equations described above are used to estimate Ts through an iterative procedure.
    Ts is initially set to Tair, leading to Ri=0 and F(Ri)=1; evapotranspiration is
    then estimated and the energy balance is solved to update Ts (Liang and Lettenmaier,
    1994). Iterative solutions for Ts are repeated until the difference between initial
    and final values are within a tolerance. This scheme is applied to the case of
    tile A in Fig. 2 when . A2 Snow overstory scheme from Cherkauer et al. (2003)
    The energy balance in VIC was improved with the snow overstory scheme of Cherkauer
    et al. (2003). Andreadis et al. (2009) upgraded this scheme with fully balanced
    energy terms and the representation of snow interception. The scheme assumes a
    vegetated overstory (with foliage temperature Tf) and an understory without vegetation
    (with surface temperature Ts), as in tile B in Fig. 2 with . If snow is not present,
    Tf is assumed equal to Tair, and Ts is calculated with the scheme described above.
    When snow is present, the energy balance is solved separately in control volumes
    (CVs) of the overstory, understory, and the atmosphere surrounding the canopy
    (with temperature Tc), respectively. The algorithm involves the following steps:
    Tc is initially assigned equal to Tair. The snow on the canopy is determined according
    to snowfall and maximum interception capacity, , where Lr is a step function of
    Tf from the last time step. If there is no snow on the trees, then . If there
    is snow on the trees, and snow is melting, then Tf=0 ∘C. If the snow is not melting,
    then the energy balance of the overstory CV with snow is solved for Tf, as follows:
    where EA is energy advected by precipitation, SHsnow-canopy is calculated as in
    Eq. (A13) but with Ts, and Tair replaced by Tf and Tc. The net radiation for snow
    on the canopy is as follows: with αsnow as the snow albedo. If Ts is not available,
    an initial value of 0 ∘C is used in Eq. (A16). The latent heat from snow sublimation
    is as follows: where λs is the latent heat of sublimation, Pa is atmospheric pressure,
    and ra,snow is the aerodynamic resistance near the snow surface. The energy balance
    is then applied to the understory CV. Due to the presence of a tall tree, the
    shortwave radiation reaching the ground surface is reduced (by 50 %) due to the
    shading effect. The incoming longwave radiation is computed only as a function
    of Tf, while the contribution from the atmosphere is assumed negligible. Ts is
    then calculated by solving the energy balance. In this case, sensible heat is
    calculated using Eq. (A13) by replacing Tair with Tc and computing the aerodynamic
    resistance as follows: where zs is snow surface roughness and ds is the snow depth.
    If there is no liquid water in the ground snowpack, then the latent heat is calculated
    with Eq. (A17). If there is liquid water, then Eq. (A17) is used with the latent
    heat of vaporization, i.e., λs is replaced by λv. Once Ts is derived, Tc is updated
    by solving the energy balance at the CV that includes the atmosphere surrounding
    the canopy, as follows: where SH  is the sensible heat into snow calculated in
    step 2, and SH  is the SHsnow-canopy calculated in step 1. Tc is compared with
    its estimate from the previous step (Tair in the first iteration). If the values
    are not included within a tolerance, then steps 1–3 are repeated. A3 Clumped-canopy
    scheme from Bohn and Vivoni (2016) The schemes described above are based on the
    big-leaf approach, where vegetation was assumed to cover the entire surface of
    the tile. Bohn and Vivoni (2016) introduced the clumped-canopy scheme to improve
    the simulation of bare soil evaporation from inter-canopy spaces. This scheme
    relies on the vegetation fraction (fv). The aerodynamic resistance of each tile
    is updated to be the inverse of aerodynamic conductance,  , with the following:
    where ra,s and ra,v are aerodynamic resistances for bare soil and vegetated area,
    respectively, computed using Eq. (A6). For the soil, a constant roughness height
    of 0.0001 m is used. Because of the introduction of fv, we improved the snow physics
    in the Snow-adj step. The version of VIC employed in our baseline simulation assumed
    that longwave radiation into the snowpack was received only from the canopy in
    the tiles covered by trees, even for the unvegetated fraction. In the clumped
    scheme, where a fraction (1−fv) is unvegetated, this assumption is not reliable.
    Therefore, we updated the computation of the longwave radiation as the weighted
    average of the canopy longwave and longwave from the atmosphere (LW was replaced
    by LW , as highlighted in Fig. 2b). Code and data availability MODIS products

    protocolsPublish-subscribe protocols 1. Introduction In recent years, a large
    variety of devices have become interconnected over the Internet at an unexpected
    rate by using the Internet of Things (IoT). Increasing interest in the IoT has
    driven many areas (such as agriculture, hospitals, manufacturing, security surveillance
    [[1], [2], [3]], air and water quality, transport, and domotics) to adopt IoT
    features [4,5]. The primary goal of these applications is to either exchange data
    and control signals among devices or to use cloud-based communication protocols.
    In the layered architecture of the IoT, the application layer provides various
    communication protocols and acts as an interface between desired application and
    end-users [[6], [7], [8]]. As the number of IoT applications increases, so does
    the need to modify or introduce new protocols that address issues, such as dynamic
    adaption to the network conditions and interoperability. However, updating or
    providing new protocols for each and every application is a challenging task.
    Machine Learning (ML) can be used to make these protocols dynamic and intelligent.
    ML extracts complex models through analysis of (or learning from) the experiences
    without being explicitly programmed [[9], [10], [11]]. It is used in several applications,
    such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [12], medical data analysis [13,14], and
    social networks [15,16], and also helps to mitigate several issues in IoT, such
    as intrusion detection [17], improving wireless communication [18], and data analytics
    [19,20]. Applying ML to an IoT application layer not only produces intelligent
    protocols, but also reduces redesign overheads and limits human intervention [12].
    For instance, data-sensitive real-time applications (e.g., medical, industrial,
    and smart city apps) frequently and quickly require data from IoT devices, but
    getting the most recent data quickly from edge nodes is difficult due to network
    delays and connection failures. To address these issues, ML is used extensively
    in the IoT for predicting values in situations where real-time data cannot be
    acquired [21]. Other advantages of using ML in IoT applications are summarized
    as follows: ● IoT applications require less human intervention and redesign in
    the dynamic environments. ● ML–based clustering algorithms are efficient and accurate
    [12], such as those used by message brokers (e.g., Apache Qpid, VerneMQ, and HornetMQ).
    ● ML used for data pre-processing and feature selection reduces traffic overheads
    and optimizes the energy consumption of IoT devices However, ML does have certain
    limitations that require consideration when applied to IoT applications and their
    protocols. ML is non-deterministic, has few available datasets, and requires prediction
    validation. Over the past decade, there have been several surveys of the IoT,
    its applications, applicable technologies, architectures, IoT privacy, IoT security,
    and so on [4,5]. Articles [18,19] were written about ML approaches to, among other
    subjects, IoT applications and challenges as well as fifth-generation communication
    and security. In Refs. [[6], [7], [8],22], the authors covered various IoT protocols
    supporting the application, network, and physical layers. Al et al. [6] included
    some traditional protocols, such as Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Message
    Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and Data Distribution Service (DDS). In Ref.
    [7], Sethi et al. briefly compared HTTP, CoAP, and MQTT protocols with other layer
    protocols. An editorial column [22] discussed the importance of the IoT application
    layer protocols. In Ref. [8], Salman et al. made a simple comparison between some
    application layer protocols and other layer protocols. The CoAP and HTTP were
    compared in Ref. [23]. This article discussed the benefits of these protocols,
    but did not make any open challenges to enhance the research. A comparison of
    MQTT and CoAP in terms of error and delay prone links was performed in Ref. [24],
    which stated that MQTT performs better with the IoT. IoT protocols were studied
    for cognitive Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication by Ref. [25]. In that article,
    Aijaz et al. restricted their focus to application layer protocols, specifically
    CoAP. In Ref. [26], the authors studied various CoAP security issues while failing
    to consider other application layer protocols or provide significant open issues
    for future research [27]. summarized the benefits and features of various traditional
    IoT application layer protocols (such as HTTP, CoAP, XMPP, Advanced Message Queuing
    Protocol (AMQP), MQTT, and DDS). However, it did not list any limitations or future
    enhancements. The computational performances of CoAP, MQTT, and WebSocket were
    compared across various scenarios and network conditions by Ref. [28]. In [29],
    Saritha et al. compared various traditional application layer protocols. This
    article briefly discusses these protocols and has not provided sufficient limitations
    to enhance the research in this area. The interoperability issues of various application
    layer protocols such as HTTP, CoAP, MQTT and AMQP are covered in Ref. [30]. In
    Ref. [31], Safaei et al. discussed reliability side effects related to application
    layer protocols, stating that MQTT works well for IoT among other protocols. Similarly,
    empirical studies on MQTT and CoAP were performed in Refs. [32,33]. In Ref. [34],
    experimental evaluations were conducted on CoAP, HTTP, XMPP, WebSocket, MQTT,
    and AMQP using various conditions and network scenarios. A performance evaluation
    of IoT application layer protocols was performed in Ref. [35]. [36] discussed
    application layer coding for IoT along with its implementation aspects, benefits,
    and limitations. A performance analysis of the HTTP, CoAP, and MQTT was performed
    in Ref. [37] under various circumstances, proving that the MQTT was lightweight
    and faster. Table 1 compares these surveys on IoT application layer protocols.

    made for traditional application layer protocols. This motivates us to study recent
    advancements in application layer protocols and relevant applications used by
    these protocols. These enhancements are covered in this article, along with their
    benefits, limitations, and further research scope. Existing surveys have also
    neglected to discuss the scope of ML in IoT application layer protocols, despite
    a broad scope existing for making IoT application layer protocols intelligent.
    The primary focus of this article is shown in Fig. 1. Considering the gaps in
    existing surveys, this article contributes: ● A study of previous and recent advancements
    in IoT application protocols (e.g., request-response method, publish–subscribe
    (PubSub) pattern). ● A survey of various IoT application layer protocols and the
    benefits of using them in real-time applications, including industrial IoT, smart
    cities and homes, video and security surveillance, healthcare, mobility management,
    and the Web of Things (WoT). ● Open challenges to make IoT application layer protocols
    intelligent and dynamic by employing ML approaches. These challenges highlight
    the major issues of application layer protocols, such as congestion control, message
    expiry, end-to-end delay, energy-efficiency, and resource management. Most of
    the abbreviations we use throughout the article are either standard or defined
    when first used, and for the reader''s convenience, we listed the most used acronyms
    in Table 2. The remaining sections of this article are arranged as follows. In
    Section 2, we provide a survey on previous and recent advancements in IoT application
    layer protocols and list their limitations. In Section 3, we list various IoT
    applications that use application layer protocols and their evaluations. In Section
    4, ML''s adaptability to request-response and PubSub for further research is discussed.

    protocols The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) group under the Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF) and International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication
    works on application layer protocol development in the IoT. These protocols are
    mainly categorized into request–response (e.g., client/server), PubSub, push-pull,
    and exclusive-pair communication protocols. Of these, request–response and PubSub
    protocols have been well received in the literature. This section describes historical
    and recent advances of these protocols, along with their benefits and limitations.

    protocols The request-response model is one of the basic stateless and bidirectional
    communication models on the Internet; it is also used in a constrained IoT. In
    this model, two or more end parties (e.g., clients/servers) exchange their data
    asynchronously. In the IoT, Representational State Transfer (REST)ful HTTP, XMPP,
    CoAP, and WebSocket use the request-response communication pattern. In this subsection,
    we discuss recent advancements in each of these request-response protocols. 2.1.1.
    RESTful HTTP HTTP was initially developed by Tim Berners-Lee [39] and later enhanced
    jointly by IETF and World Wide Web (WWW) Consortium for web-based messaging. It
    commonly uses a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for reliable transmissions
    over the Internet [40]. This protocol is not recommended for the IoT, as it uses
    existing web standards instead of developing services or components for constrained
    IoT applications. Its limitations with respect to the IoT are highlighted as follows.
    ● Scalability: The IoT is composed of a large number of nodes, and each node that
    connects with a server requires an underlying persistent connection, as the limited
    capability of holding requests by an HTTP server precludes it from holding connection
    requests from all nodes. Besides, each node in the network connects with multiple
    nodes, creating heavy loads on constrained IoT devices. These heavy resource constraints
    force HTTP servers to consume equivalent power, preventing them from providing
    scalability and energy-awareness with IoT applications. ● Uni-directional: Due
    to its large number of connections, the IoT needs to communicate with multiple
    devices simultaneously. By contract, HTTP protocol can only process a single request
    or response at a time. This uni-directional communication is not a recommended
    solution for IoT applications. ● Responsiveness: HTTP requires large bandwidth
    because of its weighty message sizes that increase latency and energy consumption.
    The synchronization feature of HTTP leads to latency during data transmission.
    ● Point-to-point Communication: In the IoT, a large number of nodes collect and
    transmit data to base stations simultaneously. As stated previously, HTTP cannot
    handle multiple requests simultaneously, as it can only communicate with two point-to-point
    (one-to-one) devices (e.g., nodes, servers). ● No Event-driven Nature: Most IoT
    applications are event-driven, responding only when they identify an event. HTTP
    design is based on the request–response pattern, which is not event-driven and
    requires unnecessary energy consumption. 2.1.2. Extensible messaging and presence
    protocol XMPP was developed by the IETF for the Internet, initially for heterogeneous
    networks [41] to avoid interoperability issues. It also provides efficient communication
    between devices while supporting both request–response and PubSub. These features
    are attractive to IoT users to implement various applications. Extended versions
    of the XMPP have been published through the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF), and
    the recent versions are listed below. ● xep-0000: This version provides an efficient
    multicast data transmission between low-powered devices and uses the PubSub communication
    pattern. It also includes an interoperability interface over heterogeneous networks.
    ● xep-0322, xep-0323, xep-0324: The major extensions in these versions are about
    packet size optimization and memory issues. The xep-0323 version performs basic
    operations on sensor data, and xep-0324 incorporates the access privilege management
    approaches. ● xep-0325, xep-0326: These versions control servers, devices, and
    actuators in IoT infrastructures. ● xep-0347: This version defines localization
    and discovers needs for the deployment or removal of any device in a network.
    The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Request For Comments(RFC)8284 was introduced
    recently over XMPP using white page objects rather than Jabber IDs [42]. A Lightweight
    XMPP (LXMPP) was introduced in Ref. [43] for resource-constrained IoT. This protocol
    performs periodic data transmissions by using a sleeping mechanism. The development
    of this protocol inherited the merits of xep-0060 with the support of PubSub architecture
    [44]. In this approach, sleeping clients prolong battery lifespan. In Ref. [45],
    Khramtsov et al. proposed an XMPP over RELOAD (XoR) protocol based on XMPP. In
    it, XMPP clients establish peer-to-peer streams without routing to XMPP servers.
    Some other XMPP projects, such as mbed XMPPClient and μXMPP [46], use the LXMPP
    to allow the deployment of sensor nodes. The XSF team encouraged developers to
    modify or incorporate additional services in to XMPP. A summary of recent XMPP
    advances is presented in Table 4. Table 4. Summary of recent advances in XMPP.

    [46] Lightweight and low power to deploy in Sensor nodes 2.1.3. CoAP and its recent
    advances CoAP (RFC-7252) is a low-powered, low-bandwidth, and lightweight constrained
    protocol for the IoT. This protocol was developed by the IETF CoRE group and inspired
    by HTTP over User Diagram Protocol (UDP). Due to lowbandwidth and higher network
    traffic, CoAP faces problems when handling the congestion and delay increases
    because of simple Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) [47,48]. Congestion leads to
    network retransmission, increasing energy consumption, latency, and packet loss,
    while reducing throughput and the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) [49]. There are
    several recent CoAP advances and extensions summarized in Table 5. An end-to-end
    congestion control mechanism called Congestion Control/Advanced (CoCoA) was developed
    based on the CoAP [50]. The major enhancement from CoAP to CoCoA is the Retransmission
    Timeout (RTO). The CoAP uses a fixed RTO, whereas CoCoA uses a variable RTO based
    on the Retransmission Time (RTT) calculation used in TCP. In Ref. [51], Betzler
    et al. performed experimental testbeds on CoAP and CoCoA in various conditions
    with different nodes. These testbeds indicated that CoCoA produces a PDR 14–45%
    better than the CoAP. An extension of CoCoA, CoCoA+, introduces a Variable Backoff
    Factor (VBF) in place of the BEB. The VBF is calculated based on the initial RTO,
    avoiding the successive retransmissions over a short period [52]. CoCoA and CoCoA+
    require weak and strong RTOs to determine their RTOs. Congestion Control Random
    Early Detection (CoCo-RED) was developed by Ref. [53] using a Fibonacci Pre-increment
    Backoff (FPB). In Ref. [54], Akpakwu et al. introduced a context-aware congestion
    control mechanism for CoAP, which computes RTO based on the weak and strong RTTs.

    times Throughput improvement Computationally heavy Further extensions for CoCoA+
    with an optimized RTO were introduced in Precise CoCoA (pCoCoA) [55] and CoCoA++
    [56]. The pCoCoA uses only one RTO (a smooth RTO) rather than maintaining two
    RTOs. It additionally uses the retransmission count at Acknowledgement (ACK) during
    the retransmission of the Confirmable (CON) message to regulate the number of
    packet retransmissions. It has less computational overhead compared with CoCoA+
    or CoCoA. CoCoA++ maintains a single RTO, and computes a new RTO by integrating
    with the CAIA Delay-Gradient (CDG) and Probabilistic Backoff Function. CDG gets
    congestion information from TCP''s congestion window. CoCoA++ replaces the VBF
    with a PBF during RTO computation, and it does not use per-packet RTT like other
    protocols. Overall, most CoAP advancements were made to prevent congestion by
    computing an optimal RTO. The general RTO estimation strategies of these protocols
    are illustrated in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (395KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. General RTO estimation strategies for CoAP
    and its recent enhancements. In [70], Ishaq et al. proposed a CoAP group communication
    approach by allowing them to monitor resources. The parallel operation of group
    communication and observation in the CoAP is an incessant task, but it enables
    both operations to be performed while making the protocol intelligent at the data
    source. Larmo et al. [71] tested the performances of the CoAP and MQTT on a narrowband
    IoT. The data transmissions between the sensor nodes and the cloud were faster
    in the UDP-based CoAP when compared with the TCP-based MQTT in terms of system
    capacity, coverage, and latency, even with a massive network load. The MQTT performs
    well only under low network loads. The authors of [72] developed an efficient
    proxy for IoT to estimate congestion. Their approach also adopted the Max-Age
    approach to maintain the cache. CoAP cache management was also performed in Ref.
    [57] focusing on multicast CoAP to update cache information at the proxy. This
    approach also focused on efficient energy management and delay-aware data transmissions
    by preventing congestion. In Ref. [69], Demir et al. proposed an ML-based CoAP
    protocol with an RTO computation strategy that adopted ML-based technique. Several
    articles [[58], [59], [60], [61], [62],[73], [74], [75]] have focused on CoAP
    protocol security. A Constrained Extensible Protocol (CoEP) was introduced in
    Ref. [58] for a secure and lightweight IoT application layer protocol, embedding
    authentication, confidentiality, and integrity for efficient security-based data
    transmissions. A lightweight secure protocol using Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) was is introduced in Ref. [73]. Bhattacharyya et al. [74] extended this
    approach by using DTLS with a pre-shared key to exchange encrypted data between
    IoT nodes. Similarly, a cross-layer approach of the Object Security of CoAP (OSCoAP)
    with a Cipher-block Chaining Message was proposed in Ref. [59] for media access
    control layer security in the IoT. The authors experimentally proved that this
    approach was more energy efficient (≈10%) and 37% faster than existing protocols.
    A patent from Ref. [76] enhanced the CoAP for group communication with selective
    responses in the IoT. In Ref. [61], Roselin et al. used ML to mitigate spoofing
    vulnerability attacks while supporting remote server access. This approach efficiently
    controlled fake requests from attackers to the remove servers. A security framework
    for CoAP was developed by Ref. [60] that included group key management and access
    control mechanisms as well as a pairwise symmetric key to avoid the DTLS handshake
    mechanism. Generic-bootstrapping architecture-based authentication and security
    mechanisms were introduced for CoAP in Ref. [75]. In Ref. [62], Perez et al. implemented
    a CoAP security mechanism using Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC), an
    alternative to the DTLS handshake for an end-to-end security mechanism. In [[64],
    [65], [66]], dynamic CoAP was introduced to control an IoT network. In Refs. [64,65],
    Herrero et al. focused on latency awareness to guarantee packet delivery using
    supervised classification on the data packets. This method also optimized power
    usage by minimizing network retransmissions. In Ref. [66], Krawiec et al. focused
    on multimedia streaming data transmission using the CoAP. This approach adjusted
    network parameters to improve traffic efficiency in the IoT. Hybrid CoAP was introduced
    in Ref. [63] that automatically switched between local devices and centralized
    server. This approach also detected and removed resources based on availability,
    making it scalable, cheaper, faster, and able to adapt to a dynamic system. The
    CoAP-Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a lightweight CoAP that was introduced
    as an authentication mechanism in Ref. [68], using bootstrapping services (such
    as the architecture) with entities, interfaces, and the flow operation. This protocol
    also supports authentication, flexibility, scalability, and identity federation.
    2.1.4. WebSocket WebSocket is a bidirectional, asynchronous, low-latency, full-duplex
    protocol developed for constant data transmission between two devices using a
    single TCP channel. This protocol was inspired by HTTP with advances that included
    event-driven communication in real-time IoT applications [77]. A WebSocket session
    can also start without using a request-response or PubSub communication pattern.
    Wong [78] developed a server system for WebSocket without using a master. Another
    WebSocket enhancement is communication clustering in master-slave servers. However,
    security is a major issue for this protocol. An extended WebSocket protocol was
    introduced in Ref. [79] that allowed control messages to be included in the frame
    without interruption, whereas the existing WebSocket protocol failed to get control
    messages. 2.1.5. Summary of request-response protocols As pointed out earlier
    in Subsection 2.1, most CoAP advances have been introduced at the RTO computations,
    using static mathematical approaches or TCP retransmission strategies, and focusing
    on minimizing the number of retransmissions. These methods use only the RTT to
    estimate RTOs, yet RTTs are sometimes noisy [56]. These methods can control, but
    not prevent, congestion. The CoAP is embedded with the security features, but
    all the techniques discussed in the literature are heavyweight. XMPP, by contrast,
    is decentralized with redundant protocols that create excessive traffic, making
    it unsuitable for larger applications. XMPP is also unable to transmit unmodified
    binary data over the network. 2.2. Publish–subscribe model The PubSub model is
    an asynchronous and loosely coupled model for data exchange between two devices
    that uses an eventbus or message broker. In this model, endpoints do not know
    about each other, but the broker knows about them. The broker makes a bridge between
    publishers and subscribers during data transmissions. The basic PubSub communication
    pattern is illustrated in Fig. 4. The most commonly used PubSub protocols (such
    as MQTT, AMQP, Web Services-Notification (WS-N), Simple/Streaming TextOriented
    Messaging Protocol (STOMP), and DDS) are described as follows. Download : Download

    communication pattern. 2.2.1. MQTT and its recent advances Andy Stanford-Clark
    and Arlen Nipper initially developed MQTT at IBM in 1999, and it was standardized
    in 2013 by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards
    (OASIS). MQTT is a lightweight PubSub messaging protocol widely used by many web
    applications, including the IoT [80,81]. MQTT connection uses M2M communication
    with a many-to-many routing mechanism. MQTTv3.1 adopted the feature of message
    expiry (i.e., discarding unreceived messages after a set time period). Recently,
    several modified versions of MQTT clients, servers, and brokers have evolved;
    among these versions, MQTT-SN, Mosquitto, hiveMQ, verneMQ, and Paho-MQTT have
    been well received. Their benefits and limitations are summarized in Table 6.
    MQTT for Sensor Networks (MQTT-SN) protocol is specially designed for WSNs; currently,
    it is renamed as MQTT-SN [82]. The primary modifications performed in MQTT-SN
    prevent permanent connections through UDP and reduce payload sizes. This lightweight
    protocol consumes less power than MQTT. In Ref. [83], Roy et al. proposed gateway-to-gateway
    message transmissions using MQTT-SN. This approach performs communications efficiently
    between sensor nodes and gateway. Datasets used to evaluate the MQTT protocol
    with various ML algorithms are available in Refs. [84,85]. Table 6. Summary of
    recent advances in MQTT. Protocol Features Advantages Limitations MQTT-SN [82]

    MQTT broker for reliable, highly scalable, and available Low-latency and fault-tolerant
    Lack of security Geolocation-based MQTT (MQTT-G) was introduced in Ref. [86],
    an extension of the MQTT protocol. This protocol advertises the specific range
    of locations as a notification to clients and provides search and rescue improvements.
    However, this application can only be used for a particular application, not for
    all categories. Kumar et al. [96] integrated MQTT with quick UDP Internet connections
    to reduce connection overhead during the message exchange between IoT devices
    or other devices and servers. MQTT with TCP takes the additional burden to make
    the handshake during the transmission. This approach reduces latency up to 55%,
    while processor and memory usage are lowered by 80% and 50% respectively when
    compared to MQTT. The Spanning Tree-based MQTT (MQTT-ST) protocol was introduced
    in Ref. [88] with a bidirectional communication pattern. In addition to this feature,
    it also enhances functions that include message expiry enhancement, optimal route
    selection, routing path with minimal RTT, run-time message tracking, and early
    reaction on failure messages. However, when these functions are enhanced, the
    protocol becomes heavyweight and consumes additional power to perform them. Park
    et al. [87] proposed a Direct Multicast-MQTT (DM-MQTT) protocol for efficient
    network resource utilization by preventing data transmission delay. This approach
    uses a bidirectional multicast mechanism between publishers and subscribers without
    using a centralized broker. This approach performs 58% and 65% better than MQTT
    in network usage and transmission delay, respectively. A lightweight MQTT was
    proposed in Ref. [89], using IEEE 1451 to modify MQTT''s existing architecture
    and network features. This method is not a secured one, but it can be extended
    to allow for security. The Mosquitto is an open source lightweight message broker/server
    for low-powered IoT devices; it implements MQTT/MQTT-SN using C programming and
    is maintained by the Eclipse Foundation [91]. It does not have cross-platform
    support and does not categorize message priorities; instead, it follows a first-come
    first-served approach. The message priority feature included in modified Mosquitto
    [92], separates urgent and regular messages, assigning critical messages higher
    priority and serving them first. RocketMQ is an MQTT-based message broker introduced
    for MQTT protocol in Ref. [93]. This broker controls the message push server with
    the help of Mosquitto by using the producer-consumer approach. HiveMQ is a client-based
    MQTT broker for reliable, efficient, and high-speed data transmission protocols
    on IoT devices. It is highly secured and provides continuous real-time data processing
    for brokers. This protocol works on MQTTv3.1 and all subsequent versions [94].
    VerneMQ is a distributed, reliable, high-performance, master-less clustered messaging
    protocol developed in Erlang for MQTT brokers [95]. This protocol includes many
    features, such as flow-control mechanism, message expiration, and shared subscriptions.
    The Paho-MQTT is a cost-effective open source client-based MQTT messaging protocol
    for constrained M2M and IoT applications [90]. 2.2.2. AMQP and its recent advances
    The AMQP is an open source protocol initially designed for business transactions
    exchanging messages between two parties (i.e., point-to-point communication) [97,98].
    The messaging structure of the AMQP is quite different in internal design and
    has more overhead compared to MQTT. The AMQP maintains multiple queues, storing
    messages in them temporarily before subscribers receive them. Thus, it supports
    interoperability between brokers and clients, enabling communication between heterogeneous
    connected systems [99,100]. The AMQP is also suitable for applications that require
    safe, high-quality, reliable, and rapid message delivery. However, it is not completely
    suitable for constrained applications because of its substantial features. RabbitMQ
    is a server initially implemented using Erlang programming [101]. It is an open
    source hybrid message broker for MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, and WebSocket. It sorts messages
    according to message properties, and ensures efficient and reliable delivery while
    managing component relationships well. However, this protocol is heavyweight,
    high-latency, and slow. It requires high computation, deployment, and maintenance
    costs. Apache ActiveMQ is an open source, asynchronous java-based multi-protocol
    message server for constrained applications [[102], [103], [104]]. It manages
    and allocates resources very efficiently, achieves high throughput, and also possesses
    interoperability. ActiveMQ also supports flow-control, message expiration, and
    message persistence by default. Its major limitations are memory limits per queue,
    and the heap is not used by default. An ActiveMQ broker is also limited by its
    architecture in terms of reliability, robustness, and scalability. Red Hat AMQ
    is an open source, lightweight, fast, and secure Java-based message protocol for
    large-scale Internet business applications, which was inspired by ActiveMQ. This
    protocol does not require any administrative costs, installation, or configurations.
    Apache Apollo is a new core for ActiveMQ that includes thousands of concurrent
    connections and a large multi-core server. Apache Apollo is a faster MQ that does
    not include all the features of ActiveMQ. 2.2.3. Web Services-Notification The
    WS-N protocol is standardized by OASIS, and it exchanges messages in a coalition
    environment using predetermined notifications. It transmits packets simultaneously
    to all registered clients and supports interoperability well between middleware
    providers. This protocol also takes care of security during data transmissions,
    subscriptions, and notifications using various key exchange mechanisms. It is
    a loosely-coupled architecture that uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) and
    follows Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) principles. This protocol was initially
    developed for resource-constrained applications, but it is resource-heavy compared
    with other protocols due to SOA restrictions, XML, and multiple queues. Thus,
    it is not ideal for all types of IoT applications. 2.2.4. STOMP The STOMP is a
    lightweight, secure, reliable text-based messaging protocol similar to HTTP that
    uses the PubSub pattern [105]. It has a straightforward implementation at the
    client level and also supports interoperability. Similar to AMQP, it uses frames
    for message exchanges between clients and servers by using a message broker. It
    does not use any comprehensive Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); instead,
    it uses simple, commonly used message operations with ACKs. The server implementation
    of STOMP is complicated, but it uses various existing server protocols (RabbitMQ,
    ActiveMQ, Apache Apollo, etc.). 2.2.5. DDS DDS was developed by the Object Management
    Group for real-time, lightweight IoT applications and is available for both open
    source and commercial implementations. It uses the PubSub model for reliable and
    scalable multicast message exchanges, whereas the multicast improves the QoS for
    real-time IoT applications. DDS has a broker-less architecture, unlike MQTT or
    AMQP, and requires no additional memory for a message queue. DDS is inexpensive,
    smart, secure, fast, interoperability capable, and simplifies the deployment,
    integration, development, and management of IoT applications. Fog-based DDS architecture
    was used between fog devices and cloud centers in Ref. [106]. The fog-based DDS
    architecture classifies data by considering the minimum storage cost and latency.
    This model was specially designed for fog-cloud communication, so it is not useful
    for constrained IoT devices. In Ref. [107], the DDS protocol was used as middleware
    between software and hardware devices for microgrid applications. It is a centralized
    approach used to identify and clear faults optimally. The DDS protocol is currently
    used in real-time large-scale IoT applications, such as air-traffic control, smart
    grid, healthcare, robotics, industrial integration, military [[108], [109], [110]].
    2.2.6. Summary of PubSub protocols In the PubSub model, there are still some open
    challenges. For instance, there is no consistency check in the message queue or
    the brokers. As the model depends entirely on its brokers, a broker crash can
    render the whole system useless. Should a message crash while a client is handling
    it, the message cannot be recovered (e.g., Mosquitto allows the client to control
    the message). Most of these protocols use multiple message queues when providing
    transmission between publishers and subscribers, yet the queues work based on
    predetermined rules in static conditions, but not work in dynamic conditions.
    Message expiry time management is also challenging. PubSub model performance can
    be determined based on its constraints (such as message size, required queues,
    and clients accessing a queue simultaneously). However, determining these parameters
    on-the-fly is very difficult under conventional PubSub protocols. Finally, the
    MQTT protocol does not support multicast messaging and is also unsuitable for
    service discovery auto configurations [111]. 2.3. Other protocol/message brokers
    There have been several other recent advancements for message brokers. Some popular
    brokers are summarized in Table 7. ZeroMQ (i.e., 0MQ, zMQ) is a message exchange
    protocol that uses a broker-less PubSub pattern for concurrent or distributed
    applications. It provides low-latency, high-throughput performance that integrates
    components easily [112]. However, this protocol is unreliable because of the load
    it places on local control modules. ZeroMQ also fails to manage relationships
    between all network components. Microsoft Message Queue (MSSQ) is a message broker
    for reliable message exchange between applications in an enterprise [113,114].
    In MSSQ, resource failure may happen when the message limit exceeds its threshold.
    There are also synchronization problems between the operations (e.g., copy, move,
    send, retrieve, and receive). Amazon MQ is a java-based durable message broker
    developed for ActiveMQ that also supports for MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, and WebSocket
    [115]. Apache Qpid functionalities are similar to RabbitMQ, and are used to implement
    the AMQP for reliable message exchanges among elements [116]. It easily detects
    client failover and assigns messages to different brokers. HornetQ is an asynchronous
    clustered open source middleware multi-protocol message project under the umbrella
    of ActiveMQ. Its most recent version (v 2.4) also supports AMQP and STOMP [117].
    The revised version of the HornetQ is Apache Artemis 1.0.0 which provides better
    performance and stability by combining ActiveMQ. Open Message Queue (OpenMQ) is
    an open source java-based messaging protocol developed by Oracle with scalable,
    clustered, and loosely-coupled architecture [118,119]. Latency-aware Popular Resource
    Re-caching (LEARN) is a middleware message broker developed to recache and reallocate
    heavily-loaded resources in the IoT [120]. LEARN is useful for reducing the average
    delay between two brokers with optimized resource utilization. Table 7. Summary
    of message brokers for application layers. Protocol Features Advantages Limitations

    grater stability Data loss Open MQ Java-based open source message protocol High
    availability, clustering for scalability Latency Apache Qpid, VerneMQ, HornetQ
    use simple and static clustering methods over message queues in different servers.
    ML-based clustering algorithms (such as k-means, hierarchical, or fuzzy-c-means)
    may be used in these protocols to make the clustering dynamic, efficient, and
    comfortable. 3. Significance of IoT application layer protocols in use cases Real-time
    applications benefit from using the application layer protocols of IoT in terms
    of latency, energy-efficiency, and throughput. This section reviews protocols
    used in specific applications, such as industrial IoT, smart cities and homes,
    healthcare, WoT, mobility management, and video surveillance. A summary of various
    applications that use application layer protocols are listed in Table 8. Table

    of the Wi-Fi network 3.1. Industrial IoT Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to IoT devices
    interconnected with manufacturing, automation, or control systems to perform data
    collection and analysis for improved machine efficiency and productivity [166].
    The IIoT is a delay-sensitive application that allows data transmissions and analytics
    to be performed rapidly when a correct application layer protocol is selected.
    Here, we discuss a few real-time works that adopted various IoT application layer
    protocols in the IIoT, which are summarized in Table 8. In [121], Derhamy et al.
    used CoAP protocols for on-demand, transparent, and secure IIoT translation to
    provide interoperability between communication protocols. In this work, CoAP acted
    as a SOA instead of middleware. This application also proved that the CoAP supports
    low latencies. A CoAP was used for a smart grid in Ref. [122] to improve throughput
    by reducing the mapping delay. The CoAP gateway was intercompatible in the smart
    grid network. In Ref. [123], CoAP was also used for a smart grid application through
    a combination with Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) to improve interoperability,
    system integration, and interaction. This combined protocol reduced message sizes
    and times compared with HTTP and other web service protocols. Latency estimation
    between data sources and the cloud (i.e., RTT and MQTT) was performed in Ref.
    [124]. This protocol provided inexpensive low latency. Smart agriculture through
    a remote monitoring station was introduced in Ref. [125] using the IoT. Initially,
    sensor nodes collected data and transmitted it to a remote monitoring system using
    the MQTT protocol. The station processed the data to provide farmers with decisions.
    Automatic keyword mining was proposed in Ref. [126] for network load and security
    management in WebSocket. Initially, it identified frequently appearing keywords
    before using a hidden semi-Markov approach to establish relations among them.
    The experimental validations outperformed previous WebSocket. In Ref. [127], Sunardi
    et al. used WebSocket protocol for agriculture applications to collect and transfer
    data from the field. In this context, a sensor node collects the temperature,
    soil moisturizer, and control of the field''s irrigation conduit. A fully partitioned
    DDS for real-time middleware systems was introduced in Ref. [128] for reliable
    data communication among the IoT devices. This approach performed well in terms
    of communication functions on a distributed network. In Ref. [129], XMPP was used
    to manage the microgrid''s reactive power requirements. XMPP provided an abstract
    communication service with delay-aware, interoperable, scalable, and secure data
    transmissions. 3.2. Smart city and smart home Smart cities and homes are rapidly
    growing IoT applications that enable smart technology with remote access and monitoring
    [[167], [168], [169]]. Growing these applications generates a vast amount of data,
    and this data management requires efficient application layer protocols. A summary
    of various IoT application layer protocols used in smart cities and smart homes
    is summarized in Table 8. A novel time synchronization mechanism was proposed
    in Ref. [130] for smart home applications using CoAP. This approach achieved high
    accuracy due to CoAP usage between the sensor nodes and the gateway for reliable
    data transmissions. This method also minimized network overload and resource utilization.
    In Ref. [170], an energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and secure data transmission
    protocol was introduced for smart home application. Bansal et al. [131] tested
    application layer protocols over a smart city application, comparing them with
    latency and bandwidth parameters. MQTT provided the best performance in a real-time
    environment. CoAP, MQTT, XMPP, and WebSocket performances were analyzed for a
    smart parking application in Ref. [132]. WebSocket and XMPP provided better scalability,
    while the others had single point of failure. XMPP also had the lowest server
    interaction. Using MQTT for event-based message communication in smart cities
    was proposed in Ref. [133]. This approach collected data using a network of IoT
    devices (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and ESP8266) along with sensors and actuators.
    The communication system''s primary goal was to prevent latency by minimizing
    the number of data transmissions. Remote control based smart home automation was
    presented in Ref. [134] using MQTT. This mechanism measured the current used in
    a house at each socket and also monitored the AC power while permitting remote
    access to home appliances. Similarly, an user energy management system with automated
    demand response was presented in Ref. [135] for smart home applications. In this
    work, Cornel et al. used MQTT protocols for data transmission over devices. In
    Ref. [136], an autonomous resource allocation mechanism was proposed for smart
    cities. In this approach, the Jamborsalamati et al. used MQTT for efficient data
    transmission between sensor nodes, an energy exchange, and a typical storage facility
    between neighborhoods. The method monitored network communication failures while
    investigating latency. In Ref. [137], fog computing-based home automation techniques
    were provided using ZiWi [171]. This approach used MQTT protocols for low-latency
    data communication. In this approach, home power consumption was reduced by ZiWi.
    3.3. Healthcare In healthcare and biomedical systems, the IoT has significantly
    addressed the most challenging issues, saving lives at minimal cost [172]. Using
    the IoT in the healthcare system has several benefits, such as remote health monitoring,
    monitoring hardware availability and accessibility, minimizing emergency room
    wait times, tracking patients and staff, addressing chronic disease, and managing
    drug plans [173]. In this section, we present application layer protocols that
    benefited healthcare IoT applications. A patient-centric eHealth system was proposed
    in Ref. [138] using a layered architecture including IoT devices, fog, and the
    cloud for handling complex data. This system covered assisted living, e-medicine,
    mobile health, early warning systems, and implants. In Ref. [139], an authentication
    mechanism was proposed to protect physiological data from malicious users. A smart
    gateway based on DTLS was used for efficient authentication authorization along
    with CoAP. Because of the enhanced DTLS, this algorithm efficiently performed
    data transmissions and minimized handshake delay. A mobility-based remote health
    monitoring system was introduced in Ref. [140]. Here, IoT devices were used to
    collect various patient details (e.g., pulse and ECG signals, body temperature,
    and body gesture). These details were transferred to the remote server using MQTT.
    This approach proved that MQTT performed better than HTTP and XMPP for this application.
    In [141], an IoT-based ECG monitoring system was presented. IoT devices collected
    patient information and transferred it directly to the cloud using HTTP and MQTT
    protocols. In this approach, the data transmissions and analyses were performed
    efficiently without delays between the server and web platforms. A smart healthcare
    system was proposed in Ref. [142], where IoT devices collected patient information
    and used AMQP to transfer the data to the cloud for further analysis. After analysis,
    a physician received sufficient decisions. 3.4. Mobility management The number
    of mobility based applications is rapidly increasing in the IoT, making tracking
    and managing these devices a challenging issue [174]. The mobility management
    highly depends on the wireless communication channel, and the application layer
    protocols also play a significant role in it [175]. The advantages and support
    of IoT application layer protocols for mobility management are discussed in this
    section. An MQTT-based connection management system for vehicles was proposed
    in Refs. [143,144]. Here, the MQTT protocol plays a major role in performing efficient
    data transmissions between vehicles, where MQTT was able to function even if the
    vehicle network was reorganized. Similarly, Mukherjee et al. [145] used MQTT protocols
    in the Internet of Drone Things to improve message delivery speed by reducing
    latency. Further, they used MQTT-SN to improve the average packet delivery rate
    by approximately 30%, confirming an energy efficient approach. In Ref. [146],
    Dhall et al. proposed a connected car maintenance approach based on the IoT. The
    authors used MQTT for efficient data exchanges between cars to help owners to
    schedule service, analyze traffic, and receive vehicle crash data. Here, MQTT
    enabled faster data transmissions with efficient usage of low-latency bandwidth.
    A CoAP-based Mobility Management Protocol (CoMP) was introduced in Ref. [147]
    for the IoT. The CoMP used a separate signaling flow and message format during
    data transmission. It kept track of sensor node IP addresses in the network, and
    efficiently handled latency and packet losses in the IoT. An extension of this
    work was completed in Ref. [148] with reliable mobility management. In this, Chun
    et al. modified reliable CON message communication from unreliable transmissions.
    Another extension of CoMP was achieved in Ref. [149], which performed group mobility
    communications called “CoMP-G for IoT”. This approach also performed better in
    terms of latency and total signaling during data transmission. In Ref. [150],
    proxy mobile IPv6-based mobility management approaches were proposed for sensors.
    These sensors used CoAP for data transmission. The classification of moving targets
    for WSNs was achieved using range limited marginalization and parallel range limited
    marginalization algorithms [176]. This approach achieved optimal decision fusion
    in various WSN scenarios. 3.5. Video surveillance Monitoring and tracking activities
    using video surveillance generates a massive amount of data through camera sensors
    [177]. This data has to be communicated to servers using the application layer
    protocols. IoT application layer protocols were tested for the Internet of Video
    Things in Ref. [178] by using various QoS parameters (e.g., memory usage, bandwidth,
    energy consumption, throughput, latency, packet, and payload size). The protocols
    are needed to handle low bandwidth and high latency communication channels when
    transmitting data between applications and servers [179,180]. In Ref. [181], Hilal
    et al. proposed IoT acoustic surveillance using Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)
    and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The primary goal of this approach was to recognize
    human screams or vocal stress, and it was tested at Waterloo International Airport.
    DDS middleware-based real-time video streaming was analyzed in Ref. [151]. The
    performance of network video transmission was tested with various QoS features.
    DDS prevented visual errors or interruptions during streaming and maintained acceptable
    quality. A WebSocket-based video surveillance service architecture was developed
    in Ref. [152]. WebSocket acted as a gateway for maintaining bidirectional communication.
    Compared with HTTP, WebSocket outperformed in terms of latency, frame loss rate,
    and visual errors. In Ref. [153], WebSocket subprotocols were used for media data
    transmissions between clients and servers without sending proxy server requests
    from the current channel. Here, WebSocket minimized unnecessary data transmission
    delay between the proxy server and same channel clients. 3.6. Web of Things The
    WoT is defined as physical devices (e.g., IoT devices) that can interact with
    the WWW, simply by applying web technologies to the IoT [182]. The main goals
    of the WoT are to hide the low-level designed, self-configured network through
    decreased human intervention, provide a platform for design and testing, and manage
    multiple platforms and protocols simultaneously and transparently [183]. IoT application
    layer protocols play a major role in the WoT, and most native WoT applications
    are summarized in Table 8. A proxy design for an efficient intercept communication
    module was designed for a swarm IoT in Ref. [154]. This proxy performed mapping
    between HTTP messages and CoAP and vice versa. This mechanism provided efficient
    communication with low latency and IoT interoperability. MQTT and CoAP were tested
    for the WoT in Ref. [155] for tiny IoT applications. In this work, Prabhu et al.
    used an architecture to control and monitor sensor nodes and their storage. This
    method produced minimal transmission delay and power consumption while improving
    PDR and throughput. However, network failure is possible and can cause data transmissions
    between servers and clients to be lost. Transmitting data through other clients
    during network failure was proposed with AMQP in Ref. [156]. In this case, when
    a publisher disconnects from a client, newly subscribed clients get status updates
    without any delay. Multiple observation requests for data collection and notifications
    at proxies were proposed in Ref. [157] for CoAP. This approach minimized energy
    consumption and also utilized bandwidth efficiently. CoAP is fully designed for
    IoT devices and not for web clients. Without intermediate application servers,
    a gateway, and proxies, CoAP is unable to serve the WoT appropriately. In this
    context, Castro et al. [158] extended CoAP for web-based applications without
    using any proxies, gateway, or application servers. A DTLS security-based algorithm
    was proposed in Ref. [159] for CoAP using a less biased algorithm for WoT. This
    approach supports multicast message distributions and performs encryption and
    decryption. A mobile agent was designed in Refs. [160,161] for a semantic WoT
    using CoAP. In this work, sensor nodes collected data from the field and extracted
    meaningful high-level events from it. This approach also supports interoperability
    between hybrid sensors. In Ref. [162], Williams et al. used WebSocket protocol
    between physical devices and web servers to push data transmissions. The WebSocket
    API maintaind the connection lifecycle, managed sessions, and reacted to disconnections.
    WebSocket was also useful as middleware in twisted environments. The MQTT protocol
    was studied in Ref. [163] for efficient data communication and collection from
    the IoT environment. In this article, Atmoko et al. used the MySQL database to
    store collected data for further analysis. Further, mobile and web-based applications
    were provided to access data from remote locations. In Ref. [111], the authors
    designed an architecture that autoconfigured the MQTT protocol for auto interaction
    with IoT devices using a semantic Web. This approach successfully achieved the
    autoconfiguration of MQTT-based devices with self-discovery mechanisms. Reliable
    message transmission using MQTT was studied in Ref. [164] for maintaining ordering
    between a work environment and the messages. An order flag was used along with
    the messages to maintain proper synchronization of the situation and use the message
    flag to process requests. In Ref. [165], Lie et al. proposed a distributed Wi-Fi
    network optimization method for the IoT. In this optimized network, the MQTT protocol
    was used for reliable and flexible data transmissions between devices. This method
    also extended security mechanisms over the system through the MQTT protocol. 3.7.
    Other applications A novel IoT honeypot (ThingPot) protocol was developed to provide
    denial-of-service attack security on the IoT [184]. It used the basic proof of
    the XMPP and REST API. Initially, it was developed for IoT applications, but was
    then extended to the IoT platform. Similarly [185], implemented a reverse engineering
    method on the message format of application layer protocols to identify security
    vulnerabilities in the IoT. This method identified change points and divided them
    into segments according to their static properties. These segments were then processed
    further to determine the vulnerabilities. In Ref. [186], Da et al. proposed MiddleBridge
    approach to act as middleware for translating CoAP, MQTT, DDS, XMPP, and WebSocket
    messages into HTTP. The MiddleBridge performed message configuration on the fly
    while addressing message size and transmission delays. A classification model
    for intrusion detection systems was introduced in Ref. [187] to detect IoT system
    attacks that used the MQTT protocol. In this model, attacks were classified using
    deep learning and recurrent networks. In Ref. [188], La et al. enhanced the security
    features of the MQTT protocol. Subscribers could dynamically control access to
    the data and data streams over time. The authors of [189] implemented a CoAP accelerator
    as a hardware module in a field programmable gate array. This accelerator reduced
    latency between IoT devices and improved other QoS parameters, such as throughput
    and bandwidth. 4. Scope of machine learning for further research While there have
    been several advances in IoT application layer protocols, as discussed in Section
    2, several challenges remain open and require further research. Several survey
    articles have covered possible open problems for these protocols. Even though
    there is a broad scope of ML in this layer, authors have not focused on adopting
    ML features. This section fills this gap by providing possible open challenges
    for further research to make the protocols intelligent and dynamic using ML. 4.1.
    Congestion control In CoAP, there is a need for dynamic RTO calculation to optimize
    the number of retransmissions and efficient RTTs. ML provides dynamic RTO computational
    strategies using Reinforcement Learning (RL), Bayesian, Regression, or SVM with
    minimal computational requirements [12]. From these, RL does not require a predetermined
    dataset and can learn during run-time. While Bayesian requires datasets, it also
    provides accurate RTO for congestion management in CoAP. Existing CoAP protocols
    use established RTTs to compute RTOs, yet those RTTs can be noisy. Other network
    features (e.g., retransmission counts, delays, and throughput) can also be considered
    when determining an optimal RTO. However, existing methods work once congestion
    is identified on a network, even though they cannot avoid the congestion completely.
    ML has the prediction capability to determine congestion before it occurs, based
    on the previous transmissions and other network conditions. An ML-based protocol
    can control unnecessary communications or retransmissions to avoid congestion
    from these predictions. It can also choose an alternate routing path to reduce
    traffic or drop the packets at a source to reduce energy consumption in extreme
    cases. In the IoT, the logistic regression, Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors
    (k-NN) and Q-learning provide efficient predictions for avoiding congestion. Logistic
    regression was used to control data flow and mitigate IoT congestion [190]. However,
    using logistic regression at the protocol level can provide greater benefits such
    as rapid classification, good accuracy, easy to implement and efficient to train.
    The success of RF, k-NN, and Q-learning for congestion control in WSNs indicates
    that these algorithms can control the congestion in the IoT [12]. Among these
    methods, RF is useful only for applications that do not have memory constraints,
    as RF requires more memory space [191,192]. 4.2. Energy-efficiency and delay-sensitive
    Constrained IoT devices are equipped with a limited energy battery. The energy
    consumption of a device mainly depends on data transmissions. Increasing the number
    of transmissions also increases energy consumption and vice versa. In this context,
    we can perform dimensionality reduction on the data before it is transmitted to
    reduce transmission overheads and memory overheads, as well as congestion and
    other computational necessities. Transmission overheads minimize latency for delay-sensitive
    applications (such as IIoTs, intelligent transportation systems, and healthcare
    applications). Computation overheads also affect energy consumption. The Singular
    Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent
    Component Analysis (ICA) are most suitable for dimensionality reduction in most
    IoT protocols [193,194]. Apart from dimensionality reduction, eliminating outlier
    data, anomalies, and digital garbage (garbage data generated by sensor nodes)
    can also help reduce data transmission overheads, saving energy and conserving
    network bandwidth [[195], [196], [197]]. The k-NN, k-means, SVM, and density–based
    spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithms fulfill this necessity
    in IoT application protocols. Dimensionality reduction, outlier or anomaly detection,
    and edge data prediction can be incorporated into CoAP, WebSocket, XMPP, AMQP,
    MQTT, and all their extended versions. While XMPP is particularly unsuited to
    large-scale IoT application due to its high message redundancy, its performance
    can be improved significantly through dimensionality reduction. ML is also useful
    for checking data redundancy and preventing multiple retransmissions. The feature
    selection process also reduces heavy data transmissions in the network, providing
    beneficial support for delay-sensitive applications [198,199]. The feature selection
    mechanism can also use for device classification [200]. PCA, ICA, and SVD are
    more accessible ML techniques for performing the feature extraction, and these
    are also useful in IoT application layer protocols. Among these techniques, ICA
    requires more computation, making PCA and SVD preferable for constrained devices.
    PCA was used in the IoT for anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction in
    Refs. [201,202]. Adopting these features in protocols provides benefit during
    the data collection process. Similarly, ICA also helps when addressing various
    issues discussed in subsection 4.2 [[203], [204], [205]]. RL also fulfills these
    task without requiring any training data set. 4.3. Message expiry Message expiry
    indicates that messages sent by a publisher or broker to the message queue will
    be discarded after a while if there is no subscriber response. In PubSub protocols,
    this is a fundamental parameter that describes message queue management quality.
    This option is included in recent versions of PubSub protocols with a static message
    expiry. Calculating optimal and dynamic message expiry is essential because setting
    it too high will result in queues keeping unnecessary messages while an excessively
    low setting can cause messages to be discarded before a subscriber can retrieve
    them. A dynamic message expiry time can be decided at run-time by using ML approaches
    [206]. RL approaches do not require prerecorded datasets for system training,
    allowing adaptability to message transmission situations and queue availability
    when determining optimal message expiry times. Bayesian and decision tree approaches
    can provide an accurate message expiry that depends on the queue availability
    and channel occupancy. 4.4. Resource management AMQP uses multiple message queues,
    and each queue handles certain messages as per predefined constraints, making
    it static in nature. Additionally, AMQP does not support priority queues, which
    may be alleviated by large message expiry times (though this can cause critical
    information to become stuck in a queue). Message queue classification can be made
    dynamic in AMQP by using ML algorithms. In addition to having a priority queue,
    dynamic message queue management is an essential issue in AMQP. While adding additional
    features into AMQP with ML may increase the load a bit, rapid delivery can be
    achieved with higher quality and reliability. RabbitMQ suffers from redundant
    message broker communication, which can be avoided with dimensionality reduction
    mechanisms. This protocol can also enjoy enhanced packet loss estimation with
    ML techniques. Packet loss estimation can be predicted using the RL approaches
    on-the-fly, with no training [207]. Similarly, for PubSub models, deciding message
    size, the required number of message queues, and the number of clients able to
    access a queue simultaneously for a specific application can be very complex without
    ML. Depending on traffic conditions, ML can determine a dynamic message size or
    the simultaneous access count for the message queues or brokers. Increasing or
    decreasing the number of message queues dynamically on a network is not logically
    possible. However, in heterogeneous networks, ML can resize queues according to
    various application traffic conditions. ML algorithms will efficiently perform
    these operations. Bayesian in particular can accurately adjust message queue sizes
    on-the-fly through training. 5. Conclusions In this survey, we have presented
    recent advances in application layer protocols for the IoT, followed by its significance
    in real-time use cases and ML-related research directions. Recently, several application
    layer protocols have been published as modified versions of conventional protocols
    that have not been covered by existing surveys. In this article, we have studied
    the enhancements and improvements of conventional application layer protocols.
    We have also identified and summarized the benefits and limitations of these protocols.
    In addition, we have discussed various message queues and message brokers. The
    significance of request-response and PubSub protocols in use cases (such as IIoT,
    smart cities and homes, healthcare, mobility management, video surveillance, and
    the WoT) have been discussed. We have also highlighted benefits achieved by the
    use cases through the application layer protocols. However, traditional and improved
    application layer protocols have not yet satisfied IoT needs due to variations
    in the dynamic condition of the applications. ML can make these protocols intelligent
    and work dynamically according to application conditions and without human intervention.
    This article also extended the usage of ML for future research to solve issues
    such as congestion, energy awareness, delay sensitivity, message expiration, and
    resource management. Declaration of competing interest There are no potential

    learning (ML) 1. Introduction In India one of the main economic activity is the
    agriculture. Around 60–70% of employment in India is dependent on agricultural
    sector. It has the maximum arable land that is second largest after U.S. This
    is because of the high soil fertility and large network of water sources for irrigation.
    Due the varying nature of climatic conditions at different locations it ensures
    the high availability and productivity of flora. Although the well presence of
    resources it does not produce the results equivalent to the availability.It is
    because of scarcity and incompetent use of technology, deficiency of knowledge
    and awareness among the agrarians, use of some antiquate methods (Bhargava et
    al., 2014). In addition most of the crops are affected by pests, insects, diseases
    resulting in decreased yields. Many crops are affected by the attack of insects
    or pests. Insecticides or pesticides are not always proved effective because they
    may be toxic to some kind of birds and animals. It also damages the natural animal
    food web and also food chains (Shinde and Kulkarni, 2017). Crop disease results
    in considerably low throughput. The authors in Oerke (2006) outlines the yield
    depletion between 20% and 40 % of worldwide agricultural production caused by
    insects, pests, viruses, animals, and weeds. In addition, they have a number of
    facets, some with short-term, and others with long-term consequences for the global
    food security (Savary et al., 2012). Crop production losses due to pests and diseases
    are quite substantial, particularly in the Indian weather semi-arid conditions
    (Shinde and Kulkarni, 2017). Weather has an extremely extensive role in agricultural
    production. Generally crops are more common in the weather based frangible agriculture
    systems. Survey have challenged that with the rise in population up to 10 billion,
    then definitely by 2050 we are moving towards food doomsday. It implies food production
    ability will bankrupt unless we establish and advance the smart technologies in
    agriculture. So for proper management of limited resources it is necessary to
    develop an economical technology for Indian farmers. The system should help the
    farmers to prevent the diseases of crops on time and improve the quantity and
    quality food.The system should be reliable enough to sustain in hilly areas like
    Jammu and Kashmir for timely prevention and cure (Bhargava et al., 2014). It is
    because of their capability to monitor environmental parameters, soil parameters,
    plant parameters by spatially deploying sensors remotely. On time prediction of
    diseases caused by the various harmful entities whether by the lack or exceed
    in the normal values of the monitored parameters can aid the agriculturalists.
    So that they can take special measures against the attack of these pests and insects
    in a controlled manner. This will prevent any usage of chemicals and reduce the
    diseases occurring in fauna. In addition, it would definitely boost the Aggie
    productivity and hence will bridge the gap tween increasing population and increasing
    demand of food. Evidently, overall loss percentage of crops would be reduced.
    In the last decade science and technology has revolutionized the globe. Current
    era is the technological era. To provide applicable information to the agriculturalists,
    presently, remote monitoring techniques are being used.Wireless Sensor Networks
    and Internet of Things plays an essential role in this connection. The miniaturization
    of the technology resulted in Internet of Things (IoT) utopia (Buyya and Dastjerdi,
    2016). The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) was first time used by Kevin Ashton,
    while the presentation on Management of supply Chain in 1999 (Ashton et al., 2009).
    IoT is an interconnected network of computational objects like sensors which are
    uniquely identifiable smart objects. The term “Things” represents a general array
    of objects, sensors, people, smart devices and any other entity having the ability
    to connect and share information with other entities, that is aware of its context
    and is making anything available at anytime, anywhere. It means everything is
    accessible without any place or time restrictions. In the IoT, wireless technologies
    play a central role in data gathering and data communication (Abdmeziem et al.,
    2016). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and radio- frequency identification (RFID)
    are considered as the two main building blocks of sensing and communication technologies
    for IoT (Marjani et al., 2017, Fortino et al., 2020). Wireless sensor networks
    have been used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports,
    medicine, and industry (Jawad et al., 2017). Due to which voluminous amount of
    data is being generated (Marjani et al., 2017). Wireless sensor networks sensors,
    smart devices, RFID tags, tablets, palmtops, laptops, smart meters, smart phones,
    smart healthcare, social media, software applications and digital services generate
    the volume of data. They continuously generate large amounts of structured, semi-structured
    and unstructured data which is strongly increased. The growth of data in various
    domains of applications like network operation, healthcare management, social
    media,intelligent traffic system, business, marketing, resource optimization,
    precision agriculture and social behavior etc. to study all this, data analytics
    committed for diverse wireless sensor networks to take benefits. Data analysis
    is a process of data collection, data transformation, data cleaning and modelling
    data with the goal of discovering the required knowledge (Dai et al., 2019). The
    results and findings so obtain are communicated by suggesting conclusions and
    supporting decision making. Data analytics is the process of examining large data
    sets that contain a variety of data types (Mital et al., 2015) to reveal unseen
    patterns, hidden correlations, market trends, customer preferences, and other
    useful business information (Saura et al., 2019). Agronomy consideration is the
    most well-intentioned ability for WSN, data analytics and machine learning to
    rise the crop yields and to decrease the herculean task of farmers (Kim et al.,
    2014). Precision Agriculture (PA) or site specific farming is the technological
    approach that uses modern data technology and knowledge to develop the high quality
    agricultural production. WSN are economical procedures to improve crop yield (Jawhar
    et al., 2014). Precision agriculture is in its advanced phase, and some farmers
    have started to implement PA in their terrains, and have obtained best results,
    managing to return the investment essential for its implementation. Hence, the
    activities related to PA include: identification and localization of crops, insects
    and weeds, performance monitoring, machinery, variable dozing of fertilizers,
    herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, planting monitoring and mapping (Buyya
    and Dastjerdi, 2016). In Ayaz et al. (2019) precision agriculture has been discussed
    broadly. They gave the detailed overview of how IoT is playing a role in precision
    agriculture by making the fields talk. With the help of IoT they gave the idea
    how to increase the agricultural yield to meet the needs of the bulky population
    by using the limited available arable land for cultivation, fresh water for irrigation
    etc. by giving the precise and required quantities of fertilizers, insecticides,
    water, etc. In Xia et al. (2011) environment monitoring system has been designed
    and deployed for precision agriculture using WSN. The system was tested in a red
    bayberry greenhouse situated on a hillside by collecting the following parameters;
    temperature, voltage, humidity etc. The system proved to be scalable, stable,
    and accurate and can provide real time data for precision agriculture. Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning techniques are playing an important role in the agrarian
    sector in order to handle the increasing challenges due to the weather and climatic
    changes like temperature, rain, humidity etc which are causing serious damage
    in crop production. It is necessary to increase the accuracy of data analysis
    for vigorous and proliferating production. The capability to analyze large amounts
    of data can help an organization deal with considerable information that can affect
    the business (Russom et al., 2011). The procedures and algorithms used in such
    analytical tools must discover hidden patterns and correlations in the data (Oswal
    and Koul, 2013). The field data collected by the deployed sensors is in the form
    of multimedia which helps in disease detection in stems, leaves fruits and roots,
    quality, health of fruits (Suksawat and Komkum, 2015), and presence or detection
    of weeds and smart irrigation (Tripicchio et al., 2015, Jhuria et al., 2013, Kapoor
    et al., 2016, Roopaei et al., 2017, Cambra et al., 2017). In order to produce
    higher quantity and increase the quality of food and reduce the crop failure,
    integration of IoT sensing devices and drones seem to be helpful, the same devices
    monitor the things in regular intervals for best results (Tripicchio et al., 2015,
    Kapoor et al., 2016, Cambra et al., 2017). In Fig. 1.1 we have shown the various
    steps of how IoT and data analytics are related to each other. By using IoT data
    analytics with the machine learning we can make the precision agriculture practical.
    Initially in the first step which comprises managing IoT data sources, where connected
    sensors devices use applications to interact with one another. For example, the
    interaction of devices such as CCTV cameras, drones, environmental sensors, soil
    sensors, plant sensors etc produces huge amounts of data in diverse formats. This
    generated data can be hoarded on the cloud using commodity hardware devices. In
    the second go, data is complex due to its volume, velocity, and variety. Depends
    upon the precision agriculture application specification and the type of data
    we are interested in collection of, mainly precision agriculture datasets having
    data related to crop patterns, crop rotations, weather parameters, environmental
    conditions, soil types, soil nutrients, Geographic Information System (GIS) data,
    Global Positioning System (GPS) data, farmer records, agriculture machinery data,
    such as yield monitoring and Variable Rate Fertilizers (VRT) (Bendre et al., 2015).
    These enormous amounts of data are stored in big files of data in shared and distributed
    fault- tolerant databases. The last step applies analytics tools such as Map Reduce,
    Spark and Skytree that can analyze the stored IoT data sets and find the value
    out of it. This implies integrating IoT data analytics and machine learning techniques,
    there is the need to develop forecasting models for crop management including
    disease and yield prediction. The main aim of the paper is as follows; i) To provide
    a thorough review on the use of IoT(sensors) and data analytics for precision
    agriculture; ii) To present a case study on adoption of IoT and data analytics
    on apple orchards; iii) To understand the challenges faced by traditional farmers
    in adopting technologies to complement traditional farming. Download : Download

    5 concludes a paper by highlighting important findings briefly and gives some
    future directions. 2. Literature survey A lot of activity has already been accomplished
    in the area of precision agriculture using different technologies like IoT, machine
    learning for making decision support system, data analytics, etc. We have divided
    the literature survey under three subsections: 1) IoT/ Sensors and networks, 2)
    Data Analytics and 3) Applications of IoT and data analytics as smart system in
    Agriculture. The work on precision in different fields in the literature are comprehensively
    mentioned in these subsections below: 2.1. IoT-sensors and networks Wireless sensor
    networks are used in diverse agronomic applications, for example remotely observing
    environmental and soil conditions in order to predict the healthfulness of crops.
    Watering schedule of agricultural fields is forecasted by employing WSN as observant
    of environmental conditions like pressure, humidity, temperature, soil moisture,
    soil salinity and soil conductivity. A lot of work has been done in the literature,
    main contributions by various researchers are discussed. In Ahmed et al. (2018)
    authors proposed the scalable network architecture to monitor and control agriculture
    fields in rural areas. They proposed a control system based on IoT for development
    of farming and agriculture. All the system components and improvements are examined
    and analyzed in all aspects.The solution of routing and MAC in IoT achieved energy
    efficiency, less delay and high throughput.To achieve this performance the system
    combines Wi-Fi based long distance (WiLD) network and fog computing solution.
    In Bhargava et al. (2014) authors have proposed WSN framework design, intentionally
    to setup a DSS for the detection of Apple Scab in Himachal Pradesh using Mills
    tables. In Muangprathub et al. (2019) IoT was applied in agriculture to improve
    crop yields, improve crop quality and reduce costs. Based on wireless sensor networks
    they proposed and developed a system which can optimally water agricultural crops
    like lemon, home grown vegetables. To control the effect of environmental factors
    in the crop fields, the system proposed consist three main parts Hardware (Control
    box), Web application and Mobile application. Control box was actually a WSN and
    electronic control system which was helping in data collection. Using web application
    the data collected from the control box is large scale data that was analyzed
    using data mining association rules. The mobile application was used to notify
    the farmer about water content of the soil and accordingly automatic or manual
    watering was done. Data mining showed for high productivity of home grown vegetables
    and lemon temperature should be 29–30oC and humidity 72–81%. In Fonthal et al.
    (2018) the authors have designed a system for precision agriculture which is economical
    known as Smartnode. For the optimal crop development they used the platform of
    hardware and software that allows monitoring of agro climatic parameters. They
    deployed the system into crop field to increase its yield. The main aim of Trilles
    Oliver et al. (2019) was to apply a model to alert farmers when would be the suitable
    moment to treat the downy mildew disease in a vineyard context. Following the
    IoT paradigm they proposed the system named SEnviro (Sense our Environment platform)
    to monitor vineyard fields. They used the edge computing paradigm to mitigate
    the communication between ends. In Shinde and Kulkarni (2017) authors showed that
    the existing systems are not reliable and cheap. They gave the information of
    using IoT and machine learning in the precision agriculture to predict the diseases
    of crop. They proposed a system model using machine learning and IoT. They took
    the environmental sensors like temperature, humidity etc and collect the data.
    After the final output was generated the same was sent to the local farmers as
    an SMS. In Jawad et al. (2017) the authors presented a review of WSN based agricultural
    applications. Authors compared various wireless technologies and protocol suites
    like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS/3G/4G, ZigBee, LoRa and Sig Fox. They showed LoRa
    and ZigBee wireless technologies are highly efficient to use for Precision Agriculture
    because of suitable communication range and low power consumption. Categorization
    of various techniques and algorithms related to energy efficiency of wireless
    sensor networks are mentioned. They have also mentioned the techniques that can
    be used in PA. Challenges and limitations of WSN in PA are also mentioned. In
    Sikeridis et al. (2018) authors have combined the machine learning approaches
    with the internet of things and showed their applicability in next generation
    networks.They improved the energy efficiency in NOMA(non-orthogonal multiple access)
    public safety networks by using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and WPC (wireless
    powered communication) collectively which results in Public Safety IoT (PS-IoT)
    ecosystem. In Hsu et al. (2018)the authors study proposes a creative service process
    based on the cloud computing platform of the Internet of Things and it can be
    used to improve the integration of the current cloud-to-physical networking and
    to improve the computing speed of the Internet of Things. This research uses innovative
    platform technology to be applied to the cloud agriculture platform. Through cloud
    integration, it can be applied to large area data collection and analysis, allowing
    farmland with limited network information resources to be integrated and automated,
    including agricultural monitoring automation, pest management image analysis.In
    Lavanya et al. (2020) authors presented system based on IoT by designing Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium
    (NPK) sensor which is a novel approach with Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and
    Light Emitting Diodes (LED). To monitor and analyze the nutrients present in the
    soil the principle of colorimetric is used. Google cloud database is used to store
    the data collected from fields for fast retrieval of data. Fuzzy logic concept
    has been applied in order to know the lack of nutrients from sensed data. The
    sensed data is distinguished into five fuzzy values which are very high, high,
    medium, low and very low while fuzzification. The intended hardware and the software
    incorporated in the micro-controller are developed in Raspberrypi3 using Python.
    Three different samples of soil like red, desert, and mountain soil have been
    tested by the proposed model. With respect to the concentration of the solution
    soil the developed system resulted in linear variation. In order to analyse the
    performance of developed NPK sensor in the form of end to end delay, throughput
    and jitter a sensor network scenario is deployed using Qualnet simulator.The developed
    IoT system was found to be most needful to the agrarians for high yielding of
    crop production when compared with the existing solutions. In this article researchers
    have identified the most important applications using IoT and an elaborated survey
    has been done particularly in precision agriculture (Khanna and Kaur, 2019). Challenges
    faced while using IoT in smart agriculture. In Sethi and Sarangi (2017) the authors
    surveyed protocols, methodologies and applications in developing area that is
    IoT. The article mentions new taxonomy for Internet of things technologies.It
    climaxes the most essential technologies that have the capability to make an extraordinary
    variation in human beings lives, specially for the handicapped and the elderly.
    In comparison to the same survey articles, this paper has covered major technologies
    from sensing devices to applications exhaustively and comprehensively. In Abdmeziem
    et al. (2016) authors have proposed a survey regarding the prime architectures
    in the history. Furthermore, the elementary unit technologies which are well-accepted
    to suit IoT application requirements. They also introduce a classification presenting
    the appropriateness of proposed architectures in IoT characteristics. In addition,
    they have highlighted the advantages of present solutions and proposed future
    directions on the basis of state of the art. In a future research they are planning
    to design an approach which will be able to mitigate the drawbacks of the IoT
    at each individual layer of the internet. In Ojha et al. (2015) authors examined
    the promising Wireless sensor network applications, challenges and limitations
    associated while distributing WSN to improve crop yield. Smart devices, sensing
    devices and communication technologies lined with WSN in agronomy applications
    are emphasized completely. They mentioned different case studies to explore the
    present solutions proposed in the literature. They have mentioned in the literature
    survey that how precision agriculture has been implemented globally including
    India. They have depicted the drawbacks of these existing solutions by presented
    the future directions using advanced technologies. In Zhao et al. (2010) authors
    have investigated application of IoT in precision agriculture. They used wireless
    communication technology to achieve site specific monitoring of greenhouse. They
    proposed Remote greenhouse monitoring system using wireless communications. An
    information management system has been designed while system management has been
    taken into account. The field data has been utilized for research. By using this
    remote monitoring system, the field data like temperature, humidity from the greenhouse
    has been sensed precisely and after the proper research, system resulted in good
    growth condition of vegetables. The proposed system has resulted in increased
    performance and reliability. The interface of the system was user friendly for
    ordinary farmers. In Balaji et al. (2018) authors have proposed a method for efficient
    crop monitoring for agricultural field. With the application of IoT the data can
    be stored and retrieved from anywhere. Various sensors are used to monitor and
    collect information about the field conditions. Collectively the farm condition
    is sent to the farmer through GSM technology. In the proposed work, the sensor
    part is limited only for monitoring of crops. In Jayaraman et al. (2016) authors
    research have focused on data collection from agricultural fields through various
    technologies. Using WSN, IoT, Weather stations, smart-phones, drones and cameras
    are found to be useful during their study. In addition, authors advanced the platform
    based on IoT called SmartFarmNet. This was able to process the collection of data
    from the field related to various parameters like soil, moisture, irrigation,
    soil fertility, humidity, temperature etc. The proposed system was able to correlate
    the analyzed data and was able to forecast crop status. In Paustian and Theuvsen
    (2017) authors emphasize the hoe various technologies are important in precision
    agriculture. How the farmers of Germany are able to accept the precision agriculture
    using smart devices like smart-phones. Regression analysis showed a positive effect
    of precision agriculture on farmers. The authors have given some research directions
    using IoT in agriculture. 2.2. Data analytics Before the advent of information
    technology, various traditional methods like manual detection of crop diseases
    and pests, calculations based on statistics to estimate the quantity and predict
    the production and loss of crops were generally cumbersome, this results in human
    error due to the lack of experience of inspectors (Rumpf et al., 2010). Machine
    learning is the ability of technology to learn through experiences. Data analytics
    and machine learning allows us to draw the most important conclusions from the
    large data collected from the crop fields. It reveals the hidden patterns, hidden
    relationships between the parameters affecting the horticulture like temperature,
    soil salinity, humidity etc. The mostly used and related machine learning techniques
    in forecasting crop diseases and pests in which weather data are analysed are
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN), SVM Regression and Logistic Regression, recognition
    technology using neural network, Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Singh and Gupta,
    2016), fuzzy technology for recognition etc. In Singh and Gupta (2018) authors
    proposed a system for classification of apple diseases using the machine learning
    classification algorithms. The two diseases which they classify are apple scab
    and marsonina coronaria by using the images of leaves of the apple trees as input.
    Classification algorithms Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbour, Decision
    Tree and Naïve Bayes were used on the same data. Matlab 2016 was used for the
    simulation proposed system. They showed it is the K nearset neighbour which classified
    the diseases with the 99.4% accuracy. The system was developed in the state of
    Himachal Pradesh, Uttarkhand. In Shinde and Kulkarni (2017) authors showed that
    the existing systems are not reliable and cheap. They gave the information of
    using IoT and machine learning in the precision agriculture to predict the diseases
    of crop. They proposed a system model using machine learning and IoT. They took
    the environmental sensors like temperature, humidity etc and collect the data.
    After the final output was generated the same was sent to the local farmers as
    an SMS. In Huang et al. (2018) authors have used machine learning approaches to
    create the intelligent communications. In order to improve the QoS (quality of
    service) of limited wireless assets, intelligent machine learning approaches have
    been used. In Geetha (2015) the authors used IoT technology and ML techniques
    for the prediction of late blight disease in potatoes. The environmental parameters
    like Temperature and humidity were captured by the use of sensor devices deployed
    in the farm fields which transmit the information to the central gateway. The
    data collected helps to detect the level and risk of blight. In Geetha (2015)
    authors have focused on a moderate susceptible cultivation of potato crop using
    a back- propagation network with an accuracy of 94%. In Aggelopoulou et al. (2011)
    authors have used image processing and data analysis algorithms for precision
    agriculture for predicting the site-specific yield. They proved that there is
    a high correlation between flower density and the fruit yield by predicting the
    yield of the apple orchard with an accuracy of more than 80%. In Mazilu and Trandafir
    (2002) authors have established five onsite weather stations in orchards that
    collect data. The collected data can be used in models to predict the apple scab
    infection periods. Such models can help farmers to determine the need (or lack)
    of fungicide sprays to control apple scab. They posted the information on  http://www.pomosat.ro
    for neighboring apple growers in Romania to access for and use in decision making.
    In Cetişli and Büyükçingir (2013) a new prediction model for warning of apple
    scab is proposed. The model proposed is based on Artificial Intelligence and time
    series prediction. Infection period of apple scab was evaluated as the time series
    prediction model instead of summation of wetness duration. Important hours were
    determined with feature selection methods Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, Fisher’s
    Linear Discriminant Analysis, Adaptive Neuro fuzzy Classifier with Linguistic
    hedges. Prediction was done by adaptive neural network model. To determine the
    apple scab infection 24 h are needed to capture the measurements. Five meteorological
    measurements relative humidity, leaf wetness, temperature, day light and rainfall.
    After every 12 min data was collected so time was one more parameter for time
    series prediction. They marked correlation between apple scab and meteorological
    measurements. They detect appropriate time for infection. Besides this, classification
    and prediction of apple disease was done. In Foughali et al. (2018) the authors
    present a novel decision support system (DSS) for the prevention of late blight
    using the integration of WSN, cloud and IoT. The model proved to be beneficial
    for preventing potato late blight disease. DSS was capable to estimate the precise
    quantity of fungicide to apply. Besides this IoT sensors related to weather were
    deployed to collect real time data and was then sent to cloud IoT framework for
    processing. The forecast model used the weather related data from weather stations
    and historical data for the prediction of late blight. The system was quite efficient
    and cost effective for the farmers. In Balducci et al. (2018) authors intended
    to organize heterogeneous data approaching from diverse sources in the form of
    datasets as a result of sensory systems. They also showed how useful companies
    whether large scale or a small scale, a public or a private are trying to improve
    profitability. Finding proper ways to use data that are recorded continuously
    are the best possibility to achieve goals. It suggested how Regression analysis,
    Neural networks and Machine Learning are useful decision-making. In Hamad et al.
    (2018) authors have emphasized the importance of smart mobile phones for obtaining
    agronomy facts information of different parameters like soil moisture, humidity,
    temperature etc. In the same article they have highlighted benefits of smart-phones
    in the agricultural field. The authors conducted the survey of around 230 farmers
    through questionnaires and interviews to know what they want. After completing
    the process they come to the conclusion that farmers are interested to make use
    of smart-phones to acquire information about current farm data. Table 2.1 summarizes
    the key points of the literature survey, how the authors in the existing technologies
    have contributed in the precision agriculture and what they achieved. Table 2.1.
    Literature Survey. Reference Contribution Results (Jayaraman et al., 2016) SmartFarmNet
    application Proposed framework was capable of: • Making predictions related to
    crop performance • Computation of crop forecasts  (Ahmed et al., 2018) They proposed
    a scalable network architecture for minitoring and controlling agriculture and
    farms in rural areas Improved performance in terms of: • Latency • Bandwidth  (Muangprathub
    et al., 2019) Based on wireless sensor networks they proposed and developed a
    system which can optimally water agricultural crops like lemon, home grown vegetables.
    Data mining showed for high productivity of home grown vegetables and lemon: •
    Temperature should be 29–30 °C • Humidity 72–81 %.  (Fonthal et al., 2018) The
    authors have designed a system of precision agriculture at a low cost called Smartnode.
    They deployed system: • Increased the yield in tomato crop field.  (Mazilu and
    Trandafir, 2002) They proposed an Orchard System for Monitoring and Modelling
    Apple Scab (Venturia Inaequalis for that they established five onsite weather
    stations in orchards that collect data.) The proposed scheme: • Performed well
    in the locality of Romania in terms of quality and quantity  (Hamad et al., 2018)
    Understanding the perception of farmers regarding the usage of smartphones in
    performing agricultural activities Results obtained after applying Chi-square
    test: • Lack of trust • High cost.  (Trilles Oliver et al., 2019) They proposed
    the system named SEnviro (Sense our Environment platform) to monitor vineyard
    fields. They used: • The edge computing paradigm to mitigate the communication
    between ends.  (Jawad et al., 2017) Authors compared different wireless technologies
    and protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G, LoRa, Sig Fox They
    showed: • ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are more convenient for Precision
    Agriculture.  (Lavanya et al., 2020) They present an IoT based system by designing
    a novel Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK) sensor with Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED). Proposed model proved to be helpful: •
    For high yielding of crops.  (Shinde and Kulkarni, 2017) The information about
    machine learning and IoT implementation used for crop diseases is given. The review
    given concludes that: • Existing system are not reliable and cheap 2.3. Applications
    of IoT and data analytics as smart system in agriculture IoT/sensor nodes are
    playing a key role in precision agriculture to collect the real time data (Sri
    et al., 2019). These nodes have the capability to make the system more practical
    by collecting the real time data from the crop fields to make the agriculture
    system precise. By incorporating data analytics and machine learning the agriculture
    system becomes more workable. All these technologies have tremendous applications
    in other fields. In precision agriculture various applications for farmers are
    developed to inform them about the status of crops on time. The architecture for
    precision agriculture is usually composed of three main phases as shown in Fig.
    2.1. The first phase it consists of the number of sensors/ IoT nodes to monitor
    physical or environmental conditions, soil conditions, plant conditions, e.g the
    soil moisture sensor records soil wetting reading, or soil nutrient sensor will
    check the fertility of the soil. In the second phase we need to collect this precise
    data, we can either store the data locally to the nearest fog node or we can send
    it on the cloud for higher computation and remote monitoring it depends upon the
    need. In third phase of the architecture the analytics methods are applied to
    know the status of the crop fields. This information is then communicated to the
    end users(farmers) that helps them to identify that if the reading is below or
    above threshold. Accordingly they initiate communication to the actuator that
    would switch on(or off) the watering system to pour water to the soil or farmer(end
    user) may need to spray some fertilisers potassium, nitrogen and phosphorous to
    balance the fertility of soil. Using analytics and actuators a response mechanism
    is activated upon recognition (sensing/predicting) of any critical scenario. There
    are number of applications of IoT and WSN in the precision agriculture, some of
    them are mentioned here. Fig. 2.2 shows the applications related to precision
    agriculture. Download : Download high-res image (184KB) Download : Download full-size

    precision agriculture. 2.3.1. Soil selection and planning Soil is the basic building
    block of every agrarian practice. Without soil, the word crop does not exist.
    Soil is considered to be the stomach of flora (Manna et al., 2014). So to analyze
    the condition of soil is the first and foremost step towards the best agrarian
    practice. By doing the soil testing we can analyze the physical, biological, chemical
    statuses of the soil. Based on this the farmers can take decisions accordingly
    regarding their fields. The main motive of precision farming is to produce more
    from the scarce cultivable land. So to implement the new era technologies is very
    important across the globe as we have to satisfy the increased population with
    the limited resources. Usually soil tests based on weather and soil conditions
    are done in Fall (Dinkins and Jones, 2019). By doing the soil tests we can analyze
    the soil nutrients which include the information related to the fertilizers requirement,
    copping history, soil kind, irrigation level, etc. Presently we have various sensor
    based technologies which are very helpful in soil selection and planning. These
    technologies help us to decide the best crop for the best fit soil. A soil testing
    toolkit, Lab-in-a-Box, developed by Agrocares is considered to be the complete
    laboratory test toolkit (Dinkins and Jones, 2019). It can be used by any farmer
    to test the soil of their fields without going without going any agriculture laboratory.
    According to this toolkit it is said that around 100 samples per day can be tested
    by any farmer without having any lab experience. It means around 36000 samples
    per year can be tested without visiting any lab. Using the vision based technologies
    with the sensors agriculturists can make a determination of depth and distance
    for implant a seeds and plants proficiently (Manna et al., 2014). In Santhi et
    al. (2017), using the GPS (Global positioning system), sensors and autonomous
    robot based on vision called Agribot was advanced for seed sowing. So in short
    we can say that present technology is very helpful for every farmer to help them
    to select the best fit land for the suitable crop. 2.3.2. Irrigation of crop fields
    Irrigating the crop fields on requirement bases is one of the best ways to generate
    more and more crops and manage the available fresh water bodies. Humanity relies
    only on the 0.5% available fresh water. Approximately 97% of the available water
    on the planet earth is salt water and the remaining 3% is fresh water. About 67%
    of the fresh water is either in polar ice caps or glaciers that is frozen (Ice,
    2020, What percent of earth is water?, 2020). It means only remaining percentage
    of fresh water is unfrozen which lies underground and only 0.5% is available for
    the flora and fauna to survive (Water facts-worldwide water supply, 2020). It
    has been mentioned in (Water for sustainable food and agriculture by fao, 2020,
    Motoshita et al., 2018) that it is agricultural area which consumes around 70%
    of the 0.5% available fresh water, even around 85% is utilized for the same in
    underdeveloped countries. So it is the responsibility of the humanity to manage
    the water resources. For that very purpose many researchers are working. So the
    traditional methods of irrigation can be managed by adopting the emergent technologies
    like IoT and WSN. We can deploy the WSN based system related to the soil moisture
    which will notify us whenever we need to irrigate the system. In (Zhang et al.,
    2018, Irrigation & water use, 2020) based on IoT, crop Water stress index (CWSI)
    has been developed, which can be used to increase the efficiency of crop. In CWSI
    system we are deploying the required sensors in the needed field and collect the
    data, sending that data to the central processor. A the central node we are also
    collecting the data from weather stations and including the satellite images,
    based on all thus we decide whether we should irrigate the field or not. In nutshell
    we can say by adopting the emerging technologies we can maintain the required
    moisture for the crop and in turn will save the fresh water resources. 2.3.3.
    Fertilizers Fertilizers provide the nutrients to the soil which in turn are transferred
    to the plants through roots. Fertilizers like potassium (K), Phosphorus (P), Nitrogen
    (N) etc. all have their own uses to maintain the health of flora. Plants need
    mainly NPK macro nutrients to maintain the health. P is used to maintain the health
    of roots, flowers and helps in fruit development, K is used to for stem growth
    and for proper functioning of xylem so that water can be transferred to every
    part of the plant, and N helps the leaves in growth. So we need to prevent any
    sort of deficiency of NPK fertilizers in plants or improper use may also lead
    bad results. Excessive use of fertilizers imbalance the ecosystem. Precision agriculture
    helps in proper use of NPK fertilizers by using WSN, machine learning and IoT
    technologies, hence helps us in avoiding the negative results over the ecosystem.
    Using the aerial/ satellite images to monitor the crop nutrients, in (Benincasa
    et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2018) authors have used NDVI (Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index), from vegetation it is working on reflection of visible and
    near infrared light. It helps the farmers in the estimation of vegetation vigor,
    crop health, and density. It also helps in assessing the soil nutrient level.
    Hence it helps the efficient use of fertilizers. NDVI contributing the precision
    agriculture uses the emerging technologies like VRT (Variable Rate Technology)
    (Colaço and Molin, 2017, Basso et al., 2016), autonomous vehicles (Khan et al.,
    2018), geo mapping (Suradhaniwar et al., 2018) and Global positioning system (GPS)
    accuracy (Shi et al., 2017). In short we can say that if the proper use of fertilizers
    cannot be done then there we are creating difficulties for our incoming generations.
    So it is better to develop our globe by adopting the new era technologies. 2.3.4.
    Crop disease Presently our entire globe is suffering from various crop diseases
    such as leaf spot, apple scab, potato scab, anthracnose, late blight, early blight,
    powdery mildew etc. These diseases cause financial losses up to billions. Besides
    financial and economic losses crop disease affect the health of fauna. According
    to the FAO (Food Agriculture Organization), it has been estimated that 20–40%
    crops are lost due to the crop diseases and pest use (Keeping plant pests and
    diseases at bay, 2020). It is the time to work on it, because if we will leave
    this all untreated we will lose much more that this in near future. IoT plays
    an important role in monitoring the condition of crop by using the wireless sensors,
    drones, other IoT based intelligent devices which capture the condition of the
    crop and analyses it in the high end processors and take the decisions accordingly
    based on decision support systems using machine learning. A lot of work has been
    applied to overcome all this by using various new era techniques. In Oberti et
    al. (2016) various approaches like automatic chemigation and vehicle spray, those
    are mainly used under precision agriculture to treat diseases of crop. 2.3.5.
    Pest management By using various pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, in order
    to remove the enemies of the crop, we try to maximize the yield. Most of the farmers
    are ordinary people who are unaware about the current trends and techniques. They
    are completely unaware about the precision farming technologies. Over and under
    usage of pesticides, insecticides, etc. imbalance the nature. Excessive use of
    pesticides leads bad effect over the environment. By using these germicides we
    are creating more chances of chronic and fatal diseases like cancer, asthma, etc.
    In Kim et al., 2018, Venkatesan et al., 2018 with the help of IoT we can stop
    the improper use of these pesticides. Modern IoT based pest management based on
    real time environment monitoring, provides disease prediction, modeling, etc.
    hence results more effective. 2.3.6. Yield monitoring Last but not the least application
    of internet of things is to monitor the farm lands. In order to maximize the yield
    both qualitatively and quantitatively good farmers should never hesitate in adopting
    the modern technologies because all farmers are interested in producing the best
    quantity from their fields, they always prefer to increase the quantity and quality
    of the crop. Yield monitoring monitors the whole crop area from beginning till
    end means from cultivation to harvesting. In harvesting we need to check how to
    store food? How to transport it? How to deal with the diseases which are caused
    while storing it? All these problems are solved using the wireless sensors and
    other related technologies. In Wietzke et al., 2018, Chung et al., 2016, Gholami
    et al., 2014 it has been mentioned that quality of the crop and the yield of the
    crop depends upon self-pollination and other environmental conditions. During
    dry conditions to monitor the foods like papayas, multiple optical sensors are
    used (Udomkun et al., 2016). 3. Adoption of IoT (Sensors) and Data Analytics in
    tradtional Kashmir farms for the prediction of apple scab Apple is one amongst
    the most grown fruits in the world. It grows mostly in dry areas. In Jammu and
    Kashmir where people from most of the districts are dependent on farming and agriculture,
    it produces the large quantity and diverse apples in India. Its industry is worth
    of thousands of crores in J & K. As shown in Table 3.1 the district wise production
    of Apple crop in Kashmir division. Table 3.1. District wise production of apples
    in Kashmir. District Production (In metric tonnes) Baramulla 469.3 Anantnag 161.182
    Pulwama 121.9 Kulgam 45.53 Srinagar 36.1 But due to the various diseases, wide
    range of pests and lack of technology in the fields we lose both quantity and
    quality of the crop. Apple scab is the most troublesome disease for apple growers
    in all parts of Kashmir. Scab is caused by a fungus that infects both leaves and
    fruit. Scabby fruit are often unfit for eating and continued infection of leaves
    weakens the tree. Small black spots develop on fruit, enlarging more slowly than
    on leaves. As these spots grow and become older, the center loses the velvety
    appearance and becomes brown and scabby. Heavily infected fruit becomes deformed
    and cracked when infected at an immature stage. Apple scab infections occur during
    wetting periods when moisture stimulates the pathogen spores to germinate and
    penetrate plant tissue. For this we did literature survey related to the crop
    and the factors affecting its growth. We did a local survey to find data regarding
    the factors on which we were going to work on. So, for this purpose we went to
    SKUAST (Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture Sciences and Technology, Srinagar,
    Kashmir) and visited departments of Soil and Pathology to gather the relevant
    data. Therein, certain information regarding the Apple Scab disease was collected.
    At SKAUST we came to know about the factors affecting the growth of Apple crop.
    We analyzed the collected data to verify the factors which actually affect the
    production and occurrence of diseases. Studying the R-Squared values, we see factors
    like pH, P(Phosphorous) and K(Potassium) play a very important role in the overall
    production of crop as shown in Table 3.2 OC(Organic content) is a slightly less
    important factor while nitrogen plays the least important role. Based on these
    values, we designed some prediction models as shown in Fig. 3.1. Factors like
    pH, K, P and OC together are crucial for a quality crop as is evident from its
    R-Squared value 0.788. The scab prediction table given here can be used to determine
    whether or not conditions have been sufficient for infection so that appropriate
    spray decisions can be made. Based on a certain combination of temperature and
    hours of leaf wetness, we can identify whether that region is safe (no chance
    of apple scab occurring) or unsafe (higher probability of the disease occurring
    with less incubation days) (MacHardy et al., 1989, Belete and Boyraz, 2017). From
    the data following two graphs have been drawn see Fig. 3.2. Safe zone where there
    is 0% chances of apple scab while Fig. 3.3 shows the unsafe zone where there is
    no chance to stop apple scab. Table 3.2. Relationship between production and factors.

    predict the apple scab that is the most common disease of apple crop. In this
    problem we used the real time data of wireless sensor/IoT nodes as input for linear
    regression model. In this an application is developed for farmers which is simple
    and user friendly to inform them about the status of their apple orchards on real
    time basis. The framework consists of a number of WSN/IoT nodes scattered in the
    orchards of the apple with nearby gateway for collection of the data from the
    mesh of the nodes While performing the research on the said problem various steps
    have come in the way that forms the basis of our study. These steps are shown
    in the Fig. 3.4. The nodes are deployed in the apple orchard for data collection.
    A network is established between the nodes, data acquisition is done by nearby
    gateway or a fog node from prefixed number of nodes in the network. The data analysis
    is done on the real time basis for each location/orchard for quick action if needed.
    In this work data is collected from many orchards of the Kashmir Valley using
    the same models as discussed above. The results are shown in Section 3.6. The
    detailed framework is explained below: Download : Download high-res image (66KB)

    the process. 3.2. Sensors assembled In precision agriculture IoT plays an important
    role. IoT are the embedded systems which have the capability to sense and share
    information related to any field in any application. IoT devices and its services
    play an important role in wireless world as they can provide users all required
    services at anywhere at any time. Diverse number of sensors related to agriculture
    like plant sensors, soil sensors, environmental sensors etc. collect the real
    time data respectively. This data is very helpful in predict the crop diseases.
    In our prediction model we required to monitor two parameters temperature and
    hours of wetness in a field.The sensors comprised of an IRIS mote and MTS420 sensor
    board. The IRIS is a 2.4 GHz module used for enabling low power, wireless sensor
    networks. MTS420 offer five basic environmental sensing parameters and an optional
    GPS (global positioning system). The five basic environmental sensors included
    in MTS420 are temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, ambient light sensor
    and dual-axis accelerometer. Among these we are interested in temperature and
    Leaf wetness hours only. For this DHT22 sensor is used which is embed on MTS420,
    gives us temperature and humidity. Leaf wetness hours are then calculated using
    humidity. 3.3. Sensor/IoT network setup This step involves setting up of the WSN
    for capturing the data. We created a WSN of several sensors and a gateway. Six
    sensors have been used to cover the particular area of an orchard. Each sensor
    comprises of a IRIS fitted with a MTS 420 sensor board. The gateway is incorporated
    in WSN that provides connectivity back to the wired world and distributed nodes
    using Zigbee module. The IRIS needs to be programmed to be able to act as a sensor
    with sensor board. Six such sensors were developed which are enough to cover the
    length of an average apple farm. For the gateway, MIB 520 fitted with an IRIS
    is used. Here the IRIS is programmed to act as the gateway in order to communicate
    with the computer. For programming of IRIS and MIB 520 MoteConfig Application
    is used. MoteConfig is a Windows-based GUI utility for programming Motes. This
    utility provides an interface for configuring and downloading pre-compiled XMesh/TinyOS
    firmware applications onto Motes. MoteConfig allows us to configure the Mote ID,
    Group ID, RF channel and RF power. We can also enable the over-the-air-programming
    feature present on all XMesh - based firmware. High-power and low-power XMesh
    applications are available for each sensor board and platform. The Local Program
    tab is used to upload firmware onto the Motes via a gateway. To program motes
    correctly, we set up the hardware as follows: • The gateway(in this case the MIB
    520) should be powered and connected to the PC via a serial, USB or Ethernet port.
    • The motes should be firmly attached to the gateway. • The motes should be turned
    off before the programming. Next Click on Settings followed by Interface Board,
    to select the correct gateway and port settings. Since we are using MIB 520 we’ll
    select that one. To program the IRIS as a gateway for all the other sensors we
    have to upload XMESH file over it. To program the IRIS as a MTS 420 sensor mote
    we select XMTS420-M2110-hp file for the sensor board as shown in Fig. 3.5, Fig.

    successful. After the sensors were successfully programmed, these sensors were
    carefully placed throughout in each field and the gateway was connected to the
    system. Topology used for WSN is mesh in the proposed work. Main advantage of
    using mesh topology is that it covers the maximum area of the orchard, it reduces
    loss of the data and there is not any single point failure problem. The WSN thus
    deployed is highly scalable and reliable. 3.4. Data acquisition Next step is to
    collect the data from various parts of the Kashmir Valley. Data collection is
    one of the basic and fundamental task while doing data analysis. To collect data,
    we selected three districts of Kashmir: Zakura Area of district Srinagar, Pinpora
    area of district Kulgam and Kanelwan area of district Anantnag, spread over a
    area of 4–5 kanals, 7–8 kanals, and 6–8 kanals respectively. The system was kept
    in place for over 12 h to collect a single days data. Care was taken to ensured
    that the motes weren’t damaged by water leading to wrong readings. To note any
    variation sensors were kept 100 meters apart, so that whole data from the field
    can be collected. MOTE-VIEW monitoring software was used as an interface between
    user and the deployed WSN. It provides the tools that simplifies the deployment
    and monitoring of WSN. It helps in data collection into the database. We used
    PostgreSQL database for it, this resides on our personal computer system (acts
    as a localhost), a remote server. 3.5. Analytics After the WSN was deployed, the
    sensors logged their data in a Postgres database. Next step was to analyse this
    data and find a prediction model fitting the data captured. The data from the
    database table first extracted in the form of a .CSV file. Data pre-processing:
    The .CSV file contains certain extra columns which are not required by us. These
    columns are dropped first. Next we need to take care of the anomalous values such
    as a high peak in temperature which is impractical. This kind of thing happens
    only few times but can harm our results. Hence are removed. Analysis using linear
    regression: We applied the machine learning on the same data and predicted the
    status and requirements of the disease treatment in advance by applying simple
    linear regression model. We analysed the captured data and found the prediction
    model fitting that data. In our prediction model using linear regression we have
    three variables. T, W, and I are respectively the temperature, duration of wetness
    of leaf and incubation period of the infection causing pathogen. So we have analyzed
    the collected data and found a prediction model fitting the data captured. Our
    model has three variables as such. The first of these is the temperature (T),
    second is the duration of wetness (W) and the final is the incubation period of
    the infection causing pathogen (I). The main purpose was to find a relationship
    which makes I as a function of W and T. Later on this equation is found to be
    useful in finding the vulnerability of some specific combination of wetness duration
    and temperature with respect to an attack of infection. In a simple linear regression
    model, a single response measurement is related to a single predictor (covariate,
    regressor) X for each observation. The critical assumption of the model is that
    the conditional mean function is linear as shown in Eq. 3.1: (3.1) In most problems,
    multiple number of predictor variables may be available. This will result in the
    following “multiple-regression” mean function as shown in Eq. (3.2): (3.2) Where
    a is called the intercept and the b are slopes or coefficients of X variables.
    Keeping the other predictors constant, each coefficient estimates the change in
    the mean response per unit increase in X. The equation that we found out is shown
    in Eq. (3.3): (3.3) The Eq. (3.3) we obtained using linear regression model shows
    the incubation period is being predicted by the temperature value and the value
    of wetting period. The negative coefficients (−0.3328 and −0.886) indicates inverse
    relationship between incubation period with the temperature and wetting duration.
    In other words we can say that with decreasing in the values of temperature and
    wetting period there is an increase in the value of I. 3.6. Results Table 3.3
    shows the table of results obtained by using linear regression and shows the Estimated
    Value, Standard Error, True Value of Intercept, Average Temperature and Wetting
    Duration. The Eq. 3.3 thus obtained using linear regression model shown above
    indicates that the incubation period is being predicted by the temperature value
    and the value of wetting period. With decreasing in the values of temperature
    T and wetting period W there is an increase in the value of incubation I. The
    Algorithm 1 shows the various steps used in order the get the correct results.

    and unsafe-zones. The incubation period for Kulgam was 5 days and for Anantnag
    district it was 3 days. Hence Kulgam and Anantnag were categorized as unsafe zones
    while as Srinagar was categorized as safer zone under the present climatic conditions.
    The system was proved to be useful for the local farmers and hence we got our
    results attested. In Fig. 3.7 the residuals vs. fitted is a scatter plot of residuals
    on the y axis and fitted values (estimated responses) on the x axis. The scatter
    plot is used to detect unequal error variances, non-linearity, and outliers. Any
    data point that falls directly on the estimated regression line has a residual
    of 0 i.e. no error in the predicted value. If we compare the previous work done
    with the proposed work, wherein they have not used the real time data for prediction
    of apple scab disease hence time to respond to the disease is more but by time
    we come to know about the disease the response time has already elapsed and the
    crop will be affected. In our approach using the IoT for disease prediction the
    delay is minimised to the extent that if a corrective mechanism like temperature
    control, spray of chemicals, pesticides, watering etc. for real time precise agriculture
    can be used. Although we may need to increase the number of parameters for disease
    prediction in our proposed mechanism in future but this work can give us a platform,
    architecture and algorithm to move ahead. Download : Download high-res image (55KB)

    in IoT Adoption for traditional farmers Precision agriculture is a powerful technology
    to meet the challenges of the increasing needs from scarce resources. Besides
    the advantages there are number of challenges which agriculturalists, farmers,
    researchers and scientists are facing while adopting it. For this purpose a local
    survey was conducted to know what the regional people think about it. 4.1. Survey
    setup Site Description: Jammu and Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region
    of the Indian Subcontinent. Kashmir lies between latitudes 32°and 36°N, and longitudes
    74°and 80°E. It has a different climate for every region owing to the great variation
    of the level of the altitude. Wheat, maize and rice crops grown in about 250,000
    hectares 210,000 hectares and 110,000 hectares area respectively are the major
    cereal crops of Jammu and Kashmir division. Apple is the valuable cash crop of
    Kashmir Valley. In India, agricultural risks are provoked by variety of factors,
    like climatic variability/change, extreme weather events, crop management practices
    and soil fertility status etc. which ultimately leads to uncertainties in yields
    and prices of the grain. We did the local survey in Kashmir Valley by using precision
    agriculture in the crop fields using Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICT) like IoT, Machine learning, Data analytics etc. The population of this study
    are small scale farmers to large scale farmer using simple technologies and mostly
    traditional ways in their apple orchards for agricultural information to improve
    their productivity. In order to bridge the gap of knowledge and skill regarding
    agriculture in this area, we asked some questions through interview to know its
    basic causes. 1100 people were selected who were engaged in these from three districts
    Kulgam, Srinagar and Anantnag where we have deployed our proposed system. Random
    sampling technique was used and 330 respondents (33% from the total frame) were
    interviewed in study area based on the population intensity. Table 4.1 shows the
    survey site, number of farmers selected in each site and number of respondent
    in the sample. While this survey various questions were asked to the farmers.
    Most of them were uneducated, some of them were educated, few of them have the
    knowledge of IoT and other technologies. In order to know their views various
    questions were asked to them either through questionnaire or by interview. Table
    4.2 shows the various questions and the percentage of corresponding responses
    in terms of Yes or No. The positive (yes) response was mostly received from those
    farmers who were either educated, or whose field was under investigation. Table

    4.2. Results From the last decade, overall amount of funds for the agronomy area
    has developed enormous nearly 80%. In accordance with the experts of the agronomy
    sector smart agriculture is capable to take on an important role in attaining
    the proliferating demands of food of the increasing population throughout the
    globe. The financial worth of the worldwide smart aggie marketplace is approximately
    $4.6 billion with CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) between 2015 and 2020 being
    just a touch under 12% (Fakhruddin, 2020) mentioned in a fresh report. It has
    been predicted in many foreign countries especially in United States alone agriculture
    software will nearly increase around more than 14% between current and 2022. From
    the above it is expected that development and propagation of precision farming
    should be vigorous, efficient, etc. But like other technology based applications
    precision agriculture also faces number of challenges as we have seen in the local
    survey in Jammu and Kashmir that there are number of challenges. The challenges
    faced are mentioned in Fig. 4.1 and are discussed below: Download : Download high-res
    image (76KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4.1. Challenges of Adopting
    Precision Agriculture. 4.2.1. Challenges based on commercial Due to the tremendous
    advantages of the current technologies like Internet of things, wireless sensors,
    actuators, today’s farmers are interested in business models. Using IoT technologies,
    they will accumulate the data from their farms to support their revenue. The data
    provided by the farmers are exploited by the most of the existing IoT platform
    service providers. They provide unrestricted limited services and full services
    with diverse level of subscriptions. This becomes the part of argument for farmers
    to supervise their owned data. Budget: While developing any solution for smart
    agriculture, cost analysis should be done. As we know in IoT, the initial costs
    are very high due to the variety of sensors, gateways, base station infrastructure
    (Farooq et al., 2019). After this maintenance is also an important part of cost
    analysis. Here the researcher’s goal should always remain such that increasing
    the production while decreasing the cost requirement. Unawareness of Information
    and Technology era: As we know most of the agricultural working is happening in
    rural areas where farmers are not well educated. They are unable to accept the
    new trends and technologies early. This is the reason of slowing IoT in rural
    areas. So in order to overcome this issue, we need to educate farmers in order
    to generate best results (Marjani et al., 2017, Farooq et al., 2019). Loss of
    manual employment: Around 60–70% of the workforce are working in the primary sector
    globally. The number is high particularly in Asia, Africa and Oceania. As the
    agricultural practices become automated and mechanized -a very great percentage
    of the agronomy workforce will lose their employment. It will make it necessary
    to accommodate these employs in other employable sectors. This will be only possible
    if these sectors are able to absorb such a very huge volume of unemployed people.
    But due to the poverty in most of the developing countries particularly in India
    it is hardly possible. So besides the large-scale benefits the precision agriculture
    lead but a massive displacement of labors may cause discontent and disappointment
    among populace. Benefits not immediately apparent: While developing any system
    in any field, QoS is very important. In big IoT data and machine learning used
    in precision agriculture QoS should be highlighted at each layer so that system
    will give best results at end (Al-Fuqaha et al., 2015, Huang et al., 2017). There
    are number of challenges especially while transferring data from one layer to
    another QoS is usually compromised. Hence there is a need to do more research
    work by providing a solution that will guarantee QoS throughout the network system
    at each layer. 4.2.2. Challenges based on sectorial There are number of parameters
    that need to considered for distribution of IoT systems. One of the main factor
    is the ability of an IoT device to place anywhere for perfect operation and remain
    connected globally. This means the ability to connect anywhere at anytime with
    least configuration. Other features are ability to support roaming and provide
    reliability to the system for proper results. We need to consider the IoT technology
    infrastructure for the static IoT devices. Size of individual management zones:
    Production function refers to the quantity and quality of output keeping the land
    area under cultivation same. But the production function varies for most of the
    crops, in different zones of field etc. (Fakhruddin, 2020). But unfortunately
    farmers are not aware about it. Precision agriculture cannot be optimized unless
    and until farmers become aware about varying production function e.g. excessive
    or moderate use of fertilizers, pesticides etc. will lead to crop damage. Interoperability:
    It refers to the capability of a device, product, service, system to be operated
    with others reciprocally. With the growing Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM)
    approaching with innovative and advanced precision agronomy equipments, devices,
    platforms, etc., interoperability becomes the most important point of concern
    (Fakhruddin, 2020). This involves number of issues related to the technical, semantic,
    syntactic and organization interoperability (Elijah et al., 2018, Brewster et
    al., 2017, Vermesan, 2010, Tayur and Suchithra, 2017). So in order to overcome
    this issue researchers should focus on building the farmer friendly platforms
    which are holistic instead of smart standalone devices, gateways or other smart
    appliance. Supervisory challenges: Organizing, managing and permissible foundation
    concerning the authority and proprietorship of field data between the owners of
    the fields and the data companies is required to sort out. Regulations like data
    privacy, data security, technical issues, available resources like bandwidth,
    etc. differ from country to country. Differing these supervisory features affect
    the use cases related to the agriculture. Hence due to the heterogeneity of supervising
    techniques becomes a challenge for most of the farmers. 4.2.3. Challenges based
    on technicality Technology make jobs easy. Every work based on technology becomes
    automated using IoT and other mechanized ways. This increases the dependence of
    health, traffic, home and other related jobs on the technology. It can be very
    dangerous at times even if any individual subsystem of the system will stop working.
    Hence can become the cause of loss. If we take the example of the precision agriculture
    as in our case most of the hardware units are exposed to the outside environment.
    This makes it more possible that the sensors may get destroyed due the various
    reasons like, rain, wind, snow etc. So in short we can say that we cannot meet
    the food safety. Compromising the food safety means system is useless. Sometimes
    the downtime can be caused by power failure. Hence we need to make sure we are
    keeping the backups for everything in order to meet the requirement. Single point
    failure can never lead to success. Internet Connectivity: In rural areas across
    the globe particularly in developing countries like India high speed and reliable
    internet connectivity is absent (Fakhruddin, 2020). Due to the wireless communication
    various issues like multipath propagation, which occurs due to the buildings trees
    etc. the IoT system is not able to work consistently. So there is a need to develop
    most robust and reliable technologies (Ojha et al., 2015). Security Factor: It
    refers when the said system is compromised to restore personal information. It
    is one of the most important issues in every field of study. In our case of big
    IoT data and machine learning it may compromise any sort of information at any
    layer, lower or higher (Marjani et al., 2017). The main focus of researchers remain
    to secure the customers data. With the innovations and technological revolutions
    each and everything has become dependent on cloud computing, IoT, big data machine
    learning. But unfortunately these systems don’t provide solid Service Level Agreements
    (SLA) (Marjani et al., 2017). Although there are number of ways to enforce data
    security like encryption, temporary identification, etc. But decisions should
    be made based on moral factors that is what to adopt, when to adopt, where to
    adopt, how to adopt and why to adopt? (Marjani et al., 2017, Tsai et al., 2015).
    There are number of existing solutions which are not pertinent (Marjani et al.,
    2017). They provide solutions which are applicable for static data sets. But the
    in our case, of big IoT data have dynamic nature (Marjani et al., 2017). In precision
    agriculture we cannot use the complex and sophisticated algorithms due to limited
    resources like memory, processing, power communication capabilities etc. In precision
    agriculture and farming the IoT sensing devices are most defenseless especially
    to environmental tempering like attacks by animals, thieves, and alteration of
    physical address (Varga et al., 2017, Duan et al., 2014). The IoT system when
    used in agriculture are mostly targeted by device capture attacks (Varga et al.,
    2017, Newell et al., 2014), the higher layers are then targeted by Dos attacks
    (Elijah et al., 2018). The farmers usually prefer the devices which are cheap
    but they are not supported by security and privacy related features. Hence to
    make internet of things more acceptable for every kind of farmer there is a necessity
    of strict security and endowment policies for precision agriculture (Fakhruddin,
    2020). Absence of Scalability and configuration: IoT system includes billions
    of devices which are developed and deployed across the globe over different locations.
    Existing systems and protocols should have the ability of support this large number
    of IoT nodes e.g. Sigfox gateway, Lora and Ingenu can support up to , and nodes
    respectively (Elijah et al., 2018). This requires proper management system for
    each device and unique identification numbers. Reliability: IoT sensing devices
    are mostly distributed in outdoor surrounding to sense the environmental conditions.
    This exposes IoT system to harsh environmental conditions which in turn destroys
    the sensors, gateways, etc. and hence creates the communication failures (Elijah
    et al., 2018). Hence physical safety of these devices should be ensured so that
    big IoT data precision system for agriculture will be properly developed. Selection
    of technology: Number of challenges arises while developing a smart precision
    agriculture system using IoT and big data. It is due to the fact that all the
    devices which exist at the perception layer are directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as high or low temperature, extreme humidity, storm, rain and
    many other possible dangers which destroy electronic circuits and devices (Farooq
    et al., 2019). In precision agriculture to maintain the system working in open
    fields is a challenging task. It is the responsibility of researchers to address
    these issues. Optimization of scarce resources: To determine the requirement of
    resources so that profit margins can be known in advance but due to the varying
    nature of farm sizes and different types of sensor requirement this is a challenging
    task (Elijah et al., 2018). In order to know the requirement of resources precisely
    there is a need to develop complex algorithm and mathematical models. Again the
    resources are limited in IoT system, e.g. Precision agriculture advantages have
    already been discussed. However, the need of powerful gateways, smart sensors,
    data centers and other IoT related gadgets can lead to a higher consumption of
    energy (Fakhruddin, 2020). Hence it is very important to determine optimal resource
    allocation while maximizing agricultural products and profits and minimizing the
    cost. 4.2.4. Challenges based on data analytics Todays world is running every
    business and organization to get more profit using the data analytics. Same is
    the case with the smart agriculture. To deal wit the data, researchers face number
    of challenges which are mentioned under data analytics challenge category. Integration:
    It refers to combine the data coming from different sources of different formats
    into a uniform view (Ahamed et al., 2014). Good information is achieved from good
    data which is achieved through proper integration (Liu and Zhang, 2014). But it
    is a challenging task to integrate data from diverse sources (Ma’ayan et al.,
    2014). To adjust the structure in semi-structured and unstructured data is again
    an issue to be addressed (Chen et al., 2015, Savaglio et al., 2019). In Savaglio
    et al. (2019) novel data mining methodologies have been investigated for IoT scenario
    with respect edge computing using two types of K-Means clustering algorithm; distributed
    and centralized. Performance analysis helps to choose the best among these two
    versions based on their computation, energy consumption and communication requirements.
    There is a need to develop solutions for integrating data from multiple sources
    efficiently. Knowledge Mining: It refers to generate efficient and best fitting
    descriptive and predictive solutions for big IoT data which in turn can be generalized
    for new data items (Marjani et al., 2017, Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013). Information
    extraction and data exploration are the challenges which were evolved due to big
    data and cloud computing platforms (Marjani et al., 2017, Hu et al., 2012). Due
    to nature of big IoT data every task related to data mining becomes a challenge
    like heterogeneous communication, integration, exploration and extraction process,
    cleansing, reduction, transmission (Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn, 2017, Khattab
    et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2007, Ahmed et al., 2016). The researchers are trying
    to find solutions to these issues. They have brought in sequential programming
    models, parallel programming models and proposed diverse algorithms to deal with
    big IoT data. Big data is increasing making precision agriculture data driven;
    this will become helpful only when we make sense of it using technology. Visualization:
    It is an important part in IoT data especially while handling IoT related systems
    in which data is produced enormously (Marjani et al., 2017). Again it is a very
    challenging task while dealing with big IoT data due to the structured, semi-structured
    and unstructured nature of it. So we did not get good and clear results. Cloud
    computing platforms enriched with GUI facilities help us to find good insights
    (Wang et al., 2015). Dimensionality reduction techniques are very helpful to deal
    with the big IoT data (Azar and Hassanien, 2015). Again if we try to use parallelization
    techniques to deal with small manageable tasks is again a challenge in precision
    agriculture big IoT data (Childs et al., 2013). 5. Conclusion and future work
    The arable land is reducing slowly due to constructions (houses, dams, factories,
    industries, etc.), natural shrinking of arable land (floods, earthquakes, landslides
    etc.). Hence, the emphasis on superior and proficient crop disease approaches
    is prerequisite so that increasing food demand of the growing population can be
    fulfilled. The paper has given an extensive literature survey on the precision
    agriculture using IoT data analytics and machine learning. Furthermore, the applications
    of these technologies in precision agriculture are highlighted. Moreover the paper
    tried to address one of the problems faced in apple crop in regions like Kashmir.
    Since the apple growers are still using the classical approaches of disease prediction
    without any technological intervention like IoT/ WSN. One of the major advantages
    of the proposed approach will be real time measures against any possible disease
    like scab if predicted precisely and in a timely manner. Results from a case study
    on adoption of apple scab disease prediction in the orchards of Kashmir has shown
    improvement in terms of dissemination of information regarding the factors/parameters
    responsible for the disease aforementioned. Finally, the paper highlighted the
    issues faced while developing and deploying such applications in real time, for
    this a local survey was conducted to know what are the views of people regarding
    precision agriculture. Although many challenges are ahead before implementing
    the proposed framework at large scale. These include initial cost of implementation,
    deployment, training, weather conditions and other parameters. But once the aforementioned
    limitations are overwhelmed, the profits will turn into visible and workable form.
    The work shall be extended in future to include more parameters influencing the
    crop. The paper generalize that precision Aggie is stand on four stakes; Appropriate
    source, Appropriate place, Appropriate quantity and Appropriate time. Declaration

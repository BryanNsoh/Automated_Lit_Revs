    Fungi are an important component of the biosphere, and their production (micro-
    and macrofungi) is a rapidly growing sector of the food economy worldwide (Royse
    et al. 2017). This includes developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Central
    America where locals, indigenous people, or members of the general public forage
    for both, fruiting bodies and sclerotia (a dense conglomerate of mycelium produced
    by some species that serves as a food reserve for the fungus) as a food and also
    as a therapeutic resource. Dozens of species have been successfully farmed, and
    there are continuous attempts to domesticate new ones (Wasser 2010; Nnorom et
    al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013; Thawthong et al. 2014; Santiago et al. 2016; Yongabi
    2019). Foraging for wild mushrooms is still popular in Europe, e.g., in Italy,
    Spain, Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Turkey, Finland, Lithuania, Switzerland, and
    France, either as a traditional pastime, a seasonal recreation, or for commercial
    reasons (Læssoe et al. 1996; Isiloglu et al. 2001; Pelkonen et al. 2006; Stijve
    2007; Falandysz and Borovička 2013; Kalać, 2016). Globally, 44.2 million tons
    of mushrooms were produced in 2021 (FAO 2022), but this does not include the quantities
    of wild mushrooms that are foraged by individuals for personal consumption or
    for sale, locally. Button mushrooms (champignon), oyster mushrooms, and shitake
    are still the most popular commercial varieties and dominate the global consumer
    market for these foods (FAO 2022). Mushrooms with edible or medicinal value are
    highly biodiverse, numerous, and have evolved to colonize a variety of soil and
    plant substrates. Their position, between the plant and animal kingdoms, bestows
    a meaty texture and taste to the flesh of many edible species, largely resulting
    from the occurrence and composition of amino acids (Miller et al. 2014; Jaworska
    et al. 2015; Kalać, 2016). The possibility of combining traditional knowledge
    of mushrooms in folk medicine (Grzywnowicz 2007; Wasser 2010; Bhatt et al. 2018),
    with the requirements of modern pharmacy and the search for new bioactive compounds
    as possible medicines, is currently a challenging field of research (Money 2016;
    Gründemann et al. 2020). The successful attempts to domesticate some of these
    have resulted in a diverse range of farmed species—mainly saprotrophs, which can
    be raised using a wide variety and composition of substrates (often waste agricultural/plant
    material) (Koutrotsios et al. 2018; Rizzo et al. 2021; Berger et al. 2022). Complementing
    this use and biodiversity, fungi are now increasingly explored for bioactive organic
    and inorganic components and as possible agents for the remediation of contaminated
    land (Sanchez and Demain 2017; Treu and Falandysz 2017). This work concisely documents
    and critically overviews literature data on the occurrence of La and Ce in the
    fruiting bodies of wild and farmed species of edible and medicinal mushrooms.
    In particular, the evaluation was based on parameters such as environmental geochemistry,
    cultivation practice, analytical chemistry, food toxicology, mushroom systematics,
    and ecology. An initial assessment of any potential health risk from REE intake
    through mushroom consumption was also made. Rare-earth elements Lanthanides, referred
    to as the rare earth elements (REE; La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er,
    Tm, Yb, and Lu), are often reported as light-, medium-, and heavy atomic weight
    REE. The IUPAC definition also includes Sc and Y, but this inclusion is currently
    the subject of debate between different scientific disciplines. They are dispersed
    in soil bedrock, clays, and topsoils and are similarly absorbed from the soil
    solution by mushrooms and plants, making them amenable to further migration up
    food webs (Brioschi et al. 2013; Khan et al. 2017; Squadrone et al. 2019; Patel
    et al. 2023). Within the last few decades, applications of REE in alloys, high-tech
    materials, and commodities have seen a rapid increase as have the related activities
    of geological extraction and processing of ores for these metals. REE are increasingly
    used in modern technologies including magnets in electric motors, metallurgy,
    the electronics sector, wind turbines, crude oil refining, catalytic converters
    in the automotive industry, and others (Voncken 2016; Mordor Intelligence 2022).
    So, in addition to research and investigations into geological resources, production,
    new applications, inventions, and analytical chemistry, REE also attract growing
    attention within the environmental, food, and toxicological sciences (Li et al.
    2013; Migaszewski and Gałuszka 2016; Doulgeridou et al. 2020; Piarulli et al.
    2021; Brouziotis et al. 2022; Falandysz and Fernandes 2023). Typically, REE are
    present in terrestrial feeds and drinking water at low levels, but the current
    state of knowledge suggests that they are neither essential nor toxic at current
    occurrence levels in foods, feeds, and environmental media (Squadrone et al. 2018;
    Wysocka et al. 2018). From the food toxicology point of view, data on the toxicity
    of the full range of REE to humans are incomplete, while their occurrence and
    typical concentrations in plant-based foodstuff are reported as “natural” and
    without advisories or precautions (Squadrone et al. 2018; Doulgeridou et al. 2020).
    Recent experiments on toxicity using omics-based approaches (with micro-fungus
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have identified some biological functions and pathways
    that may be disrupted by some medium and heavy atomic weight REE and also the
    key genes and proteins that are associated with this mode of toxicity (Pallares
    et al. 2023). These effects were not identified for the light atomic weight members
    (Ce, La, and Nd), which have analogous features and can be a substitute for calcium
    (Ca) in some bacteria. REE data reported so far on matrices from marine environments
    (macro algae—seaweeds, fish seem to show higher concentrations in marine than
    terrestrial species, on a dry weight basis) (Squadrone et al. 2017, 2019). Among
    the REE, La, Ce, and Nd have seen the most applications. Cerium is largely used
    to manufacture aluminim alloys and also as a fluid cracking catalyst for oil refineries,
    a catalyst for self-cleaning ovens, in engineered nanomaterials, a polishing powder
    for liquid crystal and glass display panel surfaces, magnetic memory discs, a
    chemical oxidizing agent, as a yellow colorant in glass and ceramics, as ferrocerium
    flints for lighters, and as robust intrinsically hydrophobic coatings for turbine
    blades. Lanthanum is used in high refractive index and alkali-resistant glass,
    flint, hydrogen storage, battery-electrodes, camera, and refractive telescope
    lenses, and as a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst in oil refineries (Voncken
    2016). CeO2NP and CeO2 are engineered Ce-nanoparticles that are used as model
    compounds in toxicological studies but have also found agricultural and commercial
    application, with the potential for nanomedicine (Ma et al. 2023). The pressures
    of promoting innovation and economy, accompanied by the lack of comprehensive
    toxicological research on new food additives, raise questions on the risk such
    as the safety of metal nanoparticles that are used directly in food and taken
    up orally by humans. Even those that have been used for some time, e.g., TiO2,
    SiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, turn out to be problematic and even risky (Cheng et al. 2023).
    This increasing and diverse use of REE is considered a potential source of pollution
    of environmental media including soils (Qvarforth et al. 2022). Airborne REE,
    (e.g., La, which is one of the most used REE in fluid catalytic cracking catalysts
    and is released from local sources of emission such as production sites or oil
    refineries), behave like classical heavy metals, undergoing atmospheric and also
    wastewater diffusion, and finally fallout or sedimentation on surfaces (Kulkarni
    et al. 2007; Migaszewski and Gałuszka 2015; Censi et al. 2017). A recognized example
    of environmental pollution by REE is that of gadolinium (Gd). For some years now,
    Gd-based contrast agents have been administered to patients by intravenous injection
    in order to improve the clarity of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance
    angiography scans, as an aid to diagnosis. The dosed Gd is subsequently excreted
    through the renal system, although there is debate about the proportion of the
    dose that is retained and can accumulate in the body, e.g., in the brain (Guo
    et al. 2018; Kanda 2019; Ibrahim et al. 2023). There are reports that such use
    of gadolinium chelates which are ultimately disposed off through the sewage system
    results in the contamination of freshwater, drinking water, and beverages that
    are produced using these waters (Migaszewski and Gałuszka 2016; Schmidt et al.
    2019). Metallic elements and mushrooms Micro- and macrofungi are key components
    of forest ecosystems. They recycle chemical elements and other nutrients, often
    symbiotically benefiting plants, but they are also food for a myriad of organisms
    including large animals (Lepp et al. 1987; Berendes and Steinhauser 2022). In
    addition to the physiological necessity of assimilating essential nutrients including
    minerals from their substrates, macromycetes inadvertently also uptake a variety
    of environmental pollutants, both inorganic elements, as well as a range of anthropogenic
    organic chemicals. This uptake and assimilation are well recognized, particularly
    for potentially toxic elements (PTEs), and has been extensively studied (Falandysz
    and Borovička 2013; Falandysz 2016; Braeuer et al. 2000; Strumińska-Parulska et
    al. 2021; Falandysz et al. 2022a; Golovko et al. 2022, and many others). Consequently,
    the contents of some elements such as Hg, Pb, Cd, or radiocaesium in mushrooms
    are regulated in some countries and regions. The potential of mushrooms for mycelial
    uptake (and temporal storage), transfer, and accumulation of a given chemical
    element or compound in the fruiting body is estimated using the concept of the
    bioconcentration factor (BCF) (Tyler 1980). The BCF is the concentration ratio
    (quotient) of fruiting body occurrence relative to that of the substrate. It can
    be estimated using the absolute (total) element concentration in the fruiting
    body. For soil substrates, some estimations use absolute (or pseudo-total) concentrations
    but also other (extractable-labile, mobile, or adsorbed fraction) concentration
    data (Grawunder and Gube 2018; Lipka et al. 2018). BCF values for La and Ce for
    both wild and farmed mushrooms show bio-exclusion (i.e., the BCF ratio is < 1)
    (Aruguete et al. 1998; Grawunder and Gube 2018; Koutrotsios et al. 2018; Vukojević
    et al. 2019; Zocher et al. 2018; Mędyk and Falandysz 2022). Ce, La, and ΣREE in
    forest soils and wood substrates Natural concentrations and distribution patterns
    Cerium was the most abundant REE in forest topsoils that were collected along
    with mushrooms in Poland/Belarus, Serbia, and Germany contributing 40–44, 33–38,
    and 42%, respectively to the sum. La was also abundant, contributing 19–21, 22–22,
    and 20%, respectively contrasting strongly with lutetium, the least abundant REE
    with contributions of 0.27–0.46, 0.07–0.08, and 0.30%, respectively (Zocher et
    al. 2018; Vukojević et al. 2019; Mędyk and Falandysz 2022). The occurrence pattern
    of REE in the soil is reflected in mushrooms, trees, plants, and other food products
    (a consequence of the Oddo-Harkins’ order of elemental occurrence), thus maintaining
    the original abundance patterns (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). Absolute concentrations of
    REE in foods range from low to ultra-low levels, e.g., based on 79, 91, and 65
    positive results (that were above the method quantification limit) out of 98 samples
    of brown rice, dry weight (dw) concentrations of Ce, La, and Lu were 1.3 µg kg−1,
    0.74 µg kg−1, and 0.17 µg kg−1 dw, respectively (Fig. 3). Similarly, respective
    Ce, La, and Lu concentrations were 7.97, 7.49, and 0.04 µg kg−1 dw in Italian
    tomatoes, 2.2, 1.3, and 0.085 µg kg−1 fw (fresh weight) in Graviera (Gruyère)
    cheese from Macedonia, and 13, 2.6, and 0.43 µg kg−1 fw in the muscle meat of
    wild European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus from Greece (Fig. 3). This preserved
    occurrence pattern owes much to the similarity of the physico-chemical properties
    between REE, i.e., they all show similar electronic configurations, ionic radii,
    and a dominant trivalent oxidation state. Consequently, they also have generally,
    the same biogeochemical fate—they behave similarly or largely as “one element”
    as they migrate through food webs (Kabata-Pendias and Pendias 1999). A few REE,
    e.g., Eu and Ce in part can occur also in other oxidation states in the environment
    which may sometimes lead to an anomaly in their “shale or chondrite normalized”
    distribution pattern in environmental media (Migaszewski and Gałuszka 2015; Kwecko
    2016). Such an anomaly in the occurrence of Eu in mushrooms has been observed
    by Borovička et al. (2011) as well as in Macrolepiota procera (Falandysz et al.
    2017). Similarly, minor anomalies of Eu occurrence were observed for some morphological
    parts but not for all mushroom samples in another study (Mędyk and Falandysz 2022),
    or for Suillus luteus which showed a positive anomaly for Y (Zocher et al. 2018).
    Plots of natural normal- and log-normal distribution of REE occurrence in abiotic
    and biological samples display the characteristic saw-tooth pattern reflecting
    the mentioned Oddo-Harkins order. This characteristic is very useful for objective
    (internal or external) assessment and verification of the credibility and analytical
    quality of a data set. It is therefore important, scientifically justified, and
    sound to provide the results of determination of a full range of REEs in the tested
    matrix, instead of only one or a few randomly selected REE, which is sometimes
    observed in reported data on mushrooms (Table 1). Fig. 1 Natural normal- and log-normal

    or clearly biased data are shown in bold, and with a question mark) Full size
    table Biologically, REE are considered to behave similarly to the macroelement,
    calcium (Ca2+) (Liu et al. 2012; Lange and Peiter 2020). In alcohol dehydrogenase
    of methylotrophic bacteria, REE can take the place of Ca2+, particularly in the
    case of those REE that are more abundant in nature such as La, Ce, Pr, and Nd
    (Pol et al. 2014; Hibi et al. 2011). In addition to this similarity in behavior
    to the Ca ion, analogies have also been made with the biological coordination
    chemistry between REE and Fe3+ and Mg2+ (Brown et al. 1990; Guo et al. 2016; Cotruvo
    2019). Calcium is one of the main macro-minerals and is present in a large excess
    in relation to the summed REE concentration in foods, including edible mushrooms
    (Mędyk et al. 2023). On the other hand, Ca also shares behavioral similarities
    (Saniewski et al. 2016), with barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr), which like Ca are
    group II alkaline earth metals. Ca, Ba, and Sr significantly exceed the occurrence
    of REE in mushrooms. For example, in Suillus grevillei commonly known as the Larch
    Bolete or Greville’s bolete, the Ca concentration in caps ranged from 80 to 420
    mg kg−1 dw, with 220 to 510 mg kg−1 dw in the stems (median values for 6 sample
    sets with 78 specimens), Ba ranged from 0.89 to 7.1 and 1.6 to 7.7 mg kg−1 dw,
    and Sr ranged from 0.31 to 1.8 and 0.79 to 2.3 mg kg−1 dw, respectively (Chudzyński
    and Falandysz 2008). Summed 13–14 REE concentrations in another set of S. grevillei
    were 0.068 mg kg−1 dw in the caps and 0.049 mg kg−1 dw in the stems (corrected
    values) (Mędyk and Falandysz 2022). However, possible associations in the occurrence
    and relationships between REE, Ca, Ba, and Sr in the light of food toxicology
    are as yet, largely unexplored. In China, specifically, the REE (largely “a mixture
    with La, Ce, Nd, and Pr accounting for the main components”) have been used for
    decades as fertilizers for crops (largely to overcome deficiency symptoms of Ca),
    and due to overdosing over time, adverse effects have been seen in plants (Redling
    2006; Tommasi et al. 2021; He et al. 2022). There is no factual data on whether
    REE were used in the farming of mushrooms. Farmed mushrooms are largely raised
    on plant substrates (sawdust, straw, wood, vegetable wastes, etc.), and for some
    species, additional nutrition can be supplemented through the use of compost like
    manure (derived from horses and chickens), peat, chalk, and others, but there
    are no reports of the use of REE (Bhatia et al. 2013; Koutrotsios et al. 2018;
    Pankavec et al. 2021). REE have been used to promote the growth of livestock but
    as in the case of crops, it is doubtful if they play any “positive” role (Redling
    2006; Schwabe et al. 2012; Tariq et al. 2020). Artifacts Sampling artifacts—incrusted
    sand crystals, adhered soil dust, and herbaria samples Even very minor contamination
    of mushroom samples with sand (soil dust) debris will result in elevated concentrations
    of La, Ce, and other REE and also Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Fe, Li, Ni, Sc, Sr, Th, Ti,
    V, and Y, as has been documented and explained in the literature (Cocchi et al.
    2002; Stijve et al. 2001, 2002,  2004). It is difficult to exclude soil dust from
    fungal samples taken from sandy soil stands and from truffles simply by using
    dry clean-up methods, and wet clean-up methods, e.g., rinsing with distilled water,
    can affect water-soluble potassium and phosphates (Stijve et al. 2004). A stipe
    (stem, stalk) but also a cap (pileus) of some species can, hypothetically, be
    incrusted with sand (or soil dust), which in practice is impossible to remove
    completely. Stijve et al. (2004) found artificially high levels of REE and some
    of the above-listed elements in species such as Gyrophragmium dunalii (Fr.) Zeller
    (current name Agaricus aridicola Geml, Geiser, and Royse ex Mateos, J. Morales,
    J.A. Muñoz, Rey, and C. Tovar (the sand mushroom), Helvella monachella (Scop.)
    Fr., Morchella dunensis ((current name Morchella esculenta (L.) Pers., (common
    morel, morel, yellow morel, true morel, morel mushroom, or sponge morel)), Podaxis
    pistillaris (L.) Fr. (the desert shaggy mane), Psathyrella ammophila (Durieu and
    Lév.) P.D. Orton (the dune brittlestem) because of incorporated soil dust. Gyroporus
    cyanescens (Bull.) Quél.) (bluing bolete or cornflower bolete), and other members
    of the genus Gyroporus (Gyroporaceae) which grow in sandy soils need particular
    attention if collected (although most are protected species). Also, the popular
    Tricholoma flavovirens (L.) P. Kumm.—current name T. equestre (L.) P. Kumm., (man
    on horseback or yellow knight), if collected from sandy soil stands would require
    particular care during cleaning as would many other sand-dwelling species. Mushrooms
    growing on wood or plant substrates either wild or farmed would generally be free
    of dust contamination after cutting out the bottom part of the stipe. Dried mushrooms
    if bought from retail outlets can be contaminated by soil dust. Karkocha and Młodecki,
    who studied the nutritive value of dried Boletus edulis, Agaricus bisporus, Cantharellus
    cibarius, and Gyromitra esculenta found that the content of sand in these mushrooms
    (possibly commercial consignments) ranged from 0.55 to 1.8% (Karkocha and Młodecki
    1965). Precaution is advised when working with fungal materials deposited in academic
    herbaria that can be contaminated with soil substrate residues (Borovička et al.
    2011). REE data on mushrooms and their substrates can also be affected by analytical
    chemistry methodologies that are used for determination. Analytical artifacts
    Some analytical methodologies and instrumentation that are used in the determination
    of REE in biological materials can lead to questionable results for REE, including
    both La and Ce (Table 1). Measurement by X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF)—a modern
    non-destructive technique which has been used in the determination of REE in mushrooms
    has been highlighted as producing unreliable quantitation in part due to the inadequacy
    of the method quantitation limits (Borovička et al. 2011; Falandysz and Fernandes
    2023). Hence, data obtained using XRF were not included in Table 1. A similar
    non-destructive technique, neutron activation analysis (INAA), allows the determination
    of many elements in a sample without matrix decomposition, but in the case of
    REE, INAA has inadequate instrumental and methodological detection and quantification
    (LOD, LOQ, MDL, MQL) capabilities for a range of REE. Apart from Ce, Nd, and La,
    other elements with much lower biological occurrence usually fall below the detection
    or quantitation limits required for mushroom analysis. Using INAA, Řanda and Kučera
    (2004) were able to provide results only for La (as well as Sc and a few data
    for Y). Other practical considerations in using INAA are the poor accessibility,
    high level of technical and safety training, and the high cost of using the technique.
    Inductively coupled-emission/optical mass spectroscopy (ICP-A/OES-MS) which has
    popularly been used for elemental determination is poorly suited for elements
    at trace or ultra-trace levels including REE in biological materials because of
    a combination of insufficient instrumental detection limits, background noise,
    and spectral interferences, particularly during direct analysis of digested sample
    extracts (Bulska and Ruszczyńska 2017). Due to these limitations, the use of ICP-OES
    for the determination of REE in mushrooms or other materials (wood, trees, soil,
    etc.) was found to yield unreliable results (as commented by Zocher et al. 2018;
    Falandysz 2022a; Falandysz 2022c). Accordingly, only a small subset of the published
    literature data on La, Ce, and ΣREE in mushrooms using ICP-OES has been included
    in Table 1, mainly for comparative and illustrative purposes. ICP, coupled to
    quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with a collision cell, was used in a few
    studies to determine REE in mushrooms and their substrates. In these studies,
    the acid-decomposed sample solution was aspirated directly into the plasma (without
    any further separation from interferences) which resulted in data that were anomalous
    from the point of view of analytical chemistry and biogeochemistry, i.e., REE
    results showed random distribution patterns, and many elements had atypically
    elevated concentrations. So, in common with the ICP-OES data, apart from a few
    comparative examples, most of these data were not included in Table 1. These issues
    on the reliability of REE data based on the analytical methodology used have been
    discussed in more details in other articles (Zocher et al. 2018; Falandysz 2023b;
    Falandysz and Fernandes 2023; Falandysz et al. 2024). The credible determination
    of REE relies on instrumental techniques that are often expensive or use additional
    purification steps, but other important aspects include the competence and experience
    of the analytical chemists. For example, sound knowledge of analytical chemistry,
    geochemistry, environmental and food science, and knowledge of REE occurrence
    through the literature as well as through the understanding of necessary laboratory
    infrastructure, which may seem trivial and mundane are still pertinent issues
    in 2023. Patterns—normal and log-normal or shale (or other matrix) normalized
    and concentration quotients (ratios) An illustration of the dominance of Ce and
    La (also Nd) in summed REE occurrence in mushrooms can be observed from the distribution
    patterns plotted for randomly selected examples in the literature. These are available
    for farmed and wild epigeous (fruiting above the ground—both ectomycorrhizal and
    saprotrophic) and hypogeous (below ground) mushrooms, which were obtained using
    analytical methods with adequate analytical quality and control (AQ/AC) (Fig.
    4). Both, relative concentrations and mutual relationships in REE occurrence in
    mushrooms, their substrates, and some foodstuffs can be explained by the Oddo-Harkins
    order of elemental occurrence (including REE) as clearly observed by the typical
    patterns seen in the plotted data in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Fig. 4 Natural normal-
    and log-normal distribution pattern of lanthanides in farmed (C. cylindracea and
    P. ostreatus) and wild mushrooms; whole saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal species,
    caps of S. grevillei and in truffle (T. magnatum) (after Borovička et al. 2011;
    Koutrotsios et al. 2018; Mędyk and Falandysz 2022, and Segelke et al. 2020, respectively)
    Full size image Farmed Cyclocybe cylindracea (C. c.) and Pleurotus ostreatus (P.
    o.) raised on seven plant substrates with natural but different concentrations
    of La, Ce, and other REE (Koutrotsios et al. 2018) showed BCFs in the ranges:
    0.43 to 0.0065 (C. c.), 0.56 to 0.0084 (P. o.), 1.5 to 0.031 (C. c.), and 1.5
    to 0.039 (P. o.), respectively. The BCF values of Ce calculated for various morphological
    parts (pileus trama—flesh of a cap, pileipellis—skin of a cap, lamellae—lamella/gills,
    stipes—stipe/stem) of Lactarius pubescens ranged from 0.014 to 0.0007 (total),
    0.22 to 0.011 (mobile), and 2.4 to 0.12 (adsorbed) (Grawunder and Gube 2018).
    The BCFs of La and Ce available to date for wild and farmed mushrooms (calculated
    or cited from literature data) and collated in Table 2, generally show bio-exclusion.
    Table 2 The BCFs of La and Ce available to date, for wild and cultivated mushrooms
    Full size table These BCFs for Ce and La are in the range of values calculated
    for Ca in various mushrooms from different collection sites (Jarzyńska et al.
    2012; Lipka et al. 2018). Based on the so-called mobile fraction of Ca in the
    soil substrate which is a portion of the total concentration, BCF values can be
    greater than 1 (as seen in the above listing for some La and Ce data or for compounds
    of other elements, largely oxides, which are poorly soluble in pore water). The
    mycelial network of mushrooms that colonize soil and plant substrates uptake available
    inorganic compounds readily from the soil solution but also actively search for
    nutrients originating from rock and mineral bioweathering by excreting chelating
    agents (Gadd 2017). Mushrooms are much better at bioconcentrating some essential
    elements like K, Mg, Zn, and Cu (BCF > 1) than La and Ce (and other REE and also
    Ca, Ba, and Sr) (Jarzyńska et al. 2012; Andersson et al. 2018; Lipka et al. 2018).
    Toxic elements such as Ag, As, Cd, or Hg occurring at natural concentrations in
    forest topsoils that are largely similar (Cd) or lower (Ag, As, Hg) than those
    of Ce or La are much better bioconcentrated (BCF > 1) than REE by mushrooms (Falandysz
    et al. 2003; Jarzyńska et al. 2012; Árvay et al. 2017; Andersson et al. 2018;
    Grawunder and Gube 2018; Zhang et al. 2020). In view of the natural distribution
    pattern of REE in mushrooms or other biological materials, the values of quotients
    (concentration ratios) for a given pair of REE should occur within a narrow range
    regardless of the matrix and type of input data—absolute or shale/chondrite normalized
    (Falandysz 2023a, 2023c; Falandysz et al. 2024). The La/Ce quotients calculated
    from available data for certain mushrooms (presented in Table 3) show a narrow
    range from 0.4 to 0.6, although this may be exceeded in a few examples. Similarly,
    the La/Ce quotients calculated for shales (Post-Archean Australian Shale, North
    American Shale Composite, European Shale, and World Shale) that were quoted by
    Bau et al. were as follows: 0.48–0.51, 0.44–0.47, 0.49–0.51, and 0.49, respectively
    (Bau et al. 2018). Forest topsoil (0–10 to 0–15 cm layers) at the sites of mushroom
    collection from Poland showed a La/Ce quotient range from 0.44 to 0.50; the quotient
    for those collected in Belarus was 0.45 (Mędyk and Falandysz 2022). In three other
    studies on European mushrooms and soils (Grawunder and Gube 2018; Zocher et al.
    2018; Vukojević et al. 2019), the La/Ce quotients for forest topsoil were 0.47
    (Ronneburg soil), 0.47 (Jena soil), 0.47 to 0.49 in forested land in Bremen in
    Germany, and 0.60 to 0.65 in Serbia. In Japanese forests, La/Ce quotients of 0.50
    and 0.71 were reported for the litter, fermentation/humifying, and mineral layers
    of soils, while the ratios were 0.48 and 0.49–0.37 in Sand-dune Regosol and 0.48–0.38
    for Andosol (Yoshida and Muramatsu 1997). Table 3 The La/Ce quotients (ratios)
    for whole fruiting bodies and their morphological parts of several species Full
    size table La and Ce database for mushrooms An attempt has been made to create
    a database on the occurrence of La and Ce in mushrooms, both wild and farmed,
    based on reported literature data. Such a database relies on good-quality data
    and can be used to establish baseline concentrations for guidance as well as to
    estimate any future occurrence trends. La and Ce, and summed REE concentration
    levels, obtained from validated studies (as well as other data with patterns that
    do not follow the Oddo-Harkins order) were collated (Table 1). Uncertain or clearly
    biased data as described (Falandysz 2022a, b; 43,44,45,46,47,f; Falandysz et al.
    2024) are queried in bold and with a question mark (?). Based on the data in Table
    1, the simplified distribution of La and Ce (and summed REE) concentrations in
    mushroom species collected in Europe is presented in Fig. 5. Concentrations that
    appear overestimated are shown in red and originate from ICP-OES and/or some ICP-Quad-MS
    measurements. Fig. 5 The distribution of La, Ce, and ∑REE in mushroom species
    (as per Table 1) collected in Europe. Concentrations that appear overestimated
    are shown in red and originate from ICP-OES and/or some ICP-Quad-MS measurements
    Full size image Low BCF values and the bio-exclusion of Ce, La, and ∑REE in fruiting
    bodies suggest that macromycetes are unsuitable for mycomining or the bioremediation
    of REE, although these occur over a range of concentrations depending on where
    (above or below the soil or humus substrate), they produce fruiting bodies (Table
    1). Two independent studies determined Ce, La, and summed REE in truffles (genus
    Tuber, species T. aestivum and T. indicum) that produce subterranean fruiting
    bodies and reported high concentration in the peridium (a thin outer skin membrane
    covering the fruitbody) with Ce at 2100–4000 µg kg−1 dw and La at 520–910 µg kg−1
    dw (the quoted uncertainty was very high, i.e. > 100%), while the gleba (the inner
    fleshy part) concentrations were substantially lower, i.e., Ce at 73–140 µg kg−1
    dw and La at 34–79 µg kg−1 dw (Table 1). The values for gleba were within the
    range of results reported in wild epigeous fruiting bodies of many species listed
    in Table 1. One study reported Ce and La in Pseudohydnum gelatinosum (toothed
    jelly fungus) at concentrations of 340 and 170 µg kg−1 dw, respectively, maintaining
    the biogeochemically sound value of the La/Ce quotient at 0.50 (Table 1). The
    Ca concentration was 240 mg kg−1 dw (Du et al. 2010), which is similar to that
    cited earlier for Suillus grevillei. In order to maintain body structure, the
    jelly-like plasmodium of the slime mold Fuligo septica (Myxomycetes, commonly
    called the dog vomit slime mold or the scrambled egg mold is rich in Ca (8.76%
    dw, range 4.80 to11.2% dw) chemically close Ba (2550 mg kg−1 dw, range 294 to
    15,190 mg kg−1 dw) and Sr (1290 mg kg−1 dw, range 237 to 2190 mg kg−1 dw) (Stijve
    and Andrey 1999). Hypothetically, this very high content of Ca in parallel to
    Ba and Sr in F. septica (and potentially in other jelly fungi with elevated Ca)
    may imply a potential to accumulate the chemically similar REE, but currently,
    there are no published studies in support of this hypothesis. La and Ce and ∑REE
    possible intake and risk through mushroom consumption Precise data on mushroom
    consumption in different countries is generally unavailable and likely to be an
    approximation, if available, as this would be based on the production and sale
    of cultivated species. This is particularly true for areas where foraging of wild
    mushrooms is widely practiced. Consumption will also vary depending on personal
    tastes, growing conditions, and the abundance of particular species. Additionally,
    estimating dietary intake of contaminants or some nutrients from mushroom meals
    is difficult especially as mushrooms are very rarely eaten raw (fresh, untreated—as
    a delicacy) as in the case of Tricholoma matsutake. Household/culinary (or industrial
    for both farmed and wild species) processing such as blanching, boiling, blanching,
    and pickling, typically causes pronounced changes (usually a decrease) in the
    mineral and trace element concentrations of mushrooms (based on whole-weight,
    meal weight, or wet weight), depending on the species, the process, and the element
    (Svoboda et al. 2002; Drewnowska et al. 2017a and 2017b; Falandysz et al. 2019;
    Pankavec et al. 2019 and 2022). Other cooking methods such as frying, braising,
    grilling, and sometimes also pickling can lead to a small loss or even a slight
    concentration increase of an element in a mushroom meal compared to the raw product
    (on a whole/wet weight basis) (Manzi et al. 2004; Daillant et al. 2013; Falandysz
    et al. 2022a, 2022b and 2022d; Saba 2021). Further uncertainty in estimating dietary
    intake arises after consumption because gastrointestinal digestion and bioavailability
    of metallic elements from a mushroom meal are reported to be limited (Pankavec
    et al. 2023). It has been reported that some of the local population in the Yunnan
    (populated with 46.9 million people in 2022) province of China may consume up
    to 20–24 kg of wild mushrooms (raw product/fresh weight) per capita, annually
    (Zhang et al. 2010). An older study suggested that individuals in the UK could
    consume up to 26 kg (Barnett et al. 1999), which could be considered extreme.
    However, even if an extreme level of consumption is considered (e.g., 30 kg per
    individual per annum), the low occurrence levels of Ce and La, and ∑REE in unprocessed
    mushrooms, combined with the effects of culinary processing and limited gastrointestinal
    digestion and bioavailability (and thus bioaccessibility), would suggest very
    limited uptake. Thus, based on the current state of knowledge, there is no evidence
    of a human health risk through mushroom consumption, or from combined (including
    other foodstuffs and drinking water) exposure. Clearly, this view could change
    with new knowledge and insights into the toxicology of these elements, both collectively
    (the effects of mixtures) and individually, and also if there were concurrent
    increases in the REE occurrence levels in popular species. Given the expanding
    use of REE globally, such increases cannot be ruled out, and it would be prudent
    to initiate surveillance not only in edible mushrooms but also in other foods.
    Conclusions The occurrences of Ce, La, and summed REE that have been reported
    in the literature were assessed through the criteria of environmental geochemistry,
    analytical chemistry, food toxicology, mushroom systematics, and ecology. Based
    on the type of instrumentation used for measurement and the quality of the analytics
    used for determination, some data were excluded, particularly when the collective
    REE occurrence patterns deviated from those predicted by the Odo-Harkins order.
    The collated data shows that Ce and La accumulate similarly in fruiting bodies
    and are not fractionated during uptake, maintaining the original occurrence patterns
    of the substrates in which the fungi grew. There is also no credible evidence
    that the other REE undergo variable uptake because the evaluated data show natural,
    unfractionated patterns in accordance with the Oddo-Harkins’ order of environmental
    lanthanide occurrence. Ce and La were the first and the third most abundant lanthanides
    in wild and farmed mushrooms regardless of substrate, with Ce occurrence approximately
    double that of La. The species covered in this report also appear to bio-exclude
    REE. The fruit body concentrations were two to four orders of magnitude lower
    than the growing substrates (where reported). This is corroborated by the low
    values (ranging from 0.001 to below 1) of independently reported bioconcentration
    factors. There is scant information on the toxicological implications of dietary
    intake of REE, but the current state of knowledge provides no evidence that wild
    or cultivated mushrooms pose a health risk either by themselves or when included
    with the rest of the diet. However, given the growing and varied use of REE in
    commercial applications, it would be prudent to monitor REE concentrations in
    environmental and food-related matrices in the future. Data availability All data
    generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.

  description: Dense wintertime fog regularly impacts Delhi, severely affecting road

    (1961–2020) Article Open access 25 March 2021 Introduction The Indo-Gangetic plains
    (IGP) have the highest population density and growth rate in India. Fog formation
    in the IGP is very common during wintertime – every other day in Delhi – adversely
    affecting society and the economy through transport and health impacts1,2,3,4.
    Numerous studies have examined fog prediction over the IGP region using a variety
    of techniques including statistical methods5, numerical weather prediction (NWP)6,7,8,9,10
    and diagnostic approaches11,12. However, reliably accurate operational forecasts
    of fog events remain elusive. The majority of fog events over the IGP of northern
    India are seen in wintertime. A 71% increase in the number of fog days in winter
    has been observed in Delhi over the last three decades, from 38 fog days in the
    1980s to 65 in recent years13,14, the cause of which is unclear. Located within
    the IGP, the Indian capital city Delhi is the second most populated (22.7 million)
    and fastest-growing megacity in the world15. Delhi has been suffering severely
    from deteriorated air quality, with PM2.5 concentrations often far exceeding the
    safe limits set by the World Health Organisation as well as the national ambient
    air quality standards of India16,17, and this is associated with low visibility
    during wintertime13,14,18,19. Aerosols also play a role as cloud condensation
    nuclei and high aerosol concentrations can alter the fog’s microphysical and radiative
    properties. However, while aerosol induced haze is undoubtedly a common phenomenon
    in Delhi (and in the IGP in general), air pollution alone does not fully explain
    the observed trends in fog frequency20. An important alternative driver may be
    the rapid parallel increase in observed low-level humidity21, as evidenced for
    example at Safdarjung airport in Delhi where the December and January average
    dewpoint temperature increased from 7 °C in 1980 to 10.5 °C in 201922. We hypothesise
    that this dramatic increase in wintertime humidity is linked to the increased
    use of irrigation for agriculture in winter in the IGP region. Accurate prediction
    of fog using NWP models is a major challenge due to the complex feedbacks between
    many processes involving the land surface, boundary-layer mixing, cloud microphysics
    and cloud-aerosol interactions. These small-scale processes are parameterised
    in NWP and fog simulation is highly sensitive to these physical parameterisations8,9,23,24,25,26.
    In particular, the land surface and boundary-layer schemes are critical for accurately
    simulating fog onset24,27; while the microphysics scheme is pivotal for simulating
    fog development and dissipation23,24,28,29,30. Soil moisture is a key surface
    property. Higher soil moisture leads to greater evaporation and a moister boundary
    layer; while it also affects soil thermal conductivity, surface temperature and
    surface heat fluxes, all impacting on fog development25,27,31 and dissipation32.
    Multiple NWP models have systematic near-surface dry biases over the IGP during
    winter11,33,34. For example, there were dry biases over Delhi in an operational
    version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, resulting in missed
    fog events in the winters of 2016/17 and 2017/1833. This humidity bias was also
    present on days when fog events were simulated and contributed to errors in the
    onset time. Similarly, in the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM), dry biases are
    consistently present in wintertime simulations for Delhi on both clear and foggy
    days34. An initial soil moisture model bias could theoretically be corrected through
    improved data assimilation of satellite-derived soil moisture35,36. Such a correction
    could be achieved by taking a fraction of the satellite derived soil moisture
    anomaly from the monthly climatology and adding it to the model climatology37.
    However, model climatologies are currently too dry in the IGP, as they don’t include
    irrigation, and thus even after adjustment biases remain35. We hypothesise that
    the cause of this dry bias is a lack of irrigation being represented in these
    NWP models. Since the 1960s, India has seen the impact of the Green Revolution38
    partly through the adoption of modern crop varieties leading to enhanced yields39,40.
    The production of foodgrains, such as rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses,
    increased at an average rate of 2.5% per year between 1950 and 2007. Foodgrain
    production reached a record of 285.2 million tons in 2018-19 (Supplementary Fig.
    1); with India now the second largest producer of wheat worldwide41. This increase
    in agricultural production has not come from any major change in production area
    (Supplementary Fig. 1), but instead from the widespread adoption of a double-cropping
    system42, adding a winter season (Rabi; Nov-Feb) of primarily wheat to the traditional
    summer season (Kharif; Jun-Sep) of primarily rice. Winter is a very dry season
    in the northern plains of India43 (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e, f), so this has required
    a major expansion in irrigation (Fig. 1a, b), using groundwater and water canals,
    increasing from less than 20% of cropland in the 1960s to more than 45% in recent
    years44 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Zaveri and Lobell41 estimate that national Indian
    wheat yields in the 2000s were 13% higher than they would have been without this
    expansion in irrigation. Since the 1970s water use has increased in the winter
    months by 10 mm/month/decade or more in the north-western IGP (Fig. 1b shows January;
    Supplementary Fig. 2g, h, i show each winter month). Fig. 1: Irrigation and rainfall

    shown in black. Full size image The recent growth in extensive irrigation over
    the IGP has resulted in important changes in surface soil moisture, with noticeable
    increases over the north-western region45. Over India, additional soil moisture
    has been linked to an increase in evaporation (latent heat flux) and decreases
    in sensible heat fluxes and surface temperature, with consequent impacts on heat46,
    moist heat stress47,48 and precipitation49,50,51,52,53. As an example, Barton
    et al.54. found that a dry and warm bias exists in the Indian operational model
    during the monsoon period over the IGP which is collocated with the areas equipped
    for irrigation, concluding that an irrigation scheme is urgently needed. Nevertheless,
    all the above studies only consider the summer season. Wey et al.55 discussed
    the effects of wintertime irrigation in Northern India on monsoonal circulation.
    However, to the best of our knowledge there have been no previous assessments
    of the impacts of winter irrigation in India on fog. Given the dramatic increases
    in wintertime irrigation and fog frequency in northern India over recent decades,
    we hypothesise that irrigation practices in winter have decisively contributed
    to the observed increased fog frequency and thus need to be accounted for in NWP
    models in a realistic way. To examine this hypothesis we present, for the first
    time, simulations of fog events with and without irrigation represented in a state-of-the-art
    NWP model (the Met Office Unified Model, MetUM) in its configuration for the IGP
    region (the Delhi Research Unified Model, DRUM) and compare against observations.
    Irrigation is represented realistically - with an appropriate amount of water
    added to the model’s soil moisture in areas that we know are irrigated in the
    winter season (Fig. 1d); experimental details and data sets are described in the
    Methods section. Results Observed trends To demonstrate the increasing importance
    of irrigation, we examine the trends in irrigation and rainfall over the IGP in
    January over the 1972–2010 period (Fig. 1b, c). There is a large and significant
    positive trend in irrigation water use over the north-west region, especially
    over central and eastern Punjab, northern Rajasthan, and western Haryana (Fig.
    1b). This area represents a heavily irrigated region for the Rabi crop season
    during winter (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). In contrast, the magnitudes
    of winter season rainfall (Supplementary Fig. 2d–f) and rainfall trends (Fig.
    1c) are relatively small for this dry season. Model results To investigate the
    impact of irrigation effects on fog formation over the Delhi region, a comparison
    of model sensitivity experiments is presented. Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution
    of deep fog obtained from the INSAT-3D satellite fog/low cloud product and from
    irrigated and non-irrigated model simulations respectively for the first fog event:
    at 18Z 21st January 2016 (development stage), and 00Z (mature stage) and 06Z (dissipation
    stage) on 22nd January 2016. Observations indicate widespread optically thick
    (deep) fog occurrence during the development (Fig. 2a) and mature stages (Fig.
    2b), with the fog beginning to dissipate in the south-east during the dissipation
    stage (Fig. 2c). The irrigated simulation captures the deep fog distribution well
    (Fig. 2d, e); in contrast to the non-irrigated simulation which only simulates
    less widespread shallow fog which dissipates too early (Fig. 2g–i). The irrigated
    simulation is successful in simulating the occurrence, extent and depth of the
    fog over the central and north-western parts of the domain, but not over the south-eastern
    region of the IGP. Fig. 2: Spatial distribution of fog during the first fog event.
    Panels show shallow fog, deep fog and low cloud at the development stage 18Z 21
    January (left), mature stage 00Z 22 January (centre) and dissipation stage 06Z
    22 January 2016. The rows show observations from INSAT-3D (a–c); then irrigated
    (d–f) and non-irrigated (g–i) model output. Full size image To examine how irrigation-effects
    are manifest, we analyse maps of specific humidity and wind for the same stages
    of this fog event to ascertain the impact of moisture advection from irrigated
    to non-irrigated regions (Fig. 3). The near-surface atmosphere is more humid,
    by typically 1 g/kg, across the majority of the IGP region. The winds are generally
    light (<5 m/s) and north-westerly over Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi,
    (typical at this time of year as a result of the subtropical westerly jet over
    northern India and channelling by the Himalayas to the north) so advect moisture
    from areas of irrigation in the NW of the domain (see Fig. 1d) over the partly
    non-irrigated region of Uttar Pradesh, resulting in an increase in humidity there
    too. The increase in specific humidity in the irrigated compared to non-irrigated
    simulation is evident in all fog stages (development, mature and dissipation);
    i.e., after 18, 24 and 30 h of simulation time. The increased near-surface humidity
    is driven by increased latent heat flux over the irrigated area (not shown) resulting
    from the increase in available soil moisture to evaporate. The increase in latent
    heat flux is balanced by a decrease in the sensible heat flux compared to simulations
    without irrigation. The marked increase in moisture downstream of the irrigated
    area demonstrates a clear non-local impact, illustrating that non-irrigated urban
    areas such as Delhi can be affected by the advection of additional moisture from
    irrigated areas. Fig. 3: Spatial distribution of near-surface moisture and winds.
    Panels show 5 m specific humidity (g/kg, shaded) and 10 m winds (m/s, vectors)
    from the irrigated (a–c) and non-irrigated (d–f) model experiments at 18Z 21 January,
    and 00Z, and 06Z on 22nd January 2016 over the IGP region. The time steps represent
    the developing (18Z), mature (00Z) and dissipation stages (06Z) as Fig. 2. The
    scale arrow is 5 m/s. Full size image We have also compared model output against
    WiFEX (Winter Fog Experiment) measurements recorded at IGI-Airport, Delhi14,56(Fig.
    4). The irrigated simulation captures the observed diurnal changes in visibility,
    relative humidity, and downwelling long-wave (LWD) radiation considerably better
    than the non-irrigated simulation, implying that more accurately capturing the
    near-surface humidity is leading to a denser and optically thicker fog that is
    more consistent with the visibility and LWD observations. This pattern is also
    broadly reproduced for the two subsequent fog events of the 23rd and 24th January
    2016; the visibility and relative humidity are notably more accurate, and the
    LWD is more accurate on the 24th. However, deficiencies in the simulations remain,
    with neither configuration able to reproduce the rapid reduction in visibility
    after sunset. We hypothesise that this is, in part, due to the simple urban land
    surface parameterisation used here, resulting in a ~1 K night-time temperature
    bias (not shown). Anurose et al.34 discuss urban parameterisations and fog. It
    is important to note that visibility is a derived diagnostic (rather than a prognostic
    model variable) and depends on an assumed aerosol size and mass appropriate for
    Delhi as well as on humidity. Improvements to the visibility diagnostic from the
    MetUM are currently being trialled and this could potentially further improve
    the relationship between aerosol, fog, and visibility in the MetUM. Fig. 4: Evolution
    of three fog events in Delhi. The time series show visibility (Vis, m; a), relative
    humidity (RH, %; b) and downwelling long-wave radiation (LWD, Wm−2; c) observations
    (black) and model output from non-irrigated (solid lines), and irrigated (dashed
    lines) configurations during 22-24 January 2016 at IGI-Airport, Delhi. The blue,
    red, and aqua colours denote simulations starting at 00 UTC on the 21, 22 and
    23 January respectively. Full size image We have also compared model output to
    meteorological observations at various locations within the model domain (shown
    in Fig. 1d). Generally, the irrigated simulations have a higher relative humidity
    than the non-irrigated simulations that is in better agreement with the observations
    (Fig. 5). The impact is largest at the BRL, HSR, PTL and DEL sites, locations
    close to or within the irrigated area; and is smaller at GWL and DHD, further
    away from the irrigated area. Although, these locations can also be impacted by
    the additional moisture advection, e.g., DHD on the 22nd January 2016 (Fig. 5),
    leading to fog (Fig. 2). These improvements in relative humidity in the irrigated
    model simulations translate to improvements in visibility (Supplementary Fig.
    3). However model deficiencies remain, for example at GWL and BRL, located to
    the east of the domain, and the improvement in relative humidity is insufficient
    to reach saturation and produce fog (Fig. 2). Fig. 5: Evolution of three fog events
    at other locations. The time series show relative humidity (RH, %) from observations
    (black) and model output from non-irrigated (solid lines) and irrigated (dashed
    lines) configurations during 22-24 January 2016 (as Fig. 4). Results are shown
    for (a) Bareilly (BRL), (b) Dehradun (DHD), (c) Hissar (HSR), (d) Delhi (DEL),
    (e) Patiala (PTL) and (f) Gwalior (GWL). Full size image In short, we have shown
    that adding soil moisture due to irrigation into an NWP model improves the simulated
    near-surface humidity, resulting in improvements to the spatial distribution,
    evolution and optical depth of fog and, consequently, visibility. Discussion We
    have demonstrated that additional soil moisture due to irrigation has a major
    impact on the simulation of dense fog events over northern India (including Delhi).
    Winter season irrigation of the IGP increased between 1972 and 2010 (Fig. 1b)
    and continues to increase57. This irrigation increase has been accompanied by
    an increase in humidity and fog frequency13,21,22. In our irrigated simulations,
    we have observed an improved representation of fog development in comparison to
    satellite and in situ observations. These experiments highlight important processes
    driving widespread fog in northern India and point to the importance of representing
    irrigation in models. Although our work has focused on a three-day period, these
    fog events are representative of other fog events in terms of density and duration
    at the WiFEX site14 and spatial extent as observed by INSAT-3D56. Additionally,
    the model’s dry bias over this period is consistent with other events, both foggy
    and clear days34. Our conclusions regarding the model performance and the impact
    of representing irrigation can thus be likely extended to other wintertime fog
    events. Most of the northern plains of India (IGP region) are irrigated cropland.
    When irrigated, the additional moisture, and consequent changes to the surface
    energy budget, result in the advection of moisture into Delhi and beyond and cause
    widespread dense fog to develop earlier and be more persistent in these cases.
    Representing irrigation leads to improved simulations of relative humidity, countering
    a dry bias typically seen in model simulations for this region34, and consequently
    improves the simulation of fog, low cloud and visibility; it leads to a better
    spatial distribution of fog across the IGP when compared to INSAT-3D satellite
    observations and surface visibility observations. These events clearly show that
    irrigation can be highly important for the formation of dense fog. Previous studies
    have speculated that irrigation could play a role in the observed increased frequency
    of fog in the IGP18,58 but without evidencing a clear cause and effect. We have
    demonstrated the decisive role irrigation may play in the frequent and increasing
    occurrence of widespread fog events over the IGP. Further work is needed to develop
    a methodology which can realistically simulate the irrigation process in operational
    NWP models. This could involve an improved soil moisture data assimilation system
    (overcoming existing challenges35,37,51), a smart irrigation parameterisation
    which includes spatial and temporal variations in irrigation practice or a hybrid
    approach. While inclusion of wintertime irrigation in our simulations leads to
    a substantial improvement in fog prediction, it does not solve all of the problems.
    Fog forms as a result of complex interactions between the land surface, the meteorology,
    and the aerosol and cloud microphysics. Further work is still needed to address
    deficiencies in representing these processes including the accurate representation
    of urban areas34,59, aerosol sources and chemistry8 and aerosol microphysics30.
    Nonetheless, including irrigation in NWP models offers the potential for a step
    change improvement in fog forecasting accuracy over northern India in winter.
    Methods Environmental data WiFEX data The Winter Fog Experiment (WiFEX) took place
    over consecutive winters between 2015 and 2020 at the Indira Gandhi International
    Airport (IGI-Airport, Palam) in New Delhi14,56. WiFEX has included measurement
    campaigns of more than 90 dense fog events, using a wide array of instrumentation,
    supporting fog characterisation and modelling studies. Here we use the WiFEX automatic
    weather station and radiation flux measurements in the evaluation of our model
    experiments of a dense fog case study which occurred over the period 21st–24th
    January 2016. Each day the fog dissipated and reformed overnight. The number of
    hours with visibility below 1 km ranged from 15 to 18 h and below 50 m ranged
    from 3 to 8 h, typical of the duration of fog events during WiFEX. Gridded rainfall
    dataset The daily gridded rainfall dataset for India described by Pai et al.43
    has a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and is based on observations from 6955
    rain-gauge stations. It is used for the climatological and event assessment of
    wintertime rainfall. Satellite Fog/low cloud product We use the Fog/low-cloud
    satellite (INSAT-3D) product available from the Meteorological and Oceanographic
    Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC) which is a Data Centre of the Space Applications
    Centre for satellite data under the Indian Space Research Organisation. The INSAT
    product has been successfully verified against surface observations60,61 and provides
    a powerful tool for model validation with high temporal (30 min) and spatial resolution
    (4 km). Each pixel is tagged as either fog or no fog. The night time fog/low-cloud
    product uses a commonly used algorithm62,63 based on a threshold of the brightness
    temperature difference between two spectral channels (mid wave infrared and thermal
    infrared). The night-time method has difficulty detecting optically thin fogs62,64
    and thus we refer to the satellite as measuring deep fog and compare it to the
    model’s simulation of deep fog. The daytime product uses the visible channel reflectance
    and thermal infrared brightness temperature65 and so has better sensitivity to
    optically thin fog. Note the night-time product is used at 18Z and 00Z and the
    daytime for 06Z. We use the ‘Very Low Cloud’ (cloud below 111 m) and ‘Low Cloud’
    (cloud between 111 m and 1949 m) output of our model experiments to identify where
    fog occurs and compare against the Fog/low-cloud satellite (INSAT-3D) product.
    We refer to a modelled ‘Very Low Cloud’ fraction above 0 alone as shallow fog,
    both a ‘Very Low Cloud’ fraction and a ‘Low Cloud’ fraction above 0 as deep fog
    and a ‘Low Cloud’ fraction above 0 without any ‘Very Low Cloud’ as low cloud.
    Meteorological (SYNOP) measurements We compare the spatial variation of our modelled
    visibility and relative humidity against surface measurement data recorded at
    the following airports in the northern India surface synoptic (SYNOP) network:
    Delhi Safdarjung (DEL), Bareilly (BRL), Dehradun (DHD), Patiala (PTL), Gwalior
    (GWL) and Hisar (HSR) (see Fig. 1d for locations). Irrigation water use datasets
    We base the design of our model experiments with irrigation represented on the
    global irrigation water use dataset (0.5° × 0.5°) described by Huang et al.66.
    derived using the Hanasaki et al. 67 method. We use the most recent January data
    from this dataset, from January 2010. Data for 1972–2010 were also used to assess
    trends in winter irrigation over the IGP. This dataset was based on the Food and
    Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations global information system on water
    and agriculture, United States Geological Survey estimates and simulated global
    hydrological models. These data are used to give the seasonality in irrigation
    which is unavailable in other more recent datasets. Land cover data In order to
    realistically simulate the spatial distribution of irrigation we use the European
    Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover project’s land cover data
    at 300 m spatial resolution for 2016 to restrict irrigation to the ‘irrigated
    cropland’ land cover class (Supplementary Fig. 4). Modelled irrigation sensitivity
    experiments To investigate the impact that irrigation has on fog formation, intensity
    and persistence, a set of irrigated and non-irrigated model sensitivity experiments
    were performed for the 21st–24th January 2016 events using the recently developed
    Delhi Research Unified Model (DRUM). DRUM is a regional research version of the
    Met Office Unified Model (MetUM), that uses the regional atmosphere tropical configuration
    version 2 (RA2T)68, and the same domains as the Delhi model developed for operational
    fog forecasts at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF)69.
    The DRUM is a limited area model (with a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km in this
    study), nested in a global 17 km resolution model using the Global Atmosphere
    6.1 (GA6.1) configuration70, with a domain covering the IGP region including the
    highly irrigated areas to the NW of Delhi (Fig. 1a). Each simulation is initialised
    at 00Z and runs for 36 h consistent with the operational version of the model69.
    The initial conditions are derived from the global model’s analysis, which includes
    soil moisture data assimilation37. To determine the irrigated area, we combine
    the irrigation water use and land cover datasets. While the land cover dataset
    has high spatial resolution (300 m), it does not provide any seasonal irrigation
    information. On the other hand, the global irrigation water use dataset is monthly
    but at a lower spatial resolution (0.5° × 0.5°). We define a realistic agricultural
    irrigation area for the winter months (Fig. 1d) by convoluting land areas classed
    as “irrigated cropland” (Supplementary Fig. 4) with areas with irrigated water
    use of over 5 mm in January (Fig. 1a). For these irrigated areas, the initial
    soil moisture in the MetUM is increased to become the saturated soil moisture
    content for sand (38.3 kg m−2) following a similar approach to Fletcher et al.52.
    This corresponds to an additional 20–25 mm of water, which is consistent with
    flood irrigation practice in the region (Prof B Lankford 2023, personal communication,
    16 May). The soil moisture is then left to evolve normally during the simulation.
    In short, we believe our representation of irrigation, by saturating the model’s
    soil moisture initial conditions, is a physically reasonable approach that introduces
    a realistic amount of moisture into the model simulation (~25% of the monthly
    irrigation total; Fig. 1a) in the known irrigated cropland areas (Fig. 1d). In
    this study, we use this relatively simple approach to assess the potential impact
    of irrigation and justify the need to include it in model simulations of fog events.
    The development of a more sophisticated approach to irrigation, which could be
    used operationally, is underway. Data availability WiFEX campaign data are stored

  description: Climate change is a threat to sustainable livestock production and
    livelihoods in the tropics. It has adverse impacts on feed and water availability,
    disease prevalence, production, environmental temperature, and biodiversity. Unravelling
    the drivers of local adaptation and understanding the underlying genetic variation
    in random mating indigenous livestock populations informs the design of genetic
    improvement programmes that aim to increase productivity and resilience. In the
    present study, we combined environmental, genomic, and phenotypic information
    of Ethiopian indigenous chickens to investigate their environmental adaptability.
    Through a hybrid sampling strategy, we captured wide biological and ecological
    variabilities across the country. Our environmental dataset comprised mean values
    of 34 climatic, vegetation and soil variables collected over a thirty-year period
    for 260 geolocations. Our biological dataset included whole genome sequences and
    quantitative measurements (on eight traits) from 513 individuals, representing
    26 chicken populations spread along 4 elevational gradients (6–7 populations per
    gradient). We performed signatures of selection analyses (and XP-EHH) to detect
    footprints of natural selection, and redundancy analyses (RDA) to determine genotype-environment
    and genotype-phenotype-associations. RDA identified 1909 outlier SNPs linked with
    six environmental predictors, which have the highest contributions as ecological
    drivers of adaptive phenotypic variation. The same method detected 2430 outlier
    SNPs that are associated with five traits. A large overlap has been observed between
    signatures of selection identified byand XP-EHH showing that both methods target
    similar selective sweep regions. Average genetic differences measured by are low
    between gradients, but XP-EHH signals are the strongest between agroecologies.
    Genes in the calcium signalling pathway, those associated with the hypoxia-inducible
    factor (HIF) transcription factors, and sports performance (GALNTL6) are under
    selection in high-altitude populations. Our study underscores the relevance of
    landscape genomics as a powerful interdisciplinary approach to dissect adaptive
    phenotypic and genetic variation in random mating indigenous livestock populations.

    is a threat to sustainable livestock production and livelihoods in the tropics.
    It has adverse impacts on feed and water availability, disease prevalence, production,
    environmental temperature, and biodiversity. Unravelling the drivers of local
    adaptation and understanding the underlying genetic variation in random mating
    indigenous livestock populations informs the design of genetic improvement programmes
    that aim to increase productivity and resilience. In the present study, we combined
    environmental, genomic, and phenotypic information of Ethiopian indigenous chickens
    to investigate their environmental adaptability. Through a hybrid sampling strategy,
    we captured wide biological and ecological variabilities across the country. Our
    environmental dataset comprised mean values of 34 climatic, vegetation and soil
    variables collected over a thirty-year period for 260 geolocations. Our biological
    dataset included whole genome sequences and quantitative measurements (on eight
    traits) from 513 individuals, representing 26 chicken populations spread along
    4 elevational gradients (6–7 populations per gradient). We performed signatures
    of selection analyses ( and XP-EHH) to detect footprints of natural selection,
    and redundancy analyses (RDA) to determine genotype-environment and genotype-phenotype-associations.
    RDA identified 1909 outlier SNPs linked with six environmental predictors, which
    have the highest contributions as ecological drivers of adaptive phenotypic variation.
    The same method detected 2430 outlier SNPs that are associated with five traits.
    A large overlap has been observed between signatures of selection identified by
    and XP-EHH showing that both methods target similar selective sweep regions. Average
    genetic differences measured by are low between gradients, but XP-EHH signals
    are the strongest between agroecologies. Genes in the calcium signalling pathway,
    those associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors,
    and sports performance (GALNTL6) are under selection in high-altitude populations.
    Our study underscores the relevance of landscape genomics as a powerful interdisciplinary
    approach to dissect adaptive phenotypic and genetic variation in random mating
    indigenous livestock populations. Peer Review reports Background The genetics
    of local adaptation and climate resilience in livestock has become more relevant
    in the face of climate change [1,2,3,4]. Local adaptation refers to the response
    of individuals to differential selective pressure leading to higher genetic fitness
    in their environment than individuals from elsewhere [5, 6]. Resilient animals
    have the capacity to be minimally affected by environmental disturbances (e.g.,
    temperature stress, disease pressure, introduction to a new habitat) if they occur,
    or can return rapidly to the state pertained before exposure to the disturbance
    [7, 8]. Animals that combine high production potential with resilience to external
    stressors in a wide variety of environmental conditions are regarded as ‘robust’
    [9]. Phenotypic differentiation represents the fraction of phenotypic variance
    between populations over the total phenotypic variance and helps understand evolutionary
    processes shaping populations [10,11,12]. Environmental differences acting as
    a natural selective force can result in exceptionally strong genetic differentiation
    in genomic regions containing loci subjected to selection [13]. Phenotypic and
    genetic differentiation along environmental gradients, or across contrasting habitat
    types, can be indicative of local adaptation [6, 14, 15]. For instance, alleles
    providing adaptation to high elevation are found in high frequency in populations
    at high elevation but in low frequency in populations at low elevation in humans
    [16, 17], in chickens [16, 18, 19], in pigs [20, 21], and small ruminants [22].
    Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and local adaptation in
    livestock in response to environmental variation helps to enhance productivity
    and mitigate climate change [2, 23,24,25]. Randomly mating indigenous livestock
    populations are raised in stressful environmental conditions for many generations
    and harbour genomic regions conferring local adaptation that need to be exploited
    [26, 27]. Once identified, beneficial alleles/variants in indigenous chickens
    can be introduced into commercial chickens through breeding programmes [28, 29]
    or genome editing [30,31,32] to develop animals with desirable phenotypic attributes.
    The effects of environmental selective pressures as drivers of local adaptation
    and specially their influences on phenotypic and genetic differentiation in Ethiopian
    chicken populations have not been investigated enough to shape our understanding
    of environmental adaptation. Ethiopian indigenous chickens also called local,
    village, scavenging, backyard, or family chickens are widely adapted, random mating,
    nondescript domesticated chicken populations. They are managed in extensive (low-input)
    systems in their natural environment, without selective breeding programmes in
    place [33]. Ethiopia has one of the earliest evidences for chicken domestication
    and dispersal in Africa [34]. Ethiopian chickens are distributed in all agroecologies
    [33] and show substantial phenotypic and genetic diversity [35,36,37,38,39]. Large
    genetic diversity of present-day Ethiopian chicken populations might be attributed
    to their multiple waves of introduction into the country [40, 41] and the presence
    of highly diverse environment (e.g., climate, vegetation, elevation) [42]. As
    such, the country can be considered an ideal place for studying adaptive phenotypic
    and genetic variation in chickens. Certain phenotypes in Ethiopian indigenous
    chickens (e.g., comb shape, parasitic resistance) are related with local adaptation
    [26]. Genomic regions conferring adaptation to environmental challenges (e.g.,
    elevation, temperature, water scarcity, and feed availability) have been identified
    among African indigenous chickens [43,44,45]. Important insights on local adaptation
    of Ethiopian indigenous chickens were obtained in previous studies: the association
    between environmental predictors and phenotypic differentiation in quantitative
    traits was reported as an evidence for adaptative variation [46]. Another important
    study claimed that environmental conditions may have driven genomic variation
    in indigenous chicken populations [47]. At an interface between ecology and population
    genetics, landscape genomics provides an analytical framework useful to investigate
    the underlying evolutionary processes behind phenotypic and genetic differentiation
    of random mating populations raised in heterogenous environments. Landscape genomics
    seeks to understand the influences of geographic and environmental features on
    selectively neutral and adaptive loci, and underlying micro-evolutionary processes
    such as gene flow, selection, and genetic drift [48, 49]. Landscape genomic approaches
    were followed in studies of adaptive genetic variation in different farm animal
    species animals including chickens, sheep, goats, swine, and cattle [45, 50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57].
    Popular tools being used in landscape genomic studies include species distribution
    modelling, signatures of selection analyses, and genotype-environment analyses.
    Multivariate methods that simultaneously account for multiple drivers of phenotypic
    and environmental divergence, are recently being applied in landscape genomic
    studies to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with environment
    predictors [58,59,60,61] and with phenotypic variables [60, 62,63,64,65]. Species
    distribution models (SDMs), also known as environmental (ecological) niche models
    (ENMs) or habitat distribution models [66], use computer algorithms to analyse
    environmental data and to predict the distribution of a species across geographic
    space and time. SDMs are a popular tool in quantitative ecology because of their
    low data requirement, availability of many software packages and guidelines, and
    their higher predictive abilities [67, 68]. The central concept in SDMs is the
    niche theory [69, 70], which delineates the environment into fundamental and realized
    niches. In recent years, the conceptual framework for SDMs has been extended by
    livestock scientists and used to identify environmental predictors associated
    with habitat suitability and local adaptation [45, 46, 56, 71, 72]. Signatures
    of selection analysis are useful to identify regions of the genome that have differentiated
    between populations, possibly in response to selective pressure [73, 74]. Positive
    selection leaves conspicuous footprints or selective sweeps on the genome that
    can be detected using several approaches ranging from summary statistics such
    as Tajima’s D, to maximum likelihood and machine learning [75]. Cross-population
    Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (XP-EHH) detects differential selection between
    two populations [76]. Pairwise comparison of fixation index ( ) reveals differentiation
    of populations in different environments due to differences in evolutionary history
    [77]. and XP-EHH approaches are complementary to each other and lead to a more
    comprehensive understanding of signatures of selection. is more suited for detection
    of positive selection in the distant past [78] while XP-EHH is more useful for
    detection of entirely or approximately fixed loci [76]. Another statistical method
    that is being used in landscape genomics is Redundancy Analysis (RDA). RDA is
    useful to investigate association between genomic and environmental variability.
    RDA combines regression and principal component analysis (PCA) and it is an extremely
    powerful tool for ecologists to model multivariate response data [79, 80]. RDA
    determines how groups of loci covary in response to the multivariate environment,
    and can better detect processes that result in weak, multilocus molecular signatures
    relative to univariate tests [81]. It accounts for population structures, demographic
    histories, and polygenic interactions [59, 82]. Multivariate methods like RDA,
    that simultaneously account for multiple drivers of phenotypic and environmental
    divergence are being used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated
    with environment predictors [58,59,60,61]. Multivariate ordination methods such
    as RDA have outperformed mixed-model-based methods and machine learning-based
    methods (e.g., Random Forest) in detecting loci associated with environmental
    variation [59, 82]. Despite its ability to investigate genotype-phenotype associations
    RDA is mostly neglected in GWAS studies in livestock, while it became a standard
    in genotype-environment association studies in wildlife [62, 83]. In the present
    study we follow a landscape genomic approach to dissect adaptive genetic and phenotypic
    variation in Ethiopian indigenous chickens. We use SDMs to identify the most relevant
    environmental predictors driving local adaptation and produce habitat suitability
    maps. We perform signatures of selection analyses ( and XP-EHH) to detect genetic
    differentiation between populations and selective sweeps. RDA is applied to identify
    outlier SNPs associated with environmental and phenotypic variation. Together,
    we explain variations in the genome by using key environmental drivers and identify
    candidate genes and genomic regions linked with environmental adaptation in Ethiopian
    indigenous chickens. Materials and methods Sampling strategy Sampling design is
    a fundamental aspect of landscape genomic studies. As such, we implemented a robust
    sampling strategy, considering environmental gradation (e.g., elevational clines)
    and geographic (latitudinal and longitudinal) variation in the country [46] to
    avoid biases in discovery of genomic regions under selection. A hybrid strategy
    combines maximization of geographic distance (based on coordinates) and climatic
    distance between chosen sites. The landscape is divided into distinct environmental
    regions before choosing sites within each region that maximizes spatial distance
    [84]. A hybrid sampling strategy ensures environmental and geographic representativeness
    of sampling sites and increases statistical power by reducing false discovery
    rates of statistically significant loci in signatures of selections analysis and
    genome wide association studies [84,85,86]. The strategy also prevents the sampling
    of neighbouring sites with similar conditions and avoids the superposition between
    adaptive and neutral genetic variation [87]. The spatial distribution of our samples
    considered environmental (e.g., geography, climate) and biotic processes (e.g.,
    domestication, routes of introduction) influencing the chicken populations. A
    total of 513 chickens were sampled from four environmental gradients (gradient-I,
    -II, -III, and -IV) with a minimum distance between gradients of 500 km. Environmental
    or ecological gradients refer to gradual changes in abiotic environmental factors
    (such as elevation, temperature, soil, vegetation, and precipitation) with consequences
    on the species’ distribution and local adaptation [88]. Gradient-I stretches from
    the Rift valley lowlands of northeastern Ethiopia along the territories of Afar
    region to the highlands of Wollo province within Amhara region. Gradient-II, starts
    from the Rift valley lowlands in central Ethiopia, crosses the highlands of Hararghe,
    including Mount Gara Muleta, and stretches to eastern Ethiopia within Oromia region.
    Gradient-III stretches from the highlands of northwestern Ethiopia and goes down
    to the lowlands along the Ethiopian-Sudanese border within Benishangul-Gumuz region.
    Gradient-IV extends from the highlands of western Ethiopia in Oromia region to
    the lowlands along the Ethiopian-Kenyan border in Southern region. Areas around
    the national borders of Ethiopia have low elevation, which gradually culminates
    to highland plateau in the center of the country creating a striking contrast
    in agroecology. Each gradient comprised three environmental clusters or agroecologies,
    primarily delineated based on elevation in meters above sea level (m.a.s.l). These
    are lowland (400–1800 m.a.s.l); midaltitude/midland (1800–2400 m.a.s.l.); and
    highland (2400–3500 m.a.s.l.) according to the conventional agroecological classification
    in Ethiopia [89, 90]. Clusters within a gradient were distant by at least 100
    km and farmers keeping target chicken populations within a cluster visited separate
    livestock markets. Each cluster along the spatial gradient constituted of 2–3
    populations. In the context of the present study, a population of Ethiopian indigenous
    chickens refers to individuals that are kept within a specific geographic area
    (at village level) and which are assumed to be similarly influenced by environmental
    (ecological) and socio-economic factors. A village (kebele) is the smallest administrative
    unit in Ethiopia. The metadata of 513 individual samples representing 26 chicken
    populations is presented in Supplementary Table 1 The topographic map of Ethiopia
    showing the Ethiopian indigenous sample populations and their environmental gradients
    is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Topographic map of Ethiopia depicting the 26 Ethiopian
    indigenous chicken sample populations and their environmental gradients. Range
    of numbers with different colours in the legend indicate elevation (m.a.s.l.)
    Full size image The chicken populations from different geographies of Ethiopia
    may be the result of different evolutionary histories. We controlled for the potential
    confounding effects between demographic processes (e.g., domestication history,
    migration) and adaptive variation in our analysis by performing signatures of
    selection analyses at three different analytical layers (layer-I, layer-II, and
    layer-III). Figure 2 shows the sampling and analytical framework used in the present
    study. Fig. 2 Sampling and analytical framework in landscape genomics study to
    detect adaptive phenotypic and genetic variation in Ethiopian indigenous chicken
    populations LL = lowland; MA = midaltitude; and HL = highland. Adaptive loci are
    the result of natural selection and contribute to fitness while neutral loci are
    due to other evolutionary process (e.g., gene flow, genetic drift, demographic
    history) Full size image Environmental data For every population, a single geographic
    coordinate was taken at the center of the village during sampling of chickens.
    Coordinates from nine additional grids (1.44km2), covering a total of 12.96 km2,
    were then drawn around a recorded location and extracted using Google Earth Pro
    v 7.3.2 to ensure high representation of environmental variability affecting the
    population. The total number of ‘presence’ or ‘occurrence’ points used in SDMs
    for the 26 sample populations comprised 260 coordinates. Out of 34 environmental
    predictors, 9 predictors identified through SDMs for their association with habitat
    suitability and adaptive evolution of chickens in Ethiopia [46] were included
    in the present study for genotype-environment association analysis with RDA. The
    9 predictors are isothermality, temperature seasonality, mean temperature of the
    coldest quarter, precipitation of the warmest quarter, precipitation of the coldest
    quarter, solar radiation of the month of May, water vapour pressure of the month
    of May, water vapour pressure of the month of August, and soil clay content (Supplementary
    Table 2). Values for bioclimatic variables (temperature, precipitation, soil radiation,
    and water vapour pressure) in different seasons were obtained from WorldClim database
    (http://www.worldclim.org/; version 2) at a spatial resolution of 30 s (~1 km2)
    [91] based on mean values of 30 years (1970–2000). Additionally, considering the
    importance of elevation in the conventional definition of agroecologies in Ethiopia
    [33], its link with certain adaptive traits in chickens [92], and our sampling
    design that takes into account elevational clines, we incorporated elevation as
    a tenth environmental predictor. All the ten predictors were used to produce habitat
    suitability maps for the 26 sample chicken populations with MaxEnt computer algorithm
    (version 3.4.1) [93]. Configuration of model parameters for MaxEnt was set based
    on a previous study [46]. Quantitative trait data Collection of phenotypic data
    was performed on adult chickens (about 20 chickens sampled from each of the 26
    villages). These chickens were selected randomly by walking along a defined path
    (transect) across an adminstative village and sampling one chicken from each farming
    household until a total of 15 hens and 5 cocks (roosters) were measured. The age
    of the chickens was estimated by interviewing owners to confirm that females were
    in their second clutch (7 to 8 months-of-age) and males were above 12 months-of-age.
    The researchers also visually appraised roosters for the presence of well-developed
    spurs. To minimize the risk of inbreeding, one chicken was sampled per household.
    Under rare circumstances (n = 9), two chickens were sampled per household when
    farmers expressed that their animals have no family relationship, for instance
    when they were obtained from different sources (e.g., one is hatched at home while
    the other was bought from the market). 19 quantitative traits were initially measured
    on each of the 513 adult chickens. Out of these 19 quantitative traits, we used
    the five traits identified by [46] for their putative roles in local adaptation
    and usefulness in phenotypic classification of Ethiopian chicken populations (Supplementary
    Table 3). These are live body weight, beak length, comb width, wattle width, and
    earlobe width. Live body weight (total mass of an individual in grams before slaughter)
    was taken using a digital scale in the morning when the animal was fasting i.e.,
    before it was released to scavenge in the backyard. The phenotypic measurements
    for the other traits were read from pictures of individual chickens and analysed
    using ImageJ software (version 1.52a) [94]. To reduce systematic error, the same
    operator measured all chickens, which were held in the same position by a technician.
    A steel ruler was placed in every picture as a distance reference. Blood sampling
    Whole blood samples were taken from the wing vein of individual chickens in line
    with standard procedures [95]. A volume of 50–250 µl of whole blood with anticoagulant
    (K2EDTA) per sample was put into a cryo-tube filled with 1.5 ml absolute ethanol
    (100%). Samples were preserved at -200C until DNA extraction and processing. Whole
    genome sequence and data processing WGS data was generated on Illumina HiSeq2000
    platform in paired-end mode with a read length of 150 bp. Reads were quality trimmed
    using Trimmomatic (Version 0.39) (ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3
    TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36) [96]. The average depth of coverage was
    8.63 (range: 5.47–14.12) with an average mapping rate of 99.2% (97.05–99.6) and
    a mapping quality of 33.6 (28.77–34.45) to the GRCg6a reference assembly (Ensemble
    Gallus_gallus.GRCg6a.dna.toplevel.fa). Genomic analysis was performed on autosomes
    and non-autosomes. Freebayes variant calling was run on processed bam files (alignment
    data) to generate VCF file with the following setting: min-base-quality 10 --min-alternate-fraction
    0.2 --haplotype-length 0 --ploidy 2 --min-alternate-count 2 [97]. The ‘min-base-quality
    10’ specifies the minimum base quality required for a base to be considered during
    variant calling. The ‘min-alternate-fraction 0.2’ sets the minimum fraction of
    reads to 20% supporting the alternate allele for a variant to be called. The ‘haplotype-length
    0’ disables the haplotype extension feature, ensuring that all reads are considered
    independently during variant calling. The ’ploidy 2’ defines the ploidy of the
    organism being analysed, with a value of 2 indicating diploid. The ‘min-alternate-count
    2’ establishes a minimum number of 2 observations supporting an alternate allele
    required for a variant to be called. Post processing was performed in BCFtools
    [98] using vcffilter module of with the setting‘-f ‘QUAL > 20’’. SNPs with low
    phred quality score (< 20), low call rate (< 0.7), and those within 3 bp of an
    insertion-deletion (indel) were discarded. Filtering of genotypes was performed
    [99] prior to downstream analyses to improve data quality. Genotypes were filtered
    for SNPs not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 5 × 10− 6), with minor allele
    frequency (MAF) < 5%. After applying stringent quality filtration on genomes of
    513 individuals, we used a clean dataset of 25 M (autosomal and non-autosomal
    SNPs) from 466 individuals for all downstream analyses (see Materials and Methods).
    Information on genome coverage, mapping rate and quality of samples is presented
    in Supplementary Table 4. Population structure analysis PCA was performed using
    the Eigenstrat method, with the smartpca function from Eigensoft v 6.1.4 software
    [100, 101] to understand the structure of the 26 populations. The VCF files containing
    the found variants were converted to the eigenstrat format with a python script
    (https://github.com/CarolinaPB/Bioinfo_scripts/blob/main/vcf2eigenstrat.py). Signatures
    of selection analysis (SSA) The search for signals of positive selection ( or
    XP-EHH) was carried out on SNP data (n = 25 M) that were obtained from WGS after
    stringent quality filtering. Haplotypes were phased using FastPhase software [102]
    prior to signatures of selection analyses. To identify candidate loci and genomic
    regions linked with local adaptation, we performed signatures of selection analyses
    ( and XP-EHH) at three different analytical layers (Fig. 2). In layer-I, we classified
    the indigenous chicken populations into four gradients (without regard to their
    agroecologies) and analysed them to detect genetic differentiation between them.
    The populations across gradients (-I, -III, and -IV) were then categorized by
    agroecology and analysed (lowland, midaltitude, and highland) in layer-II. Chickens
    have a complex history of introduction and dispersal in Africa at large and in
    Ethiopia in particular through multiple maritime and/or terrestrial routes [40].
    Considering the geographic closeness of gradient-II to the Arabian Peninsula,
    we analysed populations from this gradient (layer-III) separately by agroecology
    (lowland, midaltitude, and highland) to account for possible differences in evolutionary
    processes from the other three gradients. Fixation test ( ) analysis was conducted
    using VCFtools v0.1.16, [103], to identify regions of increased genomic differentiation
    between the classifications defined in the analytical layers. value of 0 indicates
    no differentiation between populations while a value of 1 indicates complete differentiation.
    Previous works in diverse species including chicken suggest that sliding-window
    analyses between 20 kb (with 10 kb overlap) and 400 kb (with 200 kb overlap) have
    considerable power to detect changes in allele frequencies and genomic regions
    with significant divergence between populations in signatures of selection analysis
    [104, 105]. We calculated the average values with overlapping windows of 50 kb
    (25 kb overlapping). We calculated the average XP-EHH values for the classifications
    defined in each of the analytical layers. Analysis of genomic regions with signs
    of recent positive selection with XP-EHH was based on the concept of extended
    haplotype homozygosity (EHH) [76, 106] and was performed on phased haplotypes
    using R package rehh (Version 3.2.2) [107]. First, the data2haplohh function was
    used to convert the VCF files to a suitable format to be used to compute XP-EHH.
    Then, XP-EHH was calculated with the ies2xpehh function from the same package.
    The same size of overlapping bins (50 kb) was used for XP-EHH analysis to allow
    comparison with First, the average ( or XP-EHH) values for all bins in each pairwise
    comparison in an analytical layer were sorted on their significance. Empirical
    p-values were calculated for both and XP-EHH by ranking the windows based on each
    metric and dividing the rank by the total number of windows. The same approach
    was used by a previous study on Ethiopian chickens [45]. Only the 1% most significant
    windows (p < 0.01 or XP-EHH) were retained as significant. Significant windows
    which were commonly identified by the two methods were counted as overlapping.
    Pathway enrichment analysis We used ShinyGO with chicken as background to perform
    pathway enrichment analysis and identify genes that are under selection in specific
    agroecologies [108]. Association analyses Association analyses in RDA were performed
    with the R package ‘vegan’ using RDA function [109] to identify environmental
    predictors and quantitative traits associated with genomic variation. RDA is a
    multivariate multiple regression followed by a PCA of the table of fitted values
    and presents relationships between variables in two-dimensional space using ordination
    plots [80, 110, 111]. Environmental predictors and quantitative traits were analysed
    separately according to [112]. RDA was performed using a set of genome-wide LD-pruned
    SNPs to keep a subset of SNPs that are nearly uncorrelated with each other and
    keep a subset of markers that are in approximate linkage equilibrium. Pruning
    of genotypes for high LD reduces redundant loci and improves efficiency of models
    in association analysis [113]. The cleaned dataset with 25 M SNPs filtered for
    SNPs not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 5 × 10− 6) and MAF < 5%, was LD pruned
    using PLINK [114]. We used the following setting for pruning: plink2 --vcf --set-all-var-ids
    @:# --chr-set 38 --allow-extra-chr --indep-pairwise 100 10 0.5 --maf 0.05 --recode
    vcf-iid --out --indep-pairwise. The ‘100 10 0.5’ instructs PLINK to perform LD
    pruning by evaluating LD in sliding windows of 100 variants, removing variants
    within each window if more than 10 are correlated, and considering variants to
    be correlated if their LD correlation (r2) exceeds 0.5. The ‘--recode vcf-iid’
    modifier produces sample IDs in the last header row of VCF file. The LD pruning
    resulted in a subset of markers comprising 1,070,305 SNPs from 466 individuals,
    which was large enough for RDA. The dataset was structured as a matrix of 466
    chickens by ~ 1 million SNP markers. Genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis
    with RDA Correlated predictors cause problems for regression-based models like
    RDA and variable reduction was done when correlation coefficients between ecological
    predictors exceeded and an acceptable threshold (r >|0.7|) [115]. We fitted partial
    RDA with the 10 selected environmental predictors conditioned on (i.e., controlling
    for the effects of) geography as explanatory variables and the genetic dataset
    as response variable [81]. SNPs exhibiting RDA loadings greater than 3.5 standard
    deviations (two-tailed p-value = 0.0005) from the mean were identified as selection
    signals This threshold is very conservative and helps to identify loci under strong
    selection (i.e., minimizes false positive rates) [59]. After a visual inspection
    of the scree plots, we extracted SNP loadings from the first three canonical axes.
    Genotype-phenotype association analysis with RDA We fitted partial RDA with the
    five least correlated and most explanatory quantitative traits selected by correlation
    analysis. The RDA were fitted with the quantitative traits as explanatory variables,
    conditioned on geography, and the genetic dataset as response variable. SNPs exhibiting
    RDA loadings greater than three and half standard deviations from the mean were
    identified as association signals [59]. After a visual inspection of the scree
    plots, we extracted SNP loadings from the first three canonical axes. Results
    Habitat suitability The suitability of an environmental niche for a population
    depends on which environmental predictors are influencing the species. The habitat
    suitability maps produced by SDMs suggests that the 26 populations have different
    niches (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Habitat suitability maps of the 26 Ethiopian chicken populations.
    Colours towards red spectrum indicate more suitable conditions Full size image
    Genomic diversity of Ethiopian indigenous chickens PCA based on the filtered variants
    provides information on the structure and relatedness of the 26 Ethiopian indigenous
    chicken sample populations (Figs. 4, 5 and 6). The PCA shows no clear separation
    among populations (n = 20) sampled from gradient-I, III, and gradient-IV, while
    populations (n = 6) sampled from gradient-II have distinctly separated from the
    other three gradients (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 PCA plots of 26 Ethiopian indigenous chickens
    by population based on 25 million autosomal SNPs Full size image The PCA based
    on gradients (Fig. 5) illustrates clear separation between chickens sampled from
    gradient-II and the other three gradients. Admixture is seen between gradients-I
    and -IV, and between gradients-III and -IV. Fig. 5 PCA plots of 26 Ethiopian indigenous
    chickens by gradient based on 25 million autosomal SNPs Full size image Chicken
    populations sampled from the three agroecologies (lowland, midlatitude, and highland)
    did not clearly differentiate except in gradient-II where populations sampled
    from the lowlands were distinct from those sampled from the midlands and highlands
    of the same gradient (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 PCA plots of 26 Ethiopian indigenous chickens
    by agroecology based on 25 million autosomal SNPs Full size image After carefully
    looking at the three PCA plots and understanding the genetic structure (Figs.
    4, 5 and 6) of Ethiopian chickens, we decided that the sampled populations from
    gradient-II should not be analysed together with populations from the other three
    gradients. Signatures of selection for environmental adaptation Genetic differentiation
    between gradients The mean values between any two gradients was low (Table 1).
    This suggests that genetic differentiation between geographies among Ethiopian
    indigenous chicken populations is very little. A complete list of significant
    genes (p < 0.01) from overlapping windows jointly identified by and XP-EHH in
    each gradient-wise comparisons is presented in Supplementary Table 5. Table 1

    Some regions of the genome show genetic differentiation across gradients. Genetic
    differentiation between agroecologies across gradients The mean values between
    any two agroecologies across gradients was lower than values obtained for comparisons
    between any two gradients (Table 2). The Manhattan plots on and their scores for
    comparisons across agroecologies (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 6)
    show very low values across the genome. The scores for comparisons between agroecologies
    within gradient-II(Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 6) are relatively
    higher than between agroecologies across gradients, owing to differences in genetic
    background evidenced by the population structure analysis, Figs. 4, 5 and 6. Table

    Full size table Selection signatures between agroecologies across gradients We
    performed XP-EHH analysis to identify genomic loci associated with high-altitude
    adaptation. Figure 7 shows the most significant selective sweeps for highland
    vs. lowland populations. All SNPs with a -log (p-value) above 2 or below − 2 from
    the green line are significantly selected (p < 0.01) in one agroecology but not
    in the other. The most significant window under selection in the highland populations
    was found on chromosome four, overlapping the GALNTL6 gene (XP-EHH = 4.16). Variants
    in this gene have been associated with power performance in humans [116] possibly
    by showing a positive effect on anaerobic metabolism. In addition, several genes
    under selection (XP-EHH > 2.7) are part of the calcium signalling pathway which
    has been associated with high altitude adaptation and hypoxia in previous studies
    including Tibetan chickens [19]. The genes identified in this pathway include
    ERBB4 [117], PLCB2, STIM2 [118], and GNAS [119]. The MOAA and MOAB genes are also
    under strong selection in the high altitude populations (XP-EHH > 3.5), these
    genes correlate with the expression of HiF-1α and with transcription factors Sp1
    and Sp3 which are master regulators of the cellular and developmental response
    to hypoxia [120]. Other genes under selection include the RIPPLY2, associated
    with body length [121], the SGCZ gene which response to the HIF-1 transcription
    activity during hypoxia [122], the SPNS2 gene that regulated hypoxia-inducible
    factor 2alpha [123], and the BRINP3 gene under selection in high-altitude Andeans
    [124]. A complete list of genes from overlapping windows jointly identified by
    and XP-EHH in agroecological comparisons in lowland vs. highland, lowland vs.
    midland, and midland vs. highland respectively across the three gradients (layer-II)
    are presented respectively in Supplementary Table 7. XP-EHH scores for comparisons
    between different agroecologies across the three gradients (layer-II) and between
    gradients are presented in Supplementary Tables 8 and Supplementary Table 9 respectively.

    populations while negative values indicate selection in lowland populations. Genes
    indicated in bold have been associated with the hypoxia related pathways Full
    size image Figure 8 shows the most significant selective sweeps for highland vs.
    lowland populations within gradient-II. The most significant window was found
    on chromosome 3 overlapping the follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene,
    which is an activator of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 protein [125], a key regulator
    of oxygen homeostasis. The second strongest signal is found on chromosome 6 overlapping
    the CHAT gene which has a direct interaction with the hypoxia-inducible factor
    (HIF)-1α protein [126]. Interestingly, the third strongest peak overlaps with
    the RYR2 gene. This gene is well known to be associated with high altitude adaptation
    in Tibetan chickens [19]. Other notable genes under selection include HIGD1A (hypoxia
    inducible domain family, member 1 A), IGFBP1 (insulin like growth factor), CAP2,
    and HERC4, of which the latter two have been found to be differentially expressed
    under hypoxic environments [18]. There is no significant enrichment for the highland
    genes found. However, the genes under selection in the lowland populations are
    enriched for the ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion which serve as an
    important role in tissue and organ morphogenesis and in the maintenance of cell
    and tissue structure and function [127]. A significant overlap (13.4%) was observed
    between significant windows (p < 0.01) identified by and XP-EHH analyses in the
    pairwise agroecological comparisons across gradients and within gradient-II (20.9%),
    indicating that the two methods target the same regions and hence are good predictors
    of selection signatures. Additional details are given under Supplementary Fig.
    5 for overlaps between the two methods across gradients and under Supplementary
    Fig. 6 for overlaps within gradient-II. Complete list of genes from overlapping
    windows jointly identified by and XP-EHH in agroecological comparisons across
    gradients and within gradient-II are also presented in Supplementary Table 10
    A–C and Supplementary Table 10D–F, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis We
    assessed whether the genes under selection in the highland population are enriched
    for specific KEGG pathways. In total 150 bins have a XP-EHH value greater than
    2.7 (p < 0.01). These bins include a total of 95 genes. Only the “Calcium signalling
    pathway” was significantly enriched (q-value < 0.1) and in which five genes were
    found (ERBB4, GRIN2A, STIM2, GNAS, PLCB2) to be under selection in the highland
    populations. Several candidate genes in the calcium-signalling pathway were found
    to be under directional selection in adaptation to the hypoxia experienced by
    two Tibetan chicken populations [19], suggesting a potential genetic mechanism
    underlying high altitude adaptation to be similar in Ethiopian highland chicken
    compared to Tibetan chickens [19]. Ca2+ are signalling molecules that regulate
    the response to hypoxia, which modulates cell contraction, cell proliferation
    and growth [128, 129]. Moreover, calcium signalling stimulates the translation
    of HIF-alpha, a transcription factors that mediates adaptation to hypoxia [130].
    The candidate selected genes identified in this study, and their variants, may
    be useful targets for clarifying our understanding of high-altitude adaptation
    in chicken. In addition, the “ribosome pathways” is enriched for windows under
    selection in the lowland populations (XP-EHH < -2) from a total of 212 windows
    and 112 genes. XP-EHH detected signatures of selection between populations sampled
    from any two gradients were also strong (Supplementary Fig. 4.). However, they
    were not as strong as signatures detected across agroecologies. Pathway enrichment
    analysis We assessed whether the genes under selection in the highland population
    are enriched for specific KEGG pathways. In total 150 bins have a XP-EHH value
    greater than 2.7 (p < 0.01). These bins include a total of 95 genes. Only the
    “Calcium signalling pathway” was significantly enriched (q-value < 0.1) in which
    five genes were found (ERBB4, GRIN2A, STIM2, GNAS, PLCB2) to be under selection

    in chicken. In addition, the “ribosome pathways” is enriched for windows under
    selection in the lowland populations (XP-EHH < -2) from a total of 212 windows
    and 112 genes. XP-EHH detected signatures of selection between populations sampled
    from any two gradients were also strong (Supplementary Fig. 4). However, they
    were not as strong as signatures detected across agroecologies. Genotype-environment
    associations (GEA) Of the ten predictors identified through MaxEnt-based SDMs
    for their association with habitat suitability of chickens [46] and elevation
    (added as a tenth predictor), 6 less correlated (r≤|0.7|) predictors were retained
    for RDA (Supplementary Fig. 5). These predictors were: precipitation of the warmest
    quarter, precipitation of the coldest quarter, solar radiation of May, elevation,
    soil clay content and temperature seasonality. We had as many RDA axes as we had
    predictors (n  = 6) in our model. The first three RDA axes explained more than
    half (68.1%) of the variance in the environmental predictors (Supplementary Table
    11). The significance of models in RDA is based on F-statistics [131].The adjusted
    R2 considering the number of environmental predictors was 0.02, meaning that our
    constrained ordination explains about 2% of the variation or that 2% of the SNP
    variation is associated with the environmental predictors. Based on the magnitude
    of the arrows in PCA plots based on RDA axes 1 and 2 (Supplementary Fig. 8) elevation,
    precipitation of the warmest quarter, and soil clay content had the highest contributions
    to genotypic variation, while temperature seasonality and solar radiation had
    the lowest contributions. The SNP loadings for environmental predictors on each
    of the three RDA axes show a relatively normal distribution (Supplementary Fig.
    9). The 1,909 SNPs from the two extreme ends of the loading distribution with
    standard deviation > 3.5 (two-tailed p-value = 0.0005) for each significant axis
    were taken as outlier SNPs that are associated with environmental variation. The
    list of candidate SNPs which have significant association (p < 0.001) with the
    six environmental predictors and considered to be under selection are presented
    in Supplementary Table 12. SNPs associated with the combined set of environmental
    predictors in gradients -I, III, and -IV do not show a clear clustering but are
    more or less evenly spread across the genome (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 Manhattan plot of
    RDA showing the association of SNPs with the combined set of six environmental
    predictors in the three gradients (-I, -III, and -IV) as explanatory variables.
    The y-axis indicates -log 10 (p-value). Horizontal blue line indicates the significance
    threshold (p < 0.001) Full size image Some of the highest -log10 (p-values) are
    found on chromosomes 1 and 3 (Fig. 9). Only the peak on chromosome 1 shows additional
    significant SNPs near the top SNP. The significant candidate SNPs (n = 1,909)
    that are associated with the combined set of environmental predictors are assigned
    to individual predictors based on the correlation values estimated by partial
    RDA analysis (Fig. 10). Most candidate SNPs (942 or 49.3%) have their highest
    correlation with elevation. Elevation has also the highest number (n = 321 or
    57.4%) of the moderately to highly associated SNPs (n = 559) (0.3 < r < 0.6).
    The second environmental predictor most associated with candidate SNPs is precipitation
    of the warmest quarter. It has correlation with 410 candidate SNPs (21.47%). The
    other 4 environmental predictors have the highest correlation for a smaller number
    of SNPs (n = 557 or 29.17%), but for all predictors, a considerable number of
    SNPs (n = 59) are found with correlations above|0.3| and only two SNPs have correlations
    above|0.4|. Fig. 10 Number of significant candidate SNPs (p < 0.001) that are
    most correlated with each of the six selected environmental predictors grouped
    by absolute magnitude of their correlation Full size image Genotype-phenotype
    association Out of a total of 8 phenotypic variables identified through MaxEnt-based
    SDMs for their utility in phenotypically discriminating study populations [46],
    five least correlated (|r| ≤ 0.72) quantitative traits were selected to be used
    for RDA (Supplementary Fig. 10). These five traits were live body weight, beak
    length, comb width, wattle width and earlobe width. The correlation between comb
    width and wattle width was 0.72 which is slightly higher than the common threshold
    (|r| > 0.7) used to reduce variables However, we decided to keep both traits because
    of their adaptive roles documented in literature related with thermoregulation
    in tropical chickens. The first three RDA axes explained most of the variance
    (62.1%) in the phenotypic predictors (Supplementary Table 13). The adjusted R2
    for the partial RDA was 0.002. This shows that only 0.2% of the SNPs variation
    is associated with quantitative traits. The SNP loadings for quantitative traits
    on each of the three RDA axes show a relatively normal distribution (Supplementary
    Fig. 11). Based on the magnitude of the arrows in the PCA plots based on RDA axes
    1 and 2 (Supplementary Fig. 12), comb width, wattle width and body weight were
    most useful in explaining SNP variation. SNPs associated with the combined set
    of quantitative traits in gradients -I, -III, and -IV show strong supportive peaks
    on chromosomes 1,3, 4, 7,8, 13, 15, and 29 indicating probable regions of quantitative
    trait loci (QTL) associated with phenotypic variation (Fig. 11). The picks were
    more diffused across the genome for the Manhattan plot showing association between
    SNPs and quantitative traits for populations sampled from gradient-II (Supplementary
    Fig. 13). Fig. 11 Manhattan plot of RDA showing the association of SNPs with phenotypic
    variation in the five quantitative traits in gradients -I, -III, and-IV. The y-axis

    SNPs (p < 0.001) that are most correlated with each of the five quantitative traits
    is presented in Fig. 12. The significant candidate SNPs (were assigned to individual
    traits based on correlation values estimated by partial RDA analysis. Partial
    RDA identified 1340 candidate SNPs that have significant association with the
    five quantitative traits (Supplementary Table 14). A total of 19 SNPs show moderate
    to high correlation with body weight (0.3 < r ≤ 0.6). Most candidate SNPs, 39%,
    were associated with comb width (n = 519) and 27% with body weight (n = 360) (Fig.
    12 and Supplementary Table 13. Higher association was also seen between comb width
    and candidate SNPs for populations sampled from gradient-II (Supplementary Fig.
    14). Fig. 12 Number of significant candidate SNPs (p < 0.001) that are most correlated

    Adverse effects of climate change and increasing demand for animal source proteins,
    particularly in the tropics (particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia), necessitate
    that we properly understand the genetic architecture of environmental adaptation
    and develop productive and environmentally resilient breeds [132, 133]. Investigation
    of molecular pathways indicate that indigenous chickens are more adapted to the
    environment in which they live compared to specialized chickens [132]. Important
    insights were obtained from earlier studies on local adaptation of African chickens
    [45, 134, 135] by applying SDMs and signatures of selection analyses. However,
    previous studies did not adequately relate genomic variation with environmental
    and phenotypic variation. Analysing genomic data without relating it environmental
    and phenotypic variation does not provide a complete picture of adaptive variation.
    In the present study, we followed a landscape genomic approach to study adaptive
    and phenotypic variation among Ethiopian chickens. We applied an environmental-gradation
    approach to survey chicken populations across all possible agroclimatic clines
    in the country. Our sample size of 513 animals from four environmental gradients
    was large enough to capture adaptive variation across populations. For species
    with limited dispersal, sample sizes above 200 units are generally sufficient
    to detect most adaptive signals in landscape genomics, while in random mating
    populations this threshold should be increased to 400 units [84]. After applying
    stringent quality filtration, we had 25 M SNPs (autosomal and non-autosomal) and
    466 individuals for downstream genomic analyses. The dataset used in the present
    study is substantially larger than previous genomic studies on Ethiopian chickens
    (which sampled a maximum of 225 birds per study) [45, 136, 137]. We combined different
    techniques including SDMs, genetic differentiation test ( , cross-population Extended
    Haplotype Homozygosity (XP-EHH), and RDA. SDMs were used in our study to identify
    the most relevant environmental predictors influencing habitat suitability for
    chickens. The environmental predictors identified in the present study (related
    with elevation, precipitation, soil clay content, solar radiation, and temperature)
    were reported in earlier studies for their influences on availability of feed,
    productivity, prevalence of diseases and parasites [26, 46, 138, 139]. The habitat
    suitability maps produced by SDMs suggest that the 26 Ethiopian indigenous chicken
    sample populations may have gone through different environmental selective pressures
    which give rise to phenotypic and genetic differentiation. The gradients and agroecologies
    show low differentiation, as evidenced by the low values. Lower level of genetic
    differentiation was also detected among Ethiopian chickens by [45]. In contrast
    to the results, strong signals of selection (p < 0.01) were detected by XP-EHH
    in pairwise agroecological comparisons. XP-EHH results show that selective pressure
    in Ethiopian chickens is stronger between agroecologies. A large overlap was observed
    between significant windows identified by and XP-EHH analyses, suggesting that
    both methods identified similar regions in the genome are under selection. The
    overlap between and XP-EHH analyses ranged from 13.4 to 20.9% between agroecologies
    which is considerably higher than the 4.9% overlap reported by [45] between and
    XP-EHH for Ethiopian chickens. The large overlap between and XP-EHH in the present
    study might be due to our sampling strategy. Firstly, the sampling design captured
    a wide range of geographic and environmental variation and helped to survey most
    of the ecotypes and agroecologies in the country. Secondly, the design may have
    minimized confounding between neutral and adaptive processes which result from
    mixing of populations that have different demographic histories. By classifying
    the populations by gradients, we controlled for the effects of population genetic
    structure associated with specific geographies. For instance, a very high overlap
    between the and XP-EHH results was found in agroecological comparisons within
    gradient-II. The decision to analyse this gradient on its own was informed by
    PCA, which clearly separated populations of gradient-II from the other three gradients
    (-I, -II, and -III). Gradient-II represents chicken populations from eastern parts
    of Ethiopia which have a distinct evolutionary history and route of introduction
    into the country [38, 40, 136], in contrast to populations representing the other
    three gradients. Combining gradient-II with the other three would have reduced
    the overlap of and XP-EHH results. Our results based on XP-EHH show that genes
    in the calcium signalling pathway are under selection in high-altitude adapted
    Ethiopian chicken populations as well as genes associated with the hypoxia-inducible
    factor (HIF) transcription factors. The gene under strongest selection is the
    GALNTL6 gene associated with sports performance in multiple human studies. It
    is hypothesized that this gene is expressed in the gut microbiome regarding regulation
    of short-chain fatty acids and their anti-inflammatory and resynthesis functions
    causing a positive effect on anaerobic metabolism. The ERBB4 gene, found to be
    under selection in high altitude Ethiopian chicken populations, is also under
    selection in human Tibetan populations [117]. ERBB4 is strongly associated with
    vascular wall stability, and possibly with the production of erythrocytes and
    belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor subfamily. We also identified
    the MAOB and MAOA genes to be under selection, where MAOB has been shown to be
    correlated with HiF-1α (tumour grade and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor)
    [120]. Inhibition of MAOA in cells may exert antitumour activity in the treatment
    of prostate cancer [140]. The roles of MAOA and MAOB genes in local adaptation
    of chicken need to be further investigated. Results from signatures of selection
    analyses with the two methods ( and XP-EHH) can be used complementarily with RDA
    to shed light on the relationship between genomic, phenotypic, and environmental
    variation in local adaptation studies in indigenous chickens. With RDA, we identified
    83 candidate SNPs in regions on chromosomes 1,3, 4, 7,8, 13, 15, and 19 that have
    a moderate to high correlation (0.3 < r < 0.6) with live body weight. Conventional
    GWAS studies in the past identified body weight associated SNPs and QTLs on chromosomes
    1,4, 8, 11, 19 in Chinese, Rwandan, and Ethiopian chicken breeds [27, 141,142,143,144].
    Our results demonstrate that RDA can be used as an alternative approach to GWAS
    in random mating, indigenous livestock populations which have sufficiently interacted
    with the environment. Candidate SNPs associated with the six SDM-identified environmental
    predictors contributing to habitat suitability were identified by RDA. The RDA
    found only 2% of the SNP variation to be associated with the six environmental
    predictors. This is a small value but not unexpected because most of the SNPs
    are under neutral and therefore not show a relationship with the environmental
    predictors. SNPs that do show association with the environmental predictors are
    likely to be under selection. This selection can be in response to these selected
    predictors that were used in the model or some other environmental variable that
    is correlated with these predictors. Candidate SNPs associated with environmental
    predictors (Fig. 9) were evenly spread across the genome without obvious overlap
    with the peaks from genotype-phenotype association Fig. 11). Genotype-phenotype
    associations had very distinct suggesting that phenotypic variation is present
    among populations for selection to act on it. The environmental drivers could
    increase haplotypes related to adaptive phenotypic plasticity and morphological
    variation in indigenous chickens. The pea-comb, a dominant mutation in chickens,
    drastically reduces the size of the comb and wattle, decreasing heat loss and
    making the chicken less susceptible to frost lesions [145]. Histological section
    analysis of dermal papillary layer has revealed that red earlobes have many more
    blood vessels and were associated with thinner skin than that of white earlobes
    [146] indicating the role of earlobes in thermoregulation. The total amount of
    SNP variation associated with phenotypic variation was only 0.2%, in contrast
    with 2% of the SNP variation associated with environmental variation. The underlying
    mechanisms of genotype-phenotype associations are well studied and understood
    in livestock, but this is not the case for genotype-environment associations.
    Finding 2% of SNP variation related to environment variation is promising for
    further investigation of the mechanisms leading to these associations. In summary,
    in this manuscript we reported the first study integrating phenotypic, genomic,
    and environmental information on Ethiopian indigenous chickens. Our findings on
    genomic and phenotypic variability associated with environmental adaptation (e.g.,
    genes selected in highland populations, genes associated with body weight and
    ecological variables) are useful in the design of breeding programmes aiming at
    developing more productive and resilient chicken strains (lines) suitable for
    smallholder systems in the face of climate crisis. The landscape genomic approach
    followed in the present study can also be used to study adaptive variation in
    other random mating indigenous livestock populations that are managed extensively
    to better understand organismal response to environmental variables and develop
    better breeding strategies. Data availability The datasets analysed during the
    current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

  description: Interest in the dynamics of soil respiration (Rs) in subalpine forest
    ecosystems is increasing due to their high soil carbon density and potential sensitivity
    to environmental changes. However, as a principal silvicultural practice, the
    long-term impacts of thinning on Rs and its heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration
    components (Rh and Ra, respectively) in subalpine plantations are poorly understood,
    especially in winter. A 3-year field observation was carried out with consideration
    of winter CO2 efflux in middle-aged subalpine spruce plantations in northwestern
    China. A trenching method was used to explore the long-term impacts of thinning
    on Rs, Rh and Ra. Seventeen years after thinning, mean annual Rs, Rh and Ra increased,
    while the contribution of Rh to Rs decreased with thinning intensity. Thinning
    significantly decreased winter Rs because of the reduction in Rh but had no significant
    effect on Ra. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of Rh and Ra also increased with
    thinning intensity, with lower Q10 values for Rh (2.1–2.6) than for Ra (2.4–2.8).
    The results revealed the explanatory variables and pathways related to Rh and
    Ra dynamics. Thinning increased soil moisture and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and
    the enhanced nitrogen and water availability promoted Rh and Ra by improving fine
    root biomass and microbial activity. Our results highlight the positive roles
    of NO3--N in stimulating Rs components following long-term thinning. Therefore,
    applications of nitrogen fertilizer are not recommended while thinning subalpine
    spruce plantations from the perspective of reducing soil CO2 emissions. The increased
    Q10 values of Rs components indicate that a large increase in soil CO2 emissions
    would be expected following thinning because of more pronounced climate warming
    in alpine regions.

    nitrogen deposition on soil respiration components in two alpine coniferous forests,
    southeastern Tibetan Plateau Article 10 May 2018 Introduction Over past decades,
    global temperate plantation forest cover has increased rapidly (Rudel et al. 2005;
    Deng and Shangguan 2017; Lu et al. 2018). An important reason for this is efforts
    to mitigate CO2 emissions, considering that temperate plantations are a significant
    sink of CO2 (Fang et al. 2014; Pugh et al. 2020; Pan et al. 2022). Soil respiration
    (Rs), including heterotrophic respiration (Rh) associated with microbial metabolism
    and autotrophic respiration (Ra) from root-rhizosphere respiration, contributes
    as much as 60–90% of the total carbon (C) emissions from temperate forest ecosystems
    (Pan et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2011; Hopkins et al. 2013). Thus small variations
    in Rs induced by forest disturbance could exert major effects on temperate forest
    C budgets, even transitioning the net sink to a source of CO2 (Zhang et al. 2015;
    Pearson et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2022). Currently, most field observations of
    soil respiration dynamics in temperate forest ecosystems have been performed during
    the growing season, while the C efflux in winter has seldom been determined (Schindlbacher
    et al. 2007; Du et al. 2013; Jiao and Wang 2018; Zhang et al. 2020; Yang et al.
    2022a). Nevertheless, growing evidence indicates that winter Rs contributes a
    considerable fraction of the annual soil C exchange and should be ignored in temperate
    forest ecosystems, especially in subalpine forests in which winter spans several
    months to more than half a year (Wang et al. 2010; Hu et al. 2016; Gao et al.
    2018; Li et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2023). Thus, more field observations, including
    winter Rs data, are needed for accurate estimations of annual C budgets in temperate
    plantations. To increase productivity and maintain forest health, thinning has
    been a principal silvicultural practice for plantation forests. It has been well
    established that thinning affects microclimate (Schrumpf et al. 2011; Pang et
    al. 2013; Su et al. 2024), organic substrate availability (Scott-Denton et al.
    2006; Cheng et al. 2021), nutrient status (Chase et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2020),
    microbial activity (Dang et al. 2018), and root dynamics (Brunner et al. 2009;
    Çömez et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2023), and thus has considerable on Rs in the
    growing season. However, in winter, these biophysical variables show marked changes,
    including soil frost and extreme low temperatures (Du et al. 2013; Shi et al.
    2014; Yang et al. 2019); therefore, the response by Rs to winter thinning may
    be different from that in the growing season. Additionally, another uncertainty
    regarding thinning effects on Rs is that Rh and Ra often show independent and
    inconsistent responses to different thinning intensities (Lei et al. 2018; Chen
    et al. 2020). For example, moderate and heavy thinning decreased Ra while promoting
    Rh (Cheng et al. 2015), and light thinning promoted Ra but not Rh (Zhao et al.
    2019). Previous research also reported that Rs increased significantly in the
    initial phase after thinning due to the stimulation of Rh by the input of organic
    matter with harvest residues (Peng and Thomas 2006; Zhang et al. 2018) and significantly
    decreased for the subsequent three to 6 years because of the reduction in Ra (Shen
    et al. 2017; Doukalianou et al. 2019). However, several recent long-term experiments
    have shown that Ra recovered to its original levels and then increased steadily
    six to eight years after thinning with the gradual recovery of tree roots (Han
    et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2022b). Currently, most research has concentrated on
    the impacts of thinning on Rh and Ra in the early years, and the long-term effects
    of thinning on these two respiration components are not well known. The interest
    in the dynamics of Rs in subalpine forests is increasing due to their high soil
    C density and potential sensitivity to environmental change (Chen et al. 2010;
    Xu et al. 2014a; Berryman et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2022; Di Matteo et al. 2023).
    However, previous field measurements of thinning effects on Rs and its respiration
    components have concentrated on temperate, subtropical, and tropical plantation
    forests, while the responses by subalpine plantations remain uncertain (Zhang
    et al. 2018, 2022; Chen et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2023). Thus, a three-year field
    observation with consideration of winter soil CO2 efflux was carried out in a
    34-year-old subalpine spruce plantation in northwestern China. These plantations
    are widely distributed in the region and important for maintaining the C balance
    in the arid part of the country. The aim of this study was to explore the long-term
    (17 years) impacts of thinning in middle-aged subalpine spruce plantations on
    Rs, Rh and Ra as well as the underlying mechanisms. It was hypothesized that long-term
    thinning would have independent and inconsistent effects on Rh and Ra because
    of their different responses in winter and in the growing season. Materials and
    methods Experimental design Field observations were carried out in a subalpine
    spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) plantation (100° 15′ E, 38° 32′ N) in the central
    Qilian Mountains and within Zhangye City. The site has a cold-temperate, semi-arid
    climate, with an annual temperature of 1.6 °C and annual precipitation of 385
    mm (He et al. 2018). Approximately 85% of the precipitation is concentrated from
    June to October. Winter lasts from November to May, which is consistent with a
    continuous period of mean daily soil temperature (ST) < 0.5 °C at a 5-cm depth,
    as defined by Grogan and Jonasson (2006) and Wang et al. (2019). The extreme minimum
    temperature ranges from − 25 to − 30 °C according to meteorological data for 2000
    to 2019. In this area, P. crassifolia stands occupy shaded, north-facing slopes;
    grasslands, dominated by Carex moorcroftii Falc. ex Boott, Agropyron cristatum
    (L.) Gaertn., Elymus cylindricus (Franch.) Honda, Carex tristachya Thunb. in Murray,
    Caragana jubata (Pall.) Poir., and Stipa capillata L., are distributed on sunny
    south-facing slopes and semi-shaded east- or west-facing slopes. In the early
    1970s, afforestation with P. crassifolia at a density of 4500 ind. ha−1 expanded
    rapidly on semi-shaded slopes. The understorey is composed mainly of herbaceous
    species (Polygonum viviparum L., Carex atrata L. and S. capillata L.) and moss
    (Abietinella abietina (Hedw.) M. Fleisch., Cirriphyllum cirrhosum (schwaegr.)

    ex Schwägr.). Soils are dominated by Haplic Podsol (FAO classification system),
    loam texture according to USDA classification (37% sand, 43% silt, and 20% clay).
    To reduce stand density and relieve soil degradation, especially drought, and
    improve stem-level productivity, thinning was carried out in 1997 and 1998 as
    manual whole-tree harvesting of all trees in every other row. Residues produced
    during harvesting were removed from the stands (He et al. 2018). In the summer
    of 2015, approximately 17 years after thinning, a field survey was carried out.
    There were three management treatments, including unthinned, with 4438 ind. ha−1
    (control, CK); light 20% thinning and a final density of 3558 ind. ha−1 (T1);
    and heavy 40% thinning and a final density of 2721 ind. ha−1 (T2). Nine 30 m × 30
    m sample plots were randomly established within each of the treatments. The distance
    between each plot was > 30 m to prevent edge effects. The stand characteristics
    of the overstorey trees were determined. Within each plot, five 1.0 m × 1.0 m
    quadrats were established to determine the biomass of the understorey vegetation.
    The general site characteristics for each treatment are summarized in Table S1.
    Field measurements of R s, soil temperature (ST), and soil moisture (SM) Rh and
    Ra were separated from Rs using a trenching method (Comstedt et al. 2011). In
    the summer of 2015, ten 1 m × 1 m subplots, including five trenched subplots and
    five untrenched subplots, were selected in each plot. Total Rs was determined
    in the untrenched subplots; the trenched subplots were used to determine Rh, and
    Ra was estimated as the difference between Rs and Rh. As the root depth of P.
    crassifolia is generally less than 60 cm, a 60-cm-deep trench was excavated in
    the trenched subplots. To minimize the influence on SM, four 400-mesh bags were
    inserted into the trenches and the soil backfilled. All live plants were removed
    from the trenched subplots to eliminate Ra. Two weeks before the first measurements
    of Rs and Rh, a PVC collar with an inner diameter of 20 cm was installed at the
    centre of each subplot. The Rs and its respiration components were observed monthly
    from June 2016 to May 2019 using a Li-8100a soil CO2 flux system on the collars.
    Previous studies have demonstrated that the Rs observed in the morning could reliably
    the average values for the entire day (Tian et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2020), and
    our previous diurnal measurements also supported this pattern. Therefore, the
    measurements were carried out between 08:30 and 12:00 am mid-month only on rain-free
    days. For each collar, the measurement was repeated twice and the final Rs rate
    for a given collar was the average of the two measurements. Before the measurements,
    living plants, including mosses, and litter layers were manually removed from
    the collars. In winter, surface snow was removed carefully from the collars. After
    10 min to allow the system to equilibrate, the soil CO2 efflux was measured. The
    removed snow was gently backfilled after the measurements. ST and SM were determined
    concurrently at a 10-cm depth with a hand-held thermocouple probe and a Theta
    probe connected to the Li-8100a instrument positioned adjacent to the collars,
    respectively. In winter, when the probes could not be inserted into the frozen
    soil, ST and SM were obtained from continuous measurements by the 5TM system (one
    for each plot). In addition, the SM was also determined by oven drying to calibrate
    the SM data. Soil sampling and analysis In August 2015, one composite sample of
    five soil cores (to a 10-cm depth) was collected per plot for the determination
    of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N).
    In March, June, September, and December during the experimental period, one composite
    10-cm sample was obtained from five soil cores per plot while monitoring the Rs
    rate. The soil was transported on dry ice to the laboratory for later determination
    of dissolved organic C (DOC), nitrate nitrogen ( -N), ammonium nitrogen ( -N),
    and microbial biomass carbon (MB). The detailed methodology is described in Chen
    et al. (2023). To determine fine root (< 2 mm in diameter) biomass (FRB), another
    composite sample (to a 10-cm depth) was obtained from five soil cores with 10-cm
    inner diameter root drills. Fine roots were separated manually and dried to determine
    FRB. Data analysis An exponential function was adopted to fit the relationships
    between ST and Rs and its respiration components (Eq. 1) and to assess the temperature
    sensitivity (Q10) of Rs and its respiration components (Eq. 2). A linear function
    was adopted to relate Rs and its respiration components to SM (Eq. 3). (1) (2)

    The soil CO2 emissions (SCE) for the growing season, winter, and whole year were
    the sums of the monthly SCE, which were calculated by multiplying the average
    daily SCE by the number of days for each month, as summarized with the following
    equation (Frank and Dugas 2001): (4) where SCE is soil CO2 emission (g m−2) for
    the season of interest, is the number of months for the season of interest, is
    the number of days for month , is the daily average Rs (μmol m−2 s−1) for month
    determined with the Li-8100a soil CO2 flux system, and S is the number of seconds
    (s) within a day. Statistical analysis Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was adopted
    to assess the thinning effects on Rs, Rh, Ra, the contribution of Rh to Rs (Rh/Rs),
    the Q10 value, SOC, TN, C/N, DOC, -N, -N, MB, and FRB; multiple comparisons were
    performed with the least significant difference (LSD) test. A two-way ANOVA evaluated
    the effects of thinning level and measurement year on the average yearly values
    of Rs, Rh, Ra, and Rh/Rs. Additionally, a two-way ANOVA was also used to evaluate
    the effects of thinning level and trenching on ST and SM. The relationships of
    Rs components with ST and SM were fitted with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
    Pearson correlation (PC) analysis was adopted to assess the relationships of Rh
    and Ra to selected biophysical factors. Structural equation models (SEMs) were
    further used to explore the causal and interactive pathways regulating Rh and
    Ra. The SEM only included biophysical factors that correlated significantly with
    Rh and Ra, as detected by the PC analysis. The model was fitted using the maximum-likelihood
    estimation. ANOVA, LSD, OLS, PC, and SEM analyses were conducted with the “multcomp”,
    “agricolae”, “basicTrendline”, “psych”, and “semPlot” packages in R (version 4.1.2),
    respectively. Results Changes in biophysical factors As thinning levels increased,
    ST increases in the untrenched and trenched subplots were insignificant in the
    first, second and third measurement years; however, the 3-year average increased
    significantly with increased thinning (Table 1). As thinning increased, SM in
    the untrenched and trenched subplots increased significantly in the first, second
    and third measurement years, and the three-year average also increased significantly
    (Table 1). There was no significant response by ST and SM to trenching over the
    three years (Table 1). -N, MB and FRB increased significantly, while dissolved
    organic carbon decreased with increased thinning; SOC, TN, C/N and -N did not
    differ among the treatments (Table 2). Table 1 Average values of soil temperature

    respiration and its heterotrophic and autotrophic components in both thinning
    treatments showed similar seasonal and annual variations, with peak values occurring
    in July to September and minimal in January to March (Fig. 1). Both thinning and
    measurement year significantly affected Rs, Rh, Ra and Rh/Rs (Table 3). Over the
    3 years, Rs and Ra increased with increased thinning; Rh increased with increased
    thinning in the first year but there was no significant response in the second
    and third years (Fig. 2). On average, as the thinning increased, Rs increased
    from 1.9 to 2.3 μmol m−2 s−1, Ra from 0.6 to 0.9 μmol m−2 s−1, and Rh from 1.2
    to 1.3 μmol m−2 s−1. Over the three years, Rh/Rs decreased significantly with
    increased thinning. On average, as thinning levels increased, the Rh/Rs decreased
    from 70.0 to 63.4% (Fig. 2). Fig. 1 Dynamics of soil respiration (A), autotrophic

    the 3 years, annual soil CO2 emissions increased with increased thinning and ranged

    thinning and ranged from 451.2 to 695.9 g m−2 a−1 (Table 4). However, in winter
    soil CO2 emissions were inconsistent to thinning and ranged from 189.9 to 234.8
    g m−2 a−1. Thinning significantly decreased winter SCE in the first and second
    years but had no effects in the third year (Table 4). Winter to annual ratios
    ranged from 21.9 to 34.4% and decreased with increased thinning over the 3-year
    period (Table 4). Table 4 Soil CO2 emissions for the growing season and winter

    (Fig. 5). Q10 values of Ra increased with increased thinning from 2.8 in the controls

    -N and FRB were the major determinants of Ra, and SM, -N and MB were the major
    determinants of Rh (Figs. 7, 8). Thinning significantly increased SM and -N, and
    the enhanced nitrogen and water availability significantly promoted Ra and Rh
    by improving FRB and MB, respectively.. Table 5 Pearson correlation coefficients

    observations revealed that long-term thinning increased annual mean Ra and Rh,
    leading to a net increase in Rs in subalpine spruce plantations. These results
    contradict our hypothesis that Rh and Ra would show different responses to long-term
    thinning. Because thinning can alter Rh and Ra through independent and different
    processes, these two respiration components often show inconsistent responses
    to thinning (Lei et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2022). For instance, in young ponderosa
    pine plantations, Tang et al. (2005) observed that a thinning intensity of 60%
    depressed Ra while stimulating Rh in the second year. However, Cheng et al. (2015)
    found that a thinning intensity of 40% promoted Rh but had no influence on Ra
    in Chinese fir plantations, while Zhao et al. (2019) reported that thinning intensities
    of 20% and 40% promoted Ra but had no influence on Rh in a middle-aged Pinus tabuliformis
    Carr. plantation in the early years after thinning. The long-term impacts of thinning
    on Rs components in our study were quite distinct from the short-term effects
    documented in previous studies. Several recent long-term thinning experiments
    have shown that Ra and Rh consistently increased due to the gradual recovery of
    tree roots and understorey vegetation and stimulated microbial activities (Han
    et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2022b). Our observations support previous findings after
    long-term thinning. Over the 3 years of field observations, Rh/Rs ranged from
    63.4 to 70.0%. A synthesis of published field measurements of Rs components for
    forest ecosystems reported that the average Rh/Rs ratio was 54.2% (Hanson et al.
    2000). Our estimates notably exceeded the previously reported average for forest
    ecosystems. This may be largely due to the low root production in the subalpine
    spruce plantations compared to that in other forests (Brunner et al. 2009; Çömez
    et al. 2019). Interestingly, in this study, Rh/Rs decreased significantly with
    increased thinning, indicating that Ra increased more with long-term thinning
    than Rh. We speculate that increased root growth of the residual trees following
    long-term thinning may have resulted in the decreased Rh/Rs. Our observations
    show that the long-term impacts of thinning on soil respiration components varied
    with the season. Specifically, thinning significantly increased Rs, Rh and Ra
    during the growing season but Rs and Rh decreased in winter. There is growing
    evidence that winter soil C emissions account for a significant proportion of
    the annual C budgets in seasonal forests, including subalpine forests (Wang et
    al. 2010; Shi et al. 2014; Hu et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2018). In the present study,
    the annual winter soil CO2 emissions (SCE), determined by interpolation, ranged
    from 189.9 to 234.8 g m−2 a−1, accounting for 21.9 to 34.4% of the total annual
    C emissions. Unfortunately, most observations of the effects of thinning on Rs
    and its respiration components were carried out during the growing season, while
    thinning effects in winter remain poorly understood (Chen et al. 2020; Yang et
    al. 2022a). The inconsistent response of Rs and its respiration components to
    long-term thinning between the growing season and winter observed in our study
    indicate that more field measurements of winter Rs are needed in seasonal forest
    ecosystems. Notably, we found that, in contrast to the growing season Rs, winter
    Rs decreased significantly with increased thinning because of the reduction in
    Rh. These findings indicate that excluding winter Rs would overestimate the long-term
    impacts of thinning on annual C emissions in subalpine forests. In addition, it
    was observed that the average Ra rate in winter was approximately 0.30 μmol m−2
    s−1, challenging the prevailing assumption that autotrophic respiration is approximately
    zero in cold periods due to root dormancy (Jiao and Wang 2018; Zhang et al. 2020;
    Chen et al. 2021). Ra mainly encompasses root and rhizomicrobial respiration (Kuzyakov
    2006). We speculate that the winter Ra observed in these subalpine spruce plantations
    primarily originated from rhizomicrobial respiration. Moreover, our results reveal
    that long-term thinning significantly enhanced temperature sensitivity (Q10) values
    of Rs components. This agrees with Lei et al. (2018), who found that thinning
    intensities of 15% and 70% enhanced Q10 values of Rh and Ra in Chinese red pine
    (Pinus massoniana Lamb) plantations due to diminished nutrient competition for
    root growth and microbial metabolism. The Q10 value is commonly adopted to indicate
    the response of Rs to climate warming (Kuzyakov 2006; Akburak and Makineci 2015;
    Liu et al. 2023). The higher Q10 values in the thinned than in the unthinned treatments
    imply that soils in the thinned subalpine plantations may release more CO2 under
    climate warming. Published studies have shown that the temperature sensitivity
    of Rs is determined by the respiring components (soil microbes and fine roots)
    and the temperature sensitivity of the involved respiring processes (Kuzyakov
    2006; Chen et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2019; Pacaldo and Aydin 2023). In this study,
    long-term thinning significantly increased microbial biomass carbon (MB) and fine
    root biomass (FRB) by increasing nitrogen and water availability. Therefore, it
    is speculated that the elevated Q10 values of Rs following long-term thinning
    were due to MB and FRB. Previous field measurements in temperate forest ecosystems
    have often revealed higher Q10 values for Rh than for Ra (Zhao et al. 2019; Yang
    et al. 2022b). The Q10 values, different from those in temperate forest ecosystems,
    were higher for Ra than for Rh over both thinning treatments in the subalpine
    spruce plantations, indicating that rhizosphere respiration is more sensitive
    to temperature than microbial respiration. The results of the structural equation
    model analysis revealed that MB and FRB played fundamental roles in driving Rh
    and Ra dynamics following long-term thinning, respectively, confirming our second
    hypothesis that the underlying mechanisms of heterotrophic dynamics following
    thinning were different from those of autotrophic respiration. It has been well
    established that thinning effects on Ra are primarily controlled by FRB dynamics
    in a specific soil layer, while thinning effects on Rh are closely related to
    microbial decomposition of organic substrates in temperate, subtropical and tropical
    forests (Pang et al. 2013; Lei et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2022b; Jian et al. 2023).
    Our results further demonstrate that these explanatory variables and pathways
    are applicable in subalpine forests. The results also highlight the positive roles
    of -N and soil moisture in regulating Rh and Ra following long-term thinning.
    Specifically, long-term thinning significantly increased soil moisture and -N,
    and the enhanced nitrogen and water availability significantly promoted Ra and
    Rh by improving FRB and MB, respectively. Nitrogen is the principal limiting nutrient
    for alpine forests because of low mineralization rates and deposition, as shown
    in previous research (Yang et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2014b; Li et al. 2019). By opening
    the canopy and improving microclimate conditions, thinning reduced N consumption
    while enhancing its mineralization, thus increasing -N (Chase et al. 2016; Fang
    et al. 2016). Increased N availability had positive impacts on Rh and Ra by alleviating
    competition for nitrogen between microbial decomposers and the roots of the remaining
    trees. Due to lower stand transpiration, an increase in soil moisture has been
    observed following the removal of a portion of tree biomass (Tang et al. 2005;
    Schrumpf et al. 2011; Pang et al. 2013; Chase et al. 2016). In this study, long-term
    thinning resulted in a significant increase in soil moisture, confirming the results
    of previous research. The average annual precipitation in our study area was less
    than 400 mm, and water availability was another limiting factor for subalpine
    spruce plantations (Geng et al. 2012; He et al. 2018). Therefore, fine root biomass
    and microbial biomass can be expected to be promoted by increased soil moisture
    following long-term thinning, thus increasing Ra and Rh. Conclusions The three-year
    field study showed that long-term thinning increased annual average heterotrophic
    and autotrophic respiration, leading to a net increase in soil respiration in
    the subalpine spruce plantations. Thinning significantly decreased winter soil
    respiration because of the reduction in heterotrophic respiration. These findings
    indicate that excluding winter Rs would overestimate the long-term impacts of
    thinning on annual carbon emissions in subalpine forests. The results further
    indicate that long-term thinning significantly enhanced the temperature sensitivity
    of soil respiration components, indicating that soils in thinned subalpine plantations
    may release more CO2 under climate warming than those in unthinned plantations.
    In contrast to temperate forest ecosystems, the temperature sensitivity values
    in these subalpine spruce plantations were higher for Ra than for Rh over both
    thinning treatments. These findings indicate that rhizosphere respiration is more
    sensitive to temperature than microbial respiration in subalpine forests. Moreover,
    the results highlight the positive roles of -N in stimulating soil respiration
    components following long-term thinning. Therefore, the application of nitrogen
    fertilizer is not recommended when thinning subalpine spruce plantations from
    the perspective of reducing soil CO2 emissions. References Akburak S, Makineci

    2020 Introduction In recent years, while the global population has doubled, this
    increase has not been matched by a corresponding growth in crop production, leading
    to frequent food shortages, especially in less developed countries. This disparity
    highlights the urgent need to identify crops that contribute to food security,
    particularly those adaptable to diverse ecological environments1. Sweet potato
    (Ipomoea batatas L.) stands out as a promising option in this regard due to its
    rich nutritional profile, including carbohydrates and vitamin A, which are crucial
    in combating malnutrition2. Cultivating sweet potatoes in new, dry-climate regions
    requires efficient fertilization management, as inadequate nutrient supply can
    significantly reduce yield3,4. Furthermore, agricultural production is affected
    by various factors, among which drought is a major challenge, severely impacting
    global crop production5. Climate change has intensified drought conditions, increasing
    their frequency and severity6, with varying effects on crops depending on factors
    like crop type, drought severity, timing, soil fertility, irrigation management,
    and other agricultural practices7,8,9,10,11,12. The growth stages of the sweet
    potato plant can be divided into four: seedling, fibrous root system establishment,
    early vine development, and storage root bulking13. Research on the drought sensitivity
    of sweet potatoes is somewhat limited, especially in arid regions. While sweet
    potatoes are generally tolerant to prolonged drought, they are particularly susceptible
    during the establishment stage. If drought occurs within the first six weeks after
    transplanting, it can significantly reduce yield14,15,16. Studies by Zhang et
    al17, and Wang et al18, have emphasized the importance of avoiding drought stress
    during the early growth stages of sweet potatoes. Placide et al19, Kivuva et al20.
    found that the plants are sensitive to water shortage at the storage root initiation
    stage. According to Saraswati21, maintaining soil moisture above the wilting point
    throughout the season is vital for the development of storage roots. Drought not
    only affects nutrient availability in the soil by altering their mineralization
    but also impacts the physiological processes within the plant, influencing nutrient
    absorption and transfer22,23,24. Jarzyniak & Jasiński25, Hussain et al26, and
    Nieves-Cordones et al27. attribute this to the reduction in transpiration rates
    and active transporters, leading to decreased root absorption power and nutrient
    uptake. In response to drought, plants have developed two primary mechanisms:
    avoidance and resistance. Avoidance strategies include changes in root and shoot
    structures, plant growth, and alterations in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Resistance
    is often marked by the accumulation of compounds like osmolytes and proteinase
    inhibitors, which protect plant cells under low water conditions8. Given these
    challenges, providing appropriate supplements like humic and chitosan can enhance
    drought resilience, thereby improving crop productivity and contributing to global
    food security. Humic substances, resulting from the decomposition of plant and
    animal matter, improve nutrient availability, membrane permeability, enzyme and
    hormone activity, and water retention, positively affecting plant metabolism and
    yield28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36. Chitosan applications on crops have been shown
    to reduce leaf transpiration and improve growth under stress, increasing water
    absorption and nutrient availability37,38,39,40,41. However, the exact mechanisms
    of chitosan in mitigating adverse conditions are not fully understood42. This
    study aims to explore the effects of drought on sweet potato growth and yield
    under various drought conditions, focusing on stages most sensitive to water shortages.
    It evaluates the effectiveness of applying humic and chitosan, both individually
    and in combination, to alleviate drought stress. The study also assesses the impact
    of these treatments on yield, yield quality, and irrigation water efficiency.
    This research will provide valuable insights into the role of organic fertilizers
    in sweet potato productivity and nutrition, offering a theoretical basis for optimal
    irrigation and fertilization strategies during critical drought stages. Materials
    and methods Study site The experiment was carried out during the summer of 2021
    and 2022 growing seasons at the experimental farm of water studies and research
    complex station, National Water Research Center, Toshka, Egypt, which is located
    at latitude 22°, 24`0.11` N longitude 31°,35`0.43` E and at an altitude of 188
    m. The experimental site is located in southern Egypt and is characterized by
    a hot and dry summer, a mild winter, and a scarcity of rainfall. Table 1 presents
    the monthly relative humidity, maximum and minimum temperature, and wind speed
    in the area during the growing seasons. The main source of irrigation water is
    groundwater through a well that was dug in the studied area. Table 2 presented
    ground water chemical properties at the experimental site during (2020–2021) seasons.
    The physical and chemical properties for the soil are presented in Table 3. All
    physical and chemical properties of the soil are estimated by following standardized
    methods of43,44. Where, 1.0 g of processed soil sample was weighed and transfer
    quantitatively into 500 mL Kjeldahl flask. Then (1 g CuSO4, 10 g K2SO4 and 30
    mL Con. H2SO4) was added and stirred well, then nitrogen (N) content was estimated
    by the Kjeldahl method, as outlined by43. Additionally, 1 g of the soil sample
    was air-dried, sieved (< 2 mm) then added to 10 mL of 0.025 M HCl and 0.03 M NH4F
    and extracted the solution. For 10 min at 2000 rpm, the suspension was centrifuged
    and filtered. Then by colorimeter methods using a spectrophotometer, the available
    phosphorous (P) in the filtered extract was then analyzed by measuring absorbance
    at 660 nm wavelength. On the other hand, 5 g of the soil sample was digested and
    mineralized with 10 mL mixture of concentrated nitric-perchloric solution for
    nutrient determination. Then, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg)
    contents were determined in the previous solution using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
    The sodium (Na) was estimated via flame photometer, while {iron (Fe), manganese
    (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu)} were measured by using atomic absorption spectroscopy.
    Sulfate anions (SO4) were determined by turbidimetric methods using a spectrophotometer
    at 470-nm wavelength. Bicarbonate anion (HCO3) was determined soon after preparing
    extracts by titration with 0.01 N H2SO4, while soluble chloride (Cl) was determined
    by titration with silver nitrate titration. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was determined
    by calcimeter method and following the method described by43. Electrical conductivity
    (EC) was measured by extracting the soil sample with water (1:1). To determine
    soil pH, soil samples were air-dried and sieved through a (1 mm) mesh sieve. Then
    10 g of soil sample was taken in a 100 mL beaker then 25 mL of distilled water
    was added and stirred well. By using digital electrodes (digital ionalyzer/501,
    Orion research multifunctional pH meter), soil pH was determined. The organic
    matter of the soil samples was extracted by taking 1g then sieved and added inside
    a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask and mixed with (10 mL 1 N potassium dichromate + 20
    mL H2SO4). The mixture was centrifuged gently for about 30 min. Subsequently,
    200 mL distilled water + 10 mL H3PO4) was added, the allow the mixture to cool.
    Then 15 drops diphenylamine indicator were added and the soil organic matter was
    estimated via titration with 0.5 M ferrous ammonium sulfate solution. Table 1

    The experiment was conducted in a split-plot design with five replications under
    a drip irrigation system. The experimental units were divided into four main groups
    representing irrigation regime schemes, i.e.: (A) 100% of the total calculated
    irrigation at all growth stages which represent normal irrigation conditions,
    (denoted, normal scheme), (B) 70% of irrigation water at the early vine development
    stage while applying 100% of the irrigation water at the remaining stages {represent
    long -term and moderate drought conditions at the early vine development stage,
    (denoted, Shv 70 scheme), (C) 70% of the irrigation water at the storage root
    bulking stage while applying 100% of the irrigation water at the remaining growth
    stages {represent short -term and moderate drought conditions at the storage root
    bulking stage (denoted, Shs 70 scheme), and (D) 85% of the irrigation water at
    the early vine development and storage root bulking stages while applying 100%
    in the remaining growth stages {represent prolonged and mildly drought conditions
    at the early vine development and storage root bulking stages (denoted, Prv + s
    85 scheme). Furthermore, there was a buffer zone between each irrigation unit
    of 3 m to prevent interactions and each plot was equipped with a manometer valve
    to control the operating pressure at 1 bar. The plots were also equipped with
    a flow emitter for discharge with 4.0 L h–1 to control the mounts of the targeted
    irrigation water requirements. In addition to tap water denoted control which
    was sprayed by hand sprayer (20 L volume), the plots of each main group were divided
    into five subgroups representing fertilization applications, which be listed as
    follows: (a) Chitosan (250 mg L−1) was applied as foliar application four times
    every 15-day interval, initiated after 6 weeks of transplanting, denoted CH; (b)
    Humic acid (0.5%) was applied as foliar application after 60 and 75 days from
    transplanting, denoted Hsp, (c) Humic acid as ground drench: 475 (kg ha−1) was
    applied beside the seedling two times after 60 and 75 days from transplanting
    at two equal doses (273.5 kg ha−1 humic for dose), denoted Hgd, (d) Chitosan as
    a foliar application at a rate of (250 mg L−1) in a combination with humic as
    a foliar application at a rate of (0.5%), denoted CH + Hsp, (e) Chitosan as a
    foliar application at a rate of (250 mg L−1) in a combination with humic as ground
    drench beside the transplants at a rate of (475 kg ha−1), denoted CH + Hgd. The
    humic was purchased from Egyptian Canadian for humate Co, the product had 65.0%
    humic substances (involving 13.0% active humic acid and 3% fulvic acid), and 5.0%
    potassium. While CH: is a high molecular weight that was purchased from Alpha
    Chemika Co, its solubility reaches about 97% in 1.0% acetic acid under continuous
    stirring, and the pH was adjusted to 5.6 using 1N NaOH. It worth to note that
    CH, Hgd, and Hsp application rates and intervals were implemented according to
    the manufacturer’s recommendations, and depended on the recommendations of previous
    study45,46,47,48 Therefore, based on the aforementioned, the net space of each
    experimental unit was 45 m2 (10.0 m long × 4.5 m width), accordingly, the experimental
    design involved 100 plots {4 irrigation schemes × 5 fertilizer applications × 5
    replicates}. The calculations of the irrigation amounts To calculate daily ETo,
    the irrigation amounts of the normal scheme were calculated by entering the obtained
    data from the toshka agrometeorological station, in CROPWAT package, version 8.0,
    then the crop evapotranspiration of sweet potato (ETc) was calculated according
    to Allen et al49. as the following equation: $${\\text{ETc }} = \\, \\left( {{\\text{ETo
    }} \\times {\\text{ Kc}}} \\right)$$ where ETc = Crop evapotranspiration (mm day−1).
    ETo = Reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1). Kc = Crop coefficient. Finally,
    normal scheme irrigation amounts were calculated according to the following equation:
    $${\\text{IR}} = \\frac{{{\\text{ETc}} + {\\text{Lr}}}}{{{\\text{Ei}}}}$$ where
    IR = Irrigation requirements (mm). ETc = Crop evapotranspiration (mm). Lr = Leaching
    requirement amounts (%), equaled 10 % since EC of soil solution is low, Lr was
    neglected. Ei = Irrigation system efficiency %, the efficiency for drip irrigation
    system = 85%. Accordingly, the total of calculated irrigation water amounts under
    different schemes that applied to the plants during the growing seasons of 2021
    and 2022 were: 9346, 8065.5, 8287, and 8175.8 (m3 ha−1), for normal scheme, Shv
    70 scheme, Shs 70 scheme, and (Prv + s 85) scheme, respectively, as demonstrated
    in Table 4. Table 4 Total irrigation water amounts throughout the different growth
    stages of sweet potatoes during the growing seasons of 2020/2021. Full size table
    Crop husbandry The experiment was prepared as recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture
    in Egypt for newly reclaimed soil. All treatments were equally fertilized, calcium
    superphosphate (15.5% P2O5) was applied to the soil in two portions one during
    tillage operation at the dose of 360 kg ha−1 and the other one at the dose of
    240 kg ha−1 after 30 days of transplanting. Potassium sulfate (48% K2O) at the
    dose of 288 kg ha−1 was applied in three equal portions after 60, 75, and 90 days
    of transplanting. Nitrogen in the form of ammonium nitrate (33.5% N) at the dose
    of 360 kg ha−1 was applied in three equal portions after 60, 75, and 90 days of
    transplanting. The sweet potato transplant (Beauregard cv) was conducted in the
    second week of April, during the two study seasons. The source of stem cuttings
    was the Egyptian company for sweet potatoes, Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt. The
    Beauregard cultivar is recommended as the high-yielding commercial cultivar. Moreover,
    this cultivar and the methodologies used in this study were consistent with international,
    national, and institutional guidelines and legislation. The transplants were approximately
    20–25 cm long and were grown on the ridges of the plots, and cultivated using
    25 cm spacing between transplants and 70 cm spacing between rows. After 140 days
    of transplanting the harvesting was done in both seasons. Measurements 1-the following
    data were recorded: A sample of 3 plants from each treatment was randomized 100
    days after transplanting to measure the percentage of leaf relative water content
    (RWC) in sweet potato leaves according to Afzal50 using the following formula:
    $${\\text{RWC}} = \\frac{{{\\text{FW}} - {\\text{DW}}}}{{{\\text{TW}} - {\\text{DW}}}}
    \\times 100$$ where FW: Actual weight of sweet potato leaves. DW: Dry weight of
    sweet potato leaves. TW: Turgid weight of sweet potato leaves. Additionally, the
    leaves from the top of the sweet potato plants were randomly collected in each
    plot. Then, the proline content was estimated using the leaves of the plant as
    described by Luo et al51. On the other hand, Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and
    potassium (K) (%) was determined in the dried leaves according to52,53,54, where
    the dried leaves were weighed and ground into a fine powder, then N contents were
    estimated by the Kjeldahl method, P contents were estimated by colorimeter methods
    using a spectrophotometer at 410-nm wavelength, and K contents were estimated
    using a flame photometer. 2-At harvest, the following data were recorded: A-Yield
    and its components: Vine fresh weight (kg m −2), tuber roots weight (kg plant
    −1), and total tuberous roots yield (kg ha−1): sweet potato tuberous roots weight
    taken on plot bases (kg). B-Tuberous root quality: To determine tuberous root
    quality five uniformly sized tuber roots from each treatment were cleaned, cut,
    dried, and ground. Then weighted for analysis: N, P, and K (%) in sweet potato
    tubers were determined by using the same methods as described above in leaves.
    Total carbohydrates: It was estimated by El-Katony et al55. methods. Briefly,
    0.5 g of the powdered tissue samples were extracted overnight with 5 mL of 80%
    ethanol, then for 10 min the extract was centrifuged, replicated with fresh ethanol,
    and mixed then dried under the vacuum. After that the residue was redissolved
    in 1 ml of distilled water. The soluble carbohydrate was measured using the glucose
    calibration curve. Protein: The protein of each treatment was recorded by multiplying
    the total nitrogen by the factor of 6.25 according to Chang and Zhang56. Soluble
    sugar: was determined according to Adu-Kwarteng57 by adding 10 mL of 80% aqueous
    ethanol to the tubes and incubating at 80–85 °C for 10 min to extract the soluble
    sugars, with intermittent mixing on a vortex stirrer. Then for 10 min at 1000 × g
    (3000 rpm), the tubes were centrifuged. Later, the supernatants were carefully
    poured off into 50-ml beakers; and re-suspended in another 10 mL of 80% ethanol
    with repeated this process. Then the supernatants were pooled to obtain the total
    extracts of soluble sugars, and the remain standard steps were followed. Carotene
    content: was estimated by using a spectrophotometer according to the method described
    by Qiang et al58. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) Mathematically (IWUE)
    according to Elshamly59, can be estimated by $${\\text{IWUE}} = { }\\left( {\\frac{{{\\text{GY}}}}{{{\\text{IW}}}}}
    \\right)$$ where IWUE = Irrigation water use efficiency (kg m−3) GY = Yield (kg
    ha−1) and IW = Total calculated irrigation water (m3 ha−1). Statistical analysis
    To determine the statistical differences between the treatments CoStat software
    version 6.303 was used Costat60, The means were separated through a revised least
    significant difference (LSD) test at the 0.05 level as per Casella61. At p ≤ 0.05,
    bars that have different letters are statistically significant. Moreover, different
    lowercase letters on error bars show statistically significant differences either
    for irrigation schemes (main plot treatments) or examine applications of chitosan
    and humic acid treatments (subplot treatments) or both. Ethics approval and consent

    and interaction effects of various irrigation schemes and (CH, Hsp, and Hgd) applications
    on: N concentration in leaves and tuberous The analysis of variance results (ANOVA)
    for the sole and interaction impacts on the investigated parameters demonstrated
    that there were significant differences in available N concentration in leaves
    as a consequence of the individual and interactions impacts. Table 5 showed the
    individual effects of adopting different irrigation water schemes and different
    applications of (CH and H) on the average N concentrations during both growing
    seasons, while (Fig. 1) showed the interaction impacts. In (Fig. 1A), by comparing
    the various irrigation water schemes in the tap water treatment, choosing Shv70
    irrigation water scheme, results in a significant reduction in N contents in the
    sweet potato leaves compared to the other irrigation schemes. Additionally, it
    was found that by comparing the impacts of examined applications on N concentration
    in sweet potato leaves, the solitary applications of Hsp attained higher N concentration
    by adopting normal irrigation scheme. While there were insignificant variations
    among the solitary applications of CH and control under the same irrigation scheme.
    Conversely, it was positive a significant variation could be achieved by adopting
    Hgd applications. Likewise, under the other irrigation schemes, it was found that
    the solitary applications of (Hsp and Hgd under Shv70 scheme or Prv + s 85 scheme)
    and (Hgd under Shs70 scheme) were significantly attained the better N concentrations.
    Concerning the interaction, the obtained results indicated that there were positive
    significant impacts by applying Hsp + CH applications under the normal irrigation
    scheme and applying Hgd + CH applications under the various stress irrigation
    schemes (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s 85 schemes). The findings showed that the combined
    applications of (Hgd + CH) under Prv + s 85 scheme attained the highest N concentrations
    in sweet potato leaves. While the lowest N contents were observed by applying
    tap water applications under Shv70 scheme. Table 5 The individual effects of adopting

    the early vine development and storage root bulking stages while applying 100%
    in the remaining growth stages, represent prolonged and mildly drought conditions).
    Full size image Based on the results in (Fig. 1B), executing Shv70 scheme under
    different examined applications attained the greater decreases in N concentration
    in the sweet potato tubers. By comparing the solitary applications of (CH, Hsp,
    and Hgd), applying solitary applications of Hgd led to attain the best increases
    in N concentration under (Shv70 and Shs70 schemes), relative to tap water treatment.
    Likewise, relative to tap water treatment, applying any solitary applications
    of (CH, Hsp, and Hgd) led to attain the best increases in N concentration under
    Prv + s 85 scheme. While under the normal scheme, N content attained the best
    increases by adding the solitary applications of Hsp applications. On the other
    hand, regarding the interaction impacts of the examined applications, the results
    indicated that there were positive significant impacts by applying Hsp + CH applications
    under the normal irrigation scheme and applying Hgd + CH applications under the
    remaining stress irrigation schemes. Generally, adopting the (Prv + s 85 scheme)
    and applying combined applications of (Hgd + CH) achieved the maximum increase
    of N concentration in sweet potato tubers, although that significantly equaled
    the adoption of the normal irrigation scheme x combined application of Hsp + CH.
    Similar to N concentrations in sweet potato leaves, the findings indicated that
    the lowest N contents in tubers were observed by applying tap water applications
    under the Shv70 scheme. P concentration in leaves and tuberous The analysis of
    variance results (ANOVA) for the sole and interaction impacts on the investigated
    parameters demonstrated that there were significant differences in P concentration
    due to irrigation schemes and examined applications. Table 5 showed the individual
    effects of adopting different irrigation water schemes and different applications
    of (CH and H) on the average P concentrations during both growing seasons, while
    (Fig. 2) showed the interaction impacts. By comparing the different irrigation
    water schemes in the tap water treatment (Fig. 2A), choosing Shs70 or (Prv + s
    85) irrigation water schemes, results in a significant enhancement for P contents
    in the sweet potato leaves compared to the normal irrigation schemes. Whereas
    P concentration was increased compared to the normal irrigation scheme by 11.0
    and 18.2%, respectively, in the tap water treatment. Conversely, there was a significant
    reduction by 6.2% could be obtained by adopting Shv70 irrigation scheme relative
    to the normal irrigation scheme under the same treatment. By comparing the solitary
    impacts of examined applications on P contents in sweet potato leaves, it was
    found that the solitary applications of Hsp attained higher P concentration by
    adopting normal irrigation scheme. While under the Shv70 scheme, there were positive
    significant variations by applying both solitary applications of (Hsp and Hgd).
    Finally, it was positive a significant variation could be attained by adopting
    Hgd applications under (the Shs70 scheme or Prv + s 85 scheme). Concerning the
    interaction, the obtained data showed that there was an equaled positive significant
    impact by applying both combined applications of (Hsp + CH) and (Hgd + CH) under
    the normal scheme, Shv70, and Prv + s 85 schemes. Conversely, the best significant
    improvements (15.4%) could be obtained by applying combined applications of (Hgd + CH)
    and adopting the Shs70 irrigation scheme relative to the normal scheme under tape
    water treatment. Overall, the findings showed that under the Prv + s 85 scheme,
    the highest P concentrations in sweet potato leaves could be attained by applying
    the solitary applications of Hgd. Although that significantly equaled by adopting
    the same irrigation scheme x applying both combined applications of (Hsp + CH)
    and (Hgd + CH). While the lowest P contents were observed by applying the both
    of tap water and CH applications under Shv70 scheme. Figure 2 The interactive

    the irrigation water at the early vine development and storage root bulking stages
    while applying 100% in the remaining growth stages, represent prolonged and mildly

    comparing the various irrigation water schemes in the tap water treatment, choosing
    Shv70 irrigation water scheme, results in a significant reduction in P concentration
    in the sweet potato tubers compared to the other irrigation schemes. On the other
    hand, by comparing the solitary applications, applying solitary applications of
    Hgd led to attain the best increases in P concentration under (Shv70, Shs70, and
    Prv + s 85) irrigation schemes, relative to tap water treatment. Conversely, applying
    solitary applications of Hsp led to attain the best increases in P concentration
    in the sweet potato tubers under the normal irrigation scheme. Also, it was observed
    that under CH treatment, there were insignificant variations among the plants
    by executing Shv70 scheme compared to the normal scheme. Concerning the interaction
    impacts, the obtained results indicated that there were positive significant impacts
    by applying Hsp + CH applications under the normal irrigation scheme and applying
    Hgd + CH applications under the various stress irrigation schemes (Shv70, Shs70,
    and Prv + s 85 schemes). Additionally, in contrast to (Hsp + CH), it was observed
    that under (Hgd + CH) treatment there were insignificant impacts by executing
    Shv70 scheme compared to the normal scheme. The findings showed that irrigated
    sweet potato plants with (Prv + s 85) irrigation scheme and applying combined
    applications of (Hgd + CH), improved the P concentration and achieved the maximum
    increase for P concentration in the sweet potato tubers. While the lowest P concentrations
    were observed by applying tap water applications under Shv70 scheme. K concentration
    in leaves and tuberous The analysis of variance results (ANOVA) for the sole and
    interaction impacts on the investigated parameters indicated that there were significant
    differences as a consequence of the individual and interaction impacts. Table
    5 showed the individual effects of adopting different irrigation water schemes
    and different applications of (CH and H) on the average K concentrations during
    both growing seasons, while (Fig. 3) showed the interaction impacts. According
    to the results in (Fig. 3A), by comparing the various irrigation water schemes
    in the tap water treatment, choosing Shv70 irrigation water scheme, results in
    a significant reduction in K concentration compared to the other irrigation schemes.
    While, by comparing the solitary applications of (CH, Hsp, and Hgd), applying
    solitary applications of Hgd led to attain the best increases in K concentration
    under the (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s 85 schemes), relative to tap water treatment.
    While under the normal irrigation scheme, applying the solitary applications of
    CH led to attain the best increases in K concentration in leaves compared to tap
    water application. On the other side, regarding the interaction impacts of the
    examined applications, the results indicated that applying the combined applications
    of Hsp + CH under the normal irrigation scheme led to attain the best increases
    in K concentration compared to (Hgd + CH) and tap water application. While applying
    the combined applications of Hgd + CH were pronounced under the (Shv70, Shs70,
    and Prv + s 85 schemes). Overall, the obtained results showed that K concentration
    in sweet potato leaves reached the peak by applying the combined applications
    of Hgd + CH and adopting the Shs70 scheme. On the other hand, adopting the Shv70
    scheme and applying tap water application attained the minimum value of K concentration.

    hand, the findings in (Fig. 3B) demonstrated that by comparing the various irrigation
    water schemes in the tap water treatment, choosing Shv70 irrigation water scheme,
    results in a significant reduction in K concentration compared to the other irrigation
    schemes. Likewise, by comparing the solitary applications of (CH, Hsp, and Hgd),
    applying solitary applications of Hgd led to attain the best increases in K concentration
    under (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s 85 schemes), relative to tap water treatment.
    While, relative to tap water treatment, applying the solitary applications of
    Hsp led to attain the best increases in K concentration under the normal scheme.
    On the other hand, regarding the interaction impacts, the results showed that
    there were positive significant impacts by applying Hsp + CH applications under
    the normal irrigation scheme. Likewise, applying Hgd + CH application under the
    (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s 85 schemes) (Shv70 and Prv + s 85 schemes), was pronounced
    to attain the best increases in K concentration. While under Shs70 irrigation
    scheme there was an equaled positive significant impact by applying both combined
    applications relative to tap water treatment. In general, relative to the normal
    scheme under tap water treatment adopting the Shs70 scheme and applying the sole
    application of Hgd, or either the combined applications of (Hsp + CH) and (Hgd + CH)
    achieved the maximum increase of K content in sweet potato tubers by (61.6, 60.2,
    and 64.5%), respectively. While the findings indicated that by adopting the Shv70
    scheme and applying tap water application achieved the minimum K concentration
    in sweet potato tubers. The individual and interaction effects of various irrigation
    schemes and (CH, Hsp, and Hgd) applications on Proline concentration Table 6 showed
    the individual effects of adopting different irrigation water schemes and different
    applications of (CH and H) on the average proline concentrations during both growing
    seasons, while (Fig. 4A) showed the interaction impacts. Based on the illustrated
    results in (Fig. 4A), by comparing the different irrigation schemes in the tap
    water treatment, adopting normal irrigation scheme, resulted in the minimum proline
    concentration. Conversely, it was shown that the proline concentration could be
    obtained by adopting the Shs70 or (Prv + s 85) schemes. It was found that by comparing
    the solitary effects of the examined applications, there were insignificant impact
    on proline by applying these amendments in a sole application under normal scheme.
    Conversely, adopting the various stress schemes (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s 85
    schemes) significantly increased the proline contents in sweet potato leaves.
    While concerning the interaction, the obtained data showed that there were positive
    significant impacts by applying Hgd + CH applications under the all the examined
    irrigation schemes. Overall, the findings showed that the highest proline contents
    (192.8 mg g−1), were obtained by adopting the Shv70 scheme and applying combined
    applications of (Hgd + CH). however, that significantly equaled the adoption of
    Shs70 irrigation scheme and applying the same combined application. While the
    lowest proline values were significantly obtained by applying the full irrigation
    amounts (normal scheme) and adding (tap water, CH, and Hsp applications). Table

    Full size image Carbohydrate content Table 6 showed the individual effects of
    adopting different irrigation water schemes and different applications of (CH
    and H) on the average carbohydrate concentrations during both growing seasons,
    while (Fig. 4B) showed the interaction impacts. Similarly, by comparing the examined
    applications under irrigation schemes in tap water treatments, the total carbohydrate
    content was enhanced when adopting Shs70 or (Prv + s 85) schemes, as can be seen
    in (Fig. 4B). While there were insignificant variations by executing the Shv70
    scheme compared to the normal scheme. By comparing the solitary applications of
    (CH, Hsp, and Hgd), applying solitary applications of Hgd led to attain the best
    increases in total carbohydrate content under (Shv70 and Shs70 schemes), relative
    to tap water treatment. While, applying any solitary applications of Hsp, led
    to attain the best increases in total carbohydrates content under the normal and
    Prv + s 85 schemes. On the other hand, regarding the interaction impacts of the
    examined applications, the data indicated that there were positive significant
    impacts by applying Hsp + CH applications under the normal irrigation scheme and
    applying Hgd + CH applications under the remaining stress irrigation schemes (Shv70,
    Shs70, and Prv + s 85). Generally, adopting the (Prv + s 85 scheme) and applying
    combined applications of (Hgd + CH) achieved the maximum increase in total carbohydrate
    concentration. While the findings indicated that the lowest total carbohydrate
    contents were observed by applying the solitary applications of Hsp under the
    Shv70 scheme. RWC percentage Table 6 showed the individual effects of adopting
    different irrigation water schemes and different applications of (CH and H) on
    the average RWC concentrations during both growing seasons, while (Fig. 5A) showed
    the interaction impacts. To maximize RWC percentage in sweet potato leaves, either
    avoid the Shv70 irrigation scheme or apply combined applications of the examined
    applications to provide protracted techniques, as can be seen in (Fig. 5A). By
    comparing the solitary applications, applying solitary applications of Hgd led
    to attain the best enhancements in RWC percentage under (Shv70 and Prv + s 85)
    irrigation schemes, relative to tap water treatment. Conversely, applying solitary
    applications of Hsp led to attain the best increases in RWC percentage in the
    sweet potato leaves under the normal irrigation scheme. Under the Shs70 scheme,
    the obtained results showed that both solitary applications of Hsp and Hgd were
    matched significantly in attaining the best RWC values. Also, it was observed
    that under CH and Hsp treatments, there were negative significant variations by
    executing the Shv70 scheme compared to the normal scheme. However, the most negative
    impacts were observed by applying the solitary applications of Hsp under the Shv70
    scheme. While there were insignificant impacts by applying Hgd applications and
    executing Shv70 scheme compared to the normal scheme. Concerning the interaction
    impacts, the obtained results indicated that there were positive significant impacts
    by applying Hsp + CH applications under the normal irrigation scheme and applying
    Hgd + CH applications under the various stress irrigation schemes (Shv70, Shs70,
    and Prv + s 85 schemes). The findings showed that by irrigating sweet potato plants
    with (Prv + s 85) irrigation scheme and applying combined applications of (Hgd + CH),
    improved the RWC percentage and achieved the maximum increase in the sweet potato
    leaves. While the lowest RWC percentage was observed by applying Hsp applications
    under the Shv70 scheme. Figure 5 The interactive impacts for the individual or
    combined application of humic & chitosan under normal and drought schemes on RWC

    and different applications of (CH and H) on the average carotene concentrations
    during both growing seasons, while (Fig. 5B) showed the interaction impacts. The
    superiority of (Hgd + CH) applications with normal or Shs70 irrigation schemes
    remains pronounced leading to an increase in carotene content, as can be seen
    in (Fig. 5B). By comparing the different irrigation schemes in the tap water treatment,
    adopting Shv70 and Shs70 schemes were significantly resulted in the minimum carotene
    content. Conversely, it was shown that the carotene content could be improved
    by adopting the Prv + s 85 scheme. It was found that by comparing the solitary
    effects of the examined applications, applying solitary applications of CH and
    Hgd led to attain the best increases in carotene concentration under the (Prv + s
    85) scheme, relative to tap water treatment. While under the normal irrigation
    scheme, applying the solitary applications of CH led to attain the best increases
    in carotene concentration compared to tap water application. Under the Shv70 irrigation

    under the stressful irrigation schemes. Overall, the data showed that the highest
    carotene contents were obtained by adopting the Shv70 scheme and applying combined
    applications of (Hgd + CH), although, that significantly matched with adopting
    the normal irrigation scheme and applying the combined application of (Hsp + CH).
    While the lowest carotene values were significantly obtained by adopting both
    irrigation schemes (Shv70 and Shs70) under the tap water treatment. Total sugar
    content Table 6 showed the individual effects of adopting different irrigation
    water schemes and different applications of (CH and H) on the average sugar concentrations
    during both growing seasons, while (Fig. 6A) showed the interaction impacts. According
    to the illustrated findings in (Fig. 6A), adopting the Shv70 irrigation scheme,
    resulted in the minimum sugar content in sweet potato tuberous. While it was found
    that to increase total sugar percentage, it was better to adopt the Shs70 irrigation
    scheme under different examined applications. By comparing the solitary applications,
    applying solitary applications of Hsp and Hgd led to attain the best increases
    in the total sugar percentage under the (normal, Shs70, and Prv + s 85) schemes,
    relative to tap water treatment. While, applying any solitary applications of
    Hsp, led to attain the best increases in the total sugar percentage under the
    Shv70 scheme. On the other hand, regarding the interaction impacts of the examined
    applications, the data indicated that there were positive significant impacts
    by applying Hsp + CH applications under the normal irrigation scheme. While a
    positive significant impact was matched by applying the both combined applications
    under the irrigation schemes of (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s 85). Generally, adopting
    the Shs70 scheme and applying either the applications of (Hsp + CH), (Hgd + CH),

    leaves under the Shs70 irrigation scheme. Concerning the interaction impacts,
    the obtained results indicated that there were positive significant impacts by
    applying Hgd + CH applications under the various irrigation schemes. The findings
    showed that by irrigating sweet potato plants with (Prv + s 85) irrigation scheme
    and applying both of the combined applications of (Hsp + CH) and (Hgd + CH), improved
    the vine fresh weight and achieved the maximum increase. Although, that significantly
    matched with adopting the normal irrigation scheme and applying the solitary applications
    of Hsp. While the lowest vine fresh weight was observed by applying tap water
    applications under Shv70 scheme. Tuber weight Based on the results in (Fig. 7B),
    with an exception of the combined applications, executing Shv70 scheme under the
    examined solitary applications decreased the tuber weight of sweet potatoes. By
    comparing the solitary applications of (CH, Hsp, and Hgd), applying solitary applications
    of Hgd led to attain the best increases in tuber weight under (Shs70 and Prv + s
    85 schemes), relative to tap water treatment. Likewise, relative to tap water
    treatment, applying any solitary applications of (CH, Hsp, and Hgd) led to attain
    the best increases in the tuber weight under the Shs70 irrigation scheme. While
    under the normal scheme, the tuber weight attained the best value by spraying
    the solitary applications of Hsp applications. On the other hand, regarding the
    interaction impacts of the examined applications, the results indicated that there
    were positive significant impacts by applying Hsp + CH applications under the
    normal irrigation scheme and applying Hgd + CH applications under the (Shv70,
    Shs70, and Prv + s 85 schemes) irrigation schemes. Overall, adopting the (Prv + s
    85 scheme) and applying combined applications of (Hgd + CH) achieved the maximum
    increase in the sweet potato tuber weight. While the findings indicated that the
    lowest tuber weight values were observed by applying CH applications under the
    Shs70 scheme. The individual and interaction effects of various irrigation schemes
    and (CH, Hsp, and Hgd) applications on Sweet potato yield The individual effects
    of adopting different irrigation water schemes and different applications of (CH
    and H) on the average sweet potatoes yield during both growing seasons are presented
    in Table 7, while (Fig. 8A) showed the interaction impacts. The analysis of variance
    results (ANOVA) for the sole and interaction impacts on the investigated parameters
    indicated that there were significant differences as a consequence of the individual
    and interactions impacts on the sweet potato yield. According to the results in
    (Fig. 8A), to improve sweet potato yield, (A) avoid the adoption of the Shv70
    irrigation scheme under the various examined applications except with solitary
    applications of Hgd; (B) apply combined applications of the (Hgd + CH) and under
    the both irrigation schemes of Shs70 and (Prv + s 85) to provide protracted techniques;
    (C) avoid the adoption of the (Hsp + CH) under the Shv70 irrigation scheme. The
    results indicated that by comparing the various irrigation water schemes in the
    tap water treatment, choosing Shv70 irrigation water scheme, results in a significant
    reduction in sweet potato yield compared to the other irrigation schemes. Also,
    by comparing the solitary applications, applying solitary applications of Hgd
    led to attain the best enhancements in sweet potato yield under (Shv70, Shs70,
    and Prv + s 85) irrigation schemes, relative to tap water treatment. Conversely,
    applying solitary applications of Hsp led to attain the best increases in sweet
    potato yield under the normal irrigation scheme. On the other hand, regarding
    the interaction impacts of the examined applications, the results indicated that
    applying the combined applications of Hsp + CH under the normal irrigation scheme
    led to attain the best increases in sweet potato yield compared to (Hgd + CH)
    and tap water application. While applying the combined applications of Hgd + CH
    under were pronounced under the (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s 85 schemes). Overall,
    the obtained results showed that sweet potato yield reached the peak by applying
    the combined applications of Hgd + CH and adopting the Shs70 scheme. However,
    that significantly matched with adopting the (Prv + s 85) irrigation scheme and
    applying the combined applications of Hgd + CH. On the other hand, adopting the
    Shv70 scheme and applying tap water application attained the minimum value of
    sweet potato yield. Figure 8 The interactive impacts for the individual or combined

    an exception of the combined application of (Hsp + CH), IWUE was increased by
    adopting the Prv + s 85 scheme, as can be seen in (Fig. 8B). By comparing the
    solitary applications of (CH, Hsp, and Hgd), applying solitary applications of
    Hgd led to attain the best increases in IWUE under the (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s
    85 schemes), relative to tap water treatment. While under the normal irrigation
    scheme, applying the solitary applications of Hsp led to attain the best increases
    in IWUE compared to tap water application. On the other side, regarding the interaction
    impacts of the examined applications, the data indicated that applying the combined
    applications of Hsp + CH under the normal irrigation scheme led to attain the
    best increases in IWUE compared to (Hgd + CH) and tap water applications. While
    applying the combined applications of Hgd + CH under were pronounced under the
    (Shv70, Shs70, and Prv + s 85 schemes). The obtained results showed that IWUE
    of sweet potato reached the peak by applying the combined applications of Hgd + CH
    and adopting Shs70 or Prv + s 85 schemes. While adopting the Shv70 scheme and
    applying tap water applications attained the minimum value of IWUE. Overall, the
    IWUE increased from the lowest recorded value (1.3 kg m−3) for the control Shv70
    scheme in the tap water treatment to the highest significant values (4.8 and 4.7
    kg m−3) for (Hgd + CH x Shs70 scheme) and (Hgd + CH x Prv + s 85 scheme), respectively.
    Discussion While sweet potato is considered a moderately drought-tolerant crop,
    research into its optimal water and fertilizer management across different growth
    stages in arid conditions has been largely overlooked. To increase yield and improve
    IWUE under such challenging environments, it is crucial to implement effective
    irrigation management strategies. These strategies should be complemented by enhancing
    the plant''s drought tolerance through the application of suitable supplementary
    treatments, as emphasized by Zhou et al62. This approach involves not just regulating
    water supply but also incorporating additional aids that support the plant''s
    resilience to water scarcity. Impacts of CH, Hsp, and Hgd under normal irrigation
    conditions on tuber yield and IWUE In this study, we investigated the effects
    of applying CH, humic acid as a soil drench (Hgd), and humic acid as a foliar
    spray (Hsp) under normal irrigation conditions. The results revealed that these
    applications, whether used individually or in combination, significantly influenced
    growth traits and helped improve IWUE. Specifically, while individual application
    of Hsp significantly enhanced tuber yield and IWUE, the combination of Hsp and
    CH proved to be more effective under the same irrigation conditions compared to
    other treatments. These findings align with Chen et al63, who noted that humic
    acid and chitosan can promote the growth and yield of sweet potatoes. The study
    posits that these effects may result from an imbalance in nutrient transport activities,
    particularly between the plant''s aerial parts and roots. The application of Hsp
    alone seemed to compensate for this imbalance, enhancing nutrient absorption,
    vine weight, and thereby yielding better results. Man Hong et al64.observed a
    similar phenomenon, noting that Hsp application primarily influenced the aerial
    parts of potato plants, with a delayed effect on root development. Moreover, the
    combined application of Hsp and CH under normal irrigation conditions achieved
    optimal yield and IWUE. This is attributed not only to the benefits of Hsp but
    also to the nitrogen content in CH. The addition of Hsp, with its acidic components,
    increased the solubility of CH, amplifying its positive effects. This observation
    is supported by Li et al65, who found that foliar application of humic acid can
    increase nitrogen contents. Yildirim66 also noted the significant impact of foliar
    humic in enhancing soil nutrient levels by promoting root growth and function,
    ultimately improving yield, a finding echoed by other studies39,46,63. However,
    it''s important to note that when sweet potato plants were irrigated according
    to their actual water needs (normal scheme), neither solitary nor combined applications
    achieved the highest yield. This may be due to increased soil water and nutrient
    contents under these conditions, leading to a shift from productive to vegetative
    growth (e.g., more leaves, taller vines), as also observed in other studies62,67
    This indicates that over-ideal conditions, such as over-irrigation or excessive
    nitrogen application, can lead to unfavorable outcomes like overgrowth of shoots
    and leaves, immature leaf development, and reduced storage processes in sweet
    potatoes. Impacts of various water stress schemes on sweet potatoes and the role
    of CH, Hsp, and Hgd under these conditions This study underscores the importance
    of avoiding prolonged drought stress in sweet potato cultivation and advocates
    for a moderate irrigation approach, particularly during the early vine development
    stage. The results indicate that the Shv70 irrigation scheme (70% of normal water
    supply during early vine development) leads to significant decreases in growth
    traits and yield. Consistent with previous findings17,18, sweet potatoes, though
    drought-resistant, are particularly vulnerable during the early vine development
    stage. The Shv70 scheme appears to push the plants past a critical threshold,
    adversely affecting their growth. In response to such stress, plants increase
    proline production, a protective mechanism under stress conditions, aligning with
    findings in68. During the early vine development stage, sweet potatoes prioritize
    forming a robust root system and then developing strong aerial tissues. However,
    under stress, these priorities shift, leading to an accelerated life cycle but
    with an underdeveloped root system, resulting in reduced nutrient absorption and,
    consequently, lower yields. In such stressful conditions, an effective fertigation
    strategy that minimizes drought effects and optimizes yield through the right
    combination of humic and CH applications is crucial. This study found that applying
    humic acid as (Hgd) alone, particularly under the Shs70 irrigation scheme (70%
    water supply during the storage root bulking stage), significantly improved IWUE
    compared to sole applications of CH and Hsp (humic acid as a foliar spray). This
    improvement can be attributed to the increased activity of the root system under
    stress, which becomes the primary driver of plant activities. By applying Hgd
    to the roots, enhanced nutrient absorption and storage are facilitated, leading
    to improved crop yield and IWUE, as supported by findings in69,70,71. Additionally,
    previous studies64,72 have shown that humic applications enhance crop resistance
    to drought stress and improve nutrient uptake and utilization, thereby increasing
    yield under less favorable water conditions. Humic acid applications have also
    been noted to improve soil properties in arid and semi-arid areas73,74. Furthermore,
    the study reveals that the highest tuber yields are achievable through the combined
    application of Hgd and CH, either under the Shs70 scheme or under a mild irrigation
    scheme throughout both the early vine development and storage root bulking stages
    (Prv + s 85). Under the Shs70 scheme, plants enhance (P and K) absorption and
    proline production, benefiting from an established root system from the previous
    stage, thereby improving tuber yield. These findings align with research in75,76.
    Moderate irrigation later in the season can slow leaf senescence, extend their
    functional period, and boost photosynthetic efficiency, as indicated by62. Feasibility
    of CH, Hsp, and Hgd in improving sweet potato resistance during the most sensitive
    stage to drought conditions In line with the earlier observation about the vulnerability
    of sweet potatoes to drought during the early vine development stage, the combined
    application of humic acid as Hgd and CH has shown promise in improving tuber yield.
    This enhancement can be attributed to the ability of these applications to mitigate
    drought impacts and create better growth conditions. Specifically, applying CH
    four times has been found to enhance sweet potato drought resistance. CH contributes
    to the formation of a transparent layer on the leaves, which reduces the transpiration
    rate and increases water content, thereby conserving water and enhancing IWUE.
    Adamuchio-Oliveira et al77. support this, indicating that foliar application of
    CH increases the thickness of the leaf blade, resulting in enhanced water storage
    within the tissue. Additionally, the amino proton group present in CH boosts photosynthesis
    rate and nutrient absorption, improving yield quality in terms of carbohydrates
    and proteins, as corroborated by findings in38,39,78,79. Furthermore, supplementing
    plants with Hgd under the same irrigation conditions amplifies the benefits, enhancing
    plant resistance to drought and, consequently, improving tuber yield. This is
    in line with research46,80, suggesting that Hgd application not only increases
    nutrient uptake but also enhances transport efficiency by chelating unavailable
    nutrients and lowering soil pH, as noted by Mackowiak et al81. These findings
    highlight the importance of proactively supplying plants with additional substances
    to fortify them against drought. Given that drought is among the most challenging
    environmental stresses to predict in terms of duration, occurrence, and severity82,83,
    adopting such strategies is crucial for ensuring crop resilience and maintaining
    productivity in the face of fluctuating and often harsh environmental conditions.
    Conclusion This study sheds light on the effects of drought on sweet potato plants,
    leading to several significant conclusions. Firstly, the early vine development
    stage of sweet potato plants is highly sensitive to drought conditions. This finding
    underscores the importance of proactively supplementing these plants with additional
    substances to bolster their defense against such unfavorable environmental stressors.
    Secondly, when sweet potatoes are irrigated normally, applying humic acid either
    alone (as a foliar application) or in combination with chitosan substantially
    improves both yield and water use efficiency. This observation suggests that even
    under conditions of adequate water supply, these treatments contribute positively
    to plant growth and productivity. Thirdly, the study finds that during periods
    of drought in the storage root bulking stage, using humic acid as a ground drench
    is more effective than either using chitosan alone or applying humic acid as a
    foliar spray. This highlights the importance of the application method and timing,
    particularly in relation to the specific growth stages of the plant, in effectively
    managing drought stress. Lastly, for achieving the highest yield and water use
    efficiency, it is crucial to expose sweet potato plants to a mild drought regime
    during both the early vine development and storage root bulking stages, while
    applying a combination of chitosan and ground drench humic acid. This approach
    appears to be the most effective in mitigating the undesirable effects of drought.

  description: The present work aimed to predict the fate of two pesticides, copper
    (Cu) and glyphosate in a Mediterranean basin with an intermittent river and to
    assess the ecotoxicological risk related to their presence in water bodies coupling
    field measurements of streamflow and pesticide concentrations, and an eco-hydrological
    model. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated and, subsequently
    used to assess predicted environmental concentrations of pesticides in surface
    waters. The ecotoxicological risk related to the presence of Cu and glyphosate
    in surface water was assessed at the reach scale by using the Toxicity to Exposure
    Ratio approach (TER). Measurements of glyphosate concentrations (< 0.5 μg l−1)
    exceeded the maximum European threshold of environmental quality standards for
    pesticides (EQS) of 0.1 μg l−1. High concentrations of glyphosate were predicted
    in the wet season and in September, when glyphosate is mostly used in vineyards
    and olive grove productions. Acute risk (TER < 100) associated with the presence
    of glyphosate was detected for several reaches. High concentrations of Cu (< 6.5
    μg l−1), mainly used as a fungicide in vineyards, were predicted in several river
    reaches. The results of the ecotoxicological risk assessment revealed that November
    and January were the critical months during which most of the river reaches showed
    a chronic risk associated with the presence of Cu.

    Article 12 March 2024 Groundwater recharge is sensitive to changing long-term
    aridity Article 12 March 2024 Arsenic and other geogenic contaminants in global
    groundwater Article 12 March 2024 Introduction Over the past century, the global
    population has swiftly increased, and in the current century, growth continues
    implying an increase in food needs1,2. In 2050, the population is projected to
    increase by 30% to approximately 9.2 billion3,4. Although, intensive agriculture
    was a tool to achieve a substantial increase in crop production, the high level
    of pesticide used is a threat to biodiversity, soil ecosystems, and water resources5,6,7
    Pesticides are largely used in intensive agriculture because they contain active
    substances able to kill unwanted insects, harmful fungi, or weeds8. But, pesticides
    can also derive from urban wastewaters due to the treatment carried out in parks,
    gardens or along roads and railways9. An active substance is \"persistent\" if
    its half-life in water is more than two months and, in soil or sediments, if it
    is more than six months10. The transport of pesticides residue through drift,
    runoff and leaching can lead to contamination of waters and soils at the basin
    scale11,12,13,14,15 or global scale, through long-range atmospheric transport
    phenomena16. Indeed, once pesticides are applied to crops, a fraction is intercepted
    by the foliage and a fraction reach the soil surface 17. Then, through various
    processes including foliar wash-off by rain, surface runoff, soil erosion, or
    percolation into the aquifer, dissolved or sorbed pesticide can end up in water
    bodies 5,9. Other fraction could be lost through wind drift and volatilization7,18.
    Several studies have shown that pesticides can affect the behaviour and physiology
    of aquatic organisms by hampering reproductive processes and reducing the entire
    community’s health19,20,21. Indeed, some compounds can cause reproductive and
    endocrine disruptions, inhibition of amino acid biosynthesis and neurological
    disturbances in fish and amphibians9. This effect could be enhanced in intermittent
    rivers, where the dilution effect is low due to the hydrological regime22,23.
    The use of pesticides in agriculture is currently under debate. Indeed, notwithstanding
    the unintended effects, the abolition of pesticides could cause a reduction up
    to 40% of the crop yield4. The actual environmental strategies such as the Transforming
    our world: the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development24 and the Farm to Fork
    strategy of the European Green Deal25 aim to secure food production and make an
    appropriate use of pesticides. In this context, the monitoring of pesticides in
    soil and waters is fundamental especially for those compounds of particular interest
    (priority substances) due to the possible related ecotoxicological risk26. However,
    since direct measurement can be costly in terms of time and economic resources,
    several studies, that target the identification and toxicity of single or mixed
    pesticides, used available monitoring data27,28. Hence, together with field measurements,
    models may be fundamental tools for water resources managers to analyse the transport
    and fate of pollutants in water bodies and to find critical source areas29. Several
    models such as MACRO30, PRZM (Pesticide Root Zone Model)31, SPIDER (Simulating
    pesticides in ditches to assess ecological risk)32 and SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment
    Tool)33 have been developed in recent decades to simulate the fate of pesticides34,35.
    SWAT is a spatially distributed and physically based model that was developed
    in the 1990s by the United States Department of Agriculture—Agricultural Research
    Service (USDA-ARS)33. This model is one of the most commonly used to simulate
    the fate and transport of pesticides at the basin level due to the possibility
    to evaluate the compound contamination considering different scenarios of Best
    Management Practices (BMPs), climate and land use changes36,37. Many papers report
    SWAT model implementations to simulate hydrology38, sediments39,40,41, nutrients42,
    and pesticides29,43. However, few published papers reported studies on monitoring
    and modeling pesticide concentrations in small intermittent rivers23. Indeed,
    difficulties may arise when modeling hydrological regime and water quality of
    these rivers due to the limited data availability, and to the extremely low flow
    and zero-flow44. The general aim of the present work was to develop a specific
    methodological approach to assess pesticide concentrations and the corresponding
    ecotoxicological risk in an intermittent river system in order to identify critical
    river reaches and timing. The specific objectives were (i) to quantify the predicted
    environmental concentration (PEC) and loads delivered to the semi-enclosed sea
    “Mar Piccolo” of Cu and glyphosate and, (ii) to identify the river reaches with
    Toxicity to Exposure Ratio (TER) beyond the threshold of ecotoxicological concern.
    The SWAT model ability in predicting pesticides in the surface waters was tested
    in a complex case study: the Canale d''Aiedda basin (SE Italy), which included
    karstic areas and limited data availability (e.g. streamflow, point source discharge,
    pesticide concentration in surface waters, pesticide application rate). The results
    will contribute to increase the knowledge concerning pesticide modeling (i.e.
    pesticides parameterization) in intermittent river systems. In addition, the methodological
    approach for assessing the ecotoxicological risk at the reach scale can give an
    important contribution to the decision-makers. Materials and methods Study area
    The Canale d''Aiedda basin is located in the province of Taranto, in the Apulia
    region in southern Italy. The river flows into the semi-enclosed sea called “Mar
    Piccolo”. The banks and the bed of the river system are almost all covered by
    concrete. The hydrological regime is natural and intermittent in the upstream
    part of the basin, while it is almost perennial, in the remaining area, due to
    the presence of the discharges from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs),
    located in the municipalities of Montemesola, Monteiasi, and San Giorgio Ionico
    (Fig. 1a). The total drainage area, excluding the upstream karst formations, is
    222 km2 (360 km2 with karst areas), the average altitude is 168 m a.s.l., between
    0 and 517 m, and the average slope is 2.7 °5. The climate is Mediterranean and
    classified in the Koppen cold semi-arid climates class (BSk). The average annual
    rainfall (period 2000–2020; Grottaglie station) varies between 352 and 907 mm,
    and is characterized by intense and short events in summer and autumn. The average
    temperatures (period 2000–2020; Grottaglie station) are 5.2 ° in January and 32.8
    ° in August. The soil textures vary from silty-clay to sandy loam. In the north-eastern
    edges of the basin, fractured limestone carbonate rocks, with a high water infiltration
    rate that recharges the deep groundwater aquifer, characterize the Canale d’Aiedda
    lithology. The particular hydrogeological structure generates a consistent groundwater
    discharge which flows in submarine springs (locally called “citri”)46. The basin
    is mainly agricultural (88.9%) while only 10% is urbanized. The vineyards cover
    an area of 36.3% the olive groves cover 24.5% and the durum wheat cover 28.1%.
    Among the other crops there are almond trees, grasses, tomato, orange groves,
    and arable land (i.e. pastures, set aside land). Natural areas, such as forests
    and rangeland cover 5% of the surface (Fig. 1b). Before to reach the Mar Piccolo,
    the river flows within the “Regional Natural Reserve Palude la Vela” which belongs
    to the Site of Community Importance (SIC) “Mar Piccolo” (IT9130004). Here the
    vegetation is characterized by Mediterranean maquis, mostly made up of myrtle,
    mastic, and holm oak which are able to offer shelter and food to many sedentary
    species (e.g. grey herons and finch) and migratory birds (e.g. flamingoes and
    curlews)46,47,48. Figure 1 (a) Study area: Canale d’Aiedda basin, Apulia Region
    (SE, Italy). (b) Land use of Canale d’Aiedda basin. (QGIS version 3.4.13. https://www.qgis.org/it/site/).
    Full size image Monitoring Historical streamflow and water quality data were unavailable
    for the study area. In 2017, two flow measurement stations (MDS Dipper-PT, © 2019
    Seba Hydrometrie, Kaufbeuren, Germany) were installed on the main course of the
    stream and programmed to monitor the streamflow on a sub-hourly time scale (Fig.
    1a). Streamflow was monitored continuously from August 2017 to December 2019.
    Surface water samples for pesticide analyses were collected twice a month for
    a year (January to December 2021) very close to one of the hydrometric stations
    of the Canale d''Aiedda basin (Fig. 1a). For each sample a 1.5 L of water was
    collected in PET bottle and stored in a refrigerator. The analyses were carried
    out by an certified laboratory (methods 1495-CH-12 and 195-CH-39, for all compounds
    except for Cu) based on gas/liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry (limit of
    quantification < 0.5 μg l−1). The method used for Cu determination was the 11-A
    (UNI EN ISO 17294–2:2016; limit of quantification 0.5 μg l−1). A large number
    of compounds (i.e. 560 pesticides and 6 metabolites) were investigated. Only traces
    of Cu and glyphosate were found. Cu was quantified in the totality of samples
    with a median concentration value of 2.1 μg l−1 (maximum concentration 6.2 μg
    l−1). Glyphosate instead was quantified in only eight sample with a median concentration
    of 0.29 μg l−1 (maximum concentration value of 0.42 μg l−1) (Fig. 2). Figure 2

    Full size image SWAT model In this work, the hydrological and water quality model
    SWAT was used33. The model divides the basin area into sub-basins and in turn
    into Hydrological Response Units (HRU), the basic unit for the water balance calculations,
    which are based on defined thresholds referring to land use, topography, and soil
    properties17. The surface runoff is computed with the Soil Conservation Service
    Curve Number method (SCS-CN)49, while landscape and the in-stream sediment are
    obtained through the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation MUSLE50 and the Bagnold
    stream power Equation51, respectively. The Hargreaves52, Penman–Monteith53 and
    Priestly–Taylor54 methods can be used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration17.
    The movement of the pesticide in the land phase (e.g. wash-off, degradation and
    leaching) is computed by equations derived from GLEAMS55. Specifically, the model
    considers that a fraction of the pesticide can be intercepted by the leaves, and
    a fraction can reach the soil, both through direct application or leaves wash-off.
    The latter process will occur when the rainfall of a given day exceeds 2.54 mm17.
    Moreover, a part of pesticide can be degraded in both soils and leaves. The amount
    of degraded pesticides depends on the number of days required to reduce the concentration
    of a given pesticide by half, or the half-life. Pesticides characterized by high
    solubility in water and low soil adsorption coefficient normalized for soil organic
    carbon (SKOC) can percolate into soil profiles and, consequently into the groundwater
    system17. Soluble and sorbed pesticides which move from the land to the stream,
    through runoff lateral flow and percolation, are calculated by algorithms taken
    from EPIC50. Then, the processes which involve the transformation and the transport
    of pesticides in streams, such as degradation, volatilization, settling and resuspension,
    are simulated by using mass balance equations implemented by Chapra56. SWAT allows
    to simulate only one pesticide at a time for runs which have to be activated through
    the IRTPEST function in the .bsn file17. Model results can be assessed at different
    spatial (e.g. basin, subbasin and reach scale) and temporal (e.g. daily, monthly,
    yearly) scales17,44. SWAT model setup Due to the position of the karst areas and
    to the absence of flow within the river network, confirmed by field surveys carried
    out periodically in the studied period, the karst areas were cut out of the basin
    boundary, since they were considered as not contributing to the streamflow57.
    The river basin was divided into 40 sub-basins and 271 Hydrologic Response Units
    (HRUs) discretized through thresholds of 10%, 10%, and 20% of land use, soil classes,
    and slopes, respectively. SWAT was run from 1997 to 2021, on a daily time scale,
    including a three-year warm-up period. The Hargreaves method was used to calculate
    PET, while the SCS-CN method was used for surface runoff45. As reported in table
    A1 (supplementary file), the following inputs were included to set up the model:
    topography (DEM) land use, soil map, soil properties, agricultural management
    practices and pesticide applications, weather data. Concerning WWTPs, volumes
    and water quality data on the monthly time scale were collected from Regional
    Agency for Environmental Protection and Apulian Water Authority. Data from 7 meteorological
    stations (Fig. 1a) from 1997 to 2021 on a daily time scale were used. For the
    same period of time, inlets from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were
    included. Agricultural practices (i.e. fertilization, tillage, pesticide application,
    and irrigation) were included into the management database of SWAT using data
    retrieved from direct interviews and from the agricultural census46. Twenty-one
    classes for land use and eleven for soil type were identified in the basin. Three
    shallow tillages were applied in olive groves. Fertilizers were spread in April
    (urea and 12-8-8) and in August (13-46-00). A total amount of 500 m3ha−1 of water
    was given to the crop from June to September. Two shallow (10 cm) operations were
    applied for the vineyards in February and May, while one deep (35 cm) tillage
    was applied in October. Fertilizer were spread in February (12-12-17 and 10-5-15),
    October and in November (manure for both). A total amount of 2400 m3ha−1 of water
    was given to the crop from May to September. A three-year rotation was considered
    for durum wheat (durum wheat–herbage–set aside). For the durum wheat, a deep and
    a shallow tillage operation were applied in August and October, respectively.
    Fertilizers were spread in December (25-15-00) and in February (urea). For orchards
    and for the other minor land uses, for which data were unavailable, a deep and
    a shallow tillage operation were applied in spring and autumn, respectively, and
    the irrigation and the fertilization were set as automatic45. Due to the absence
    of conservative practices in the study area the USLE P (Universal Soil Loss Equation—Support
    practice factor) factor was set to 145,47. For pesticides it was assumed that
    Cu sulphate (98%) was the main copper-based pesticide applied in vineyards as
    fungicide, olive groves as bactericide, and orchards (i.e. citrus fruits) as fungicide.
    Since no reliable data on Cu application (amount) were available, as farmers didn''t
    provide precise information, the application rates were assumed based on the current
    European regulations, which authorize a total maximum amount of 28 kg of Cu per
    hectare over 7 years58. Specifically, for olive groves, treatments were carried
    out in spring (April) and after the harvest in Autumn–Winter (September, October,
    November, December and January depending on the harvest period). Also in the vineyards,
    the treatments were carried out in Spring (April, May and June) and after the
    harvest (October and November depending on the harvest period). In the other orchards,
    treatments were carried out in Autumn–Winter (October, November, December and
    January) and in spring (May). Monthly loads of Cu in the effluent from the WWTPs
    were also included in the model setup (source: http://www.arpa.puglia.it/web/guest/depuratori).
    Roundup (granular soluble in water), whose active substance is glyphosate, is
    a systemic herbicide to be used for the control of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous
    weed species (annual, biennial, or perennial). For vineyard productions it was
    applied in spring (March, April) in pre-flowering, at the end of spring in suckering
    (May), and in mid-November, December to avoid re-infestation. For olive groves,
    it was applied near flowering (end of March), or for pre-harvest (September) weeding
    of pitches. In addition, glyphosate was applied also in durum wheat (April, July
    and October) and orchard cultivations (February, March and October). Specifically,
    on durum wheat, glyphosate was applied in pre-seeding because if applied before
    maturity, it can accumulate in the development of the grains sufficiently to affect
    germination59. Due to the absence of data on the applied amount, an application
    rate of 2.28 kg ha-1 of the active substance (equivalent to 3.16 kg product ha-1)
    was considered following the Roundup safety data sheet. Data regarding the glyphosate
    attribute (i.e. Koc, wash off fraction, foliar and soil half-life and water solubility)
    were included in the SWAT database. For the Cu the model was adapted by adding
    the compound in the pesticide database. The main attributes were retrieved from
    the research carried out by Serpa et al.36 and from the International Union of
    Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) website (http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/iupac/Reports/178.htm).
    Model calibration The model was calibrated for hydrology, using continuous measurements
    from both the gauging stations (A and B), from August 2017 to December 2019 (at
    the daily time scale), and for pesticides by using discrete sampling carried out
    during 2021 close to gauge A (Fig. 1). The SWAT-CUP (SWAT-Calibration and Uncertainty
    Programs) tool by means of the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) algorithm
    was used for the sensitivity analysis and for both the calibration processes60.
    For both hydrology and pesticides, only the calibration was performed. This strategy
    was adopted in order to include the different hydrological conditions (wet and
    dry) and, because of the limited number of measured data45. Additional details
    about the hydrological calibration are reported into Ricci et al.45,57. The set
    of parameters (Table 2) used for the pesticide calibration was retrieved from
    both the literature and from the SWAT manual43,61,62. Initial values of some parameters
    such as “Degradation half-life of the chemical on the soil” (HLIFE_S), “Degradation
    half-life of the chemical on the foliage” (HLIFE_F), “Wash off fraction” (WOF),
    “Application efficiency” (AP_EF), “Solubility of the chemical in water” (WSOL),
    and SKOC were derived for Cu from the research carried out by Serpa et al.36 and
    from the IUPAC website (http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/iupac/Reports/178.htm),
    and for glyphosate from the pesticide appendix of the SWAT manual61,63. Model
    performance was assessed by using Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias
    (PBIAS), and coefficient of determination (R2). In general, the model simulation
    was assumed as “satisfactory” if NSE > 0.50 and R2 > 0.50, and if PBIAS ± 25%
    and as “good” if NSE > 0.65, R2 > 0.60 and PBIAS ± 15 for streamflow; meanwhile
    for pesticides, the same value suggested for nutrients or PBIAS ± 70% (satisfactory)
    and PBIAS ± 40% (good) were considered64. Ecotoxicological risk assessment The
    ecotoxicological risk related to the presence of Cu and glyphosate in surface
    water was assessed at the reach scale by using the TER approach65 for the chronic
    and the acute risks. The chronic and the acute risks can be defined as the “adverse
    effects on any living organism in which symptoms develop slowly over a period
    of time (often the lifetime of the organism) or reoccur frequently” and the “adverse
    effects on any living organism that results from a single dose or single exposure
    of a chemical”, respectively66. A two-step approach was adopted, first the TER
    for chronic risk was evaluated, then the TER for acute risk. The TER for chronic
    risk was evaluated with the following equation (Eq. 1)65: $$TER=\\frac{NOEC}{PEC}
    \\le 10$$ (1) where: NOEC is the No Observed Effect Concentration, which is defined
    as “the highest concentration tested at which the substance is observed to have
    no statistically significant effect (p < 0.05) when compared with the control,
    within a stated exposure period”67,68; PEC is the Predicted Environmental Concentration,
    which is provided by the model at the reach scale67,68. The TER for acute risk
    was evaluated by using the following equation (Eq. 2)65: $$TER=\\frac{{L(E)C}_{50}}{PEC}
    \\le 100$$ (2) where: L(E)C50 is LC50 (“the toxicant or effluent concentration
    that would cause death in 50% of the test organisms”) or EC50 (“median effective
    concentration at which 50% of the test organisms die”). Both LC50 or EC50 can
    be used depending on the available data67,68. Following the European Commission
    Regulation 546/201165, the chronic risk was assessed for algae, daphnia and fish,
    while the acute risk for daphnia and fish. Moreover, the most sensitive aquatic
    species (i.e. lower values of NOEC or L(E)C50) were also considered if different
    from the species indicated by the Regulation65. NOEC and L(E)C50 were derived
    from the IUPAC database (http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/iupac/Reports/178.htm,
    http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/iupac/Reports/373.htm). Specifically, to assess
    the chronic risk for glyphosate, the NOEC was 1000 μg l−1 (Fish—Brachydanio rerio—Chronic
    21 day), 12,500 μg l−1 (Daphnia—Daphnia magna—Chronic 21 day) and 2000 μg l−1
    (Algae—spp—Chronic 96 h NOEC). To assess the acute risk, the L(E)C50 was 100,000
    μg l−1 (Fish—Oncorhynchus mykiss—Acute 96 h), 100,000 μg l−1 (Daphnia—Daphnia
    magna—Acute 96 h) and 10,000 μg l−1 (Sediment dwelling organisms – Chironomus
    plumosus—Acute 96 h). For the chronic risk for Cu the NOEC was 970 μg l-1 (Fish—Oncorhynchus
    mykiss—Chronic 21 day) and 57 μg l-1 (Daphnia—Daphnia magna—Chronic 21 day). No
    value for algae was reported. For the acute risk the L(E)C50 was 13,200 μg l−1
    (Fish—Oncorhynchus mykiss—Acute 96 h) and 2300 μg l−1 (Daphnia—Daphnia magna—Acute
    96 h). The risk was considered unacceptable when TER < 10 for chronic exposure
    and TER < 100 for acute exposure65. Maps were designed for the chronic risk, while
    graphs were reported for the acute risk accordingly with the results. Results
    Hydrological calibration The results of calibration, considering the statistical
    performance, were satisfactory for gauge (A) with R2 R2 = 0.48, NSE = 0.47, and
    PBIAS = − 4.2% and good for gauge (B) with R2 = 0.72, NSE = 0.71, and PBIAS =  + 5.1%
    (Table 1). The streamflow was overestimated in gauge A (PBIAS = − 4.21) and underestimated
    in gauge B (PBIAS =  + 5.05) (Table 1)45,57. For both the gauging stations the
    SWAT model simulated well the main peaks (i.e. gauge A: the highest measured peak
    was 0.27 m3s−1 and the simulated peak was 0.31 m3s−1; gauge B: the highest measured
    peak was 2.67 m3s−1 and the simulated peak was 2.85 m3s–1), the normal flow (0.095
    m3 s−1 > Q > 0.012 m3 s−1) was underestimated (i.e. gauge A: Qobs = 0.04 m3s–1
    and Qsim = 0.03 m3s–1; at gauge B: Qobs = 0.05 m3s−1 and Qsim = 0.04 m3s–1), and
    the low flow (Q < 0.012 m3 s−1) was generally overestimated (i.e. gauge A: Qobs = 0.015
    m3s−1 and Qsim = 0.03 m3s−1; gauge B: Qobs 0.008 m3s−1 and Qsim = 0.02 m3s−1)
    (Fig. 3A; Fig. 3B)45,57. At the basin scale the modelled surface runoff (118.52
    mm) was 19.3% of the modelled precipitation (612.80 mm), while the modelled total
    water yield (146.84 mm; Surface runoff + baseflow + lateral flow) was 25%, and
    modelled transmission losses (41.99 mm) were 6.8%. The modelled potential evapotranspiration
    was 1186.4 mm. Table 1 Calibrated parameters for the best-fit simulation of streamflow

    r_ corresponds to the multiplication of the original values by 1 + the value reported
    in the row. Values in bold represent the final range of the parameter57. For the
    hydrological calibration some parameters, such as the Curve Number (CN2.mgt),
    the factor which controls the transmission losses from main channel (TRNSRCH.bsn),
    the hydraulic conductivity of the main channel (CH_K2), the deep aquifer percolation
    (RCHRG_DP) and the Manning’s roughness (CH_N2) of the main channel, were very
    sensitive and, therefore fundamental for the process45. Chemicals calibration
    The lists of the parameters used for glyphosate and Cu calibration and their fitted
    values are reported in Table 2. The results of the calibration in terms of statistical
    analysis were satisfactory for Cu with R2 = 0.63, NSE = 0.50, and PBIAS = 21.6%,
    and good for glyphosate with R2 = 0.78, NSE = 0.57, and PBIAS = 6.8%. However,
    the loads, estimated by the SWAT model were underestimated for both Cu (PBIAS = 21.6%)
    and glyphosate (PBIAS = 8.7%) (Fig. 4). Table 2 Calibrated parameters, description,
    and their fitted values. Full size table Figure 4 Comparison between daily simulated
    and observed loads: (a) Copper; (b) glyphosate. Full size image v_ corresponds
    to the replacement of the original value with the new values reported in the row.
    The most sensitive parameters for both Cu and glyphosate were the soil adsorption
    coefficient normalized for soil organic carbon (SKOC.dat), the application efficiency
    (AP_EF.dat), the pesticide percolation coefficient (PERCOP.bsn) and the reaction
    coefficient in reach bed sediment (SEDPST_REA.swq). In addition, parameters related
    to the sediment routing (i.e. SPCON.bsn, SPEXP.bsn, ADJ_PKR.bsn, and LAT_SED.hru)
    resulted sensitive for Cu and the half-life of the chemical into the soil (HLIFE_S)
    was sensitive for glyphosate. Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) In 2021,
    the results of the SWAT model showed that the mean annual PEC of Cu ranged from
    0.00 μg l−1 to 245 μg l-1 in the reaches defined in the river network (Fig. 5a)
    (highest value in reach 9, Fig. A1 supplementary file). The maximum PEC of Cu
    was modeled in the reaches located in the northern part of the area, corresponding
    to sub-basins where vineyards, olive groves, and durum wheat were the main agricultural
    productions (Fig. 5a) and main soil textures were clay and sandy-clay (Fig. A2
    supplementary file). At the basin outlet, the annual load in surface waters, delivered
    to the Mar Piccolo predicted by the model was 69.45 kg y−1, corresponding to 0.08%
    of the total amount applied on the fields. These results suggest that net of drift
    losses, the most of the Cu applied is in soil and it can be both lost by leaching
    or involved in settling and resuspension processes. For Cu no Environmental Quality
    Standard (EQS) were fixed neither by the national regulations nor by the European
    Directives. The EQS defines a threshold value below which no adverse impact on
    the human health or on the environment occur. At the European level, Directive
    98/83/EC has set a value of 2000 μg l−1, as the threshold limit for drinking water,
    meanwhile, the Italian Legislative Decree 31/2001, and subsequent amendments defined
    a more restrictive value equal to 1000 μg l−1. The PEC of Cu in the totality of
    the river reaches was always below this threshold. Figure 5 Predicted Environmental
    Concentration (PEC) for Cu (a) and glyphosate (b) for the year 2021. The value
    0.1 μg l−1 was the Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) for glyphosate. (QGIS
    version 3.4.13. https://www.qgis.org/it/site/). Full size image In the same period,
    the mean annual PEC of glyphosate predicted by the model in the reaches ranged
    from 0.00 μg l−1 to 8.50 μg l−1 (Fig. 5b) (highest value in reach 33, Fig. A1
    supplementary file). The annual load delivered to the Mar Piccolo was 71.94 kg
    y−1 corresponding to 0.1% of the applied amount. Net of wind drift losses, glyphosate
    mostly accumulates in the top-soil layers, and it may be lost through suspended
    sediment69 . In several reaches, the PEC of glyphosate exceeded the EQS fixed
    for generic pesticides (of 0.1 μg l-1) by the European Union (EU) Directive (EU)
    2020/218470 and by the Italian Decree 172/201571. It is a legally binding limit
    for individual substances, mainly used in Europe. Around the world, there is no
    unique definition. For instance, in the USA and Canada, the terms Ambient Water
    Quality Criteria and Water Quality Guidelines are used, respectively72. The SWAT
    model simulated the highest PECs of glyphosate in the river reaches located in
    the upstream subbasins of the study area, where the main crops were vineyards
    and olive groves, durum wheat, and ryegrass (Fig. 5b) and main soil textures were
    clay, clay-loam and sandy-clay (Fig. A2 supplementary file). Ecotoxicological
    risk assessment The chronic ecotoxicological risk was evaluated, for both compounds,
    on a monthly scale for the year 2021. Figure 6 reports the maps of the months
    in which the ecotoxicological risk for the Cu for fish was detected for at least
    one reach of the river network. November and January were the critical months
    during which much of the river reaches showed TER < 10, which means chronic exposure.
    For daphnia instead, since the NOEC was much lower than the one for fish, most
    of the months showed a TER < 10 for at least one river reach. January, November
    and December were the most critical months (Fig. A3). This result was mainly due
    to the combination of the two factors: the high surface runoff that occurred during
    those months and the Cu applications. For fish during the dry period (from May
    to October), the river did not show an ecotoxicological risk associated with the
    presence of Cu in the water column. Indeed, from May to October, the rainfall
    amount and surface runoff are very low within the basin, therefore also the amount
    of Cu delivered to the stream is low. A chronic ecotoxicological risk was instead
    identified for daphnia (Fig. A3). Figure 6 Maps of the monthly chronic toxicity
    to Exposure Ratio (TER) for the copper for fish (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (2021).
    Red and yellow indicate the reaches under high exposure. (QGIS version 3.4.13.
    https://www.qgis.org/it/site/). Full size image The results for the acute risk
    associated with the presence of Cu showed TER values < 100 for fish in almost
    all the river reaches in January, November, and December. During these months
    Cu was largely applied on olive groves, vineyards and orchards and high rainfall
    occurred. The river was not at risk in May, June, and July (Tab A2). The river
    reaches at risk were located in the same areas where high PEC values were found
    (Fig. 5a). The duration of the overruns was mostly lower than 24 h (h). Details
    about the reaches and frequencies of occurrence of acute risk are reported in
    table A2 (supplementary material S1). Figures A4a–c report an example of three
    events in which TER was found < 100 of durations 72 h, 48 h, and 24 h, respectively.
    The figure refers to three different reaches (22, 34, and 32; Fig. A1 supplementary
    file). For daphnia TER was < 100 for the whole period, with a duration of the
    overrun mostly higher than 96 h. For glyphosate no chronic risk was detected based
    on the model results, neither for fish daphnia and algae. The results for the
    acute risk showed no risk for fish and daphnia and TER values < 100 for sediment
    dwelling organisms in March, April, November and January. During these months
    glyphosate was applied in most land uses (Olives, wheat and vineyard) and high
    rainfall occurred. The river reaches in which acute risks was detected were located
    in the same areas in which the PEC exceeded the EQS (Fig. 5b). The duration of
    these overruns was generally lower than 24 h. Details about the reaches and frequencies
    of occurrence of acute risk are reported in table A3 (supplementary material S1).
    Figure 7a–c report an example of three events in which TER was found < 100 of
    durations 72 h, 48 h and 24 h, respectively. The figure refers to three different
    reaches (6, 13 and 8; Fig. A1 supplementary file). The most important factor influencing
    the glyphosate peaks of concentration is the streamflow. As Fig. 7a,b show the
    peak of concentration precedes the peak of streamflow, contrarily in Fig. 7c the
    peak of streamflow precedes the peak of glyphosate. This is due to the fact that
    in the first case the area contributing to the drainage is small and close to
    the subbasin outlet, while in the second case the contribution of pesticides comes
    from remote areas (Fig. A1 supplementary file). In a sequence of flood events,
    the peak of glyphosate was not simulated in the second flood (Fig. 7a) suggesting
    a rapid dissipation of the substance. Figure 7 Concentration for glyphosate (red
    line), streamflow (blue line) and precipitation for three events in 2021. The
    green line represents the concentration limit for the acute risk for sediment
    dwelling organisms (Chironomus plumosus). (a) reach 6, 72 h, (b) reach 13, 48
    h and (c) reach 8 24 h. A map of the reaches is reported in Fig. A1 in the supplementary
    file. Full size image Discussion The application of the eco-hydrological models
    in Mediterranean basins with intermittent streams can be particularly difficult39,44,45.
    Working with limited data or with low concentrations of pollutants, which are
    common characteristics of small river basins in the Mediterranean Region, complicates
    the implementation and calibration of models73. For this reason, it is very important
    to accurately build a methodological approach as well as an expert judgment for
    selecting information, data, and methods to better describe the processes. For
    the pesticide assessment, the definition of the application plan (i.e. timing
    and amount) in relation to the meteorological data was found to be extremely important,
    since it regulates processes, such as wash-off, infiltration, and surface runoff
    to be activated or not. Model performances in simulating hydrology may be low
    in basins with temporary river systems74,75. In the dry season, the flow appears
    and disappears along the river network depending mostly on the lithology and geology
    of the area and secondarily on the rainfall regime, therefore, the assessment
    of the low flow and dry conditions is affected by a great uncertainty. In the
    Canale d’Aiedda, the SWAT model performed better for hydrology at gauge B (180
    km2), with a larger drainage area, than for gauge A (37 km2). This is because
    some parameters have to be set at the basin scale. For instance, the parameter
    TRNSRCH.bsn, which controls the fraction of transmission losses from the main
    channel, can be calibrated only at the basin scale, therefore, it produced an
    overestimation at gauge A and an underestimation at gauge B57. In both gauges,
    the main peaks were well estimated, the normal flow was only slightly underestimated
    and the low flow was slightly overestimated. Difficulties in calibrating the low
    flow can be related to the constant values of discharge from WWTPs adopted as
    input that led to having an abiding simulated flow curve. Daily values of WWTP
    discharge may improve modelling results45. Moreover, uncertainties may be due
    to the parameterization of multiple factors (e.g. groundwater, topography, surface
    water exchanges with the subsoil, and management practices)38. To improve the
    simulation of the peak flow, the parameterization of the curve number (CN2.mgt)
    and the Manning’s roughness of the main channel (CH_N2.rte) had an important role.
    Indeed, these two parameters are strictly related to the runoff formation process
    and to the flow velocity17. Also, the parameterization of the fraction of percolation
    between the root zone and the deep aquifer (RCHRG_DP.gw) was very important in
    improving the simulation of the baseflow17,61. The SWAT model simulates one pesticide
    at a time62, therefore, two different calibrations were performed, one for Cu
    and one for glyphosate, without changing hydrological parameters. Generally, sediments
    play a crucial role in the modeling of pesticide in surface water76. This was
    particularly true for Cu calibration, where the parameters related to sediment
    concentration and routing were fundamental. Indeed, the transport of Cu into the
    streamflow occurs predominantly in the suspended sediment absorbed form77. Also
    the soil adsorption coefficient parameter (SKOC.pest.dat) was sensitive. The value
    calibrated value for this parameter was slightly lower than the value reported
    by Serpa et al.36 Despite being soluble in water, glyphosate can easily also be
    adsorbed by soil and transported in suspended sediment69,78. Indeed, the soil
    adsorption coefficient parameter (SKOC.pest.dat), which controls the ratio between
    the pesticide concentration sorbed to the solid phase and the concentration in
    solution, resulted very sensitive in the calibration process. The calibrated value
    of this parameter is low respect the values reported in the IUPAC database, however
    in lines with the values reported the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database
    (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/). The degradation half-life of the chemical
    on the soil (HLIFE_S.pest.dat) was also relevant for calibrating glyphosate. The
    calibrated value is slightly higher respect to the range reported in the IUPAC
    database. However, this parameter is highly variable and can range from a few
    days up to one or two years, depending on environmental conditions, such as temperature
    and soil humidity, and also on soil properties and agricultural practices79,80,81.
    The SWAT model performed satisfactory and good for Cu and glyphosate, respectively.
    However, it underestimated measured concentrations for both compounds. This could
    depend on the fact that SWAT does not simulate the drift loss which occurs during
    a pesticide application44,82, it is still unable to spatially reflect the fate
    of the drifted part of particles explicitly due to oversimplification39. Other
    sources of uncertainty, which could have influenced the results, are related to
    the quality and quantity of measurements (i.e. discrete data instead of continuous
    data) used for the calibration and to the temporal discrepancy between the calibration
    of the streamflow and the calibration of the pesticides concentration57. Similarly,
    the input data (i.e. application rates of the pesticides), which were derived
    from regulations or from the safety sheet, could be affected by a large uncertainty
    and they have had a key role in the modelling pesticides concentrations39,83.
    Therefore, the results could be improved by using data retrieved from farmers.
    This study evidenced that Cu and glyphosate are used in extensive agriculture
    basins. The two main crops in the study area are vineyards and olive groves. Since
    the end of the nineteenth century, Cu has been used in vineyard productions as
    a fungicide84. According to investigations by Mackie et al.85, major applications
    of Cu as a fungicide are applied by spraying directly on the vine canopy to fight
    downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) from May to August. On olive groves, it is
    a common practice to use a copper-based bactericide to provide protection against
    olive knots (Pseudomonas savastanoi), and further sprays, generally applied in
    the spring to improve control of other disease86. Frequent applications or a high
    application rate of Cu could be phytotoxic, especially when applying it at high
    temperatures or in dry weather87,88,89. Indeed, the Commission Implementing Regulation
    (EU) 2018/1981 limited the use of Cu at 28 kg ha−1 in a 7 years period58. In the
    Canale d’Aiedda, Cu showed high chronic ecotoxicological risk at the monthly scale
    in several river reaches. January and November were the months in which the higher
    number of reaches showed a TER < 10. This can be related both to the treatments
    and to the rainfall events. Indeed, the rainfall in November 2021 was 172.75 mm
    and in January 2021 was 46.55 mm. This study highlights that, in the study area,
    Cu delivered by the river (69.45 kg y−1) may accumulate in the sea environment
    affecting the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate
    the accumulation of heavy metals in marine sediments of the Mar Piccolo. Glyphosate
    is one of the most widely used non-selective herbicides in the world90. It acts
    only in post-emergence and is particularly effective when weeds are actively growing.
    The excessive dosage of glyphosate is of concern for the effects on the environment9.
    Although the leaching of glyphosate is limited, its continuous use can lead to
    a pollution of the shallow groundwater91. In surface waters, glyphosate converts
    very swiftly to its primary metabolite (i.e. AMPA) which is more persistent and
    harmful92, with a soil half-life higher than glyphosate. In 2016, the Italian
    Ministry of Health banned the use of glyphosate in agriculture and in the countryside,
    in all phases prior to wheat harvesting. Moreover, the WHO reclassified glyphosate
    as a probable carcinogen substance93. In 2019, the European Chemical Agency (ECHA)
    classified glyphosate as a dangerous and toxic substance to aquatic organisms94.
    This was also confirmed in 2022 by ECHA Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) (https://echa.europa.eu/it/-/glyphosate-no-change-proposed-to-hazard-classification).
    Experiments demonstrated the genotoxicity on fish of Roundup95,96. In this context,
    monitoring activities and modeling the transport of glyphosate is needed to identify
    critical river reaches where mitigation measures could be implemented. Concerning
    glyphosate, the concentrations in river exceeded the EQS for surface waters. However,
    no reaches showed a chronic ecotoxicological risk related to the presence of glyphosate.
    In 2021, the analysis carried out at daily scale for glyphosate revealed that
    some reaches showed acute risk. In most of them the peak of concentration last
    24 h, only a few cases showed a duration of 72 h. Also in the case of acute toxicity
    a relation between the peak of concentration and the rainfall was observed. The
    acute risk cases mainly occurred in April and November, when glyphosate treatments
    were generally applied. In the study area, glyphosate delivered by the contaminated
    river (71.94 kg y−1) may accumulate in the marine environment affecting the aquatic
    ecosystem, and the structure and function of aquatic communities. Therefore, further
    studies are needed to investigate the accumulation and impact of glyphosate in
    marine sediments of the Mar Piccolo. Neither Cu nor glyphosate are identified
    as priority substances by the Directive 2013/39/EU97 nor are they included in
    the Watch List within the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/84098. The
    EU did not provide specific limits for these substances in surface waters43. However,
    also non-priority compounds can be potentially harmful to aquatic life99,100.
    Currently, the review process of EQSs is still ongoing. No specific EQS has been
    fixed for glyphosate, whereas for generic pesticides EQS is 0.1 μg l−170,71. The
    study highlighted that in the Canale d’Aiedda, some measures should be adopted
    to avoid inappropriate and intensive use of pesticides. Best Management Practices
    (BMPs) and Nature-based solutions (NBSs) should be promoted to reduce water and
    soil pollution. The methodological approach proposed in this work allows us to
    identify the areas under ecotoxicological risk within a river basin. However,
    the selection of the most suitable BMP or NBS requires further analysis which
    involves the local environmental policies and the economic feasibility for both
    the public and the private sector and to remove the barriers constituting a limit
    in the NBS adoption. Conclusions Going beyond a case study, this work turns out
    to be fundamental to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of SWAT to simulate
    the fate and transport of pesticides in the surface runoff of an intermittent
    hydrological regime basin with a Mediterranean climate. Low rainfall, flow intermittence,
    and the limited data availability that characterize the Mediterranean basins make
    the modeling of pesticides a challenge. In this work, Cu and glyphosate were modelled
    with results ranging between satisfactory and good. The results, obtained after
    the calibration, show that the SWAT model was able to simulate Cu and glyphosate
    concentrations in a Mediterranean environment. However, improvements in the algorithm
    are desirable to correctly simulate wash-off threshold and drift in the Mediterranean
    environment. Moreover, improvement in the computation of the pesticide loads will
    be useful to better assess the model results. Indeed, SWAT provides only results
    at a reach scale and not at the HRU level. This study highlighted that Cu and
    glyphosate are largely used in extensive agriculture basins. The methodological
    approach defined in this work, which was based on field measurements (streamflow
    and pesticide concentrations) coupled with modeling, proved to be able to able
    to evaluate the PEC and the ecotoxicological risk associated to the presence of
    Cu and glyphosate within the river network. In the Canale D’Aiedda case study,
    the results of monitoring and modeling activities revealed a chronic risk associated
    with the presence of Cu from November to April in several river reaches and acute
    risk associated to the presence of glyphosate in several reaches mainly in the
    wet season. The most important factor influencing the chronic risk for Cu were
    the combination of two factors: the high surface runoff and the Cu applications.
    The most important factor influencing the glyphosate peaks of concentration is
    the streamflow. The event based analysis shows a rapid dissipation of the substance.
    Further studies are needed to investigate the ecotoxicological effect of multiple
    pollutants. This work lays the basis for future investigations (i.e. sustainable
    scenarios analysis) aiming at mitigate the concentrations of pesticides in surface
    water. Data availability All data generated or analyzed in the current study are

    215 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate instability directly affects
    agro-environments. Water scarcity, high air temperature, and changes in soil biota
    are some factors caused by environmental changes. Verified and precise phenotypic
    traits are required for assessing the impact of various stress factors on crop
    performance while keeping phenotyping costs at a reasonable level. Experiments
    which use a lysimeter method to measure transpiration efficiency are often expensive
    and require complex infrastructures. This study presents the development and testing
    process of an automated, reliable, small, and low-cost prototype system using
    IoT with high-frequency potential in near-real time. Because of its waterproofness,
    our device—LysipheN—assesses each plant individually and can be deployed for experiments
    in different environmental conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN
    integrates multiple sensors, automatic irrigation according to desired drought
    scenarios, and a remote, wireless connection to monitor each plant and device
    performance via a data platform. During testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive
    enough to detect and measure plant transpiration, from early to ultimate plant
    developmental stages. Even though the results were generated on common beans,
    the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops. This tool serves to screen
    transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related physiological
    traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design, LysipheN will
    be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and breeding context.
    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board
    temperature, the inside stem temperature (inserted thermocouple), and soil temperature
    together with air RH and calculated VPD. GU1 to GU5 studied younger (PCS) plants
    (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 studied plants close to the final harvest
    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for

    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of

    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.

    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: In recent decades, numerous studies have examined the effects of climate
    change on the responses of plants. These studies have primarily examined the effects
    of solitary stress on plants, neglecting the simultaneous effects of mixed stress,
    which are anticipated to transpire frequently as a result of the extreme climatic
    fluctuations. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of applied chitosan
    on boosting the resistance responses of peanuts to alkali and mixed drought-alkali
    stresses. Peanuts were grown in mid-alkaline soil and irrigated with full irrigation
    water requirements (100%IR), represented alkali condition (100% IR × alkali soil)
    and stress conditions (70% IR × alkali soil—represented mixed drought-alkali conditions).
    Additionally, the plants were either untreated or treated with foliar chitosan.
    The study evaluated various plant physio-chemical characteristics, including element
    contents (leaves and roots), seed yield, and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE).
    Plants that experienced solitary alkali stress were found to be more vulnerable.
    However, chitosan applications were effective for reducing (soil pH and sodium
    absorption), alongside promoting examined physio-chemical measurements, yield
    traits, and IWUE. Importantly, when chitosan was applied under alkali conditions,
    the accumulations of (phosphorus, calcium, iron, manganese, zinc, and copper)
    in leaves and roots were maximized. Under mixed drought-alkali stresses, the results
    revealed a reduction in yield, reaching about 5.1 and 5.8% lower than under (100%
    IR × alkali), in the first and second seasons, respectively. Interestingly, treated
    plants under mixed drought-alkali stresses with chitosan recorded highest values
    of relative water content, proline, yield, IWUE, and nutrient uptake of (nitrogen,
    potassium, and magnesium) as well as the lowest sodium content in leaves and roots.
    Enhances the accumulation of (N, K, and Mg) instead of (phosphorus, calcium, iron,
    manganese, zinc, and copper) was the primary plant response to chitosan applications,
    which averted severe damage caused by mixed drought-alkali conditions, over time.
    These findings provide a framework of the nutrient homeostasis changes induced
    by chitosan under mixed stresses. Based on the findings, it is recommended under
    mixed drought-alkali conditions to treat plants with chitosan. This approach offers
    a promising perspective for achieving optimal yield with reduced water usage.

    Open access 03 January 2024 Introduction The southern region of Egypt is situated
    in a hyper-arid zone, which is distinguished by summertime temperatures that consistently
    surpass 40 °C1 and lacks any annual precipitation2. Moreover, the lands in this
    region are predominantly sandy and frequently exhibit various issues related to
    inadequate nutrient availability and water retention3,4. Furthermore, the induction
    of alkali stress via NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 results in additional stress5. Consequently,
    elevated temperatures, alkalinization, evaporation, and nutrient deficiency can
    be detrimental to plant development. The improvement of these alkali soils by
    the reclamation process can be achieved through various techniques. These techniques
    encompass the application of adequate quantities of high-quality water in well-drained
    conditions, the leaching process utilizing soluble calcium to substitute sodium6,7,
    and the development of salt-tolerant crop varieties8. However, the implementation
    of breeding as a remedy has thus far yielded only modest results in terms of creating
    tolerant crop varieties9. Likewise, in numerous regions across the globe, including
    Egypt, the acquisition of alternative reclamation techniques is hindered by the
    scarcity of freshwater resources. Certain farmers have been compelled to deviate
    from the optimal reclaim recommendations that ought to be attained by decreasing
    the quantity of water utilized for leaching. Hence, under these circumstances,
    salts accumulate in the rhizosphere as a result of inadequate water amounts and
    high evaporation rates9, which has numerous negative effects on plant growth due
    to salt and drought stresses10. Therefore, there is a need for more research to
    make land reclamation more sustainable in similar environments. In this respect,
    the present study examines the viability of peanut plants as an additional reclaim
    method that can be maintained under drought-mild alkali stress conditions (with
    a salt content of no more than 3% and a pH range of 7.1–8.5)5. Given its relatively
    high drought tolerance, peanuts are capable of thriving in a variety of challenging
    environments11. Under drought or alkali environments, peanut has the potential
    to improve soil macronutrients. In this concern, Kebede12 demonstrated that as
    a legume species, peanut has distinctive effects on nitrogen assimilation via
    symbiotic relationships with microorganisms, including rhizobia, which fix atmospheric
    nitrogen and make it accessible to the roots for absorption. Moreover, peanuts
    have been found to enhance phosphorus and potassium availability under drought-
    alkali conditions13. However, Gentili et al.14 indicate that the availability
    of the majority of macronutrients is not the primary issue in alkaline soils,
    where it is increased. On the contrary, the availability of micronutrients, particularly
    iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn), exhibited a general decline. The reduced
    concentrations of these elements have the potential to detrimentally impact the
    growth of plants. Given the significant role that these nutrients play in alleviating
    the combined abiotic stressors15,16. Hence, in addition to the aforementioned
    advantages associated with planting peanuts in such conditions, prior research
    has demonstrated that peanut plants can improve the availability of micronutrients
    when irrigated17,18. Prior research by Duchene et al.19, Guinet et al.20 provided
    an explanation for this concern: peanut plants can increase nutrient absorption
    under normal irrigation conditions by increasing root exudates (ethylene release
    from their roots), which reduce soil acidity and improve the availability of insoluble
    soil nutrients21. However, the precise mechanism by which peanut plants improve
    their nutrient absorption in the presence of mixed drought and alkali stresses
    is still unknown. In typical growth conditions, numerous environmental stresses
    have a detrimental impact on the yield of several key crops1,22. Therefore, numerous
    plant species exhibit diverse molecular, physiological, and biochemical responses
    to distinct abiotic stresses. These include the synthesis of organic solutes,
    the closure of stomatal pores, the regulation of ion uptake by the roots, the
    accumulation of ions in particular plant organs (e.g., leaves), and the reduction
    of water potential in plant tissues23,24,25,26. Therefore, it is critical to acquire
    a thorough understanding of the monitoring of peanut responses in the presence
    of diverse stimuli. In a region where the achievement of that objective would
    safeguard more than 900 million hectares from drought-induced alkali damage5.
    On the other hand, despite the drought tolerance of peanuts, the prolonged water
    stress that occurs during the flowering stage and pod filling continues to have
    detrimental effects on yield, as previously noted27,28. Therefore, the present
    study posits the hypothesis that when plants are under drought stress, they will
    exhibit a diminished capacity to absorb water and nutrients. Since the transportation
    of mineral nutrients from the soil to the organs of plants is intricately linked
    to water29. Additionally, when plants are under stress, they will employ specific
    mechanisms to tolerate such conditions30,31. In the interim, it is worth considering
    whether exogenous applications of chitosan would be more effective in improving
    water status within plant tissues. In this regard, chitosan (CH) has garnered
    significant attention as a viable strategy to mitigate the detrimental consequences
    of abiotic stress32,33,34. The utilization of antitranspirant materials, including
    CH, demonstrated significant potential in prolonging soil moisture retention,
    thereby delaying the advent of abiotic stress and ultimately improving IWUE30,35,36.
    A multitude of studies have identified a variety of advantages associated with
    the utilization of CH, such as improved plant transpiration, enhanced growth,
    chemical versatility, nutrient availability, and carboxylation efficiency in the
    presence of abiotic stressors32,37,38. Furthermore, the utilization of CH resulted
    in an increase in the content of photosynthetic elements, which in turn promoted
    stress tolerance39. Moreover, CH possesses a distinctive bioactive characteristic
    that can restrain serious injury to plants by stimulating their defense mechanisms40,
    when exposed to stressful conditions. Consequently, the implementation of CH may
    represent an optimal strategy for mitigating the adverse effects of drought-alkali
    combined stress10,41. However, the effects of CH applications on nutrient reorganization
    or enhancement, as well as on plant responses that could mitigate the detrimental
    effects of unfavorable conditions on peanut crops, remain poorly understood. Drawing
    from the previously mentioned data, drought and alkali stress can occur concurrently
    in many regions of the globe, and they have severely impeded plant development
    in the agricultural sector worldwide. Nevertheless, the majority of research has
    primarily concentrated on the effects of individual types of stress, with relatively
    little emphasis placed on the consequences of drought-alkali mixed stress. Therefore,
    the current study aimed to A) Assess the effects of alkali and drought-alkali
    combined stress conditions on the growth, nutrient assimilation, carbohydrate
    content, chlorophyll, root-water content (RWC), proline, yield, and IWUE of peanuts.
    Also, this research was conducted to B) Examine the impact of CH application on
    nutrient homeostasis between the leaf and root of peanuts under conditions of
    mixed drought-alkali and alkali stress. And C) Assess the viability of improving
    the aforementioned parameters by implementing CH under these demanding conditions.
    Materials and methods The experimental site and design The current experiment
    was conducted during the two summer seasons between May and September (2021/2022)
    at the experimental farm of Water Studies and Research Complex (WSRC), south of
    Egypt (22° 24'' 11'''' N, 31°, 35'' 43'''' E). The experimental area lies in arid
    climatic conditions. The average monthly data of maximum and minimum temperature,
    relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed were acquired from Toshka agrometeorological
    station during the consecutive cultivated seasons (2021/2022) presented in Table
    1. The irrigation water came from a well was dug in the studied area with chemical
    characteristics are depicted in Table 2. Prior initiating the experiment, soil
    samples were taken from the topsoil layer (0–60 cm), right next to the plant (between
    5 and 10 cm from the plant). The physical and chemical properties of the experimental
    soil were determined according to Estefan et al.42 and are presented in Table
    3. To fulfill the purpose of the current study, the experiment layout was conducted
    in a split-plot arrangement on the basis of a randomized complete block design
    with four replications. The main plots were assigned to irrigation levels, while
    sub-plots were dedicated to the two foliar applications. The experiment consisted
    of 4 treatments and 16 experimental plots. The net space (10.0 m long × 4 m width)
    of each experimental unit. Two irrigation water levels, i.e., 100 and 70% of the
    peanut irrigation water requirement were evaluated in the current study, denoted
    IR100 and IR70. Table 1 The average weather data from the experimental site throughout
    the period (May to September) during the 2021/2022 growing seasons. Full size

    of the soil at the experimental site, Full size table Based on the chemical properties,
    the soil pH was alkaline (mean pH = 8.08). Therefore, the IR100 plot represented
    (alkali conditions), and the plants were irrigated by the full irrigation requirements.
    While, IR70 plot was represented (mixed drought-alkali stresses conditions), whereas
    the plants were grown in alkaline soil and irrigated by the limited irrigation
    requirements. The IR70 was chosen based on a previous study was tested various
    irrigation regimes on peanut crops in the same climatic conditions17. The subplots
    were divided into two groups, namely control and CH. After six weeks of emergence,
    peanut plants were pretreated by foliar applications of CH (500 mg L−1), which
    was purchased from Alpha Chemika Co. The molecular weight of this product is (6 × 103
    kDa), deacetylation (82.4%), solubility (97% in 1% acetic acid), and viscosity
    (3275 cps). The CH solution was prepared by following a standardized method43
    where: A solution of chitosan (5%) was prepared by adding high molecular weight
    of CH to 5% V/V glacial acetic acid solution on stirring at a pace of 500 rpm
    for 12 h on hot plate stirrer (ARE Heating Magnetic Stirrer). To stabilize the
    aqueous and to plays as a sticking agent in each spray, two drops of the tween
    80 (polysorbate 80) were added, pH of CH solution was adjusted to 4.5 by adding
    0.5 M NaOH and then filtered. Plants were sprayed with distilled water as a foliar
    application in the control treatment. The Foliar application of CH was applied
    four times (30, 45, 60, and 75 days), after the sowing date. All sprays for [CH—distilled
    water (control)] were performed by a hand pressure sprayer. Previous studies were
    used to determine the appropriate concentration range of CH (500 mg L−1)44,45.
    Planting operations The peanut seeds (CV Giza 6) were obtained from the agricultural
    research center, Egypt. Before planting, peanut seeds were inoculated with the
    symbiotic N2—fixing specific rhizobium bacteria (Rhizobium japonicum strains)
    which was prepared by the Soil Microbiology Dept., Soil, Water and Environment
    Res. Inst., Agricultural Research Center (ARC), Egypt. The seeds were recommended
    as a high-yielding commercial cultivar. Moreover, these seeds and the implemented
    methods in the current study complied with international, national, and institutional
    guidelines and legislation. The coating seeds process was carried out using Arabic
    gum solution as a sticking agent46,47. As recommended by the Egyptian agriculture
    ministry, two seeds were sown in holes on May 5 and May 10 in the first and second
    growing seasons, respectively, at a rate of 120 kg seeds ha−1. Each sub-plot contained
    four planting rows that were 10 m in length with a spacing of 75 cm between the
    rows. A peanut plant density of 160,000 plants ha−1 was attained by sowing at
    a distance of 25 cm between plants on the rows. During the growing seasons, all
    agriculture practices were applied according to the recommendations set by the
    Ministry of Agriculture. Where nitrogen was applied as ammonium nitrate (33.5%
    N) at a level of 322 kg ha−1. This amount was divided into 6 equal doses, applied
    after 15 days of the sowing date; and repeated every 3–4 days with a rate of 60
    kg ha−1 per portion till the flowering stage. Phosphorus in the form of superphosphate
    (15.5% P2O5) was added at a level of 715 kg ha−1, in one dose before planting.
    Potassium in the form of potassium sulfate (48% K2O) was added in two equal portions
    at a level of 180 kg ha−1 before and during the flowering growth stage. On the
    other hand, during the study period, no pesticides were applied. Water requirements
    assessment Irrigation system After full emergence and standardization of the numbers
    of peanut plants per plot at (960 plants plot−1), peanut plants were irrigated
    following the two irrigation water levels. A set sprinkler irrigation system was
    used to irrigate peanut plants. Each irrigation plot was equipped with a manometer
    valve to control the operating pressure at 2.5 bar. Additionally, the plots were
    equipped with a flow emitter to control the mounts of the targeted irrigation
    water level. Moreover, to avoid interactions between plots there was a distance
    of 9 m buffer zones. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) The soil moisture parameters
    were measured before the experiment was initiated. After that, the reductions
    in the soil moisture were recorded, till it reaches to 45% of the available water,
    which a previous study indicated it was the critical limit on yield48. Accordingly,
    based on this knowledge the irrigation event was set every 2 days. The amounts
    of water requirement were calculated by the CROPWAT, version 8.049 (a computer
    program for irrigation planning and management) combined with a climatic database
    those obtained from Toshka agrometeorological station. Taking into consideration
    that the reference evapotranspiration of peanuts (ETo) was determined based on
    Fao Penman–Monteith, following the recommendations of Allen et al.50. ETc for
    peanuts was determined according to Waller & Yitayew51 as follows: $${\\text{ETc
    }} = \\, \\left( {{\\text{ETo }} \\times {\\text{ Kc}}} \\right),$$ where ETc = crop
    evapotranspiration (mm day−1), ETo = reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1),
    Kc = crop coefficient, dimensionless, (was equaled 0.60, 0.76, 0.88, 0.78, and
    0.63 for Kc initial, Kc development, Kc mid, Kc late, and Kc harvest according
    to Zayton et al.52. Each plot received amounts of irrigation water, calculated
    according to Elshamly53 as follows: $$\\mathrm{IR }=\\frac{[\\left({\\text{Etc}}\\times
    {\\text{Dd}}\\right)+{\\text{Lf}}]}{{\\text{Es}}}$$ where: IR = calculated irrigation
    water requirements (m3 ha−1), Etc = crop evapotranspiration, Lf = leaching water
    requirement 10%, Dd = time intervals, Es = irrigation system efficiency, 0.78.
    The amount of IR70 treatment was proportionally obtained from the IR100. The peanut
    plants were irrigated with limited irrigation level only in the development and
    flowering growth stages. Accordingly, the average total seasonal amounts of IR
    were 8522 and 7075 m3 ha−1 for the IR100 and IR70, respectively. Chemical and
    physiological measurements After 65 days of sowing date Relative water content
    (RWC) Nature and number of the samples In order to measure the RWC of peanut,
    ten plants in each plot were taken. Then one fully expanded leaf was taken from
    each plant resulting in 10 leaves per plot, and repeated four times. The measurement
    The leave samples were detached and immediately weighed to determine fresh weight
    (FW). After re-hydration for 24 h at 25 °C in darkness chamber, turgid weight
    (TW) was determined. Then, after oven-drying in 75 °C for 72 h dry weight (DW)
    was recorded. RWC ratio calculated based on Ref.26 as follows: $${\\text{RWC}}=\\frac{{\\text{FW}}-{\\text{DW}}}{{\\text{TW}}-{\\text{DW}}}\\times
    100$$ Determination of total chlorophyll content, total carbohydrates, and proline
    Nature and number of the samples From ten different plants, located in the middle
    of the plot, the upper three leaves of the main stem of each peanut were collected,
    resulting in 30 leaves per plot, and repeated four times. After removing the leaves
    from the selected plant, the total chlorophyll content, total carbohydrates and
    proline contents were measured as follows: The measurement of total chlorophyll
    content In the first, 0.2 g of peanut leaf samples were dried and powdered. Then
    the samples were added to ethanol (80%), homogenized, and stirred for 3 h. The
    solvent was evaporated, after that the residues was mixed with distilled water
    and is ready for the following analysis54. Then, the total chlorophyll determination
    as per El-Saadony et al.55. To measure the total chlorophyll, the extractor was
    centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min followed by the removal of debris. The absorbance
    of the supernatant was measured by using a spectrophotometer at 645 and 663 nm
    for chlorophyll (a and b) respectively. The average total chlorophyll expressed
    as (μg g−1) was obtained as follows: $$\\mathrm{Total \\,chlorophyll }=\\mathrm{chlorophyll
    \\,a }+\\mathrm{chlorophyll \\,b}$$ The measurement of total carbohydrates content
    Total carbohydrates expressed as (%), were determined by standard calibration
    curve of glucose method as described by El-Katony et al.56. Where, 0.5 g of the
    peanut leaf samples were air-dried and ground into a powder and then the aliquots
    were mixed with anthrone reagent (8.6 mM anthrone in 80% v/v H2SO4). Then on a
    water bath at 80 °C for 10 min, the mixture was boiled, then cooled for 30 min
    on the ice. Finally, by using a standard calibration curve of glucose, the absorbance
    was measured at 623nm. The measurement of proline content To measure proline in
    extracts, 0.5 g of fresh leaves sample were grounded in a mortar using liquid
    nitrogen and pestle with 10 ml of sulfosalicylic acid and filtered. Then, the
    rest procedures were done by following standardized method as described by Sahin57.
    Where the extract was homogenized in a water bath at 99 °C, then the solution
    was stored in the refrigerator until the extraction process. Then the supernatant
    was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. 2 ml of supernatant was taken and mixed
    with both (2 ml of glacial acetic acid and 3 ml of 2.5% ninhydrin reagent). After
    that the reaction mixture was incubated in boiling water for 60 min. Then it was
    extracted by adding 4 ml of toluene. The proline concentration in the absorbance
    was determined using a spectrophotometer at 520 nm, and the following formula:
    $${\\text{Proline}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Toluene }\\left({\\text{ml}}\\right)\\times
    \\mathrm{ proline }({\\text{mg}}/{\\text{ml}})}{115.13\\mathrm{ ml}/{\\text{mol}}}\\times
    \\frac{\\mathrm{ samples }({\\text{g}})}{5}$$ At the harvest Measuring the morphological
    characteristics The plots were harvested entirely by hand. First, ten plants per
    plot were randomly selected from the middle two rows at harvesting date (as a
    subsample). After removing the pods from the selected plant, the shoot fresh weight
    of selected plants was measured using a scale, then the results were recorded.
    At the same time the root length was recorded and the pods from the selected ten
    plants were air-dried. For the determination of seed index (10 seeds weight),
    the seeds were separated from the pods, then 10 seeds samples were taken and recorded
    as the mean of samples taken at random from the ten harvested plants of each treatment.
    For the calculation of pods weights, in each plot (random ten samples with 1 m2)
    was harvested manually, air-dried, and the weight of the pods was determined on
    a scale when the moisture content was (8% approximately). Then the results were
    expressed as pod yield per m2, which was then converted to kg per hectare. Measuring
    nutrient content in the shoot and roots The dried peanut samples of ten different
    peanut plants (leaves and roots) were collected, weighed and ground into a fine
    powder. The nitrogen (N) content was measured by weighing 0.5 g of the fine powder
    and transfer quantitatively into a 100 ml digestion tube, then N content was measured
    by the Kjeldahl method according to Estefan et al.42. Phosphorus (P) contents
    were measured using the colorimetry analysis, where in a volumetric flask with
    (sulfuric acid, salicylic acid, and hydrogen peroxide), the plant sample (leaves
    and roots) was digested. After providing the extract, it was measured by using
    a spectrophotometer at 470 nm wavelength42. The potassium (K) and sodium (Na)
    contents of the dry digestion extracts for leaves and roots were analyzed using
    a flame -photometer as described by Shekari et al.58. Where in a furnace (550
    °C) and dissolving in 0.5-M HCl the dry digestion extracts were prepared, then
    filtered and diluted to a certain volume. On the other hand, by digesting 100
    mg of the fine powder in a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and perchloric
    acid (3:1; v/v) at 175 °C. Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) contents were measured
    using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, as outlined by Estefan et al.42.
    While, the minerals contents (iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper
    (Cu) were estimated according to Lukic´ et al.59. Where the plant organs (leaves–roots)
    were sieved and became ash at 550 °C and then dissolved in 2-M HCl and filtered
    through a filter paper and diluted to a certain volume. After that, a digestion
    was used, and by using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer, (Fe, Zn, Mn, and
    Cu) were measured. Measurements of soil pH In each subplot, six soil cores of
    10 cm diameter from the middle two rows, were sampled down to 0.40 cm, then mixed
    thoroughly in the field to form one composite sample per subplot. The soil samples
    (2 mm diameter) were used to determine soil pH by potentiometric method (digital
    ionalyzer/501, Orion research multifunctional pH meter), and the soil: water ratio
    was 2.5:1. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) calculation The IWUE was calculated
    as described by60 as follows: For the IWUE determination in both growing seasons,
    crop yield ratio (Y) to total irrigation water requirements in the field, was
    calculated and recorded under each treatment. The statistical analysis Statistical
    differences among irrigation levels and CH application in each growing season
    were analyzed and estimated using ANOVA tests. By CoStat (version 6.303) software
    program61, the differences between the mean values of irrigation levels, foliar
    chitosan application, and their interaction in each growing season were performed
    using the Tukey HSD post hoc tests at (p < 0.05), wherever found significant were
    also calculated and presented. To determine the variation in the measured variables
    obtained from different treatments, the descriptive statistics, such as the mean,
    standard deviation, and standard error, were calculated according to Casella et
    al.62. Different lowercase letters above error bars indicate statistically significant
    differences (p < 0.05). Results The solitary and interaction effects of CH and
    IR under alkali & mixed drought-alkali conditions on RWC Based on the results
    of variance analysis (Tables 4 and 5), the sole effect of examined CH and IR was
    obviously affected RWC in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded
    (0.002) in the first and second seasons. On the side, p values for IR were recorded
    (0.029 and 0.001) in the first and second seasons, respectively. While the interaction
    between CH and IR had non-significant influence (p = 0.078) in the first season
    and significant influence (p = 0.033) in the second season. RWC was increased
    under 70% IR (mixed drought-alkali conditions) than 100% IR (alkali condition)
    in the first and second seasons, as shown in (Fig. 1A). By applying CH under 70%
    IR (mixed drought-alkali condition), the RWC ratio was enhanced by 16.8 and 17.7%
    compared to control (70%) IR in the first and second seasons, respectively. Likewise,
    by applying CH under 100% IR (mixed drought-alkali conditions), RWC ratio was
    enhanced by 5.6 and 6.1% compared to control (100% IR) in the first and second
    seasons, respectively. The highest RWC (77 and 71.3%) was recorded by applying
    foliar applications of CH under 70% IR (mixed drought-alkali conditions) in the
    first and second seasons, respectively. While, the lowest RWC (65.9 and 60.6%)
    was recorded under control 70% IR (alkali conditions) in the first and second
    seasons, respectively. Table 4 Variance analysis of the investigated parameters

    the means. Different letters in the bars indicate significant differences between
    treatments at P ≤ 0.05 level by the Tukey’s test. Abbreviations: Control (tap
    water applications); CH (foliar chitosan applications at a rate of 500 mg L−1);
    IR100% (100% of the irrigation water requirements- represent alkali condition);
    IR 70% (70% of the irrigation water requirements- represent mixed drought-alkali
    conditions). Full size image Proline content Based on the results of variance
    analysis, the sole and interaction effect of CH and IR on proline content were
    significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded
    (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. Also, p values for IR were recorded
    (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. Moreover, the interaction between CH
    and IR recorded (p =  < 0.001) in the first season and second seasons. By comparing
    the treatments under alkali and mixed drought-alkali, the proline concentrations
    increased under the mixed drought-alkali conditions in the two growing seasons,
    as can be seen in (Fig. 1B). The obtained results showed that the highest proline
    concentrations were obtained by CH under mixed drought-alkali conditions. Where
    it relative to (CH × 100% IR) increased by (29.5 and 32.3%) under (CH × 70% IR)
    in the first and second seasons, respectively. While the lowest proline concentrations
    were recorded by applying tap water applications under 100% IR (alkali condition)
    in the two growing seasons. Carbohydrate Based on the results of variance analysis,
    the sole and interaction effect of CH and IR on carbohydrate content were significant
    (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (< 0.001
    and 0.004) in the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side, p values
    for IR were recorded (< 0.001 and 0.001) in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.049) in the first
    season and (p = 0.046) in the second season. The effects of the CH applications
    and IR (100 and 70%), on the carbohydrate contents, are presented in (Fig. 1C).
    By comparing the treatments under alkali and mixed drought-alkali, the carbohydrate
    contents were significantly increased under the alkali conditions in the two growing
    seasons than the mixed drought-alkali conditions. Additionally, carbohydrate contents
    were significantly enhanced by applying CH applications. The obtained results
    showed that by applying CH applications under 100% IR (alkali condition), carbohydrate
    contents increased by (8.8 and 9.7%) compared to 70% IR (mixed drought-alkali
    conditions) in the first and second seasons, respectively. While, by adopting
    100% IR without applying CH applications under 100% IR, carbohydrate contents
    increased by (17.9 and 18.3%) compared to control mixed drought-alkali treatment.
    Total chlorophyll Based on the results of variance analysis (Tables 4 and 5),
    the sole effect of examined CH and IR was affected the chlorophyll concentration
    significantly in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (0.001
    and 0.006) in the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side, p values
    for IR were recorded (0.026) in the first and second seasons. While the interaction
    between CH and IR had non-significant influence (p = 0.829) in the first season
    and (p = 0.820) in the second season. By comparing the treatments under alkali
    and mixed drought-alkali, total chlorophyll was significantly increased and attained
    the highest values under the alkali conditions in the two growing seasons compared
    to the mixed drought-alkali conditions (Fig. 1D). The results indicated that by
    applying CH applications under 100% IR (alkali condition), total chlorophyll contents
    enhanced by (20.0 and 20.9%) compared to 70% IR (mixed drought-alkali conditions)
    in the first and second seasons, respectively. While, by adopting 100% IR without
    applying CH applications under 100% IR, carbohydrate contents increased by (20.0
    and 21.0%) compared to control mixed drought-alkali treatment. N concentrations
    in peanut leaves According to the ANOVA results, the sole influence of examined
    CH and IR on N content was significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons.
    The p values for CH were recorded (0.004 and 0.002) in the first and second seasons,
    respectively. On the side, p values for IR were equaled and recorded (< 0.001)
    in the first and second seasons. While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded
    (p = 0.108 and 101) in the first season and second seasons, respectively. Relative
    to control full irrigation treatment (alkali condition), N concentrations increased
    by 5.6 and 5.5% for control limited irrigation treatment (mixed drought-alkali
    conditions), in the first and second seasons, respectively (Fig. 2A). Likewise,
    relative to control CH under full irrigation treatment (alkali condition), N concentrations
    increased by 7.7 and 7.5% for control CH under limited irrigation treatment (mixed
    drought-alkali conditions), in the first and second seasons, respectively. On
    the other side, the gained results showed that the maximum value of N contents
    was observed by applying foliar applications of CH under mixed drought-alkali
    conditions. While the lowest N concentrations were recorded by applying full irrigation
    requirements under alkali condition without CH applications. Figure 2 The solitary
    and interaction effects of CH and IR on (A) Nitrogen content in leaves, (B) Nitrogen
    content in roots, (C) and Phosphorus content in leaves, and (D) Phosphorus content
    in roots at two seasons of 2021/2022. Vertical bars represent ± standard error
    (SE) of the means. Different letters in the bars indicate significant differences
    between treatments at P ≤ 0.05 level by the Tukey’s test. Abbreviations: Control
    (tap water applications); CH (foliar chitosan applications at a rate of 500 mg
    L−1); IR100% (100% of the irrigation water requirements- represent alkali condition);
    IR 70% (70% of the irrigation water requirements- represent mixed drought-alkali
    conditions). Full size image N concentrations in peanut roots Based on the results
    of variance analysis, the sole effect of examined CH and IR was significant in
    the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (0.002 and 0.008) in
    the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side, p values for IR were
    equaled and recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While the interaction
    between CH and IR had a significant influence in the first season and had a non-significant
    influence in the second season. The p values for the interaction were (p = 0.108
    and 0.026) in the first season and second seasons, respectively. The obtained
    results in (Fig. 2B) showed that the maximum N contents in the root were observed
    by applying foliar applications of CH under mixed drought-alkali conditions in
    the two growing seasons. While the lowest N concentrations in root were recorded
    by applying full irrigation requirements under alkali condition without CH applications.
    P concentrations in peanut leaves Based on the results of variance analysis, the
    sole and interaction effect of CH and IR on P contents in leaves were significant
    (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (< 0.001)
    in the first and second seasons. Also, p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001)
    in the first and second seasons. While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded
    (p = 0.006) in the first season and (p = 0.001) in the second season. The obtained
    results in (Fig. 2C) showed that adopting stressful irrigation level (mixed drought-alkali
    conditions) without applying CH, led to significant decrease in P concentrations.
    Interestingly, treatment peanut plants with foliar applications of CH improved
    the P contents under alkali and mixed drought-alkali conditions. However, applying
    foliar application of CH under alkali conditions (70% IR), improved P concentrations
    better than mixed drought-alkali conditions. Therefore, treating peanut plants
    with CH applications and applying the full irrigation requirements under alkali
    conditions, could help the plants to pass the adverse impacts of alkali stress
    and attain higher P concentrations. P concentrations in peanut roots Based on
    the results of variance analysis, the sole and interaction effect of examined
    CH and IR on P contents in root were significant in the two growing seasons. The
    p values for CH were recorded (0.004 and 0.001) in the first and second seasons,
    respectively. On the side, p values for IR were recorded (0.002 and < 0.001) in
    the first and second seasons, respectively. While the interaction between CH and
    IR was recorded (p = 0.033) in the first season and (p = 0.008) in the second
    season. By comparing the treatments under alkali and mixed drought-alkali, the
    P contents in root were increased under alkali conditions in the two growing seasons.
    Relative to control limited irrigation treatment (mixed drought-alkali conditions),
    P contents increased by 16.7 and 17.7% for control full irrigation treatment (alkali
    conditions), in the first and second seasons, respectively (Fig. 2D). Likewise,
    relative to control CH under limited irrigation treatment (mixed drought-alkali
    conditions), P contents increased by 21.1 and 27.8% for control CH under full
    irrigation treatment (alkali conditions), in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    K concentrations in peanut leaves Based on the results of variance analysis, the
    sole and interaction effect of examined CH and IR on K contents in leaves were
    significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded
    (0.005 and 0.002) in the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side,
    p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While
    the interaction between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.003) in the first season
    and (p = 0.004) in the second season. As can be seen in (Fig. 3A), by comparing
    alkali and mixed drought-alkali conditions in the control treatments without applying
    CH applications, choosing limited-watered conditions (mixed drought-alkali conditions),
    results in significant increases for K concentrations in the peanut leaves in
    the two growing seasons. In this sense, when adopting control full irrigation
    treatment (alkali conditions), K content was decreased by 13.0 and 13.6% compared
    to control limited-watered conditions, in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    Likewise, relative to control CH under full irrigation treatment (alkali conditions),
    K contents decreased by 8.3 and 8.2% for control CH under limited irrigation treatment
    (mixed drought-alkali conditions), in the first and second seasons, respectively.

    conditions). Full size image K concentrations in peanut roots Based on the results
    of variance analysis, the sole and interaction impacts of examined CH and IR on
    K contents in root were significant in the two growing seasons. The p values for
    CH were recorded (0.008) in the first and second seasons. Also, p values for IR
    were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While the interaction
    between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.006) in the first season and (p = 0.005)
    in the second season. Relative to control alkali conditions, K contents increased
    by 5.0 and 5.2% for control mixed drought-alkali conditions, in the first and
    second seasons, respectively (Fig. 3B). Likewise, relative to control CH under
    mixed drought-alkali conditions, K contents increased by 11.9 and 10.0% for control
    CH under alkali conditions, in the first and second seasons, respectively. Ca
    concentrations in peanut leaves According to the ANOVA results, the sole and interaction
    influence of CH and IR on Ca contents in roots were significant in the first and
    second seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (0.009 and 0.030) in the first
    and second seasons, respectively. On the side, p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001)
    in the first and second seasons. While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded
    (p < 0.001) in the first and second season. Relative to control CH under limited
    irrigation treatment (mixed drought-alkali conditions), Ca contents increased
    by 8.3 and 8.5% for control CH under full irrigation treatment (alkali conditions),
    in the first and second seasons, respectively (Fig. 3C). The highest Ca contents
    were significantly recorded by applying the foliar applications of CH under full
    irrigation treatment (alkali conditions), in the first and second seasons. On
    the other side, the lowest Ca contents were obtained by adopting full irrigation
    requirements under alkali or mixed drought-alkali conditions condition and applying
    tap water applications. Ca concentrations in peanut roots Based on the results
    of variance analysis, the sole and interaction influence of CH and IR on Ca contents
    in roots were significant in the first and second seasons. The p values for CH
    were recorded (0.049 and 0.046) in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    On the side, p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons.
    While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded (< 0.001) in the first and
    second season. The obtained results in (Fig. 3D) showed that the maximum Ca contents
    in roots were observed by applying foliar applications of CH under alkali conditions
    in the two growing seasons. On the contrary, negative significant influence in
    the Ca contents were seen when the tap water was applied under the same growth
    conditions (alkali conditions). Mg concentrations in peanut leaves The results
    of variance analysis, showed that the sole and interaction influence of CH and
    IR on Mg contents in peanut leaves were significant in the first and second seasons.
    The p values for CH were recorded (< 0.001 and 0.001) in the first and second
    seasons, respectively. Also, p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001 and 0.001)
    in the first and second seasons, respectively. Moreover, the interaction between
    CH and IR was recorded (< 0.001 and 0.001) in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    By comparing alkali and mixed drought-alkali conditions in (Fig. 4A), adopting
    mixed drought-alkali conditions, results in significant increases for Mg concentrations
    in the peanut leaves in the two growing seasons. In this sense, when adopting
    control limited irrigation treatment (mixed drought-alkali conditions), Mg content
    was increased by 40.9 and 30.6% compared to control alkali conditions, in the
    first and second seasons, respectively. Likewise, relative to control CH under
    alkali conditions, Mg contents increased by 17.5 and 9.3% for control CH under
    mixed drought-alkali conditions, in the first and second seasons, respectively.

    conditions). Full size image Mg concentrations in peanut roots The ANOVA findings
    showed that in the first and second seasons, the sole and interaction influence
    of CH and IR on Mg contents in root were significant (p < 0.05). The obtained
    results in (Fig. 4B) showed that the maximum Mg contents in roots were observed
    by applying foliar applications of CH under mixed drought-alkali conditions in
    the two growing seasons. While the lowest Mg concentrations in root were recorded
    by applying full irrigation requirements under alkali conditions without CH applications.
    Na concentrations in peanut leaves Based on the results of variance analysis,
    the sole and interaction effect of CH and IR on Na contents in leaves were significant
    (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (< 0.001
    and 0.001) in the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side, p values
    for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While the interaction
    between CH and IR was recorded (p < 0.001) in the first season and (p = 0.001)
    in the second season. As presented in (Fig. 4C), the adoption of mixed drought-alkali
    conditions was attained the highest Na concentrations in leaves. The obtained
    results showed that by adopting 100% IR with applying tap water applications under
    mixed drought-alkali conditions, Na contents increased by (21.5%) compared to
    control alkali treatment in the first season. While, in second season by adopting
    100% IR with applying tap water applications under mixed drought-alkali conditions,
    Na contents decreased by (33.7%) compared to control alkali treatment. On the
    other hand, relative to control CH under alkali conditions, Na contents increased
    by 16.6 and 31.6% for control CH under mixed drought-alkali conditions, in the
    first and second seasons, respectively. Na concentrations in peanut roots Based
    on the results of variance analysis, the sole effect of CH and IR on Na contents
    in roots was significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. While the interaction
    between CH and IR had a non-significant influence in the first season and had
    a significant influence in the second season. The p values for CH were recorded
    (0.001 and 0.020) in the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side,
    p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While
    the interaction between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.097) in the first season
    and (p < 0.001) in the second season. The impacts of the CH applications and IR
    (100 and 70%), on the Na contents, are presented in (Fig. 4D). By comparing the
    treatments under alkali and mixed drought-alkali, the Na contents in roots were
    significantly decreased by applying CH applications in the two growing seasons.
    The obtained results showed that under alkali conditions, by applying CH applications,
    Na contents were decreased by (22.6 and 24.4%) compared to tap water applications
    in the first and second seasons, respectively. While, under mixed drought-alkali
    conditions, by applying CH applications, Na contents were decreased by (43.0 and
    46.2%) compared to tap water applications in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    Fe concentrations in peanut leaves Based on ANOVA results, the sole influence
    of examined CH and IR on Fe content was significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing
    seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (0.001) in the first and second seasons.
    On the side, p values for IR were recorded (0.003 and < 0.001) in the first and
    second seasons, respectively. While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded
    (p = 0.074) in the first season and (p = 0.001) in the second season. By comparing
    the treatments under alkali and mixed drought-alkali, the Fe contents were increased
    under alkali conditions in the two growing seasons (Fig. 5A). Relative to control
    mixed drought-alkali conditions, Fe contents increased by 39.7 and 63.1% for control
    alkali conditions, in the first and second seasons, respectively. Likewise, relative
    to control CH under mixed drought-alkali conditions, Fe contents increased by
    35.1 and 27.7% for control CH under alkali conditions, in the first and second
    seasons, respectively. Figure 5 The solitary and interaction effects of CH and
    IR on (A) Iron content in leaves, (B) Iron content in roots, (C) Manganese content

    alkali condition); IR 70% (70% of the irrigation water requirements- represent
    mixed drought-alkali conditions). Full size image Fe concentrations in peanut
    roots Based on the results of variance analysis, the sole and interaction effect
    of CH and IR on Fe contents in roots were significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing
    seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons.
    Also, p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons.
    While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.002) in the first
    season and (p = 0.041) in the second season. The effects of the CH applications
    and IR (100 and 70%), on the Fe contents, are presented in (Fig. 5B). By comparing
    the treatments under alkali and mixed drought-alkali, the Fe contents were significantly
    increased under the alkali conditions in the two growing seasons than the mixed
    drought-alkali conditions. Additionally, Fe contents were significantly enhanced
    by applying CH applications. The obtained results showed that by adopting 100%
    IR without applying CH applications under alkali conditions, Fe contents increased
    by (143.8 and 140.3%) compared to control mixed drought-alkali treatment. While,
    by applying CH applications under alkali conditions, Fe contents increased by
    (107.7 and 82.4%) compared to mixed drought-alkali conditions in the first and
    second seasons, respectively. Mn concentrations in peanut leaves The ANOVA findings
    showed that in the first and second seasons, the sole and interaction influence
    of CH and IR on Mn contents in leaves were significant (p < 0.05). The p values
    for CH, IR, and their interaction were recorded (< 0.001 and 0.001) in the first
    and second seasons, respectively. By comparing alkali and mixed drought-alkali
    conditions in (Fig. 5C), adopting mixed drought-alkali conditions, results in
    significant decreases for Mn concentrations in the peanut leaves in the two growing
    seasons. In this sense, when adopting control mixed drought-alkali conditions,
    Mn content was decreased by 30.0 and 38.5% compared to control alkali conditions,
    in the first and second seasons, respectively. Likewise, relative to control CH
    under mixed drought-alkali conditions, Mn contents decreased by 31.6 and 26.1%,
    in the first and second seasons, respectively. Mn concentrations in peanut roots
    The ANOVA findings indicated that the sole influence of examined CH and IR on
    Mn content in roots was significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The
    p values for CH were recorded (0.003) in the first and second seasons. Also, p
    values for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While the
    interaction between CH and IR had non-significant influence (p = 0.051 and 0.056),
    in the first and second seasons, respectively. The Mn content in the root was
    raised by 24.0 and 23.9% for CH treatments under alkali conditions compared to
    control treatment (tap water), in the first season and second seasons, respectively
    (Fig. 5D). Likewise, Mn content in root was raised by 46.2 and 27.3% for CH treatments
    under mixed drought-alkali conditions compared to control treatment (tap water),
    in the first season and second seasons, respectively. The highest Mn content in
    the root was significantly recorded by applying the foliar applications of CH
    under alkali conditions. Furthermore, the lowest Mn content in root was significantly
    obtained by applying tap water under mixed drought-alkali conditions in the first
    season and second seasons, respectively. Zn concentrations in peanut leaves Based
    on the results of variance analysis, the sole and interaction effect of CH and
    IR on Zn contents in leaves were significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons.
    The p values for CH were recorded (0.004 and 0.002) in the first and second seasons,
    respectively. On the side, p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first
    and second seasons. While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.004)
    in the first season and (p < 0.001) in the second season. As presented in (Fig.
    6A), the adoption of mixed drought-alkali conditions was pronounced with the foliar
    CH in attaining the highest Zn concentrations in leaves. Therefore, these findings
    emphasize the importance of applying CH applications, especially under limited
    irrigation conditions. This approach results the highest accumulations of Zn concentrations,
    resulting in enhanced peanut tolerance against alkaline stress impacts. The gained
    results showed that by adopting 100% IR without applying CH applications under
    alkali conditions, Zn contents increased by (8.1%) compared to control mixed drought-alkali
    treatment in the first season. While, in second season by adopting 100% IR without
    applying CH applications under alkali conditions, Zn contents decreased by (7.5%)
    compared to control mixed drought-alkali treatment. On the other hand, by applying
    CH applications under alkali condition, Zn contents increased by (24.8 and 37.0%)
    compared to mixed drought-alkali conditions in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    On the other side, the lowest Zn concentrations were recorded under alkali and
    mixed drought-alkali conditions. Figure 6 The solitary and interaction effects

    Zn concentrations in peanut roots Based on the results of variance analysis, the
    sole and interaction effect of CH and IR on Zn contents in roots were significant
    (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (0.019
    and 0.003) in the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side, p values
    for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While the interaction
    between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.001) in the first season and (p = 0.0002)
    in the second season. The impacts of the CH applications and IR (100 and 70%),
    on the Zn contents, are presented in (Fig. 6B). By comparing the treatments under
    alkali and mixed drought-alkali, the Zn contents were significantly increased
    by applying CH applications in the two growing seasons. The obtained results showed
    that by adopting 100% IR and applying tap water applications under alkali conditions,
    Zn contents decreased by (10.5 and 7.4%) compared to control mixed drought-alkali
    treatment. While, by applying CH applications under alkali condition, Zn contents
    increased by (19.1 and 16.9%) compared to mixed drought-alkali conditions in the
    first and second seasons, respectively. Cu concentrations in peanut leaves Based
    on the results of variance analysis, the sole and interaction effect of CH and
    IR on Cu concentrations in leaves were significant (p < 0.05) in the two growing
    seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (0.001 and 0.044) in the first and
    second seasons, respectively. On the side, p values for IR were recorded (0.003
    and 0.001) in the first and second seasons, respectively. While the interaction
    between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.045) in the first season and (p < 0.001)
    in the second season. By comparing the treatments under alkali and mixed drought-alkali,
    the Cu contents were significantly increased under the alkali conditions or applied
    CH applications in the two growing seasons than the mixed drought-alkali conditions
    (Fig. 6C). The obtained results showed that under alkali conditions by adopting
    100% IR and applying CH applications, Cu contents increased by (16.1 and 26.5%)
    compared to control alkali treatment (tap water). Likewise, by applying CH applications
    under mixed drought- alkali condition, Cu contents increased by (28.3 and 27.8%)
    compared to control mixed drought-alkali conditions in the first and second seasons,
    respectively. Cu concentrations in peanut roots Based on ANOVA results, the sole
    influence of examined CH and IR on Fe content was significant (p < 0.05) in the
    two growing seasons. While the interaction between CH and IR had a non-significant
    influence (p > 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded
    (< 0.001 and 0.013) in the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side,
    p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While
    the interaction between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.380) in the first season
    and (p = 0.109) in the second season. The obtained findings in (Fig. 6D) showed
    that under alkali conditions by adopting 100% IR and applying CH applications,
    Cu contents in roots were increased by (36.3 and 21.6%) compared to control alkali
    treatment (tap water). Likewise, by applying CH applications under mixed drought-
    alkali condition, Cu contents were increased by (37.6 and 21.2%) compared to control
    mixed drought-alkali conditions in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    The solitary and interaction effects of CH and IR under alkali and mixed drought-alkali
    conditions on the agronomic traits and soil pH Details of solitary and interaction
    effects for CH and IR under alkali and mixed drought-alkali conditions on (Shoot
    fresh weight, weight of pods, and seed index at two growing seasons), are provided
    in Supplementary Table S1. While the detailed list of measured traits (root length
    and soil pH) is given in Supplementary Table S2. The solitary and interaction
    effects of CH and IR under alkali & mixed drought-alkali conditions on Seeds yield
    Based on the results of variance analysis (Tables 4 and 5), the sole impact of
    IR had non-significant influence (p > 0.05) in the two growing seasons. While
    the sole CH and the interaction impacts of examined (CH and IR) were significant
    (p < 0.05) in the two growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (0.946
    and 0.114) in the first and second seasons, respectively. On the side, p values
    for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and second seasons. While the interaction
    between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.005) in the first season and (p = 0.017)
    in the second season. The findings in (Fig. 7A), demonstrated that the CH applications
    worked as a cofactor for enhancing peanut seed yield under alkali and mixed drought-alkali
    conditions. Relative to tap water applications under 100% IR (alkali condition),
    the obtained results showed that by applying CH applications, peanut yield was
    increased by (8.6 and 10.5%), in the first and second seasons, respectively. Likewise,
    relative to tap water applications under 70% IR (mixed drought-alkali conditions),
    the obtained results showed that by applying CH applications, peanut yield was
    increased by (18.7 and 18.5%), in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    The highest peanut yield was recorded by applying foliar applications of CH under
    70% IR (mixed drought-alkali conditions) in the first and second seasons, respectively.
    However, that was significantly equaled by applying CH under 100% IR (alkali condition)
    in the second season. On the other hand, the obtained results showed that the
    lowest peanut yield was significantly obtained by applying tap water applications
    under mixed drought-alkali conditions. Figure 7 The solitary and interaction effects

    conditions). Full size image IWUE Based on the results of variance analysis, the
    sole and interaction effect of CH and IR were significant (p < 0.05) in the two
    growing seasons. The p values for CH were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and
    second seasons. Also, p values for IR were recorded (< 0.001) in the first and
    second seasons. While the interaction between CH and IR was recorded (p = 0.002)
    in the first season and (p = 0.005) in the second season. As can be seen in (Fig.
    7B), by comparing the treatments under alkali and mixed drought-alkali, IWUE was
    increased and attained the highest values under the mixed drought-alkali conditions
    condition in the two growing seasons. IWUE values for peanut were increased from
    (0.71 and 0.65 kg m−3) for the (tap water × alkali condition) to (0.98 and 0.89
    kg m−3) for (CH × mixed drought-alkali conditions condition) in the first and
    second seasons, respectively. Discussion Drought and alkali stresses affect peanut
    plantations in arid and semi-arid regions, where approximately 70% of peanut cultivation
    occurs63. The majority of research focuses on the effects of drought or alkali
    stress on peanut plants, rather than both simultaneously. As a result, the present
    study endeavored to address the limited understanding of plant responses, particularly
    in the context of combined drought-alkali stresses. In situations where effective
    administration and proper recognition are critical, there are viable strategies
    that can be implemented to increase and sustain productivity. Monitoring the physio-biochemical
    traits of peanut under alkali and mixed drought-alkali stresses The results of
    this investigation demonstrated that although mixed drought-alkali stresses resulted
    in reduced values for total chlorophyll and carbohydrates in peanut plants, the
    concentration of RWC and proline exhibited an improvement in comparison to the
    effect of alkaline stress alone during both growing seasons. The observed decline
    in RWC was anticipated in alkaline environments, as prior research has documented
    that alkaline soils have unfavorable characteristics including a high infiltration
    rate, poor structure, and low holding capacity64. While this rise in RWC under
    mixed drought-alkali environments appears to be attributable to A) an elongation
    of the roots, which facilitates the absorption of adequate quantities of water.
    This assimilation resulted in an enhancement in the quantity of water that could
    be absorbed by roots. Dien et al.65 documented in this regard that plants with
    greater root systems are capable of assimilating a greater quantity of water from
    the soil when subjected to stressful conditions, thereby enhancing their tolerance
    to stress. An additional factor that contributed to the observed enhancement in
    RWC under mixed drought-alkali conditions was B) the accumulation of proline.
    Previous research has documented that plants under stress tend to increase their
    production and accumulation of osmolytes, such as proline66,67,68,69. Proline
    accumulation in response to abiotic stresses not only facilitates osmotic adjustment
    and redox balance, but also contributes to the stabilization of cell membranes
    and the preservation of the turgidity of plant leaves, the authors continued.
    Previous research has suggested that an increase in stress intensity may cause
    plants to produce proline at an accelerated rate, accompanied by a decrease in
    chlorophyll content5,15. Proline accumulation under mixed drought-alkali conditions
    is regarded as a crucial tolerance mechanism employed by plants to withstand stressors.
    Furthermore, the cultivar''s notable capacity for proline accumulation may indicate
    a robust resistance to combined drought and alkali stresses, as supported by Ref.65.
    While it was previously established that the Giza 6 variety of peanut is drought-tolerant
    variety22, information regarding its tolerance to alkaline or mixed drought-alkali
    stresses was unavailable. Proline accumulations allow intracellular water potential
    to be maintained and water''s solvent properties to be altered in response to
    stress5,70, thereby enabling osmotic adjustment. In addition, proline accumulates
    in response to stress, acts as a protective agent for enzymes, and stabilizes
    the structure of both proteins and cell membranes65,71,72. On the other hand,
    the results indicated that carbohydrates exhibited the lowest value under mixed
    drought-alkali stresses in both seasons. In relation to the decrease in carbohydrates
    during mixed drought-alkali stresses, a study by Ghouili et al.71, demonstrated
    that the accumulation of various carbohydrates is contingent upon the level of
    stress, plant species, plant organs, and cultivar employed. Moreover, proline
    levels were found to be elevated when exposed to alkali, and previous research
    has documented an antagonistic relationship between proline and carbohydrates73,74.
    Furthermore, Guo et al.75 noted that it appears plants under stress conditions
    obtain the energy necessary to maintain cellular osmotic homeostasis through the
    breakdown of polysaccharides. Monitoring the nutritional status of peanut under
    alkali and mixed drought-alkali stresses The findings indicate that in the presence
    of combined drought and alkali stresses, plants exhibit a tendency to develop
    tolerance by increasing the concentrations of certain nutrients in their leaves
    and roots. The findings indicate that peanuts subjected to mixed drought-alkali
    stresses exhibited higher concentrations of (N, K, Ca, Mg, and Na) in comparison
    to alkali conditions. This was not the case with regards to (P, Fe, Mn, and Cu
    nutrients). This study ascribed the observed increases in (N, K, Ca, and Mg) to
    the presence of Na, suggesting that this strategy functions as a defensive mechanism.
    Reducing the quantity of water applied resulted in higher concentrations of nutrients,
    including Ca, Na, and Mg, which was reflected in an increase in the quantities
    absorbed by these elements. Cell wall structure is impaired when subjected to
    a combination of drought and alkali stresses and elevated Na concentrations76.
    During this period, Ca was advantageous for improved hydration status, enhanced
    structural and functional integrity of cell membranes, and regulated ion-exchange
    behavior77. Moreover, Yokoi et al.78 noted that Ca induces stress responses through
    the direct inhibition of Na influx, a property that would have proven beneficial
    in the given circumstances. N and Mg were found to be involved in chlorophyll
    synthesis in the presence of stress79,80. Hasanuzzaman et al.81 state that increased
    K concentrations assist plants in regulating osmotic balance and maintaining ion
    homeostasis. On the other side, the obtained results demonstrated a decrease in
    (P, Fe, Mn, and Cu) absorption in mixed drought-alkali environments. According
    to the findings of Keisham et al.82, P fixed under stressful conditions due to
    the formation of insoluble precipitates with Ca, such as hydroxyapatite83, which
    inhibit the assimilation of P ions by the roots of plants. Guo et al.75 additionally
    documented a reduction in P absorption when exposed to alkali conditions. While
    the degradation of the availability and subsequent absorption of (Fe, Mn, and
    Cu) was ascribed to the influence of higher pH level84. It is noteworthy to mention
    that the findings suggest that when plants are subjected to a combination of drought
    and alkali stresses, they exhibit a tendency to alter the accumulation of nutrients
    between their roots and leaves. It was established that leaf accumulation of (K,
    Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu) is more prevalent in plants compared to root accumulation.
    Na was evidently preferable for accumulation in roots. This study ascribed this
    characteristic to the peanuts'' (cultivar Giza 6) remarkable resilience under
    adverse growth conditions. As illustrated in (Figs. 3A,C and 6A), increasing the
    accumulations of (K, Ca, and Zn) in the leaves rather than roots assisted in maintaining
    a secure water status. Moreover, elevated concentrations of (Fe, Zn, and Cu) in
    the foliage sustained the enzymatic and chlorophyll degradation processes, whereas
    Na was absent in the roots. Regarding this matter, Khan et al.85 demonstrated
    that certain plants have the capacity to release Na+ ions from within their cells
    (extracellular area). This is regarded as a significant physiological mechanism
    employed by plants to alleviate the detrimental effects of stress. The changing
    in nutrient homeostasis as a consequence of CH under alkali and mixed drought-alkali
    conditions Multiple studies have demonstrated that CH is capable of eliciting
    a wide variety of defense responses in response to abiotic stressors86,87,88.
    Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research examining the reflecting effects
    that occur on nutrient accumulations as a result of CH applications in alkali
    and mixed drought-alkali environments. As a result, this study attempts to provide
    a comprehensive overview of the nutrient homeostasis changes induced by CH under
    these stresses in this paragraph. According to the results obtained, CH altered
    the nutritional composition of peanut leaves and roots by causing accumulations
    of macronutrients and micronutrients. When CH applications were applied under
    alkali conditions, the accumulations of (P, Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) in leaves
    and roots were maximized, while the accumulation of Na was reduced to a lower
    value. It appears that CH enhanced root length under these growth conditions,
    thereby increasing the plant''s capacity to absorb nutrients and water89. Furthermore,
    it has been observed that in soil solutions with high alkalinity, Ca concentrations
    predominate83,90. Consequently, the application of CH applications facilitated
    Ca influx into the cytosol, as documented by Mukarram et al.91, and contributed
    to the reinforcement of cell structure92. Furthermore, the application of CH enhanced
    osmotic adjustment through the accumulation of more Zn, which led to an increase
    in RWC. Maintain the carbon balance by increasing P accumulation, which is essential
    for the synthesis of carbohydrates in response to stress32. Moreover, CH applications
    maintain water status and photosynthesis components (chlorophyll contents) through
    the accumulation of Fe and Mn, where Fe and Cu are essential for the photosynthesis
    process and nitrogen reduction93,94. Hebbern et al.95 demonstrated the significance
    of Mn in the process of cuticular wax deposition on leaves, resulting in increased
    water content within tissues (RWC). Furthermore, CH applications appear to have
    played a role in the reduction of Na accumulations by reducing Na accumulations
    in leaves and roots, thereby protecting against an increase in Na hazard. On the
    other side, applied CH under conditions of mixed drought-alkali stress led to
    the greater accumulations of (N, K, and Mg) in peanut leaves and roots compared
    to alkali conditions, by increasing the stress intensity. While Na accumulations
    recorded the minimum significant value in peanut leaves and roots. To elucidate
    these findings, we discovered that the significance of preserving the aforementioned
    nutrients'' accumulations is well-known and has been extensively discussed in
    the preceding paragraphs. Our focus was drawn to the following: (A) the preservation
    of preventing or minimizing Na accumulations, particularly in the leaves, through
    the reduction of Na flux from the soil or roots, which is crucial for stress resistance.
    (B) the emphasis that peanuts placed on (N, K, and Mg) accumulations in leaves
    and roots in response to mixed drought-alkali stresses (greater stress intensity)
    as opposed to (P, Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu). The aforementioned findings pertained
    to the capacity of peanuts to modify their nutrient accumulations and prioritization
    in response to stress conditions, thereby ensuring their resistance, which are
    consistent with findings from Ref.95. Furthermore, the findings of this study
    indicate that in order to alleviate the severity of stress, it is crucial to employ
    (P, Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) nutrients during alkali growth conditions, and (N,
    K, and Mg) nutrients in combination with CH during mixed drought-alkali conditions.
    Comparably, when Farouk & Amany96 examined the effects of applying CH under stressful
    conditions on cowpea, they observed increases in (N and K) in the shoots. Hidangmayum
    et al.32, on the other hand, suggested that increases in (N and K) in the leaves
    contribute to an increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell and enhance chlorophyll
    synthesis, thereby mitigating the negative effects. Abou El-Enin et al.97 found
    that foliar nano CH-loaded nitrogen increases the productivity of intercropped
    maize and soybean in calcareous soil. Under drought stress, both Bukhari et al.98
    and Ali et al.99 discovered beneficial effects of (N and K) applications and various
    concentrations combined with CH. To confirm or refute the aforementioned hypotheses,
    however, additional research is necessary under alkali and mixed drought-alkali
    stress conditions in the future. Feasibility of CH application to boost peanut
    yield and IWUE under alkali and mixed drought-alkali conditions Based on the results
    obtained, CH applications under mixed drought-alkali conditions produced the highest
    seed yield and IWUE of the peanuts while requiring the least amount of water to
    be applied. The advantages of utilizing a mild drought irrigation level in a combination
    with CH under mixed stress growth conditions were attributed to this concern.
    In the given conditions, peanut plants were subjected to a specific level of dehydration
    stress, which triggered a cascade of subsequent effects. Stresses were alleviated
    by the subsequent increases in proline and nutrient uptake such as (N, K, and
    Mg). This study ascribed this concern to the tolerance capacity exhibited by plants.
    Previous studies25,100,101,102 have documented that peanut plants can withstand
    higher pH levels by increasing their root secretions, which allows them to withstand
    adverse growing conditions. These organic secretions can function as a buffer,
    enabling plants to withstand environmental fluctuations and preserve intracellular
    pH stability and ion balance. Therefore, it appears that the marginal reduction
    in soil pH, as illustrated in (Supplementary Table S2), resulted in an enhance
    in the nutrient absorption. These enhancements further improved (shoot fresh weight,
    pod weight, root length, and seed index), and ultimately led to the highest seed
    yield and IWUE. These results are consistent with those reported by Refs.17,32,37,86.
    Conclusion The present study observed that peanuts exhibited diverse responses
    to stress induced by alkali and mixed drought-alkali conditions. In contrast to
    the alkali stress condition, (carbohydrates and total chlorophyll) decreased significantly
    under mixed drought-alkali stress conditions. Under conditions of mixed drought-alkali
    stress, plants accumulated a greater quantity of (K, Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu) in their
    leaves as opposed to their roots, according to this study. On the other hand,
    Na was evidently preferred for accumulation in roots. This could potentially be
    the peanut plant''s way of defending its leaves against the detrimental effects
    of Na stress. As an osmotic protectant, peanut plants were able to amass elevated
    levels of proline in response to chitosan applications, which averted severe damage
    caused by combined drought and alkali stresses. Chitosan accumulation increases
    the accumulation of (N, K, and Mg) in leaves and roots under mixed drought-alkali
    stress conditions, as opposed to (P, Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) under alkali stress
    conditions. The findings of this study indicate that peanut plants implemented
    distinct strategies in reaction to stresses characterized by varying levels of
    nutrient accumulation. This research suggests that supplementary applications
    of chitosan (500 mg L−1) applied foliarly to peanut plants cultivated in alkali
    soil at a rate of 70% of irrigation water requirements can increase proline, (N,
    K and Mg), pod weight, seed yield, and irrigation water use efficiency. Data availability

  description: After ecological restoration of high and steep slopes in the project
    disturbed area, soil properties, soil microorganisms, litter types and root types
    change with the succession of vegetation cover communities. However, the effects
    of different vegetation successional stages on soil respiration dynamics remain
    unclear. To elucidate trends and drivers of soil respiration in the context of
    vegetation succession, we used spatio-temporal alternative applied research. Vegetated
    concrete-restored slopes (VC) with predominantly herbaceous (GS), shrub (SS),
    and arborvitae (AS) vegetation were selected, and naturally restored slopes (NS)
    were used as control. SRS1000 T soil carbon flux measurement system was used to
    monitor soil respiration rate. The results showed that soil respiration (RS) and
    fractions of all four treatments showed a single-peak curve, with peaks concentrated
    in July and August. During the succession of vegetation from herbaceous to arborvitae
    on VC slopes, RS showed a decreasing trend, and GS was significantly higher than
    AS by 45%; Compared to NS, RS was 29.81% and 21.56% higher in GS and SS successional
    stages, respectively, and 27.51% lower in AS stage. RS was significantly and positively
    correlated with nitrate nitrogen (NO3–-N) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN),
    both of which are important factors in regulating RS under vegetation succession.
    A bivariate model of soil temperature and water content explains the variability
    of Rs better. Overall, RS was higher than NS in the transition stage and lower
    than NS in the equilibrium stage of the vegetation community on VC slopes, and
    the RS decreases gradually with the vegetation succession of artificial ecological
    restoration slopes.

    Article Open access 07 May 2021 Introduction Soil carbon (C) constitutes 80% of
    the carbon stock in terrestrial ecosystems, with soil respiration (Rs) representing
    the second-largest carbon flux between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere
    (68–98 Pg C year–1)1,2. Small fluctuations in Rs can have substantial repercussions
    on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, regional and global carbon balances, and, ultimately,
    climate change3. The construction of hydropower stations, mines, roads, and municipal
    projects, driven by economic development, has led to the destruction of numerous
    ecosystems. The loss of soil and vegetation has contributed to elevated atmospheric
    temperatures, as highlighted by the 2021 IPCC report4. Consequently, improving
    degraded ecosystems and mitigating global warming are challenges and major needs
    for green and high-quality development in China. Ecological restoration is an
    effective measure to increase carbon sinks in terrestrial ecosystems and an important
    means to alleviate global warming. As such, various technologies have been developed
    to address this problem5. Vegetated concrete ecological restoration (VC), as one
    of the important ecological restoration techniques for disturbed slopes, has been
    utilized on more than 20 million m2 of land in more than 29 provinces, municipalities
    and autonomous regions in China. It is characterized by a base material made of
    cement as a binder, mixed with planting soil, organic materials, eco-conditioner,
    water, and seeds of herbaceous plants and shrubs6. This mixture becomes the medium
    for incorporating herb and shrub seeds, The organic combination of mechanical
    stability and ecological function has been achieved7. However, several questions
    remain unanswered: What are the carbon emissions from the transition from herbaceous
    plants and shrubs to trees? What are the differences in carbon emissions between
    stabilized and naturally restored vegetation communities on slopes under restoration
    with VC techniques? What factors influence substrate carbon emissions? Accurately
    estimating VC carbon emissions is crucial for assessing the climatic impact of
    VC-restored slopes and developing emission reduction strategies for these systems.
    Rs consists of autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) respiration8. Ra emanates
    from plant roots and rhizospheric microorganisms and is closely tied to vegetation
    characteristics and root activity9. In contrast, Rh results from the decomposition
    of soil organic matter and litter and is linked to substrate availability and
    microbial activity10. Soil temperature and moisture are the primary environmental
    factors limiting Rs, as they influence soil microbial activity and substrate availability11,12.
    Moreover, interactions between different environmental factors can enhance or
    counteract their effects on soil C13. For instance, research indicates that in
    arid ecosystems, Rs is constrained by soil moisture, which weakens or abolishes
    correlations between Rs and temperature14. Furthermore in hot and arid conditions
    Rs exhibits negative temperature sensitivity, with Rs decreasing as temperature
    rises. This is attributed to further increases in temperature diminishing soil
    enzyme activity and water availability15,16. In another study, Rs initially increased
    before declining with rising temperature. Thus, temperature and soil moisture
    directly and indirectly impact Rs17. The effects of hydrothermal factors on Rh
    and Ra in slopes undergoing ecological restoration, especially in VC-restored
    slopes, remain inadequately studied18,19. Therefore, comprehending the influence
    of hydrothermal factors on VC carbon emissions will furnish a theoretical foundation
    for the development of VC-based ecological restoration techniques, which are valuable
    for carbon sequestration in substrate materials and conservation measures. During
    ecological restoration employing VC, the choice of herbaceous or shrub seeds depends
    on soil type and slope gradient. This choice can have substantial implications
    for the soil microenvironment and root activity, which modulate Ra and Rh. Alterations
    in vegetation lead to nonlinear changes in soil properties, such as pH, nutrient
    availability, and its biological parameters, thereby profoundly affecting soil
    carbon stocks20. On the one hand, changes in vegetation and soil nutrients inevitably
    affect water availability, consequently altering the subsurface soil microbial
    communities and rate of soil organic matter decomposition21. On the other hand,
    the substrate resources C, N and P in the soil do not fully satisfy the growth
    requirements of microorganisms, thus creating an imbalance between substrate and
    microorganisms. This imbalance tends to affect the growth and metabolism of microorganisms
    and thus the carbon pool in the soil. To this end, we conducted a year-long experiment
    in southern China to measure the Rs of naturally restored slopes and VC-restored
    slopes with various types of vegetation. Additionally, we explored the effects
    of different factors and vegetation types on Rs. The objectives of this study
    were to (a) determine monthly changes in VC substrate Rs rates and its composition
    under different vegetation types and (b) characterizing the response of Rs to
    hydrothermal conditions, nutrient and litter inputs. Materials and methods Study
    area overview The experiment was conducted in an urban area of Yichang City, situated
    between 29° 56′–31° 34′ N latitude and 110° 15′–112°04′ E longitude, within Hubei
    Province, China. This study area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon humid
    climate, with elevation ranging from 63 to 75 m, annual average temperature between
    13 and 18 °C, an extensive frost-free period spanning 280 days, and mean annual
    precipitation level of 992–1404 mm. The area receives abundant rainfall, primarily
    in late spring and early summer. Soil sampling was conducted in the area by selecting
    natural restoration slope sample plots and vegetated concrete technology sample
    plots at different stages of vegetation restoration. The selection of sample plots
    follows the following principles: ① Typicality of vegetation restoration stages.
    Using the spatial and temporal substitution method, typical sample plots representing
    different vegetation restoration measures were selected, including four sample
    plots of vegetated concrete-restored slopes and naturally restored slopes (NS)
    with herbaceous (GS), shrub (SS), and arborvitae (AS) vegetation (Fig. 1), each
    with similar slope orientation (Table 1). ② Similarity of vegetated concrete restoration
    technique substrate proportioning and spreading seed bank. According to the USDA
    Soil Taxonomy System, the initial allotment soils of the sample sites were all
    sandy loam. Figure1 Location of the study area. Full size image Table 1 Characteristics
    of sample areas during various stages of the restoration process. Full size table
    Experimental design and sample processing Three 10 × 10 m2 sample plots were randomly
    selected in the GS and SS areas, while three 5 × 5 m2 sample plots were designated
    for the AS and NS areas to facilitate long-term observations. In mid-August 2020,
    Rs measurements were collected in each sample plot using Rs rings. These rings,
    with an inner diameter of 20 cm and height of 7 cm, had 2 mm holes in the lower
    part to allow water circulation and plant root penetration. Random placement of
    these rings on the upper, middle, and lower slopes of each sample area ensured
    comprehensive data collection. To observe total Rs, 40 × 40 cm2 squares were positioned
    approximately 1 m from each measurement point. For root system partitioning, trenches
    were dug to depths of 8–10 cm, extending up to the bedrock or below the rhizosphere.
    Partitions were inserted around the trench to isolate the roots. Meanwhile, all
    living plants in the squares were removed, Rs rings were buried, and clingfilm
    was used to halt root development, thereby facilitating Rh determination. Soil
    was sampled monthly over a year, spanning from January 2022 to December 2022.
    At each sample plot, soil samples were collected at five locations following an
    S-type sampling trajectory, and these samples were combined and homogenized. The
    combined sample was then divided into two portions: one was air-dried and sieved
    for the measurement of soil physical and chemical properties, whereas the other
    was stored at 4 °C for soil microbial biomass determination. Litter was collected
    monthly from 1 × 1 m2 areas at the corners and center of each sample plot. The
    collected litter was dried at 80 °C and used to calculate the litter biomass for
    each sample plot. Soil respiration Rs was measured using an SRS1000 T soil carbon
    flux measurement system. Measurements were collected for 2 min at each respiration
    ring, and all surface vegetation and litter were removed from the respiration
    ring 24 h prior to measurement22. Rs was measured four times each month, from
    January to December 2022, using a soil respirometer on sunny and windless days.
    Measurements were collected between 09:00 and 11:00 am. Ra was calculated as the
    difference between Rs and Rh. Environmental factors The SRS1000 T soil carbon
    flux measurement system, connected to a LCI thermocouple temperature sensor and
    EC-5 soil moisture sensor, was used to measure soil temperature and moisture in
    the 0–5-cm soil layer. Soil chemistry indicators were referenced from Agricultural
    Chemical Analysis of Soil by Bao Shidan. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content was
    determined using the potassium dichromate oxidation-external heating method. Soil
    dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was evaluated using 0.5 mol/L potassium sulfate
    (with a 2:1 water-to-soil ratio). Soil total carbon (TC) content was determined
    using a total organic carbon analyzer (MultiN/C2 100, Germany). Soil total phosphorus
    (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N and NO3–-N) content
    were determined using a SKALAR San +  + flow analyzer (The Netherlands). Soil
    microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) were determined
    via chloroform fumigation and leaching. Statistical data analysis To assess whether
    the Rs rate and soil nutrients in different microhabitats within each sample area
    were significantly different (P < 0.05), one-way analysis of variance (one-way
    ANOVA) was performed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Regression
    modeling between Rs, Rh, Ra and soil temperature and water content. Pearson correlation
    and principal component analyses were performed between Rs and the soil nutrients
    at each sample site, and the resulting graphs were plotted using Origin 2021 (Origin
    Lab., Northampton, MA, USA). Results and analysis Hydrothermal dynamics of slopes
    at different stages of vegetation succession Figure 2a illustrates the fluctuation
    in soil moisture, exhibiting a multi-peak pattern and reaching its minimum value
    during the summer months. Subsequently, a rapid increase in soil moisture was
    observed, coinciding with the onset of rainfall following the high-temperature
    summer period. Notably, the GS consistently maintained higher soil moisture levels
    compared to the SS, AS, and NS, particularly during winter and summer. The AS
    experienced a notable reduction in soil moisture during the high-temperature period,
    attributed to the lower vegetation coverage on this slope. Figure 2 Soil hydrothermal
    dynamics of slopes in different stages of vegetation succession. Full size image
    In terms of soil temperature, an evident unimodal pattern was observed (Fig. 2b),
    with temperatures increasing from February to August. The GS consistently exhibited
    higher temperatures, culminating in a peak value of 30.46 °C in July–August. During
    the same period, the temperature on the AS was 2.76 °C cooler, registering at
    27.7 °C. Subsequently, soil temperature decreased from October to February, with
    the GS recording the lowest temperatures, and February being the month with the
    lowest soil temperature. The difference in soil temperatures between the AS and
    GS was 0.9 °C. Soil properties of slopes at different stages of vegetation succession
    Significant variations were observed among microhabitats representing the transition
    from natural vegetation to herbaceous plants, shrubs, and arboreal vegetation
    in terms of their soil physicochemical properties (Table 2). During the succession
    from herbaceous to arboreal in VC slopes, pH, SOC, and TN were significantly reduced
    by 8.15%, 24.88%, and 25% (P < 0.05). pH and SOC were significantly higher in
    VC slopes than in NS (P < 0.05), and TN was significantly lower than in NS (P < 0.05).
    The amount of litter fall on VC slopes decreased significantly with succession
    and was significantly different between GS and AS (P < 0.05), and NS was between
    GS and SS, and both were significantly different (P < 0.05). DOC and TC contents
    tended to decrease and then increase in GS, SS and AS, and AS was significantly
    higher than NS (P < 0.05). For TP content, the difference between groups was not
    significant (P > 0.05) for VC side slopes, but VC was significantly higher than
    NS (P < 0.05). The size order of NH4+-N, NO3--N, MBC and MBN in VC slopes was
    SS > GS > AS, in which the differences between NH4+-N and NO3–-N were significant
    in each group, and the MBC and MBN of SS were significantly higher than those
    of AS. Table 2 Soil properties of slopes at different stages of vegetation succession.
    Full size table Monthly soil respiration dynamics of the slopes at different stages
    of vegetation succession and their relationship with hydrothermal factors The
    monthly patterns of Rs, Rh, and Ra closely mirrored temperature fluctuations,
    exhibiting a unimodal trend characterized by an initial increase followed by a
    decrease (Fig. 3). Both Rs and Rh showed a decline from one stage of succession
    to the next. Concerning the annual mean values of Rs and Rh, no significant difference
    was observed between GS and SS (P > 0.05). However, a noteworthy difference emerged
    between AS and GS (P < 0.05), with Rs and Rh being 44.9% and 33.8% lower in the
    AS, respectively (Fig. 4). Comparing NS to SS, NS exhibited slightly higher values,
    surpassing SS by 0.52 μmol CO2·m–2·s–1 for Rs and 0.30 μmol CO2·m–2·s–1 for Rh.
    Conversely, NS recorded lower values than AS, lagging behind AS by 0.41 μmol CO2·m–2·s–1
    for Rs and 0.32 μmol CO2·m–2·s–1 for Rh. Ra displayed significant variation across
    all sample plots (P < 0.05), with AS registering Ra values 79.9%, 69.8%, and 39.7%
    lower than those of GS, SS, and NS, respectively (Fig. 3). Figure 3 Monthly dynamics

    Rs, Rh, and Ra were 0.749, 0.822, and 0.412, respectively (Fig. 5). The influence
    of soil temperature on Rs changes was most pronounced in the GS, followed by SS,
    NS, and AS. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between Rs rate and
    soil moisture content (P < 0.05), with the coefficient of determination for the
    effect of soil moisture on Rs rate ranging from 0.12 to 0.31. Figure 5 Relationships

    linear regression of soil moisture and temperature in various areas is highly
    significant (P < 0.01). The bivariate model incorporating soil moisture and temperature
    can account for 84% to 96% of the seasonal variations in Rs rates, with the most
    accurate fit observed in the herbaceous slope (GS). Table 3 Soil properties of

    and principal component analyses of soil respiration and soil properties In Fig.
    6, Rs evidently exhibits a highly significant positive correlation (P < 0.01)
    with NO3–-N and MBN, while showing an nonsignificant positive correlation with
    SOC, pH, and MBC. No significant positive correlation was observed between Rs
    rate and other nutrients. Notably, SOC displayed a highly significant positive
    correlation with TP, pH, NO3–-N, and MBN (P < 0.01), and a highly significant
    negative correlation with DOC (P < 0.01). MBC showed a highly significant positive
    correlation with TN (P < 0.01) and a significant negative correlation with TC,
    TP, pH, and NO3–-N (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). Figure 6 Heatmap illustrating the
    correlations between Rs and soil environmental factors across slopes at various
    stages of vegetation succession. Full size image The principal component analysis
    results presented in Fig. 7 reveal that the first two principal components (PC1
    and PC2) collectively account for 79.2% of the variance. PC1 contributes 43.9%
    and possesses an eigenvalue of 4.82, whereas PC2 contributes 35.3% with an eigenvalue
    of 3.88. The directional arrows of NO3–-N, MBN, SOC, pH, and TP align with that
    of Rs, indicating a positive correlation with Rs. Additionally, the angles between
    Rs and TC, TN, MBC, and DOC exceed 90°, suggesting a positive correlation between
    Rs and the consumption rate of soil organic nutrients and an increase in inorganic
    nutrient content. Figure 7 Principal component analysis of the relationship between

    stages. Full size image Discussion Effect of vegetation succession stage on slope
    substrate soil respiration Ecological restoration serves as a potent tool to enhance
    terrestrial ecosystem carbon sequestration, a pivotal strategy in mitigating global
    warming23. However, this endeavor brings forth alterations in vegetation cover
    that impact SOC stability24. The intricate interplay between vegetation characteristics,
    physiological responses, and growth patterns introduces complexity to the study
    of Rs25. Our findings reveal a discernible decrease in monthly values of Rs, Rh,
    and Ra as the transition from GS to AS unfolds. The decline stems from multiple
    factors. Changes in soil characteristics due to shifting vegetation impact both
    microbial communities and soil gas diffusion properties. This observation aligns
    with the work of Wu et al.26. The influence of vegetation type on Rs is multifaceted.
    Herbaceous plants, prevalent on high and steep slopes, provide extensive cover.
    This reduces solar radiation and surface evapotranspiration while augmenting water-use
    efficiency and microbial activity, notably enhancing Rh27. The substrate thickness
    on steep slopes generally ranges from 8 to 12 cm, compared to 10 cm for VC28.
    Herbaceous plants have shorter root lengths and increased root content compared
    to AS29. The nutrient-rich substrate on GS fosters root activity in herbaceous
    plants, subsequently elevating Ra (Table 2). As Rh and Ra gradually diminish during
    community succession on VC slopes, Rs decreases from one stage to the next. The
    dense and low vertical distribution of plant communities on GS facilitates litter
    accumulation, particularly during the non-growing season. Drying herbaceous roots
    and litter, characterized by low lignin and cellulose content, readily decompose30.
    Consequently, GS contribute more carbon to the substrate, expediting soil microbial
    community development and enhancing Rs31. These findings differ from those of
    Chen32, potentially attributable to our focus on slopes with gradients exceeding
    65° (Table 1), where litter remains on shrubby and arboreal slopes due to gravity,
    wind, and rainfall, in contrast to plains where Chen conducted experiments. Compared
    with naturally restored slopes, ecologically restored slopes had significantly
    higher Rs in the early stage of restoration and significantly lower Rs in the
    late stage of restoration. It is possible that the significant elevation of substrate
    (SOC) in the soil after inputs in the eco-conditioner favored the increase of
    respiratory substrate effectiveness of soil microorganisms and the promotion of
    root respiration in plants, which in turn increased Rh and Ra. Over time, rainfall
    leached these nutrients from the substrate, resulting in reduced Rs during the
    later stages of restoration. Soil respiration and hydrothermal dynamics in different
    vegetation succession stages on slopes In the context of climate change, quantifying
    how key environmental factors, such as soil moisture and temperature, modulate
    Rs’s role in the carbon source/sink balance of ecosystems is crucial33. The type
    of vegetation profoundly influences soil microbial activity and respiration by
    altering topsoil temperature and moisture levels. During the transition from GS
    to AS, monthly Rs dynamics align with substrate temperature variations, exhibiting
    a decline as succession progresses. This pattern is attributed to temperature-induced
    increases in microbial decomposition of soil organic matter and nitrogen mineralization,
    relieving nutrient limitations in the slope substrate and stimulating plant nitrogen
    uptake, thereby elevating Rs. Correlation analysis between Rs and temperature
    in VC substrate yields significant linear and exponential correlations, consistent
    with previous research34,35. GS dampen temperature fluctuations by reducing the
    diurnal temperature difference through vegetation36, which may account for the
    higher fit of Rs to temperature for GS than for AS. Soil moisture plays a vital
    role in stimulating soil microbe respiration and autotrophic respiration by enhancing
    microbial substrate availability, microbial biomass, and plant growth37. Moisture-induced
    changes in soil physical properties also impact CO2 emissions. In this study,
    Rs exhibits a negative correlation with soil moisture, suggesting that elevated
    moisture levels inhibit Rs. This inhibition may arise from increased soil particle
    adhesion, diminishing soil permeability and oxygen availability38. Elevated soil
    moisture content could also reduce rhizospheric and microbial activities, negatively
    affecting Rs39. The two-factor interaction of soil temperature and soil water
    content may better explain the variability of Rs, i.e. vegetation succession dominates
    the effects of soil temperature and soil water content on Rs40. Impact of soil
    physicochemical properties on soil respiration across vegetation succession stages
    on slopes Soil nutrient enrichment follows numerous pathways, encompassing hydrological,
    rhizospheric, vegetation, and animal contributions41. In our study, the GS boast
    nutrient-rich substrates, stimulating microbial metabolism and elevating Rs. Conversely,
    TP, TN, and inorganic nitrogen content gradually decline over time on SS and AS,
    contributing to reduced Rs. The lower Rs on these slopes can also be attributed
    to the high levels of recalcitrant lignin in their litter42. Furthermore, arboreal
    plant leaves generally exhibit lower C/N ratios compared to herbaceous plants,
    which may enhance soil microbial biomass and activity (Rs and mineralization).
    This interaction leads to the integration of litter with rhizospheric biomass,
    limiting the accumulation of C and N in near-surface soils43. The low nutrient
    content on NS serves as the primary reason for their lower Rs compared to VC-restored
    slopes. We found that vegetation succession modulates the degree of influence
    of slope ecosystems on Rs, and this influence modulation is mainly governed by
    soil physicochemical properties, especially soil NO3–-N and MBN. Because NO3–-N
    promotes microbial-mediated Rs, nitrogen transformations in the soil such as nitrification
    increase soil acidification, coupled with the fact that vegetated concrete is
    an alkaline substrate, carbonate-containing soils neutralize acidity and release
    CO244, which manifests itself in the early stages of succession as the highest
    levels of NO3–-N. At the same time, the positive interaction between substrate
    structure and ecological amendment decay in the early stage of succession increased
    the effective soil nitrogen content, thus enhancing microbial fixation of nitrogen
    and improving nitrogen uptake and utilization by fine roots. Rs is reduced as
    soil temperature and litter inputs decrease, inhibiting microbial activity and
    thus reducing microbial species richness and diversity45. In addition, Rs was
    also positively correlated with SOC, as shown by the gradual decrease of SOC during
    vegetation succession, followed by the decrease of Rs. The main reason was the
    rapid decomposition of organic matter due to the increase in soil temperature
    and substrate quality, consistent with the results of Liu et al.46. In addition,
    there is also partly originated from microbial-mediated heterotrophic respiration.
    In this study, Rs was found to be negatively correlated with DOC, while soil heterotrophic
    respiration was mainly associated with fungi or with fungus-associated bacteria20,
    also noted that the α-diversity of bacteria is driven by DOC and the β-diversity
    is mainly driven by water content. The evolution of herbaceous to arboreal populations
    may cause a shift from fungal to bacterial populations, thereby reducing Rs. Overall,
    VC ecological restoration techniques reduced slope Rs in the later stages of vegetation
    succession, the supply of substrates (e.g. SOC) such as VC substrates with the
    addition of eco-conditioner significantly increases the level of soil microbial
    metabolism, which further confirms that ecological restoration is an important
    measure to reduce \"carbon sources\" in ecosystems. Therefore, the application
    of VC ecological restoration technology in the ecological restoration process
    of slopes can reduce the carbon emissions in the disturbed area of the project,
    which is an effective method to help achieve carbon neutrality. Conclusions In
    this study, we found that monthly changes in RS and its components were consistent
    with changes in soil temperature, showing a clear single-peak curve, with peaks
    occurring in July and August. VC restoration techniques showed a decreasing trend
    in soil respiration rates during vegetation succession, with a 45% reduction in
    AS compared to GS and a 27.51% reduction in AS compared to NS. Soil temperature
    and moisture content are the main abiotic factors affecting soil respiration.
    RS was significantly and positively correlated with NO3–-N and MBN, both of which
    are important factors in regulating RS under vegetation succession. Soil physicochemical
    properties explained 79.2% of the soil respiration rate. Overall, succession of
    vegetation cover types on high and steep slopes reduces Rs, and soil temperature
    and soil moisture content play an important role in regulating soil respiration.
    VC slopes have lower Rs than NS slopes in the later stages of ecological restoration,
    and the application of VC technology can help to reduce soil carbon emissions
    in project-disturbed areas. Data availability Additional Supporting Information

    Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Climate change has emerged as a pressing
    global issue that poses significant challenges to human societies and the environment
    [1,2,3]. Climate change is primarily due to human activities, particularly the
    extensive combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These
    human activities generate a substantial amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
    gases, leading to global warming. Global warming, a persistent increase in Earth’s
    average temperature, is the most significant manifestation of climate change.
    This change in climate has led to numerous severe effects, including an increase
    in extreme weather events [2] (such as storms, floods, and droughts), the melting
    of glaciers and ice caps, a rise in sea levels, and changes to ecosystems [4]
    and agriculture [5, 6]. If left these impacts unchecked, these impacts could have
    disastrous consequences for human societies and the natural environment. In 1992,
    the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was signed
    at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The goal was \"to prevent dangerous
    human interference with the climate system,\" and it required countries to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with their responsibilities, abilities,
    and specific circumstances. The first substantive agreement of the UNFCCC, the
    Kyoto Protocol [7], was signed in 1997, requiring industrialized countries to
    reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to below 5% of 1990 levels between 2008
    and 2012. In 2009, the UN hosted a climate change conference in Copenhagen in
    an attempt to reach a new global agreement; however, the meeting ended without
    a clear agreement and was considered a failure [8]. The Paris Agreement [9] was
    signed at the UN Climate Change Conference in 2015, with the goal of keeping global
    warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue
    efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve this,
    countries agreed to submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to reduce
    emissions and to review these goals every five years. These agreements and meetings
    highlight the challenges of combating climate change, including in science, policy,
    economics, and justice. A key issue is how to ensure economic development and
    poverty reduction while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These challenges and
    issues are intimately related to sustainable human development. The Brundtland
    Report, “Our Common Future [10],” was released by the United Nations World Commission
    on Environment and Development in 1987. The report first introduced the concept
    of “sustainable development,” defined as “meeting the needs of the present without
    compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” The Rio
    Declaration [11] and Agenda 21 [12] were both signed at the Earth Summit in 1992.
    The Rio Declaration included 27 principles on sustainable development, while Agenda
    21 was a global action plan aimed at achieving a balance between the environment
    and development. In 2000, the United Nations established eight development goals
    to be achieved by 2015, known as the United Nations Millennium Development Goals
    (MDGs), which included reducing extreme poverty and hunger, improving levels of
    education, health, and gender equality, and ensuring environmental sustainability.
    The United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
    in 2015, which outlines 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a blueprint
    for achieving a more sustainable future for all [13]. Among them, SDG13 (Climate
    Action) is directly related to climate change, with the aim to \"take urgent action
    to combat climate change and its impacts\". SDG13 encourages all countries to
    respond to climate change, strengthen their resilience and adaptability to its
    impacts, and integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies,
    and plans. The goal also emphasizes enhancing education, raising people''s awareness
    of the threats posed by climate change, and increasing institutional capacities
    to handle climate change. It also refers to global participation and cooperation
    in addressing these issues. This includes development assistance to help developing
    countries enhance their capacities to deal with climate change. The goal of sustainable
    development is to achieve balance in social, economic, and environmental dimensions,
    a principle also known as the “triple bottom line [14].” Under this framework,
    it is not only necessary to ensure economic growth and social justice but also
    to ensure the health and sustainability of the Earth''s ecosystems and resources.
    Therefore, addressing climate change is an integral part of achieving sustainable
    development. On the other hand, accomplishing one or more sustainable development
    goals is also a way to address climate change issues. 1.2 Research frontier Addressing
    the issue of climate change faces many challenges and obstacles, including political
    challenges, economic factors, technological challenges, social and cultural barriers,
    and issues of inequality. Firstly, policy makers need to strike a balance between
    short-term economic benefits and long-term environmental sustainability. Political
    disagreements and national interests can also hinder the achievement and implementation
    of global climate agreements [15, 16]. Secondly, transitioning to a low-carbon
    economy requires a significant amount of funding and investment. Many economically
    backward countries may lack resources to implement necessary changes [17]. Thirdly,
    although renewable energy technologies have made significant progress, these technologies
    still can''t completely replace fossil fuels in many cases [18]. Fourthly, human
    lifestyles and consumption patterns need to undergo major changes, which may face
    resistance in many societies and cultures [19]. Lastly, the impacts of climate
    change are not equal globally. Some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries
    and communities are often the most affected, yet they lack the resources and capacity
    to cope with these changes [20]. There are numerous studies related to climate
    change, and these studies encompass a wide range of issues. Issues related to
    climate change and sustainable development goals [21], for example, the water-energy-food
    (nexus), has been extensively studied in relation to climate change in the past
    [22]. In this issue, systematic analyses, comparisons, interpretations, and governance
    recommendations have been proposed, along with in-depth exploration of sustainable
    development goals and appropriate management models [23,24,25]. The connection
    between climate change and the SDGs is evident, as the impacts of climate change
    have the potential to undermine the progress made towards achieving these goals
    [166, 167]. For instance, climate change has direct implications for SDGs [26,27,28,29,30,31,32]
    related to poverty reduction(SDG1: NO Poverty), food security(SDG2: No Hunger)
    [33,34,35,36,37,38,39],energy(SDG7: Affordable and clean energy) [40,41,42,43],
    clean water and sanitation(SDG6: Clean water and sanitation), and sustainable
    cities [44,45,46] and communities(SDG11 Sustainable cities and communities). People
    must take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, including enhancing
    the resilience and adaptive capacity of nations to climate-related disasters,
    and integrating climate change measures into national policies and planning(SDG13:
    Climate action). Therefore, understanding the trends and patterns of research
    on the interlinkages between climate change and the SDGs is crucial for policymakers,
    researchers, and practitioners to identify gaps and prioritize efforts in addressing
    these challenges [47,48,49]. However, many topics still require systematic research
    to formulate sustainable management strategies. For instance, key decisions from
    the COP26 held in 2021 included the formulation of long-term low-carbon development
    strategies, strengthening actions to reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gases (such as
    methane), and enhancing the intensity of nationally determined contributions (NDC)
    targets for 2030 [50,51,52,53]. Comprehensive assessments are needed on how countries
    can gradually reduce coal burning and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, as well
    as establish rules for the international carbon market [54]. In order to follow
    these resolutions, the majority of countries around the world are currently formulating
    net-zero emission management strategies. Net-zero emissions mean that the greenhouse
    gas emissions produced by an organization, city, region, or country are balanced
    by the amount they offset, thereby contributing zero to global warming [55]. When
    systematically formulating net-zero management strategies, there are several important
    topics that need to be considered, such as energy transition (requiring investment
    and policy promotion to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy) [56, 57],
    green infrastructure (constructing low-carbon, green infrastructure, such as green
    buildings and public transportation systems) [58], green finance (encouraging
    and guiding financial institutions to invest in low-carbon technologies and industries,
    and incorporating climate risks into their risk management frameworks) [59], carbon
    pricing (establishing and implementing carbon pricing systems, such as carbon
    taxes or carbon trading markets, to reflect their true environmental costs), and
    international cooperation (climate change is a global issue that requires cooperation
    among countries to share resources and technology). It involves multiple Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs). These strategies need to take into account trade-offs
    or synergistic effects, including the balance between economy and environment
    (energy transition may lead to job loss in certain industries, but it may also
    create new job opportunities. Appropriate policies are needed to mitigate the
    impact of this transition) [60,61,62], fairness (wealthier countries have more
    resources to reduce emissions, while poorer countries may rely more on fossil
    fuels. To resolve this inequality, international aid or other mechanisms may be
    needed) [63, 64], cross-sector collaboration (many solutions will require cooperative
    work between different sectors or industries, such as energy, transportation,
    construction, finance, etc.) [65, 66], technological innovation and application
    (from improving energy efficiency to developing clean energy, and designing and
    implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, technological innovation
    plays a key role in achieving net-zero. Of course, this also requires resource
    input and a suitable policy environment to incentivize and support) [67,68,69],
    behavioral and cultural change (to successfully achieve net-zero, it may be necessary
    to change public behavior and values, from dietary habits to travel methods, and
    attitudes towards energy use. This may involve education, policy guidance, and
    public participation) [70, 71], and ecological restoration and protection (forests,
    oceans, and other natural ecosystems are important carbon sinks of the planet.
    Protecting and restoring these ecosystems can provide important offset strategies,
    while also helping to protect biodiversity and enhance ecological resilience)
    [72]. Strategies to address climate change include mitigation and adaptation.
    The aforementioned net zero is a mitigation strategy, while the formulation of
    adaptation strategies to manage and respond to climate change also requires systematic
    consideration. This includes disaster prevention and post-disaster recovery, water
    resource management, adjustments to farming and livestock practices, urban planning
    and design, protection and restoration of ecosystems, and policy and legislation
    among other topics. Additionally, research suggests that enhancing the ability
    to manage extreme weather events can reduce economic, social, and human losses,
    and ultimately decrease borrowing from lending institutions. The vulnerability
    to extreme weather events, disaster management, and adaptation must become part
    of the long-term sustainable development planning for developing countries [73,74,75,76].
    In this process, there indeed exist many challenges, echoing the previously mentioned
    obstacles faced in tackling the issue of climate change. These include technical,
    policy-related, economic, social, and cultural aspects. Therefore, people must
    take a systemic and holistic approach, implementing solutions to climate change
    from the framework of sustainable development. Currently, there are over ten thousand
    academic papers discussing the relevance of climate change or one or more Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs). There are numerous ways to summarize, integrate, or
    categorize these research perspectives. Common methods include convening expert
    meetings [77, 168] or using literature mining software [73, 74, 78, 169, 170]
    such as VOSviewer, Microsoft Excel, and Biblioshiny, to conduct structured reviews
    of the interrelationships between Climate Change (CC) and SDGs. The discussions
    at the expert meeting revealed the synergies and trade-offs between climate change
    and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as the impact of climate change
    (CC) on the achievement of the SDGs [77]. Using literature software, the bibliometrix
    package, and R library, it was found that precipitation, drought, and evapotranspiration
    are the main climate terms most focused on under the topic of climate change [79].
    Moreover, an analysis using Microsoft Excel on published journal articles found
    that gender equality, climate action, and global health are the key words most
    focused on in studies related to the Sustainable Development Goals. Some researchers
    also presented the evolution of themes over the years, and the co-occurrence maps
    of key words in the context of climate change and sustainable development practice,
    and found that there have been many research studies in these areas, but there
    is still a need for more in-depth study [80]. However, as highlighted in the background,
    after the 2015 Paris Agreement and the United Nations'' Sustainable Development
    Goals were proposed, researchers worldwide are called upon to perform comprehensive
    and systematic analyses, categorizations, and discussions of the results presented
    by these literature analysis tools. These efforts aim to aid researchers and policymakers
    in addressing climate change and its related problems, as well as formulating
    suitable strategies for these issues, all from a perspective of sustainable development.
    These areas continue to require further in-depth research, and bibliometric analysis
    can serve as one effective method in this regard. 1.3 Research questions The research
    question of this study is to examine the trends of major issues connecting climate
    change and the SDGs, as reflected in the literature [81, 82]. In particular, the
    study aims to identify the most prominent Clusters and sub-Clusters related to
    this intersection and to understand the evolution of research in this area over
    time. This examination will help uncover potential gaps in knowledge, as well
    as highlight areas in need of further investigation or policy intervention. Additionally,
    when systematically analyzing the issues and sub-issues of climate change within
    the framework of sustainable development, we still do not have a clear understanding
    of how many important issues related to climate change have emerged since the
    United Nations announced the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, as well as
    the proportion of these issues in the research or which fields is leading in these
    areas [75, 77, 83]. The policy-making and research processes have not had sufficient
    literature to help understand the varying degrees of correlation between these
    issues to aid policy-makers or researchers in making appropriate strategies. Moreover,
    one indicator of the current situation in various countries is the development
    status of how researchers or research institutions in these countries view climate
    change within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals, but there is
    limited academic research on the issues connecting climate change and the sustainable
    development goals [84]. This study poses four questions: Q1: What are the main
    research topics at the intersection of climate change and sustainable development
    goals? Q2: How have the research trends at the intersection of climate change
    and sustainable development goals developed? Q3: What are the main research countries
    at the intersection of climate change and sustainable development goals? Q4: What
    are the main research fields at the intersection of climate change and sustainable
    development goals? 1.4 Methodological approach This study employs a bibliometric
    analysis to systematically review and analyze the body of literature on the connection
    between climate change and the SDGs. Bibliometric analysis is a quantitative method
    that employs statistical techniques to analyze and classify large volumes of academic
    publications. This method has the advantage of providing a comprehensive and objective
    overview of the research landscape [85], as compared to traditional literature
    reviews and other classification methods, which may be subject to biases and limited
    in scope [80, 86, 87]. 1.5 Significance of the study The findings of this study
    will provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns of research on the
    interlinkages between climate change and the SDGs, helping to inform future research
    agendas and policy interventions. By identifying the most prominent Clusters and
    potential knowledge gaps in this area, this study can contribute to a better understanding
    of how climate change and the SDGs are interconnected, thereby supporting the
    development of more effective strategies to address these pressing global challenges.
    1.6 Potential applications The results of this study can be applied in various
    ways. For instance, the findings can be used by researchers to identify research
    gaps and opportunities, guiding the direction of future studies. Policymakers
    and practitioners can also use the insights gained from this study to prioritize
    efforts and allocate resources more effectively in addressing the challenges posed
    by climate change and achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, the study can contribute
    to the development of interdisciplinary research, as understanding the complex
    interconnections between climate change and the SDGs requires the integration
    of knowledge from multiple fields and disciplines. In conclusion, this study aims
    to explore the research trends and patterns of major issues connecting climate
    change and the SDGs using a bibliometric analysis. The findings will provide valuable
    insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. 2 Methodology 2.1 Literature
    mining tools This study analyzes and categorizes literature using the two tools.
    The first one is called Content Analysis Toolkit for Academic Research (CATAR),
    the other one is called VOSviewer. 2.1.1 The benefits of using CATAR for literature
    analysis CATAR is designed to help researchers analyze scholarly literature with
    academic value. CATAR is particularly effective in multidimensional scaling (MDS)
    and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) [88], which can be used as one
    of the presentation directions for research outcomes. MDS is a technique that
    presents n documents on a map according to their similarity [89], where documents
    with high similarity cluster in close proximity to each other, while those with
    low similarity are located further apart. HAC is a type of document clustering
    [90] that does not require users to specify the number of categories and can iteratively
    group the most similar documents or categories into larger groups, gradually organizing
    all documents from the bottom up. In particular, the complete linkage method can
    group files that are highly similar to each other into the same group. Therefore,
    if two files cite common bibliography, they will generate a coupling relationship,
    and the more bibliography they share, the higher the correlation will be, and
    the more likely they will be classified into the same category. The topic map
    of this study was generated by CATAR using multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique
    to calculate the relative relationships between categories in a two-dimensional
    space and draw the topic map accordingly. In the map, circles represent a group
    of documents classified into the same cluster, with the size of the circle indicating
    the number of documents in the group, and the distance between circles representing
    the strength of the relationship between the groups. The closer the circles, the
    higher the relevance between the topics. The color of the circle represents the
    classification result in the next higher level, and if the circle is composed
    of dashed lines, it indicates that it cannot be clustered in the next level [91].
    2.1.2 The benefits of using VOSviewer for literature analysis The second tool
    used in this study is VOSviewer, which is a visualization tool characterized by
    its technical robustness and relatively simple usage. It allows for a detailed
    examination of bibliometric maps. In the network visualization maps produced by
    VOSviewer, each label is represented by a colored node, with node size determined
    by the frequency of use of the item. The higher the usage frequency of an item,
    the larger its label. In addition, the thickness of the nodes and connecting lines
    indicates the co-occurrence frequency of the labels. Nodes with the same color
    have stronger connections [74, 84, 85, 92]. As keyword co-occurrence network analysis
    is one of the most effective methods, a large number of studies have used VOSviewer
    for topics such as climate change or sustainable energy [91, 93, 94], helping
    researchers quantify trends in research Clusters and future research directions.
    This study use keyword co-occurrence network analysis in Vosviewer. 2.2 Explanation
    of data background 2.2.1 The selection of the database The data source for this
    study is the Web of Science (WoS) academic database by Thomson Routers. Analysis
    of citation data in WoS has shown greater consistency and accuracy than other
    databases such as Scopus and Google Scholar, [95] thus this study only analyzed
    journals included in WoS. 2.2.2 Boolean operators The background setting for downloading
    data from WoS was as follows: TS = (climate change) AND AB = (\"sustainable development
    goal\" OR \"sustainable development goals\" OR SDG OR SDGs). These documents are
    focused on the Cluster of climate change, and the mention of SDGs in the abstract
    refers to the United Nations'' Sustainable Development Goals. The SDGs aim to
    address major global issues, including poverty, hunger, inequality, and climate
    change. Therefore, if a document related to climate change also involves SDGs,
    it may explore how to link climate change with sustainable development goals to
    achieve a more sustainable future. Such research may investigate the impact of
    climate change on sustainable development goals or how to address issues related
    to climate change by achieving sustainable development goals. 2.2.3 The status
    of literature download In order to understand the research trends up to December
    31, 2022, a total of 2533 articles were downloaded for analysis. On the other
    hand, when downloading data from the WOS database, it was found that the closer
    it was to 2022, the more literature discussed CC and SDGs. In order to understand
    the research trends every 2–3 years and appropriately distribute the number of
    articles for analysis, research from 2015 to 2017, 2018 to 2022, and 2021 to 2022
    was also downloaded. A total of 177 articles were from the first three years,
    955 articles were from the middle three years, and 1401 articles were from the
    last two years. 3 Results and discussion The research results are presented using
    the analysis results of two tools, CATAR and VOSviewer. The two research tools
    are distinguished by date. The data analyzed by the CATAR tool dates from 2015
    to 2022, and this tool carries out a comprehensive analysis of the literature.
    The data analyzed by the VOSviewer tool is divided into three parts: 2015–2017
    (the first three years), 2018–2020 (the middle three years), and 2021–2022 (the
    most recent two years), to understand the development trends of the research field.
    In addition, CATAR also specifically presents the main research fields and research
    countries of the literature as academic references. 3.1 Results and dicussion
    of bibliographic coupling analysis by using CATAR (2015–2022) Using CATAR for
    bibliographic coupling analysis and multiple hierarchical agglomerative clustering,
    19 clusters (A-1 to A-19) were obtained at the fourth level, with 1220 documents
    participating in clustering. The characteristic vocabulary of each cluster is
    shown in Table 1 (with a default threshold of 0.01), and the degree of association
    is shown in Fig. 1, (with a threshold set to 0.02). Furthermore, the top five
    clusters in terms of proportion are related to agricultural and food systems,
    water and soil resources, energy, economy, ecosystem, and sustainable management,
    with a proportion of 53% of the documents in this level. The first cluster has
    the highest proportion of 34%. Table 1 CATAR categorizes linkages between CC and
    SDGs (2015–2022) Full size table Fig. 1 Maps of the clusters (2015–2022) Full
    size image In Fig. 1, clusters 10, 11, 15, and 17 are in green, clusters 4 and
    14 are in blue, and clusters 12, and 16 are in yellow. These colors indicate that
    they can continue to form clusters in the next level and suggest that these topics
    are worth exploring as they are related to each other. Dashed circles represent
    clusters that cannot be agglomerated in the next level. Referring to Table 1 for
    the keywords condensed in each cluster, appropriate names for the clusters are
    assigned. The results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 The topic of clusters (2015–2022)
    Full size table Through the research results of Fig. 1, since the circles represent
    the knowledge content contained in the cluster, considering factors such as circle
    color, circle size, and the intersection and union of circles, a systematic discussion
    is conducted below. 3.1.1 The relationship about A-10, A-11, A15 and A17 (color
    green) In the green circle, A-10, A-11, A-15, and A-17 are four significant topics.
    The critical issues intersecting these four topics, this study discovered, include
    \"Adaptation and mitigation strategies\", \"Integration of knowledge and collaboration\",
    and \"Urban and community context\". The four Clusters collectively highlight
    the importance of both adaptation and mitigation strategies in response to climate
    change. Cluster 10 emphasizes the need to understand and address the health impacts
    of climate change as an adaptation measure [88, 89, 96]. Cluster 11 focuses on
    building resilience in coastal areas, which is another form of adaptation [97].
    Cluster 15 covers various aspects of climate change adaptation strategies, including
    public health, particularly sanitation issues, large urban environments, and the
    application of green and blue infrastructure. It emphasizes the importance of
    considering these issues from both local and global perspectives [98,99,100,101,102].
    Cluster 17 centers on mitigation strategies such as achieving carbon neutrality
    through renewable energy sources [95, 97, 103,104,105]. Clusters 11 and 17 highlight
    the importance of integrating knowledge from various sources and fostering collaboration
    between different stakeholders. Cluster 11 emphasizes the role of knowledge integration
    in sustainability governance, while Cluster 17 involves surveys and research on
    carbon balance and renewable energy, which require collaboration among experts
    from various fields. Cluster 10, 11 and 17 explore the impacts of climate change
    and sustainable development within urban or community settings. Cluster 10 investigates
    the relationship between climate change and health in the context of planetary
    health. Cluster 15 addresses the role of green and blue infrastructure in promoting
    sustainable development within mega-urban areas. Cluster 17 focuses on achieving
    carbon neutrality in cities or countries, which has direct implications for urban
    and community sustainability. 3.1.2 The relationship between “ocean conservation
    and coral reef biodiversity” (A-12) and “corporate cultural sustainability” (A-16)
    (color yellow) The relationship between \"Ocean Conservation and Coral Reef Biodiversity\"
    and \"Corporate Cultural Sustainability\" is closely connected to climate change
    and ongoing sustainable development [106,107,108]. Many companies recognize the
    importance of environmental sustainability, particularly in the context of climate
    change and sustainable development. They incorporate this into their business
    strategies, which includes supporting ocean conservation and preserving coral
    reef biodiversity through environmentally-friendly practices, philanthropy, or
    partnerships with non-profit organizations. Examples of this include adopting
    sustainable practices and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting innovation
    in products, services, and technologies that contribute to ocean conservation
    and coral reef biodiversity protection, and collaborating with various stakeholders,
    including customers, employees, investors, and local communities, to address the
    challenges of climate change and support ocean conservation and coral reef biodiversity
    preservation [109,110,111]. 3.1.3 The relationship between “ecosystems and land
    degradation” (A-4) and “urban infrastructure and governance” (A-14) (color blue)
    First, Climate change poses threats to ecosystems and land, including extreme
    weather events and unstable rainfall patterns. Ecosystems play a crucial role
    in land conservation, water resource management, and biodiversity protection.
    Disrupting ecosystems increases the risk of land degradation, adversely affecting
    agriculture and ecological environments. Protecting and restoring ecosystems are
    key to achieving sustainable development goals [171, 172]. Second, rapid urbanization
    necessitates large-scale infrastructure development. The expansion and management
    of urban infrastructure are directly linked to land use. Poor urban planning and
    management can lead to improper land use, overdevelopment, and environmental deterioration.
    Effective urban governance should emphasize the sustainability of land use, including
    land planning and environmental regulation. Sustainable urban infrastructure and
    governance help reduce the risk of land degradation while achieving sustainable
    development goals [173,174,175,176]. Therefore, the relationship between ecosystems
    and land degradation and urban infrastructure and governance should be viewed
    comprehensively. The expansion and management of urban infrastructure should fully
    consider ecosystem protection and land degradation prevention. For instance, urban
    planning may include the preservation of green spaces and natural conservation
    areas to promote ecosystem health. Moreover, urban governance should emphasize
    the involvement of multiple stakeholders to ensure that land use and infrastructure
    development align with the principles of sustainable development. This necessitates
    interdisciplinary research and policy formulation to ensure effective management
    of land resources during the urbanization process while safeguarding ecosystems
    to address climate change and achieve sustainable development goals. 3.2 Ranking
    of countries by the number of published papers, citation count, and publication
    year The overview analysis through CATAR is used to present the top eight countries
    in terms of the number of published papers. Considering that each piece of literature
    might be co-authored by multiple individuals, the analysis results are presented
    using Fractional Count (FC). FC means that all the co-authors are counted as a
    single author. For instance, a paper co-authored by two individuals is counted
    as one, and the contribution of each author to the paper count is 0.5 and 0.5,
    respectively. The results of the FC statistics are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. We
    can observe that within the defined scope, the number of papers has significantly
    increased since 2015. The top eight countries in terms of the number of published
    papers, from most to least, are the United States, the United Kingdom, China,
    Australia, India, Germany, the Netherlands, and South Africa. If we only look
    at 2022, the top eight countries from most to least are China, India, the United
    States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Spain, Germany, and Canada. Fig. 2 Statistical

    and their publication years, using Fractional Count Full size image Fig. 3 Statistical
    analysis of the top eight countries in terms of the number of papers published
    in 2022, using Fractional Count Full size image 3.2.1 The number of articles interpreting
    climate change issues from the perspective of sustainable development goals By
    observing the results presented in Fig. 2, two pieces of information can be identified.
    The first piece of information is that, whether the data time is from 2015 to
    2022 or only looking at 2022, China, India, the United States, the United Kingdom,
    and Australia are all in the top five. The reasons for this include several factors:
    The first factor is economic influence. These countries are significant pillars
    of the global economy, and their policies and investment decisions have massive
    impacts on the global economy. For instance, China is the world''s largest manufacturer
    and largest emitter of carbon dioxide, while the United States, as the world''s
    largest economy, holds significant sway in driving global climate action. The
    second factor is population size. India and China are the two most populous countries
    globally, and their decisions will have monumental impacts on global climate change.
    In countries with large populations, the need for sustainable development is particularly
    pressing [112,113,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,121]. The third factor is influence in
    science and technology. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia hold
    leadership positions in the field of science and technology, including research
    and development in climate science and environmental technologies. Their innovations
    and solutions can have significant impacts on the global climate change issue
    [115,116,117]. The fourth factor is policy and international leadership. These
    countries play critical roles in global policy and international affairs [122,123,124,125].
    For instance, the United Kingdom was the host of the 2021 United Nations Climate
    Change Conference (COP26), and the United States also plays a leading role in
    driving the global climate agenda. 3.2.2 The increase and decrease of the number
    of papers published by each country The second piece of information is that regardless
    of the country, the number of publications generally shows a growing trend from
    2015 to 2021. The sharp increase in relevant literature published by China and
    India in 2022 indicates that addressing the challenges brought about by climate
    change and achieving sustainable development goals are issues of concern to these
    countries [126,127,128]. 3.3 Number of publications on the relationship between
    CC and SDGs by field As shown in Fig. 4, the top eight fields and years in terms
    of the number of publications can be seen. We can observe that since 2015, there
    has been a significant increase in literature discussing the relationship between
    CC and SDGs. The field of Environmental Sciences & Ecology has consistently had
    the most publicated documents every year, followed by the field of Science & Technology—Other
    Topics. Fig. 4 Number of publications on the relationship between CC and SDGs
    by field Full size image 3.4 Tracking the research development trends on climate
    change issues from the framework of sustainable development goals every 2–3 years
    The literature mining tool, Vosviewer, was used to perform co-occurrence word
    analysis on authors. Due to the small number of articles from 2015 to 2017, the
    clustering result is shown in Fig. 5. The clustering results for 2018–2020 and
    2021–2022 are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 respectively. The larger the clustered keyword,
    the more frequently it is mentioned by authors. Keywords of the same color indicate
    a higher degree of association, and are likely to discuss important topics. Fig.

    change and the implementation of sustainable development goals during 2015–2017
    During 2015–2017, it is found that research keywords regarding climate change
    and the implementation of sustainable development goals mainly include \"Ecosystem,\"
    \"Climate change adaptation,\" \"Disaster risk,\" \"Reduction,\" \"Public health,\"
    \"Renewable energy,\" \"Resilience,\" and \"Water security.\" The topic discussed
    during this period is mainly \"The impact of climate change on public health and
    its adaptation strategies.\" This topic covers the mutual influences of various
    aspects including environmental ecology, climate change, and public health, emphasizing
    on how to reduce disaster risks and improve public health levels through the protection
    and management of ecosystems to adapt to the challenges brought about by climate
    change. On the other hand, the development of renewable energy, sustainable agriculture,
    and the establishment of water security strategies also contribute to coping with
    climate change [129,130,131,132]. 3.4.2 Keywords and topics related to climate
    change and the implementation of sustainable development goals during 2018–2020
    During 2018–2020, the research trend in discussing climate change and the implementation
    of sustainable development goals partially continued from the previous period,
    and the number of keywords increased. On the other hand, from a broader framework,
    the research trend shifted towards cross-disciplinary approaches to tackle and
    adapt to climate change issues and explored how to achieve this goal by protecting
    the environment and promoting sustainable development [133]. The most widely addressed
    topics represented by keywords of different colors include the following top four:
    \"Efficient use and management of food supply to water resources\", \"Sustainable
    ecosystem management and land use under climate change\", \"Adaptation strategies
    and sustainable development strategies for agriculture under climate change\",
    and \"Development of renewable energy\" [134,135,136,137,138,139]. 3.4.3 Keywords
    and topics related to climate change and the implementation of sustainable development
    goals during 2021–2022 By 2021–2022, the research trend showed that some keywords
    regarding climate change and the implementation of sustainable development goals
    continued from the previous stage, and the number of keywords also increased.
    During this time period, ''renewable energy'' (marked in red) has become the most
    emphasized keyword against the backdrop of hot advocacy topics such as ''Net Zero''
    and ''CBAM'' (carbon border adjustment mechanism). It particularly emphasizes
    how, in the process of pursuing economic growth, we can reduce carbon dioxide
    emissions and achieve sustainable development by improving energy efficiency and
    using renewable energy [140].This also echoes the resolutions of COP26 and COP27,
    which call for an increased proportion of clean energy, including renewable and
    low-carbon energy sources, acceleration in the research and development, deployment,
    and dissemination of low-carbon technologies, and emphasis on the importance of
    natural carbon sinks [133, 141,142,143,144,145]. Other important keywords are
    resilience (in orange), ecosystem services; life cycle assessment (in blue), Africa;
    agriculture (in dark green), policy; adaptation; education (in purple), and Agenda
    2030; Paris Agreement; synergy; bibliometric analysis; remote sensing; desertification
    (in light green). These keywords are all related to the clusters of climate change
    and sustainable development, encompassing topics such as the protection of ecosystem
    services [140, 146,147,148], life cycle assessment, agriculture in Africa, policy;
    adaptation, education [149,150,151,152,153,154], the global sustainable development
    goals (Agenda 2030), the Paris Agreement, the synergistic effects of various policies
    [155,156,157,158], bibliometric analysis, remote sensing technology [159,160,161],
    and desertification [162,163,164,165]. 4 Conclusion This study, through bibliometric
    analysis tools CATAR and VOSviewer, presents multiple research findings. First,
    both tools indicate an increasing number of links between climate change and sustainable
    development goals in research across countries. There is a growing body of research
    and policy dedicated to finding and implementing strategies to solve climate change
    issues. These strategies are often linked to sustainable development goals, highlighting
    the intersection between climate action and sustainable development. Secondly,
    through CATAR, this study identified 19 clusters intersecting with climate change
    and SDGs (as shown in Table 2), among which the top five clusters in terms of
    proportion are related to agricultural and food systems, water and soil resources,
    energy, economy, ecosystem, and sustainable management, accounting for 53% of
    the documents. On the other hand, Fig. 1 also shows that some clusters are highly
    related (same color). Combined with Table 2 for further explanation, the key topics
    in the green block include adaptation and mitigation strategies, integration of
    knowledge and collaboration, and the urban and community context. The important
    topics in the yellow block are corporate sustainable development and biodiversity
    investment (especially focusing on the ocean). The important topics in the blue
    block include urban planning, sustainable governance, due to land degradation
    and the increased frequency of extreme weather events (such as droughts and floods)
    damaging ecosystems. Thirdly, whether the data period is from 2015 to 2022 or
    just in 2022, China, India, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia
    are the countries with the most research on the link between climate change and
    sustainable development goals. This is due to their economic influence, population
    size, influence in science and technology, and policy and international leadership.
    Specifically, in 2022, the number of publications in China and India grew at the
    fastest rate, while the growth trend in the UK and the US was slightly slower.
    Furthermore, Environmental Sciences & Ecology is the field with the most publications.
    Fourthly, by observing Figs. 5, 6, and 7, we can see the continuation and transformation
    of key topics in literature discussing the link between climate change and sustainable
    development goals. In the early period (2015–2017), the focus was on ''the impact
    of climate change on public health and its adaptation strategies''. By the mid-term
    (2018–2020), topics expanded to include ''efficient use and management of food
    supply to water resources'', ''sustainable ecosystem management and sustainable
    land use under climate change'', ''agricultural adaptation strategies and sustainable
    development strategies under climate change'', and ''development of renewable
    energy''. In the later period (2021–2022), under the context of popular initiatives
    like net zero and CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism), there was increased
    emphasis on renewable energy, as well as protection of ecosystem services, life
    cycle assessment, food security, agriculture in Africa, sustainable management,
    synergies of various policies, remote sensing technology, and desertification
    among others. This shows an increasingly diversified range of important topics
    being discussed in relation to climate change and sustainable development goals.
    The interconnections among the identified Clusters highlight the complex and interrelated
    nature of climate change and the 17 SDGs. Understanding these interconnections
    can help researchers, policymakers, and practitioners develop integrated and interdisciplinary
    approaches to address climate change and achieve the SDGs. For example, policies
    promoting agroforestry and sustainable agriculture can contribute to climate change
    mitigation, food security, and biodiversity conservation, thereby advancing multiple
    SDGs simultaneously. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the clusters that have
    not been part of the coalescence (as shown in the dashed circles in Fig. 1) do
    not imply that these topics are unimportant. On the contrary, these topics could
    potentially become the focus of emerging research in the future, serving as a
    reference for future researchers to conduct in-depth studies. Data availability
    The literature data used in this study were sourced from the Web of Science database.

    In this study, we selected the widely used SWAT + ecohydrological model as an

    To assist in these tasks, we developed an R package named SWATprepR, which provides
    functions for typical and repeating SWAT + model input data preparation tasks.
    The package supports the preparation of weather input files, atmospheric deposition,
    soil parameters, crop rotations, and observed (control or calibration) data, to

    are integrated in R script workflows and can help SWAT + modelers to avoid repetitive
    tasks, secure reproducibility and transparently document the data processing steps.
    Application of the package is illustrated with a test case of a SWAT + model for

    for the protection of ecosystems, which demand evidence-based policy making [1].
    Environmental modeling is an essential part of it, as policy makers can better
    understand the potential impacts of their decisions on the environment and identify
    the most effective strategies for mitigating or adapting to environmental challenges
    [2]. Transparency of methodology and reproducibility are crucial prerequisites
    for modeling studies intended to inform policy decisions [3]. Surprisingly, even
    among published peer-reviewed studies, these essential elements are often absent
    [4, 5]. This deficiency is creating legal challenges for policymakers, where environmental
    decision-making is based on modeling as input data, parameters, model assumptions
    and validation processes are most often questioned [3]. Furthermore, missing transparency
    and reproducibility in hydrological modeling studies raises concerns about the
    scientific quality of the results. This has resulted in an increasing demand from
    funding agencies and journals for the disclosure of the original data and code
    used in computations, highlighting its crucial role in scientific quality control
    [6]. The idea of scripted workflows designed for environmental modeling has been
    provided to solve this weakness in modeling studies [5, 7]. The main principle
    is that a common set of scripts is provided, with components designed to download
    and process input data, restructure model inputs to conform with required formats,
    run scenarios, extract results and compare them with the “baseline” or each other.
    If those scripts are prepared with commonly used open source scripting languages
    such as Python [8] or R [9] and released as packages via software sharing, collaboration
    and version control platforms (as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), then multiple
    possibilities for collaboration on further development and tailored adaptation
    of the tools are presented. However, these tools have to be properly generalized
    and documented, which is rarely the case as modelers primarily use scripting to
    aid in their own modeling applications. For example, the Soil and Water Assessment
    Tool (SWAT), a semi-distributed process-based ecohydrological modeling tool, has
    been employed for a duration exceeding a couple of decades [10]. It is free, open
    source and has been used worldwide for a great variety of surface water environment-related
    questions [11,12,13,14]. Records in the SWAT Literature Database provide around
    6000 scientific papers [15]. Its official website also provides multiple solutions
    for model tailoring to different questions or tools to prepare different inputs.
    However, the application of those tools in sequential order requires adaptation
    to multiple file formats, software installations, understanding of different graphical
    user interfaces and involves a lot of manual manipulation, which is difficult
    to connect programmatically and is error-prone. Some open source scripted tools
    have been made available for SWAT and the most recent SWAT + model versions [16].
    As an example, SWAT + AW [5] presented a user-friendly, Python-based scripted
    workflow for catchment modeling. This tool utilizes preprocessed input data to
    facilitate the assemblance of a SWAT + model setup. Other Python-based examples
    to be mentioned are PySWAT [17], swatpy [18] or SpotSWATplus, which are mainly
    designed for coupling SWAT + /SWAT with the SPOTpy library [19] to edit model
    parameters and run it. However, those packages are not in active development at
    the moment. Currently (as of July 2022), two packages are promoted on the official
    SWAT model website Footnote 1 which are developed using R: SWATrunR [20] and R-SWAT
    [21]. These packages are designed primarily for model sensitivity assessment,
    calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis. Their application examples are
    reported in several studies [22,23,24] and, based on development records in GitHub
    repositories, these packages are actively developed and updated. There are other
    available SWAT + related open source R packages in active development, such as:
    SWATdoctR [25], designed for model setup verification; SWATfarmR [26]—a tool for
    preparing advanced agricultural management schedules for SWAT models, SWATbuildR
    [27, 28]—a comprehensive tool for building SWAT + model setups that includes connectivity
    between spatial objects. Those packages have been developed, used, updated, and
    tested within the EU-funded Horizon 2020 research and innovation OPTAIN project
    (OPtimal strategies to reTAIN and re-use water and nutrients in small agricultural
    catchments across different soil-climatic regions in Europe) and described in
    the project’s modeling protocol [28]. Presented packages could be connected to
    a scripted workflow. Nevertheless, the tools mentioned necessitate preprocessed
    data, overlooking the labor-intensive process of preparing/preprocessing input
    data. Collection of such data, quality checks and preparation are probably the
    most time consuming stages in environmental modeling, which require proper diligence
    and verification to ensure smoothness of modeling effort in later steps [29].
    Open source scripted tools provide automatization to save time and proper documentation,
    how raw data were treated. Moreover, corrected or updated data frequently become
    available during the lifetime of projects. Thus, having a scripted workflow covering
    the input data preparation step is highly beneficial. Additionally, during an
    input data preparation stage, numerous questions could arise for the modeler.
    For instance, data have been obtained, but how accurate, complete, consistent
    is it? How to identify outliers and how to treat them correctly (remove or correct)?
    What data cover the temporal and spatial resolution needed? How to obtain important
    model input data or parameters, which are not measured in the field, and how to
    fill data gaps? Another set of questions are connected to data format handling.
    For instance, which units are needed for a model and how to convert to them? What
    format and in which structure data should be delivered for a model? What files
    have to be provided or updated so the model finds and uses delivered data in the
    correct way? How to track data preparation, handling and correct mistakes? How
    to document data handling so it could be reported and also used to add data in
    later stages, if more data become available or if someone else needs to update
    a modeling project, etc.? These are just a few examples of simple questions, which
    are likely to arise during the data preparation stage. Answering and providing
    solutions for them is time consuming. A valuable way to move forward and save
    modelers’ time would be through a systematic approach that offers open-source
    tools with pre-existing answers to some of these questions, along with a flexible
    framework to seamlessly incorporate new solutions. To further foster the use of
    automatized and transparent open source modeling workflows, this article introduces
    a new tool developed as an R package named SWATprepR with a collection of functions
    to preprocess input data and derive some missing parameters for the SWAT + model
    by providing demonstration examples of the tool’s functionality for one case study.
    The current version of the tool covers the important steps of input data preparation
    in SWAT + modeling, including weather and climate, atmospheric deposition, soil
    parameters, crop rotation, observation, and point source data. Since the package
    is open-source, it allows users to easily integrate their own solutions to enhance
    its capabilities and address additional requirements. SWATprepR package features
    The SWAT + model is a process-based, semi-distributed, small watershed to river
    basin-scale model, and it requires multiple types of input data [30]. These data
    should be identified, collected, quality assessed, cleaned and transformed to
    model usable formats. Proper input data preparation is often the most labor intense
    and prolonged phase in the modeling process. Figure 1 provides an overview of
    the main data required by the model. Fig. 1 Data requirements for SWAT/SWAT + model
    Full size image SWATprepR 1.0.2 version of the package includes functions which
    provide solutions to six different topics: weather data, atmospheric deposition,
    climate projection data, soil parameters, crop rotation and point source data.
    Functions can be categorized as designed for (i) loading data from the templates
    or online sources; (ii) plotting and cleaning data; (iii) calculating missing
    model parameters/data; and (iv) writing model input files (see Table 1). Detailed
    examples of application are presented in the https://biopsichas.github.io/SWATprepR/
    website. This section is used to present an overview of existing functionalities.
    Yet other functionalities are easily accessible with different R packages as well
    (examples provided on package website). Table 1 SWATprepR package features and
    functionality (X-functionality is supported in version 1.0.0) Full size table
    Weather and climate input Weather data hold significant importance for hydrological
    models as it determines the form of precipitation (whether it''s solid or liquid)
    and drives major water fluxes: e.g., evapotranspiration, and water flows within
    various media. Consequently, significant emphasis must be placed on quality assurance
    for meteorological variables. The SWATprepR package presents multiple options
    in addressing this concern, as depicted in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Main functions and their
    functionalities for weather data in SWATprepR package Full size image The main
    function is load_template(), which loads data from the Excel Footnote 2 template
    (named ‘weather_data.xlsx’) included in the package. The template requires typical
    information for meteorological stations, such as name, coordinates, altitude,
    and available time series for variables required by the SWAT + model (precipitation,
    temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation). The function loads data into
    the R environment in a specific object, represented as a nested list format, which
    is used by this package. Once the data have been imported, the user can apply
    all other functions to the object. Two other functions could be applied to load
    weather data from different formats to the same object. The load_swat_weather()
    function can be used to load weather data directly from SWAT + input text files
    and the load_weather_netcdf() function can be applied to load weather data directly
    from Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) files format [31], which is often used
    to store large datasets, such as climate time series data. Loaded data can be
    examined with multiple functions. For example, function plot_weather() can be
    used to perform a quality check on time series data. This function generates an
    interactive plot that shows data from all available stations. It offers various
    options for aggregation over multiple time intervals and provides different summarization
    functions such as mean, median, sum, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and
    more. By using the plot_weather_compare() function, the user can extend this capability
    to compare two datasets. Function plot_wgn_comparison() generates a plot for comparing
    weather statistical values for two datasets, which might be needed in the assessment
    of weather data from projected climate datasets. Upon loading and inspecting the
    data, the modeler may encounter situations in which certain stations have data
    gaps of different length. In such cases, different methods can be applied to fill
    in these gaps. For this purpose, the package provides the interpolate() function.
    To use this function, the modeler is required to provide a basin shapefile and
    a DEM raster file for the catchment area. Based on a user-defined grid spacing
    interval, the function creates virtual stations with interpolated weather variable
    data. The interpolation process is performed using the inverse distance weighting
    (IDW) method with a user-defined exponent parameter [32]. While there exist more
    sophisticated techniques for spatial interpolation of weather data [33], the IDW
    method has been widely used in different contexts for all weather variables required
    by SWAT + [34]. Another important input to SWAT + are weather statistical parameters,
    referred to as the input to the weather generator (WGEN or WGN). SWAT + uses the
    weather statistical data to fill gaps in daily weather data for short periods
    of time and to calculate plant growth initiation parameters. Despite the capability
    of in-build weather generator, the statistical data and its functionality are
    not recommended for simulating extended periods of missing data. To assist with
    this input, the official SWAT model website offers various tools, including the
    WGN Parameters Estimation Tool [35], WGN Excel macro [36], SWAT Precipitation
    Input Preprocessors and Dewpoint Estimation [37]. These tools require data preparation
    in different formats and demand familiarity with their respective functionalities.
    By using the SWATprepR package, in contrast, the modeler can calculate the required
    parameters with just a single command: prepare_wgn(), provided that weather data
    have been imported into the R environment. The remaining two functions, add_weather()
    and prepare_climate(), provide two options to write weather data into the SWAT + model
    setup database. The first function requires three elements: an object containing
    loaded weather data, an object containing the calculated weather generator parameters,
    and the SWAT + model setup database in.sqlite format. The prerequisite is that
    the setup database should not have any pre-existing weather station or weather
    generator parameters entered into it. The add_weather() function adds weather
    time series, weather station data, and weather generator parameters to the model
    setup. The prepare_climate() function provides the option to transform the weather
    time series data directly into the formatted text files, which are used by the
    SWAT + model executable. Atmospheric deposition input SWAT + provides the option
    to include the observed atmospheric nitrogen deposition data into the model simulation.
    The input file requires a reduced (NH4) and oxidized form (NO3) of nitrogen in
    dry (kg/ha/year) and wet deposition (mg/l). These data may be available at specific
    locations or collected with field measurements. Another source of such data are
    atmospheric models [38]. SWATprepR supports the extraction of atmospheric deposition
    data from such models and adds it to the SWAT + model setup database. The function
    get_atmo_dep() uses the basin boundary shapefile as an input and downloads the
    required atmospheric deposition data directly from Meteorological Synthesizing
    Centre—West (MSC-W) model output data provided by the European Monitoring and
    Evaluation Programme (EMEP). The EMEP domain covers the geographic area between
    30° N-82° N latitude and 30° W-90° E longitude [38]. Another function available
    in the current version of the package is add_atmo_dep(). To utilize it, the output
    from the get_atmo_dep() function and the path to the model setup database in.sqlite
    format is required. This function enables the incorporation of atmospheric deposition
    data into the model, allowing for the inclusion of deposition data ranging from
    daily to annual averages for a single station (Additional file 1). Soil parameters
    Soil characteristics are an important factor in determining the pathways of water
    when it reaches the land surface. Accurate soil parameters describing water and
    nutrient retention capacity and flow conditions in the soil matrix are essential
    for a successful and reliable SWAT + modeling study. Despite the current advancements
    in observations and data availability, in many study areas complete sets of required
    soil parameters are difficult, if at all possible, to obtain. Therefore the SWATprepR
    package includes a function, get_usersoil_table(), that simplifies the process
    of generating the complete set of soil parameters needed for the SWAT + model,
    i.e., moist bulk density, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity,
    moist albedo and Universal Soil Loss Equation soil erodibility factor. These parameters
    are derived automatically from commonly available soil datasets by pedotransfer
    functions and other equations available from the literature [39,40,41,42,43,44].
    To populate the SWAT + user soil parameter table, the modeler needs the following
    information for each soil layer within distinct soil types: Depth of layer; Percentage
    of clay defined as particles < 2 μm; Percentage of silt—2–50 μm; Percentage of
    sand—50–2000 μm; Soil organic carbon content in %. For assigning Hydrologic Soil
    Groups, tile drainage, depth to groundwater level and impervious layer data are
    needed. The theoretical documentation for the pedotransfer functions integrated
    in this function is presented in the Sect. “Lacking crop rotation data” of the
    OPTAIN SWAT + modeling protocol [28]. Crop rotation data The SWAT + model’s popularity
    can be partly attributed to the capabilities to simulate the impacts of agricultural
    land management on water resources and water quality. To fully utilize this functionality,
    the modeler is required to supply information about agricultural activities representative
    of the study area, with one of the most crucial pieces being crop rotation data.
    Such information is rarely available or freely accessible, especially in large
    or transboundary watersheds. In such cases, remote sensing data could be utilized
    to generate information about crop rotations for the selected time period. Although
    the SWATprepR package itself does not have a function for directly extracting
    remote sensing data, it does offer functions to work with results of open source
    scripts that perform this task. Google Earth Engine-based (GEE) remote sensing
    data extraction scripts were developed by Mészáros and Szabó [45] and described
    in a report of [46]. The script predicts crop types with a random forest method
    based on time series reflectance data of Sentinel 1A and 1B satellite radar images.
    The script generates a sequence of crop maps for each year as its output. To run
    this GEE script, the modeler needs the following input data: the shape of catchment
    boundary, continental or local crop data with coordinates as training points,
    and optionally, the boundaries of parcels or fields, if such data are available,
    which are added to the time series radar images selected based on the user-defined
    time period. The SWATprepR package provides two functions related to preprocessing
    (i) input data for the abovementioned GEE script and (ii) the derived time series
    crop map for the modeling. The first function, get_lu_points(), generates a set
    of training points for the remote sensing scripts. The second function, extract_rotation(),
    is designed for the extraction of crop rotation sequences per field. This data
    can be used with the SWATfarmR R package [26] to generate SWAT + model management
    input files. Observation data Observation data used for model calibration and
    validation are indispensable in most environmental model applications. Even though
    not strictly considered as model input data, they are required in the model preparation
    process for assessing and fine-tuning model performance. These data are usually
    collected and prepared along with other input data, and SWATprepR includes functions
    to quickly load, assess, plot, and clean monitoring data in the R environment
    (Fig. 3). It is important to emphasize that the SWATprepR functions were originally
    tailored for SWAT model users, but their versatility makes it straightforward
    to customize these functions for different variables or models as needed. Fig.
    3 Functions related to calibration/validation data in the SWATprepR package Full
    size image The load_template() function is used to load the data from the Excel
    template. A different template, named calibration_data.xlsx, is used to format
    the calibration data. After loading, the plot_cal_data() function can be applied
    to examine calibration and/or validation data time series for single or all the
    available gauge stations. Additionally, the plot_monthly() and plot_fractions()
    functions are designed for examining monthly aggregates and changes between ratios
    of different constituents. The plot_map() function is used to display the time
    series variables and station locations on interactive maps for assessing data
    availability, quality and variability in space. Two basic functions are included
    in the package to aid with identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies
    in the time series data. The clean_wq() function can fix most common issues related
    to water quality observation data, such as addressing comma-dot misuse, converting
    units by applying molecular weight conversion factors (e.g., converting to active
    substance weight as NH4 to N-NH4), handling negative values, removing missing
    values, and updating zero-concentrations to minimum positive values (or defined
    part of it), etc. Another function, clean_outliers(), allows the user to identify
    and remove data outliers in the time series. Outliers are identified as values
    outside the defined range (as mean ± n * standard deviation) of values. Point
    source data Point sources are generally considered to represent municipal or industrial
    wastewater treatment plants’ discharge of treated sewage into the stream network.
    Discharge locations as well as the volume of effluents and the chemical characteristics
    of discharged water are typically needed to accurately represent the anthropogenic
    point source influence in a water quality model. The load_template() function
    in the SWATprepR package is used to load the data from an Excel template. An example
    template is included as a pnt_data.xlsx file. Once loaded into the R environment,
    the data can be examined for spatial and temporal consistency (using functions
    of ggplot2 or similar packages). The prepare_ps() function can be used to transfer
    the point source data into SWAT + model input file format. This function only
    requires a loaded point source object and a path to the model setup text files.
    SWATprepR demonstration case The developed SWATprepR tool was applied in a test
    case study of the Upper Zgłowiączka catchment. This catchment spans an area of
    150 km2 and is situated in central Poland. According to observation data for 2021,
    approximately 89% of this catchment is covered by arable land, while pastures
    account for 2%, forests for 5.5%, and urban and water areas for 3.5%. About 59%
    of the catchment''s territory is equipped with tile drains. The case study site
    featured two point sources, 14 meteorological stations situated both within and
    around the catchment, as well as 21 water quality and flow measurement stations.
    This specific case study site was selected as one of the 14 sites within the OPTAIN
    project [47]. Within the scope of the project, a fine scale SWAT + model is set
    up and used to facilitate the evaluation of environmental effectiveness of Natural/Small
    Water Retention Measures (NSWRMs). The detailed setup of the SWAT + model necessitated
    the collection of various types of data, aimed at providing comprehensive environmental
    insights into the local conditions. Figure 4 illustrates a subset of the geospatial
    data that were gathered for the selected catchment. The process of collecting
    this detailed data and preparing the models input data posed several challenges,
    all of which were successfully addressed through the utilization of functions
    within the SWATprepR package. Below, we provide several illustrative examples.

    meteorological stations, point source locations, reaches and catchment boundary;

    classes defined as in land cover/plant growth database [48] Full size image Scarce
    weather data Only one meteorological station was located inside the catchment.
    Yet it had data only for around 8 years, which was not enough for the foreseen
    modeling purposes. Additional meteorological data were collected from 13 stations
    in the vicinity of the catchment (within 40 km radius). All the collected meteorological
    data have been loaded with the SWATprepR load_template() function. Following that,
    the interpolate() function was applied to create a series of virtual weather stations
    within the catchment and the interpolation process was conducted for each day
    throughout the time series. This approach is a fast way to prepare a consistent
    spatially distributed meteorological data set for the catchment. Additionally,
    the actual meteorological stations had multiple gaps in the observation time series,
    which could be addressed with the interpolation procedure. Figure 5 provides an
    average percentage of available time series data within the catchment for all
    required variables for each meteorological station within the period of 1998–2022.
    By using the SWATprepR package, we generated a 2-km spaced grid that resulted
    in 38 virtual stations, which had a 100% data coverage for the selected time period
    and were located in the catchment. Fig. 5 Meteorological stations selected for
    data collection with the evaluation of data coverage in percentage for each variable

    necessary for the SWAT + model at a detailed level can pose challenges. For the
    Upper Zgłowiączka catchment soil type map with values of sand, silt, clay, and
    soil organic carbon content were available for each soil type with characteristic
    soil layering. The availability of basic soil information allowed the parameterization
    of required SWAT + soil parameters by the get_usersoil_table() function. This
    function utilizes sand, silt, clay, and carbon content to parameterize moist bulk
    density, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, moist soil
    albedo, and the Universal Soil Loss Equation soil erodibility factor. Figures
    6 and 7 show the derived soil parameters of the function for the studied catchment.
    Additionally, hydrologic soil groups could be computed based on the data available
    on tile drainage, groundwater depth, and depth to water-impermeable layer. Detailed
    description of pedotransfer functions and methodologies applied to the calculation
    of parameters is presented in the SWAT + modeling protocol pages 81–92 [28]. Fig.

    deposition data were available for the Upper Zgłowiączka catchment. SWATprepR
    the get_atmo_dep() function was used to retrieve atmospheric deposition data for
    the catchment and another package’s function the add_atmo_dep() was used for incorporating
    downloaded data into the SWAT + model setup. Figure 8 illustrates an example of
    atmospheric deposition data extracted and plotted for the case study area, where
    previously no data was available. Fig. 8 Atmospheric deposition data for the Upper

    case of the Upper Zgłowiączka catchment, crop data were accessible only for a
    single year—2021. This proved insufficient for generating the required crop rotation
    sequences for the foreseen modeling task. To address this issue, a Google Earth
    Engine-based script [45] was applied to identify crops for field parcels for previous
    years using Sentinel 1A and 1B satellite radar images. For the training of the
    crop classification model, local crop data were used. The crop maps were generated
    with a tool developed and validated as a part of the OPTAIN project [46]. Next,
    the SWATprepR extract_rotation() function was applied and field-based annual crop
    sequences were extracted. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 9. The catchment
    is predominantly characterized by winter wheat cultivation, accounting for approximately
    20% of all rotations, while winter wheat with corn represents another 13%, and
    winter wheat with sugar beets accounts for 7%. Additionally, corn-to-corn rotations
    make up 6%, winter wheat to barley—5.5%. These outputs were then utilized in conjunction
    with the SWATfarmR tool [26] to develop crop management schedules tailored to
    the specifics of the SWAT + model. Fig. 9 Generated crop maps for each year and
    each field in the catchment. Training data are based on farmers’ declarations

    Limitations There are several limitations of the SWATprepR package that users
    should be aware of. It is challenging to list all potential limitations due to
    the diverse application cases users might have in mind. Nonetheless, we would
    like to highlight some examples to provide users with a better understanding of
    the current shortcomings in the SWATprepR version. The current version (as of
    January 2024) of interpolate() function only incorporates the IDW interpolation
    technique for weather data. Its effectiveness depends on factors such as location,
    topography, variable, and data gap length. The IDW method is widely used in meteorology
    because it is fast and easy to implement. However, ancillary data, such as elevation,
    cannot be incorporated and the method tends to generate “bull’s eye patterns”
    [49]. Moreover, as there is no extrapolation, all interpolated values are within
    the range of the data points [50]. Customization for alternative (e.g., probabilistic)
    methods, such as kriging [49], may be necessary, as IDW interpolation might not
    be suitable in certain conditions. The atmospheric deposition function get_atmo_dep()prepares
    inputs for the EMEP data domain for Europe, parts of northern Africa, and western
    Asia. It is not applicable to regions outside of this domain. The generated data
    are based on outputs of the MSC-W model [51] and thus afflicted with uncertainties.
    Additionally, EMEP updates its calculations yearly, providing information under
    new server links with slightly different coding, making it impossible to obtain
    the latest data without adjusting the function. Therefore, the get_atmo_dep()
    function is tailored to the last available version of EMEP data at the time of
    article preparation. Users should be aware of this if they intend to use the latest
    EMEP data, and tailor the functionality according to their needs. Users should
    also mind that the current version of the get_atmo_dep() function generates basin-averaged
    single time series without distinguishing between regions or stations, which may
    be an important shortcoming for large-scale model applications. The organic carbon
    content for each soil layer, required for the get_usersoil_table() function, can
    be challenging to obtain in many regions. Information needed for preparing soil
    hydrologic groups, such as impervious layer depth, depth to the high water table,
    or drainage status of soils, could be even more challenging to collect. Proxy
    data may be used, introducing potential inaccuracies and uncertainties. Based
    on soil texture and organic carbon content, the get_usersoil_table() function
    predicts hydrologically effective soil parameters, such as available water capacity
    and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The root mean squared error of the built-in
    pedotransfer functions were 0.048 cm3 cm−3 for available water capacity and 1.48
    cm day−1 for logarithmic ten transformed saturated hydraulic conductivity [52]
    on the test sets of the European Hydropedological Data Inventory point dataset
    [53]. This dataset includes temperate soils, the uncertainty of the pedotransfer
    functions in other regions is therefore unknown. Functions related to crop rotations
    are linked to application of the GEE-based remote sensing script [45] and SWATfarmR
    [26], potentially limiting utility for users with other types of land use maps,
    who will not make use of the SWATfarmR functionality. In case the GEE-based crop
    classification is utilized, users should be aware of possible classification errors,
    which can be reduced by incorporating a sufficient amount of local training data.
    Other technical limitations include interactive functions connected to plotting
    observation data, reliant on the R plotly package [51], which may encounter issues
    displaying data of large datasets. The current SWATprepR version''s point source
    data preparation function, prepare_ps(), does not load data with multi-annual
    averages, potentially posing challenges when constant point source loads are required
    in the model. The functions for data cleaning, clean_wq() or clear_outliers(),
    only include the most elementary techniques, without providing options for more
    advanced data cleaning methods, especially with regard to outlier detection [54,
    55]. These examples do not cover all limitations of the SWATprepR package, as
    there are many possible use cases. Yet, they provide users with an understanding
    of potential methodological, data-related, or technical constraints they might
    encounter. Conclusions and future work The SWATprepR package offers valuable tools
    and incorporates effective techniques to assist SWAT + modelers in preparing their
    models. One of the primary challenges in creating a comprehensive model setup
    lies in the sheer volume of high-resolution spatial and temporal data required
    to feed into the model. With numerous variables, parameters and processes to adjust,
    modelers often find themselves overwhelmed, especially when data availability
    is not straightforward. Another challenge is the number of different file formats
    (spreadsheets, text files, relational databases, NetCDF, etc.), which all require
    different tools or approaches to manipulate. Errors or biases in the input data
    may make the entire available datasets untrustworthy or unusable. Consequently,
    modelers may accidently introduce errors into their setup or choose to omit critical
    information, significantly diminishing model reliability. Unfortunately, such
    shortcomings are often masked through subsequent parameterization of processes
    in calibration, leading to unreliable simulations that can have far-reaching implications
    for decision-making by end-users of the model. The use of scripted workflows like
    SWATprepR offers significant advantages. One of them is quick and easy error correction.
    When errors or inaccuracies are identified in the setup of SWAT models, scripted
    workflows make it straightforward to implement corrections. Instead of manually
    retracing and repeating steps, modelers can easily modify and rerun the scripts
    to ensure that the model setup aligns with the desired specifications. This saves
    time and reduces the likelihood of human errors during the correction process.
    Another advantage is easy adaptation to new, updated datasets. As new or updated
    datasets become available or as the project requirements change, scripted workflows
    prove invaluable. Modelers can efficiently integrate new data sources into the
    existing model setup by updating scripts. Furthermore, scripted workflows could
    also facilitate collaboration among modelers. When workflows are documented and
    shared, other researchers or modelers can readily understand the processes and
    parameters used in the SWAT modeling. This ease of comprehension allows for efficient
    collaboration, peer review, and the potential for others to build upon or extend
    the existing models. In addition, scripted workflows can be managed with version
    control systems like Git, ensuring a history of changes, easy tracking of modifications,
    and the ability to revert to previous states, if needed. This enhances the reproducibility
    and traceability of the modeling process. As well as automation through scripting
    ensures a high level of consistency across different runs of the SWAT model. This
    consistency is essential for producing reliable and comparable results in scientific
    research or environmental assessments. The model setup insights and parameter
    estimation methods discussed in this paper should prove invaluable to any modeler
    embarking on a journey to establish a dependable case study analysis using SWAT +.
    The SWATprepR package is open-source and will continue to undergo active development
    and enhancement in the foreseeable future, reducing its current limitations mentioned
    in the previous section. We extend an invitation to the modeling community to
    contribute to the evolution of these tools, adapt our proposed methods to strengthen
    their own models, perform rigorous quality checks, and ultimately, contribute
    to a more transparent and informed decision-making process through the utilization
    of the SWAT + model. Availability of data and materials The SWATprepR package,
    its documentation, and test data are freely available on https://github.com/biopsichas/SWATprepR.

    Accurately representing spatial and temporal variability of lake surface water
    temperatures in numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems has been shown (particularly
    for Earth’s largest lakes) to improve short- and long-term forecasts of regional
    precipitation, air temperature, and surface wind velocity1,2,3,4. Thus, realistic
    representation of lake conditions is crucial for the development of the next generation
    of climate and weather forecast models5,6. The database we introduce here was
    developed to support this advancement by providing in situ validation data for
    a broader project sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) through its Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI). The parallel NOAA
    JTTI project is designed to optimize representation of lake surfaces in the NOAA
    Unified Forecast System (UFS) by exploring the sensitivity of UFS lake models
    to alternative lake bathymetric data sets7. Specifically, the NOAA JTTI project
    evaluates potential impacts of a new global lakes bathymetric dataset (GLOBathy)
    on simulations of lake surface temperature, and temperature depth profiles, in
    UFS 1-D lake models8. It is informative to note that these models are currently
    operationalized within NOAA’s High-Resolution Rapid Refresh model, or HRRR9, which
    simulates lake physics using a 1-D lake model included in the Community Land Model
    v4.510 with a 3-km horizontal resolution, and 10 vertical (depth) layers. Following
    an iterative in situ monitoring platform selection protocol (details below) we
    obtained near-surface and subsurface lake temperature data from 134 sites across
    29 lakes which (through the parallel NOAA study referenced above) can be used
    to validate HRRR lake model simulations. We solicited and stored temperature data
    at the highest temporal resolution available, which varies from site to site;
    at some sites, data is available at sub-hourly resolution and, at others, at relatively
    coarse (e.g. semi-annual or monthly) resolution. Of the 134 sites in our database,
    84 include temperature measurements across multiple depths, allowing for comprehensive
    validation of HRRR 1-D lake column model simulations. While the lakes presented
    here represent a subset of all lakes in the HRRR model, we believe that, because
    they are among the model domain’s largest lakes (by surface area; see methods
    below), they might be expected to have the most profound impacts on surrounding
    terrestrial weather and climate dynamics. We note that the Laurentian Great Lakes
    are not included in the NOAA UFS study because they are represented through a
    separate 3-D modeling framework11,12 operated through NOAA’s National Ocean Service
    (NOS). In situ data for validating Laurentian Great Lakes 3-D models is collected
    and utilized separately and specifically for the NOS modeling initiative, and
    is therefore not addressed here. Ultimately, the goal of our database is to provide
    an organized, easily-accessible aggregation of in situ lake temperature profile
    data that can be used not only to support validation for the NOAA UFS 1-D lake
    model experiments, but to serve as a resource for related lake model validation
    and empirical data analysis studies as well (see Figs. 1 and 2). Fig. 1 Map of
    the coterminous United States indicating the location of all 29 lakes in our study
    (blue polygons; magnified slightly to improve clarity). For 9 representative lakes,
    we also include an overlay of in situ monitoring sites (each represented by a
    blue ‘x’), lake boundaries, and the corresponding 3 km × 3 km HRRR lake model
    pixels (yellow grids). The 9 representative lakes are, from top left advancing
    clockwise, Lake Washington, Flathead Lake, Devils Lake, Red Lake, Oneida Lake,
    Lake Okeechobee, Lake Tawakoni, Lake Mead, and Mono Lake. See Fig. 5 for corresponding
    details for all 29 lakes in our study. Full size image Fig. 2 Representative example
    (from Oneida Lake, NY) of the relationship between in situ station locations (top
    subfigure; each represented by a blue ‘x’ and labeled with its site code), HRRR
    pixels (yellow squares), and corresponding temperature data for each station in
    2019. Full size image Methods We collected lake temperature data from a variety
    of sources, each requiring a different approach, ranging from scraping online
    federal agency repositories to collaborating with and soliciting data from local
    water quality monitoring organizations. Federal agency repositories from which
    we collected data include the NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)13, the United
    States Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS)14, and
    the Water Quality Portal (WQP) - a cooperative service maintained and sponsored
    by USGS and the United States Environmental Protection Agency15. The temperature
    data we collected from local organizations is unlikely to be included in the aforementioned
    federal repositories. It is informative to note that any data we have collected
    for a given lake in our study may be aggregated across one or more of these sources
    (for a summary, see Table 1). It is also informative to note that data quality,
    spatiotemporal resolution, and temporal continuity can vary greatly from source
    to source (see Fig. 3); some sources provide quality-controlled data throughout
    a lake’s depth profile at high temporal resolution, while others provide relatively
    sparse temperature data collected by local ad hoc or citizen-based groups with
    little documentation on quality control methods. Feedback from database users
    has highlighted that direct examination of the data significantly aids in understanding
    its characteristics, especially for individual lakes or sites. Accordingly, we’ve
    included a script within the database repository to facilitate the creation of
    data plots for each site. Table 1 Metadata associated with each lake included
    in the database. Full size table Fig. 3 Representative time series (showing only
    2018 through 2022 for clarity) of temperature data from five surface (or near-surface)
    sensors in our database. This time series underscores differences in temporal
    resolution and continuity across different sensors and lakes; a more comprehensive
    summary of temporal and spatial (i.e. depth) resolution and continuity is included
    in Table 2, and the database repository includes a script to visualize the data
    of each individual sensor. Year labels on x-axis are positioned at the beginning
    of a calendar year. Full size image One of the most important design features
    of the parallel NOAA lake model simulation study made possible by our database
    was a focus on evaluating historical lake temperature simulations in 29 of the
    largest (by surface area) lakes across the continental United States (CONUS).
    A second important design feature of the NOAA lake model study was a focus on
    assessing lake model simulation results from just one calendar year (following
    a model spin-up period) given the relatively high computational expense of running
    the HRRR model at CONUS scale. Therefore, the collective criteria for including
    a monitoring platform in our database is that it comes from one of the largest
    lakes across CONUS for which there is at least one in situ temperature observation
    within a recent calendar year. The selection of a common recent calendar year,
    in turn, is intended to maximize the total number of temperature data points across
    the selected lakes and monitoring platforms. The results of our manual and iterative
    selection process identified 2019 as the calendar year that maximizes the total
    number of in situ observations across the largest CONUS lakes. Based on our analysis
    of federal databases and conversations with individual (i.e. local) database managers,
    it is our understanding that 2019 was (for the purposes of our study) an “optimal”
    year for aggregating lake temperature data because many in situ monitoring platforms
    were discontinued in 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. As a result of this selection
    criteria, our database includes data from monitoring platforms for which there
    was at least one measurement (and, typically, many more measurements) in 2019.
    However, in order to support any future related empirical and model validation
    studies we also included any and all data available over a historical period from
    January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2022, although data availability may vary
    greatly for years other than 2019 (see Table 2). Table 2 Select summary statistics
    categorized by data source and then by each lake for which the source has provided
    data. Full size table We used the R Statistical Software (v4.2.116) to extract
    and store variables from each monitoring platform including sample collection
    date and time (UTC), coordinate location, depth (m), and water temperature (C).
    Details on our final data formatting are included in the Data Records section.
    Details on how we extracted data from each source are included in the subsections
    below, with related metadata summarized in Tables 1, 2. National Data Buoy Center
    (NDBC) The NDBC is located within NOAA’s National Weather Service, and is responsible
    for collecting, managing, and distributing meteorological and oceanographic data
    from a network of buoys and coastal stations located in oceans, coastal waters,
    and large lakes (including the Great Lakes, which are not included in this database).
    All data is quality controlled and publicly available here: (https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).
    National Water Information System (NWIS) The USGS NWIS is a comprehensive database
    containing a wide range of water-related data including streamflow, groundwater
    levels, and water quality data including lake temperatures. Lakes that met our
    study’s criteria were found manually using the online NWIS mapper (https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/),
    and their data was accessed using the dataRetrieval17 package in R by specifying
    site identification numbers, desired date ranges, and the parameter code for water
    temperature. Note that the WQP (described in detail below) includes data from
    the NWIS, but at a much lower temporal resolution. Water Quality Portal (WQP)
    The WQP is a centralized repository maintained by the United States EPA and the
    USGS, integrating data from multiple agencies and organizations18. Data from sites
    in the NWIS are included in the WQP, but typically at a lower resolution. Thus
    data was extracted directly from the NWIS wherever there was overlap with the
    WQP, and the WQP was instead used to extract data aggregated from other sources.
    WQP data can also be accessed in R via the dataRetrieval package, similar to procedures
    used with the NWIS. Due to the immense amount of data provided by the WQP, users
    can search for sites that meet certain criteria before requesting a specific site’s
    data. We used this functionality to search for all sites of type “Lake”, “Reservoir”,
    or “Impoundment” containing any water temperature data in the year 2019. Once
    we had a large list of sites meeting this criteria, we used ArcGIS to filter out
    any sites not located on a lake over 30 km2. This left us with a much shorter
    list of site names which we could then use to query the data of each site individually.
    The format for reporting depths of observations varies across different sites
    within the WQP. Some sites were not given a depth value and were instead reported
    as “near-surface”; we recorded these as a depth of 0.1 m. Other sites report depth
    values to a very high precision (<0.1 m). We rounded these depth values to the
    nearest 1 m for sites containing temperature values throughout a profile of 5 m
    or deeper, and to the nearest 0.5 m for sites with a shallower profile of less
    than 5 m. In either case, values of 0 m were then shifted to 0.1 m as the sensors
    included in the WQP only record bulk temperature. Other sources In addition to
    the well-known and established described in the sections above, we gathered data
    from a multitude of other websites and local sources, including the following:
    Flathead Lake - from the Flathead Lake Bio Station (FLBS) site (https://flbs.umt.edu/apps/weather/)
    which includes surface water temperatures at four sites. All sites have downloadable
    data dating back to 2011, and we omitted periods of data reporting extremely egregious
    lake temperature values ( < −50 C). Lake McConaughy - provided directly by Nate
    Nielsen of the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District (CNPPID).
    While data at Lake McConaughy is available in the WQP, we were able to obtain
    higher spatial and temporal resolution data from the files shared with us directly
    by the CNPPID. Lake Mendota - provided online by the Space Science & Engineering
    Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (https://metobs.ssec.wisc.edu/data_download/).
    We extracted the data at an hourly resolution, though other resolutions are available
    for download as well. Mono Lake - provided directly by Dr. Robert Jellison of
    the University of California (UC) Santa Barbara and the Mono Lake Committee (https://www.monolake.org/).
    Oneida Lake - provided by Dr. Lars Rudstam at the Cornell University Biological
    Field Station19. While Oneida Lake temperature data is also available through
    the Knowledge Network for Biodiversity (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), the
    high resolution temperature profile data provided by Dr. Rudstam is not available
    online. Pyramid Lake - provided by Jennessy Toribio, a fisheries biologist at
    Pyramid Lake Fisheries (PLF). PLF data is sampled monthly, and while there is
    no exact time specified in the raw data, the PLF stated that readings are typically
    taken in the late morning. We therefore assigned a timestamp to each recording
    of 10am local time. Sebago Lake - publicly available through the Portland Water
    District (https://www.pwd.org/sebago-lake-monitoring-buoy). Lake Tahoe - provided
    from two contacts; Dr. Gerardo Rivera at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) provided data from three sites at an extremely
    high temporal resolution, but only for shallow profiles in September 2019. Dr.
    Shohei Watanabe of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center (TERC) provided
    monthly temperature profiles dating back to 2010 throughout the entire depth profile
    of Lake Tahoe, but only at a single site. The original TERC data includes temperature
    measurements at every meter to a depth of 480 m. Our final database includes these
    temperature measurements at meter intervals to a depth of 50 m, and at 10-meter
    intervals from 50 m to 480 m (the original higher resolution data is available
    in the Raw_data section of our database). Lake Washington - provided online by
    King County, WA (https://green2.kingcounty.gov/lake-buoy/Data.aspx). All values
    from March 2009 were omitted due to noticably incongruous data. Lake Winnipesaukee
    - provided online by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (https://www4.des.state.nh.us/rivertraksearch/search.html).
    Data Records Our database is deposited in “Deep Blue Data”, the University of
    Michigan’s institutional data repository20. It can be accessed here: https://doi.org/10.7302/7gnd-mj10.
    The database contains sub-directories for each lake. Within the sub-directory
    for each lake is the R script used to extract all data for that lake, a metadata
    table with the latitude/longitude location and depth of each temperature sensor,
    and a directory containing the temperature data for each sensor in csv format
    with two columns for the date/time (in UTC) and the temperature (C). Each sensor’s
    data filename is formatted as ABCXX_YY.csv where ABC is a three letter code for
    the lake, XX is a unique numerical identifier for the latitude/longitude location
    of the site, and YY is a numerical identifier for the depth of that sensor. A
    more detailed explanation of the directory structure is included in a README file
    within the database. Technical Validation The data we collected from federal agency
    repositories (e.g. NDBC, NWIS, and WQP) and some local sources were subjected
    to repository-specific quality control methods, each of which is described in
    detail in the respective repository’s literature and (if available) web-site.
    Regardless, we visually inspected all data at all depths and removed data points
    or time periods periods with egregiously erroneous values for a very small number
    of sites (as described in the Methods section). Additionally, to ensure overall
    data reliability, we validated our in situ temperatures against remote sensed
    surface temperature data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS), which has a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km21. We used MODIS
    Terra and Aqua land surface temperature products, which collectively provide up
    to four surface water temperature observations per day, per 1-km grid cell, to
    validate our in situ observations. We recognize there are challenges to comparing
    gridded remote sensing temperature data to in situ data, especially along lake
    shorelines where there is a potential for land contamination22. To address this
    challenge, we filtered (i.e. removed, prior to validation) in situ sites within
    a 1-km buffer of any lake shoreline, leaving 79 of our total 134 in situ sites
    for validation. Then, because the original intent of our database was to validate
    (in the parallel NOAA study) HRRR lake models for only the calendar year 2019,
    we interrogated surface temperature data for MODIS pixels corresponding to each
    selected in situ site location in calendar year 2019 via NASA’s AppEEARS data
    portal (https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/). Specifically, the products
    obtained via AppEEARS were MOD21A1D.06123, MOD21A1N.06124, MYD21A1D.06125, and
    MYD21A1N.06126. It is informative to note that the MODIS data obtained through
    AppEEARS has quality thresholds of 0 (poor), 1 (marginal), 2 (good), or 3 (excellent)
    for each sensor reading, with each quality threshold corresponding to an error
    of >2.0 K, 1.5–2.0 K, 1.0–1.5 K, or <1.0 K, respectively. We only used MODIS data
    with a quality threshold of 2 or higher (i.e. reported error of <1.5 K) for our
    validation. A visual comparison between our in situ data and data from each corresponding
    MODIS pixel (see Fig. 4 for a representative time series from four sites) suggests
    that the in situ temperatures are generally consistent with MODIS, with minimal
    pronounced visible bias. To supplement this visual comparison, we calculated the
    bias (relative to MODIS) of each in situ data point, along with the root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) of each site and the RMSE across all sites. Specifically, for each
    MODIS data point, we identified the closest in situ value that was collected within
    3 hours of the MODIS observation. If there was no in situ data collected within
    3 hours of the MODIS observation, then that MODIS observation was not used for
    validation. This approach resulted in 1,808 pairs of in situ and MODIS temperatures.
    The RMSE and bias across all validation data pairs was 2.780 K and 0.023 K, respectively
    (with MODIS being slightly warmer on average), and a more detailed assessment
    of RMSE and bias for each monitoring platform (Table 3) indicates that bias is
    generally low, especially at sites for which there is a high number of observations.

    data from in situ platforms and (respectively) the nearest MODIS pixel at four
    representative sites across calendar year 2019. Measurement depths for in situ
    platforms are specified in the legend. Full size image Fig. 5 For each lake in

    The European Water Framework Directive foresees the establishment of emission
    inventories for micropollutants (MP) to facilitate an evidence-based development
    of mitigation measures. Regionalized pathway analysis constitutes a moderately
    data-intensive approach to quantify the contribution of different pathways to
    the total pollution of surface waters. So far, only few European member states
    have created an inventory that includes diffuse pathways. The fundamental basis
    to enable it is an accessible, well-structured and harmonized database with data
    on the concentration of MPs in multiple compartments, such as soils, groundwater,
    atmospheric deposition and urban systems. Combined with the water and suspended
    substance balance in river basins, such data enables the estimation of emission
    loads via specific pathways. In the Danube River Basin, but in general in Europe,
    a public data management platform with such scope and criteria is still lacking.
    Results We collected and harmonized MP measurements across multiple compartments
    and countries together with key metadata, harmonized and combined them into a
    new database. The resulting tool, available for download, facilitates the assessment
    of current data availability, in terms of quantity and quality. For example, while
    the majority of available data stems from groundwater and surface water, other

    to regions not covered by specific monitoring programmes. For example, PFAS concentrations
    in treated wastewater show significant dependence on the design capacity of the
    treatment plant. Conclusions This study showcases how such database can support
    the setup of emission inventories, guide data providers and national authorities
    in prioritizing the allocation of resources for new surveys and in optimizing
    their national data collection and management systems. The process tested showed
    a great need for enhanced data literacy across countries and institutions to increase
    data availability and quality to secure the exploitation of the full information
    potential generated via monitoring programmes. Background The European Water Framework
    Directive [1] and its daughter directives define a policy regime to improve the
    quality of surface waters and is considered one of the world’s most advanced approaches
    in this area. Regarding micropollutants (MP), besides requirements for monitoring
    in surface water bodies as basis for the chemical status assessment, member states
    are required to set up inventories of emissions, discharges and losses of priority
    and priority hazardous substances to facilitate the evidence-based development
    of emission mitigation measures. The guidance document No. 28 [25] presents a
    tiered methodological approach that should be followed to establish such inventories,
    depending on data availability and substance-criticality. The riverine load approach
    (tier 2) relies on hydrological and chemical measurements in the rivers to estimate
    the mass of contaminants transported per unit of time. When combined with the
    inventory of point source emissions (tier 1) and considering in-river processes
    such as degradation or transformation, it allows estimation of the proportion
    of diffuse emissions. These are, however, treated as a black box. To provide an
    accurate inventory of point and specific diffuse emissions, the next level (tier
    3) is necessary. This involves using a pathway-oriented approach or regionalized
    pathway analysis (RPA). Its application requires riverine loads from tier 1 to
    validate the estimated emissions, but also more information on land use, hydrology
    and main processes in the river catchments. In particular, data on occurrence
    and concentration levels of contaminants in multiple compartments, such as soils,
    groundwater, atmospheric deposition and urban systems are essential. In order
    to obtain a comprehensive depiction of the life cycle of contaminants, the source-oriented
    approach (tier 4) is designed to estimate emissions factors for different human
    activities, starting from substance-specific data on production, sales and consumption.
    As the tier increases, so does our understanding of sources and pathways, as well
    as our capability to identify the most appropriate measures. However, higher tiers
    are also associated with a larger amount and higher complexity of data needs.
    The second cycle of river basin management plan development in 2015 revealed that
    only a limited number of EU member states were able to report data and estimations
    of diffuse emissions and only for a limited range of substances [64]. This is
    also the case for the Danube River Basin (DRB), which is one of the most international
    river basins in the world [63]. Only a handful of countries in the DRB have explicitly
    included diffuse emissions according to tier 3 in their inventories, while all
    others have only created an inventory of point sources. As of the update of the
    DRB management plan in 2021, no transnational emission inventory was available
    [39]. The first fundamental step to enable the generation and regular update of
    an accurate emissions inventory is to have an accessible, well-structured and
    harmonized data basis that contains information on the concentration of MPs in
    various environmental and technical compartments. This information, when combined
    with the water and suspended solids balance of the basin, allows for the estimation
    of emission loads through specific pathways. Due to the impossibility of monitoring
    the whole territory, it is essential to have thorough documentation and accessible
    metadata associated with surveys in different compartments. This will enable the
    identification of statistically significant patterns and correlations, allowing
    for the extrapolation and interpolation of data for unmonitored locations and
    regions. Multiple international initiatives have been launched recently to collect
    data on MPs at European and DRB scale: The NORMAN network maintains the “EMPODAT”
    database [62] to support the identification and prioritization of pollutants of
    emerging concern. It focuses on new substances that are known, but not yet well
    investigated [22]. In line with this purpose, the database contains several metadata
    on the analytical methods and analytical quality assessment. Metadata on the sampled
    environmental compartment are included to a lesser extent. The data cover many
    substances with measurements at different levels of quantitative precision, ranging
    from uncalibrated screening methods to fully quantitative target analysis with
    application of quality control procedures. In line with its purpose, the database
    does not collect monitoring data for well-known substances such as heavy metals
    or from national administrations. The absence of measurements for well-known parameters,
    missing metadata about the sampling sites and facilities, and semi-quantitative
    measurements in the database impede its use as a basis for emission modelling.
    Nevertheless, the metadata regarding analytical methods can serve as a best-practice
    example. The EU joint research centre (JRC) maintains the “JRC FATE Monitoring
    Database on Occurrence and Levels of Chemical Contaminants” [35], probably containing
    reported data from the EU member states. Unfortunately, this database is not public.
    Many EU and non-EU countries report environmental data to the European Environmental
    Agency (EEA) within the EIONET network. The EEA then publishes this data, such
    as the concentration data for surface and groundwater bodies found in the “Waterbase—Water
    Quality ICM” dataset [30]. This dataset provides only limited metadata on analysis
    methods and sampling site properties and, as it covers only ground and surface
    water, it cannot be used as a basis for an inventory of multiple emission pathways.
    Comparable datasets for other compartments, e.g. soil or atmospheric deposition
    covering more than a few substances, are not yet available from the EEA. The European
    Industrial Emissions Portal [29] publishes the emissions to water reported under
    the Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) directive 2 by the EU member
    states and some non-member states, such as Serbia. The reporting of emissions
    is restricted to industries belonging to the 65 economic activities listed in
    Annex I of the directive and exceeding at least one of the PRTR capacity thresholds
    (regarding production or processing volumes). Additionally, only data on emissions
    of pollutants that exceed thresholds specified in Annex II must be released. If
    industries meet these preconditions, they must report emissions to water for 71
    pollutants, but only where they exceed the given threshold. The reported emissions
    in mass per year can be based on measurements, calculations or estimations. Due
    to the rather high pollutant-specific thresholds, only major polluters are required
    to report their emissions. Further, the reported emissions are subject to large
    uncertainties depending on the method applied for quantification. For MPs, values
    below the analytical limit of quantification are often regarded as 0, resulting
    in a best-case evaluation of emission loads. To extrapolate the reported loads
    to other emitters who are not required to report their emissions for the aforementioned
    reasons, or to estimate emissions for substances not included in the PRTR, one
    would need the water volumes and concentration data used to calculate the loads.
    Even if the water volumes are known—which is mostly not the case, as they do not
    need to be reported—the aforementioned reasons make the extrapolation highly uncertain.
    The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) operates
    the “Danube River Basin Water Quality Database” [40], which includes data from
    the “TransNational Monitoring Network” (TNMN) and the “Joint Danube Surveys” (JDS).
    The TNMN contains analyses of water samples from selected stations along the Danube
    for a limited number of MP. To complement this substance-wise rather limited monitoring,
    the JDS collects samples along the Danube once every 6 years and analyses them
    for a very wide range of pollutants. The content of this database focuses on contamination
    in the Danube River itself. The datasets only include a few major tributaries
    of the Danube, and do not cover other environmental compartments that contribute
    to river pollution, such as atmospheric deposition, stormwater or soil. Although
    two other compartments (wastewater and groundwater) were sampled during JDS4,
    their data are not yet included in the database system. To use this database as
    basis for basin-wide emission modelling, a massive extension of the scope would
    be required. This includes expanding the substance list, temporal and spatial
    coverage, and the covered environmental compartments. Finally, the French newspaper
    “Le Monde” has compiled an extensive dataset on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
    (PFAS) pollution in Europe, which also includes data from various environmental
    compartments [20]. However, the amount of metadata included is different as is
    the purpose of this web application. A database which shows comparable efforts
    outside of Europe is the one established by the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (US-EPA). This database compiles pre-existing data to support exposure
    assessment and has a wider focus regarding the environmental compartments covered
    [41]. The data can be traced back to the original source files. However, the database
    in its published state is not a suitable basis to set up emission inventories
    due to the limited metadata regarding the sampled environmental compartments.
    This brief overview clearly shows that these important and valuable initiatives
    were launched with a wide range of objectives, none of which included the creation
    of an accurate inventory of point and diffuse emissions. Therefore, they were
    not designed to meet the data and metadata requirements of such endeavour. A public
    database or data management platform with this scope and criteria is still absent
    in the DRB and Europe as a whole. To address this critical gap, the Danube Hazard
    m3c project [23] undertook a major effort to collect and harmonize data and metadata
    on MP measurements across multiple compartments and Danube countries. This was
    done to create a new database with the goal of providing the optimal information
    basis for compiling a transnational emission inventory according to the pathway-oriented
    approach. In doing so, we addressed several research questions. Firstly, we investigated
    the current availability of data in the different compartments and regions of
    the basin, considering both quantity and quality. The results of this analysis
    are important, as they provide modellers with a basis to assess the varying levels
    of uncertainty affecting the estimation of emission loads through different pathways.
    This, in turn, affects the uncertainty in predicting the effectiveness of measures
    implemented in different compartments. Additionally, the results provide data
    providers and national authorities with criteria to prioritize the allocation
    of resources in designing new surveys and optimizing their national data collection
    and management systems. Secondly, we examined the differences in the occurrence
    and concentration levels of specific substances across different compartments
    and countries. This screening helps us to better understand the relevance or dominance
    of specific emission pathways, allowing us to prioritize data-retrieval and calculation
    efforts in modelling applications. Moreover, one of the most important objectives
    was to explore the metadata to assess the potential for extrapolation of information
    for estimating regionalized emissions in areas of the basin that are not monitored
    by specific programmes. This paper presents and critically discusses the conceptual
    design of the database, the lessons learned during its implementation, the criteria
    used to select the collected data and metadata, and the new knowledge and added
    value that can be obtained through their analysis. It will be highly valuable
    not only for institutions dealing with water quality management in the DRB, but
    also for scientists or public authorities interested in launching a similar endeavour
    in other river basins worldwide. Material and methods Setup of the database The
    database is implemented as relational database in PostgreSQL [56], as this is
    a powerful and open source database management system. The data are organized
    into 31 main tables which contain the actual data, and 38 supporting tables that
    contain the allowed entries for columns in the main tables with controlled vocabularies.
    The use of controlled vocabularies is of utmost importance to harmonize the metadata
    for data from different data sources and make it evaluable as one. All tables
    include information about the data source, the date of data import, and the user
    responsible. The main tables containing concentration data include metadata on
    the analysed matrix (total, dissolved or solid phase), sample preparation and
    analytical methods along with their limit of quantitation (LOQ) and, where applicable,
    limit of detection (LOD), as well as references to national or ISO norms and the
    laboratory responsible for the analysis. Separate main tables include data for
    the different environmental and technical compartments: Water bodies: concentrations
    from river and groundwater bodies along with suspended particulate matter (SPM)
    from rivers. The metadata for river samples includes the sampling method and the
    discharge situation at the time of sampling compared to the long-term mean discharge.
    Similarly, for groundwater samples, the metadata includes the sampling depth and
    the water level at the time of sampling, compared to the long-term water level.
    For river monitoring sites, besides the exact location (coordinates with coordinate
    reference system and country), information on the catchment size and correlated
    other monitoring sites (e.g. river gauges for load calculation) are included.
    For groundwater monitoring sites, the land use/cover surrounding the well can
    be given. Finally, the reference to the water body (river or groundwater body)
    completes the metadata. Wastewater: MP concentrations in raw and treated wastewater
    including data from industrial and municipal treatment plants and settlements
    without any treatment. Further, data on sewage sludge can be found in this table
    set, as they share many metadata with concentrations in wastewater. Metadata associated
    with the wastewater samples are the sampling method (grab or composite samples),
    the sampling point in the wastewater treatment process and the flow volume at
    the time of sampling. The reference to the treatment plant was realized via a
    table for discharge points in accordance with the data structure of the EU Urban
    Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) reporting [27], which allows for one treatment
    plant to have several discharge points. The average discharge volume of the discharge
    points and the receiving water body are recorded and the discharge points are
    related to a treatment plant. The table on treatment plants further holds metadata
    regarding the catchment it is serving (industrial or municipal, number of inhabitants
    and share of combined sewer system), the design capacity (in population equivalent)
    and the implemented treatment steps and technologies. Stormwater runoff: Concentration
    of MP in stormwater runoff either in combined sewer overflows or in stormwater
    outlets in separate sewer systems are collected together as a basis to quantify
    emissions from sewer systems. The metadata associated with the stormwater runoff
    samples includes the exact sampling point (before or after treatment facilities
    like retention ponds or soil filters), the sampling method, and the runoff volume
    during sampling. For the sampling sites, besides the location information about
    the type of sewer system, the connected catchment (inhabitants, total area, share
    impervious, impervious and connected, industrial and traffic area), annual runoff
    volume, related precipitation gauge, mean annual precipitation and storage volume
    of the treatment facility. Atmospheric deposition: MP contamination in atmospheric
    deposition was mostly reported as concentration in bulk deposition samples. However,
    one study used a different sampling approach, and therefore, the raw data were
    imported as deposition rates. The metadata for deposition samples includes the
    collection period, sampling method, precipitation amount included in the sample
    (either by measuring the sample volume and relate it to the sampler inlet diameter
    or by recordings from a nearby rain gauge) compared to the annual precipitation
    sum, and the solid content in the sample. The sampling site metadata include the
    location, the long-term mean annual precipitation sums and information about related
    (nearby) precipitation gauges. Soil: MP concentrations in soil samples were available
    as single sample measurements as well as from analysis of composite samples combined
    from multiple sampling locations sharing some common properties. The metadata
    for soil samples includes information on the sampled soil layer (qualitatively
    as “humus cover” or “top soil” and the sampled depth section below the surface),
    sampling method, dry matter and organic carbon content of the sample, soil texture
    (qualitatively like”loamy sand” or by volume percent of each size fraction), and
    the soil horizon name (original value and master horizon according to [42]. The
    metadata for the sampling site, besides the location, contains information on
    the genetic soil type (original value and WRB reference soil group according to
    [42]) and the land use on the soil. All land use information was mapped using
    a controlled vocabulary taken from the CORINE land cover classification system
    [46]. The inventory was designed to include original monitoring data whenever
    possible, as well as data published in an aggregated form, such as in scientific
    publications and other technical reports. Therefore, for each environmental compartment
    different tables were adapted to include either single measurements or temporally
    or spatially aggregated values, such as statistically aggregated measurements
    from grab samples and measurements of time-integrated or space-integrated composite
    samples. Additional tables contain metadata on the MP (names, identifiers) and
    the data sources (data owner, applying license) and are referenced from every
    dataset in the main tables (concentrations). To ensure high data quality, several
    checks were built into the database as unique or check constraints to allow only
    the import of datasets with consistent metadata. This should be demonstrated with
    a few examples. Firstly, if a concentration measurement is marked as below LOD,
    a value greater than 0 and smaller than the LOQ value must be supplied for the
    LOD, and the measurement must also be marked as below LOQ. Secondly, sample or
    sampling site identifiers must be unique in the table to avoid having the same
    sample or site reported multiple times with different metadata. Finally, where
    the beginning and end of a sampling period must be supplied (e.g. for atmospheric
    deposition samples), the sampling end must be later than the beginning of sampling
    to avoid negative or 0 sampling durations. Data collection Data from all accessible
    sources in the DRB were collected, including surveys from national authorities,
    transnational monitoring programs (e.g. TNMN and JDS), as well as national and
    international research projects. The data collection focused on priority substances,
    priority hazardous substances, and other substances regulated under the EU directives
    3 and 4, together with DRB-specific pollutants [61] and substances nominated as
    such, EU watchlist parameters [31], and substances selected for the monitoring
    programme conducted in the Danube Hazard m3c project [23]. In addition to the
    MP concentrations, the study also collected data on other water quality parameters
    that support data interpretation, such as suspended solids concentrations. Data
    mainly from the years 2008–2020 were requested and later updated, especially from
    the results of the Danube Hazard m3c project itself. Of the 14 countries with
    a significant portion of their territory within the DRB and contracting parties
    of the ICPDR, eight were represented in the project as project partners (AT, BG,
    HR, HU, ME, RO, SK, SI). However, only a few partner organizations were themselves
    the responsible institution with direct access to monitoring data (AT, ME, RO,
    SK). For three countries (HR, HU, SI), data were received via associated strategic
    partners, whose work was not directly funded by the project and data delivery
    was voluntary. For three further countries (BG, DE, RS), project partners successfully
    managed to receive data. Data were mainly received in MS-Excel and comma separated
    value files and were read into R [57] with the packages openxlsx [58] and data.table
    [21], in order to harmonize and inspect them. The format and the vocabularies
    for the metadata were unified (e.g. using the same substance identifier for data
    from different data sources) and data and metadata checked for plausibility. Then
    data were imported into the database using the RPostgreSQL [17] or RPostgres package
    [65]. Data retrieval and evaluation In the PostgreSQL database, data from different
    tables (e.g. for measurements, samples and monitoring sites) were combined in
    meaningful thematic database views. Database views allow to define a new virtual
    database table that consists of selected data from different existing tables joined
    together by common key columns. Such views were used to access the data for evaluation.
    While data for groundwater, river water and river SPM were collected in one set
    of tables, they are presented to the user in different views, to make them more
    easily accessible. The same applies for data on wastewater and sewage sludge,
    which are stored in the same tables, but presented in different views. Needed
    information for evaluation was selected and downloaded from the views by sending
    SQL queries from the R environment to the database and thus retrieve the results
    of the query for further evaluation directly in the R data analysis environment.
    When dealing with MP concentrations, it is often the case that a significant portion
    of the values are censored, falling below the LOQ or even below the LOD. Therefore,
    it is essential to use appropriate methods to handle these cases during data evaluation
    to obtain the maximum information while avoiding introducing bias in the statistical
    analyses [37]. To calculate summary statistics for boxplots, the method “regression
    on order statistics” (ROS) was applied [38] using the NADA R package [48]. This
    method generally requires single measurements as input. To avoid losing all information
    included in composite samples and measurements that are only available as aggregated
    data, we adopted the following approach: we treated composite samples in the same
    way as grab samples, which may underestimate their representativeness but at least
    partly utilizes the information they contain. For aggregated data from statistical
    aggregation of single values, we considered their mean value, by treating calculated
    mean values below LOQ the same way as we treated censored measurements from grab
    samples. Statistical testing of relationships between metadata and concentration
    levels is necessary to investigate which metadata can be used to explain different
    MP concentration levels in an environmental compartment. These metadata can subsequently
    be used for better inter- and extrapolation of the available monitoring data into
    unsampled temporal or spatial regions for emission modelling. To test the correlation
    of a numerical variable with the partly censored concentrations, Kendall’s τ was
    used, whereas a generalized Wilcoxon test also known as Peto–Peto test [38] was
    applied to test the influence of a categorical variable on the partly censored
    concentrations (cenken/cendiff function from the NADA R package). To be able to
    investigate also multivariate relationships with multiple independent variables
    and multiple substances concentrations as dependent variables, we searched for
    an ANOVA-like tool that can account for censored data (significant share of data
    below LOQ) and is not based on assumptions like multivariate normality, which
    are often not met by the concentration data. Following Helsel 38, ranks of u-scores
    were calculated substance-wise from the concentrations to handle censored data
    using the NADA2 R-package [43]. Then a dissimilarity matrix using Euclidean distance
    was derived and fed together with the independent variables into a permutational
    multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, [5] and into PERMDISP [6]), a multivariate
    extension of Levene’s test. Both procedures were conducted using the vegan R package
    [54]. PERMANOVA does not require input data to meet any given distribution and
    allows classical partitioning with tests and estimation of sizes of main effects,
    interaction terms, hierarchical structures and mixed models but it is sensitive
    in unbalanced sampling designs to inhomogeneity of dispersion [7]. Therefore,
    the homogeneity of dispersion was investigated with the PERMDISP-test before applying
    PERMANOVA. To cope with unbalanced sampling designs, Anderson et al. [9] developed
    an adapted test metric, which is less influenced by inhomogeneity of dispersion.
    Unfortunately, these algorithms are not yet implemented in the R programming environment
    and therefore could not be applied in this work. To examine through substance-wise
    post hoc test how the median values differ in the groups defined by the metadata,
    a one factor permutation test (cenpermanova from NADA2) was applied. Correlation
    between the independent variables was checked by ANOVA for mixed types (numerical
    and nominal) and with Cramer’s V [18] for nominal variables using R package rcompanion
    [51]. Results and discussion To demonstrate the capabilities and usefulness of
    such a database of MP concentrations, this section presents and discusses exemplarily
    selected results regarding the assessment of data availability, identification
    of important emission pathways, and origination of model input data for emission
    models. Subsequently, this section is completed with the main insights and lessons
    learned regarding the data management process and the structure of the database,
    in view of its further development as fully operative tool. Data availability
    In total 10.7 M concentration measurements in over 383 k samples from about 25
    k sampling sites are included in the database. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution
    of the measurements across the number of substances and the environmental compartments
    investigated. It is evident that a high number of measurements are available for
    only a small number of substances (30–40), while only very few samples were analysed
    for a very high number of substances (> 2000) in surface and wastewater. This
    can be easily explained by the different monitoring approaches implemented in
    the DRB. One the one hand, in accordance with the requirements of the WFD and
    its daughter directives, approximately 40 parameters must to be monitored. For
    these parameters, a significant amount of data for ground and surface water stems
    from surveys conducted by national authorities. On the other hand, within the
    JDSs, organized by the ICPDR and supported by several research laboratories, a
    few selected locations along the Danube and since JDS4 also selected wastewater
    treatment plants (WWTP) are sampled once every 6 years. This results in a limited
    number of samples being analysed for a large number of chemicals, which increases
    over time as analytical capabilities develop. Fig. 1 Content of the concentration
    database for the DRB: Number of concentration measurements versus number of substances
    for different environmental matrices. Full lines represent all measurements, dashed
    line only those above LOQ Full size image The matrix with the most available results
    is surface water, followed by groundwater. For soil, noteworthy numbers of measurements
    are available for a few substances. The spectrum of analysed substances is wide
    for wastewater, but the total number of measurements is rather small (less than
    2000). All other matrices (stormwater runoff, atmospheric deposition, sewage sludge
    and SPM) have far fewer measurements and measured parameters. The data availability
    over time (Fig. 2) indicates that monitoring of surface water and groundwater
    is a relatively continuous process with slightly increasing number of measurements
    and parameters being investigated. Untreated wastewater numbers have started lower
    but are strongly increasing, while data for treated wastewater are only available
    for some years. This is mainly due to concentration data derived from reported
    loads being excluded from the evaluation (please refer to the last section of
    “Results and Discussion” chapter for further explanation). For soil there is continuous
    monitoring, but no clear trend over time was identified. Monitoring of atmospheric
    deposition and stormwater runoff is sporadic and mostly limited to dedicated research
    projects, with no discernible trends identified. The numbers for all compartments
    drop in 2020, which may be due to the fact monitoring data were not yet available
    when data collection for the database started in March 2021 or could be an effect
    of the COVID pandemic. Fig. 2 Availability of monitoring data for the years 2008–2020
    for different environmental compartments in the database for the DRB Full size
    image The data availability in the DRB varies greatly between different countries
    (Fig. 3). Germany and Hungary have a high number of measurements from various
    environmental compartments, while for all other countries data from fewer environmental
    compartments are available and the number of measurements is usually low, except
    for surface water. The number of parameters has a high variation, with countries
    and compartments investigated in the JDS4 including very high number of substances,
    while other data sources contain much fewer substances. Bosnia and Herzegovina
    (BA), Czech Republic (CZ) and Moldova (MD) were not actively involved in the Danube
    Hazard m3c project and therefore national monitoring data are not yet included,
    except those available from transnational monitoring activities (JDS4 and TNMN).
    Fig. 3 Data availability on country level. All countries with > 2000 km2 area
    in the DRB (contracting parties of the ICPDR) are shown. The number of measurements
    is normalized with the area of the country in the DRB. Where no data for an environmental
    compartment are available, no point is shown Full size image The spatial coverage
    of the data is generally very heterogeneous (Fig. 4). Even for surface water and
    heavy metals, where the highest numbers of monitoring data are available, the
    spatial coverage is incomplete, with gaps mainly in the southeast of the basin
    (Fig. 4:A). Mercury concentrations, which are difficult to quantify in the low
    ranges occurring in surface waters, are not measured quantitatively in many places,
    so that the data density is even lower, when only looking at areas with quantitative
    results (Fig. 4:B). Generally, the data availability is higher along the Danube
    main river compared to the tributaries. This holds also true for carbamazepine,
    an anticonvulsant pharmaceutical compound that is hardly degraded by conventional
    wastewater treatment [15] and for azoxystrobin, a fungicide used in agriculture
    and listed on the new surface water watch list under the WFD [36] (Fig. 4:C-D).
    Fig. 4 Spatial availability of measurements in surface water (water samples) for
    selected substances: mercury (A, B), carbamazepine (C), azoxystrobin (D). Number
    of measurements are summarized on a regular raster, in areas without visible raster
    cells no measurements are available. To highlight the relevance of sensitive analytical
    methods for mercury, additionally to the total number of measurements in panel
    A the number of measurements above LOQ is presented in panel B. Where concentrations
    in total and dissolved matrix were available, both were counted Full size image
    In terms of spatial coverage, it can be concluded that even for surface waters,
    which are the best-investigated compartment, and for well-known substances like
    mercury, data coverage is very scattered. There is only a certain, perhaps sufficient
    density of monitoring sites along the Danube. Targeted monitoring approaches such
    as the JDS can help to close data gaps. However, if aiming to understand the emissions
    and fate of substances in the entire basin, the tributaries must also be covered.
    Identification of main pathways The proportionate contribution of specific pathways
    to the overall emissions of MP into surface waters depends on the volume of the
    transport medium (discharge, sediment input or precipitation) and the level of
    contamination within that medium. Analysing either of these factors by comparing
    concentration levels across different environmental compartments provides initial
    insights into the predominant routes through which substances are emitted. Additionally,
    contrasting the pollution profiles of different types of MP can help identify
    specific indicator substances. If pollution levels of these indicators are elevated
    in one compartment, it signifies pollution primarily via the related pathway.
    Figure 5 compares the concentration levels of six selected MP from different substance
    groups in bulk atmospheric deposition (atm. deposition), groundwater, river water,
    stormwater runoff (from storm sewers in separated sewer systems and from combined
    sewer overflows in combined sewer systems), effluent from municipal WWTP, topsoil,
    SPM in rivers and sewage sludge. Although concentrations vary in many cases over
    several orders of magnitude, the median concentrations provide a rather clear
    indication of where contamination levels are higher and where less contamination
    is found: Fig. 5 Concentrations of selected MPs in different environmental compartments.
    Concentrations are shown as box-whisker plots with values below LOQ imputed by
    means of ROS under assumption of a lognormal distribution. If more than 80% of
    observations were below LOQ, no boxplot is shown. Notches in the boxes indicate
    roughly 95% confidence interval for comparing medians. The range of the LOQ is
    indicated by red dashed box. The number of observations (N) is shown as annotation
    above or below the boxes. The numbers underlaying this figure can be found in
    Additional file 1 Full size image Benzo[a]pyren (B[a]P) is a polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbon (PAH), well known as carcinogenic air and water pollutant mainly produced
    during incomplete combustion of organic substances. Therefore, residential heating
    with wood or coal fire and industrial emissions are significant sources [59].
    Emissions from these sources are mainly distributed via the atmosphere and deposited
    onto surfaces. In water, B[a]P has a strong tendency to adsorb to particles. Figure
    5 shows that highest B[a]P concentrations are detected in stormwater runoff and
    still significant concentrations are found in atmospheric deposition, while comparable
    low concentrations are measured in treated wastewater. The latter can be explained
    by the efficient removal of B[a]P through adsorption to sewage sludge. Concentrations
    in surface and groundwater were mostly below LOQ and are therefore not shown as
    boxplot. When comparing concentrations in solids, levels in sewage sludge and
    surface water SPM are similar, with a higher variability in river water SPM, while
    concentrations in topsoil are one order of magnitude lower. Therefore, it can
    be suspected that stormwater runoff is the main emission pathway for B[a]P in
    urban areas, while soil erosion might gain importance in rural areas impacted
    by agricultural erosion. Emissions via WWTP effluents might be negligible. The
    importance of stormwater outlets is supported by results from emission modelling
    [13, 33]. For mercury, Fig. 5 shows total concentration levels in the same order
    of magnitude in atmospheric deposition, river water, stormwater and treated wastewater,
    with highest total concentration in stormwater runoff, followed by atmospheric
    deposition. Concentrations in groundwater were not quantitatively measured above
    the LOQ with the applied methods and are therefore probably lower. As for B[a]P,
    the direct deposition onto water surfaces and wash-off from impervious surfaces
    are important pathways for mercury river pollution. However, in comparison to
    B[a]P, concentration levels in deposition are significantly higher and thus the
    direct deposition on water surfaces gains importance. It is thus less clear if
    there is a dominant pathway. This is also supported by the content in different
    solids: concentration levels in soil, river SPM and sewage sludge are around the
    same level, with slightly higher concentrations in sewage sludge. These findings
    are consistent with the literature, which identifies air pollution from coal combustion
    and cement production as the primary emitters of mercury into the atmosphere [26].
    Through air transport and deposition, mercury is contaminating sealed areas, topsoil
    and water bodies and thus several different pathways might be relevant [32, 55].
    Copper (Cu) is an element used in many technical processes but also occurring
    in nature. High emissions can be expected from traffic due to the use of Cu in
    brake-systems, resulting in significant brake-wear emissions. In Fig. 5, the highest
    total Cu concentrations can be seen in stormwater runoff, followed by treated
    wastewater, atmospheric deposition and surface waters. This is in line with the
    above-mentioned emissions from traffic. As the database is very broad for Cu,
    one can also see some very high concentrations in river and groundwater, probably
    related to areas with geogenic elevated concentrations and associated mining activities.
    Median total Cu concentrations are lowest in the groundwater compartment. With
    respect to solids, the highest Cu concentrations are found in sewage sludge, followed
    by river-SPM and soil, with significantly lower concentrations. Soil concentrations
    show a high variability, where the high outlier may again be attributed to areas
    with elevated geogenic background concentrations and mining activities. These
    findings indicate that for Cu stormwater runoff is a major pathway in urban areas
    and that areas with elevated geogenic background concentrations and mining activities
    need to be explicitly included in emission models to obtain meaningful results.
    Diclofenac is a widely used anti-inflammatory drug. Thus, emissions can be expected
    mainly via sewage. Diclofenac is not easily degraded during conventional wastewater
    treatment [50]. Figure 5 shows highest Diclofenac concentrations in treated wastewater,
    followed by concentrations in stormwater (primarily due to data from combined
    sewer overflows), which are one order of magnitude lower, and river water, which
    has again significantly lower concentration levels. The lowest concentrations
    were detected in atmospheric deposition and groundwater, with levels 4 orders
    of magnitude lower than in treated wastewater. Sewage-related pathways, namely
    WWTP effluent and combined sewer overflows, are the dominating pathways of diclofenac
    emissions into surface waters. Bisphenol A (BpA) is a chemical used as a monomer
    for the production of polycarbonate and epoxide resins, from which remaining monomers
    can leach during the use phase. BpA is also used in its original form, e.g. as
    an antioxidant in break fluids [47]. Its endocrine-disrupting impact [44] makes
    its occurrence in the aquatic environment a matter of high concern. Here, highest
    concentrations of BpA are found in stormwater runoff, followed by treated wastewater
    and atmospheric deposition (Fig. 5). Lower concentration levels are found in groundwater
    and river water, with lower median concentrations in river water than in groundwater
    (although the data base for groundwater is still rather small). In solids, only
    in sewage sludge some values above LOQ can be seen. With a solubility of 300 mg/L
    in water [60], sorption to solids is not a decisive process for fate and transport
    of BpA. Thus, the main pathways for BpA is probably stormwater runoff or treatment
    plants effluents, depending on the sewer system and emitted water volumes. Perfluorooctanesulfonic
    acid (PFOS) is a very persistent substance that was used in many applications
    until it was regulated under the Stockholm convention. PFOS remains present in
    the environment as legacy pollution, as well as in consumer products and firefighting
    foams found in the technosphere, which may still emit PFOS. Furthermore, PFOS
    can derive from degradation of precursor substances, especially during conventional
    wastewater treatment [52]. Figure 5 shows that the median concentration levels
    in treated wastewater and stormwater runoff are similar. In contrast, surface
    waters have significantly lower median concentrations, and in groundwater they
    are nearly one order of magnitude lower. In atmospheric deposition, the concentrations
    were not detected above the LOQ in most cases. Groundwater concentration shows
    the highest number of observations and also a very high variability with extremely
    high values, which are even higher than in treated wastewater. This can be attributed
    to local groundwater contamination, which in many cases is legacy pollution caused
    by former firefighting foam applications, e.g. in training fields at airports
    [14]. When looking at the solids, highest contamination is found in sewage sludge,
    followed by river SPM. Concentrations in soils are rather low and, as a result,
    not a significant pathway of river pollution. When modelling emissions, it is
    important to consider that in most catchments wastewater and stormwater runoff
    are the primary pathways. However, in some areas exfiltration from contaminated
    groundwater may be more significant and should also be included in the models,
    as described, e.g. in Kittlaus et al. 45. Deriving input data for emission modelling
    Emission models for regionalized pathway analysis, such as the MoRE model [34],
    require concentrations as input data for different pathways. Ideally, these data
    are temporally and spatially distributed to best represent the differences in
    pollution occurring in time and space. But as data on concentration of MPs in
    different environmental compartments are scarce, often one constant concentration
    value is applied for a whole river basin and over multiple years. Thus, every
    statistically significant differentiation between concentrations in space or time
    or by attributes of the emission pathway (e.g. applied treatment technology in
    WWTPs or land use stratification of top soils) has the potential to improve the
    results of the model application. A first example of how this inventory of concentrations
    can support emission modelling from municipal WWTPs is through the examination
    of heavy-metals concentrations in WWTP effluent across different countries (Fig.
    6). Quite large differences in effluent concentrations of municipal WWTPs can
    be observed for certain metals. For instance, the median concentration of total
    Hg and Zn in Hungary is approximately one order of magnitude higher than in Germany,
    Austria, and Romania. To examine whether this discrepancy is due to varying levels
    of treatment technology, the plot also indicates the type of treatment used. It
    is evident that the treatment technology applied is not the determining factor.
    It is worth noting that the median concentrations of total Hg and Pb in Germany
    are one order of magnitude lower than in other countries, while this is not the
    case for Ni and Zn. The data were thoroughly checked for quality problems, but
    no issues were found that would affect comparability. However, the reason for
    these deviations could not be identified with the available data, and further
    research is needed. Fig. 6 Heavy metal concentrations (total) in treated wastewater
    from municipal WWTP in different Danube countries with different treatment technologies
    implemented. Concentrations are shown as box-whisker plots with values below LOQ
    imputed by means of ROS under assumption of a lognormal distribution. Notches
    in the boxes indicate roughly 95% confidence interval for comparing medians. If
    more than 80% of observations were below LOQ, no boxplot is shown. The range of
    LOQ is indicated by a red dashed box. The number of observations (N) is shown
    above each boxplot. The numbers underlaying this figure can be found in Additional
    file 1 Full size image These significant differences in concentrations at national
    level can be seen as indicator that, when preparing input data for emission modelling
    on a larger scale, it is important to use different input data for municipal WWTP
    effluent in different countries. Furthermore, the low number of concentration
    values in all countries except for Germany is a strong indicator of the need for
    further monitoring of WWTP effluents with suitable methods to broaden the data
    basis. As a second example, this study investigated the concentrations of PFAS
    in the effluent of municipal WWTPs. A multivariate data analysis was conducted
    to determine the factors that influence the PFAS concentrations in the effluent.
    The dataset used in the analysis contained concentrations of PFPeA, PFHxA, PHpA,
    PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFBS, PFHxS and PFOS in 1036 effluent samples from three data
    sources [23, 49, 53]. The following independent variables were examined: size
    of the treatment plant given by 5 classes for the design capacity (in population
    equivalents (PE), see Fig. 7), treatment steps applied (only “secondary treatment”
    or “tertiary treatment with N and P removal”), country of the WWTP (AT, BG, CZ,
    DE, HR, HU, RO, RS, SI, SK) and time of sampling, which was processed into sampling
    year (2017–2022) and season (summer, winter). Unfortunately, the availability
    of data in the different groups resulting from the above-mentioned independent
    variables is very unbalanced, with many combinations of independent variables
    without any samples and some combinations with high number of samples. Due to
    this unbalanced sampling design, a homogeneous dispersion of the values in the
    groups defined by the levels of the independent variables is a precondition to
    test for differences in location of the groups [8, 9]. With the PERMDISP test
    (9999 permutations), the data were tested for homogeneity of dispersion and this
    could be rejected with high significance (p < 0.001) for all variables. Only after
    pooling the classes of the WWTP design capacity into capacity below 100 kPE and
    above 100 kPE, similarity of dispersion of these two groups could not be rejected
    (p = 0.67). Following this, it was tested if the mean effluent concentrations
    between WWTPs above and below 100 kPE are significantly different and this was
    confirmed with PERMANOVA (9999 permutations, p < 0.001). A substance-wise post
    hoc one-factor permutation test (cenpermanova from NADA2) indicated that for all
    substances that showed significant (p < 0.05) differences in the mean concentration
    (PFHpA, PFOA, PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS), the effluent concentrations from WWTPs with
    a capacity above 100k PE were higher than those from the smaller treatment plants
    (the test results and group-wise mean concentrations are listed in Additional
    file 1). Fig. 7 PFAS concentration in effluent of municipal WWTP in the DRB depending
    on the size of the WWTP given in PE. Values below LOQ (range given as red dashed
    boxes) were imputed using ROS under assumption of a lognormal distribution. The
    number of observations (N) is shown above each boxplot. The numbers underlaying
    this figure can be found in Additional file 1 Full size image The significant
    different concentration levels in effluent of WWTPs above and below 100 kPE can
    already be used as input for emission modelling. Figure 7 suggests the potential
    existence of further patterns that are not statistically significant within the
    current unbalanced data basis, but which might be interesting to further investigate
    after broadening the data availability. Specifically, the concentration levels
    in small plants seem to be higher than in medium sized plants. For those size
    classes for which a high number of measurements is available, the concentrations
    spread over a wide range, in some cases 3 orders of magnitude, meaning that the
    groups are very inhomogeneous. This might indicate that the main emissions are
    not caused by sewage from households and widespread commercial activities, but
    rather by specific commercial or industrial activities that exist in some of the
    WWTP catchments and not in others. To improve the spatial precision of the emission
    models, it would be necessary to identify these critical activities and include
    them in the modelling. As a third example, the concentration of selected MPs in
    top soil, which serves as input data for the emission pathway “soil erosion”,
    should be tested in terms of which metadata might be suitable predictors for extrapolation
    to unsampled areas. MPs from different substance groups, which are expected to
    be relevant soil pollutants and where an adequate amount of measurements were
    available in the database, were selected: mercury as an example for heavy metals,
    a low molecular weight PAH (phenanthrene) and a medium molecular weight PAH (fluoranthene),
    hexachlorobenzene (used as pesticide in the past but that can also derive from
    breakdown of other chlorinated organic substances), and a long-chain PFAS (perfluorononanoic
    acid, PFNA) with a comparable high toxicity, indicated by a high relative potency
    factor (RPF = 10) in the proposed new EU environmental quality standard for water
    [16] final based on [12]. Regarding the available metadata, information about
    land use on the soil, time of sampling, country where the sampling took place
    and the data source were available. Some datasets further contain information
    on the soil texture and genetic soil type, grain size distribution and organic
    carbon content, but these data were too scattered for a statistical investigation.
    Nevertheless, also those variables which were available for all samples (land
    use, sampling year, country and data source) could not be tested with multivariate
    procedures, as none of the selected substances are included in all data sources
    (this is only the case for some commonly measured heavy metals) and thus no complete
    cases remained for the statistical analysis. Therefore, only univariate procedures
    could be applied and interaction effects could not be considered. Highly significant
    (p < 0.01) differences in concentrations of all selected substances between different
    types of land use on the soil were found using the Peto–Peto test (the detailed
    test results are reported in Additional file 1). This means that at least one
    land use shows statistically different soil MP concentrations than other land
    uses (Fig. 8). Figure 8 shows, however, that the available information on land
    use is not totally consistent. The general class “agricultural land” includes
    sampling sites with agricultural land use that could not be attributed to the
    specific sub-classes “arable land” and “pastures”, such as for example “land principally
    occupied by agriculture, with significant areas of natural vegetation” or “heterogeneous
    agricultural areas with complex cultivation patterns”. However, an even larger
    portion of data was available for agricultural areas, for which no detailed land
    use information was available. Therefore, classification needed to remain on this
    general level. For mercury, both investigated PAHs and PFNA, the top soil concentration
    in forests is higher than on arable land and pastures, while for hexachlorobenzene
    concentrations on arable land are significantly higher than in forest soils. This
    can be explained by the different input of the substances into the soil, mainly
    via ubiquitous atmospheric deposition in the first case and via pesticide application
    on arable land for hexachlorobenzene. In forests, substances deposited by the
    atmosphere are subject to a combing effect due to the enlarged surface area of
    branches and leaves. Additionally, these substances remain in the upper soil layer
    for longer periods than on arable land, where the soil is regularly mixed by the
    tillage. The different sampling depth for top soil sampling in forests (usually
    about 10 cm) and on arable land (usually about 30 cm) further explain the lower
    MP concentrations found for contaminants transported via atmospheric deposition
    in arable land compared to forest soils. Not easily explainable are the causes
    for the high hexachlorobenzene contamination in soil of seminatural areas. Further
    metadata variables (organic soil content, soil texture, year of sampling) would
    be needed to shed light on the underlying drivers and to derive an improved regionalization
    model for soil concentrations not only depending on land use. Fig. 8 Top soil
    content of mercury and selected organic MPs versus land use on the soil. Concentrations
    are shown as box-whisker plots with values below LOQ imputed by means of ROS under
    assumption of a lognormal distribution. Notches in the boxes indicate roughly
    95% confidence interval for comparing medians. If more than 80% of observations
    were below LOQ, no boxplot is shown. The range of the LOQ is indicated by red
    dashed box or line. The number of observations (N) is shown above each boxplot.

    image Insights regarding data management and database structure development During
    the steps of data collection, data cleaning, and database setup, several insights
    and lessons were learned. These will be briefly discussed in the following section.
    Data accessibility was a major issue during data collection, particularly when
    the data holding institution was not a project partner responsible for the data
    collection or when a different authority or department within the same authority
    held the data, as they did not originate from the water administration, such as
    soil concentrations. One reason for authorities holding back data was of financial
    nature, as they sell monitoring data as a strategy to cover their expenses for
    data management and processing. In other instances, they were hesitant to release
    the entire datasets as they typically only provide selected portions of data to
    interested users, rather than complete set. As a result, some authorities decided
    not to provide raw data, but only aggregated data, e.g. mean annual river concentrations
    instead of single measurements. These data were included in the database, but
    aggregation causes significant information loss in terms of gained understanding
    and capability of extrapolation. For instance, it is not possible to evaluate
    mean annual river concentrations with regard to differences between low-flow and
    high-flow situations. This hinders, among others, the reliable calculation of
    riverine loads, which are required for the generation of emission inventories.
    In many cases, data were made exclusively available for use within the project.
    The providing institutions did not agree to include their data in the published
    database, not even if the origin of the data was properly documented. One reason
    given for not agreeing to republish whole raw datasets was the loss of the opportunity
    for further data corrections. This is however a controversial issue: as the data
    are not or only constrainedly distributed, errors in the dataset may not be discovered
    by potential users. One solution to this contradiction might be the setup of interfaces
    between different data bases, which allow for easy data updates whenever necessary.
    Even when data owners agreed to publication, the process of reaching a data publication
    agreement or assigning a license for reuse was time-consuming. As an example of
    best-practice, we identified the Bavarian Environment Agency, which offers its
    data for download [11] and clearly licenses them under the Creative Commons Attribution
    4.0 International License [19]. This facilitates the process greatly. As already
    mentioned, emissions from WWTPs are reported as loads under the EU UWWTD. Therefore,
    in many countries they are only available in the form of reported loads. While
    water amounts were available to recalculate mean concentrations from these loads,
    the approach to include concentration data below LOQ as 0 during load calculation
    leads this reverse approach ad absurdum, because the higher the LOQ of the applied
    analytical method is, the more measurements fall below the LOQ and are included
    as 0 and thus the lower the back-calculated concentrations are. Therefore, even
    if these data were available, they could not be used for further investigations
    in this study and were excluded from the evaluation. In conclusion, we recommend
    to store and share data in a non-aggregated form. During the collection and checking
    of the available data, it was observed that several responsible institutions lack
    the necessary tools and skills to handle large datasets, despite their high motivation.
    Many institutions still store and manage data in spreadsheets without implementing
    appropriate automatic quality checks. This increases the likelihood of human errors,
    such as incorrectly assigned units of measure for concentrations or omitted information
    about analytical limits and methods. If data are not stored in well-organized
    databases with controlled vocabulary, the available data may contain different
    terms to describe the same content. This could be due to different people using
    different words to describe a method or simply because of typos that were not
    noticed during data creation. Mapping heterogeneous content onto a controlled
    vocabulary is a laborious task that often requires a high level of expertise to
    determine which terms describe the same thing and where actual differences need
    to be documented. When data are derived from a well-designed database system,
    data mapping requires considerably less effort. Concerning the database development
    process, it was observed that the database design and controlled vocabulary setup
    were discussed by a small team but mainly implemented by one project team member,
    while data import was shared among a few team members. Although this was the only
    way to quickly establish a functional system and fill it with data, it occasionally
    resulted in misunderstandings between the developer and the data manager. This
    led to a need for further data harmonization and adaptations of the naming and
    documentation in the database. When developing such a tool, which will be used
    by users with different backgrounds, it is essential to allocate time and resources
    for common discussion of the terminology and ideas, as well as for proper documentation
    and testing of the tool, to achieve consistent results. With the ongoing import
    of further data, a better understanding of available data and metadata was developed
    and the data structure and controlled vocabulary were adapted and extended. For
    example, initially for all environmental compartments, separate tables for single
    measurements and aggregated measurements were created. But for some compartments,
    such as atmospheric deposition and stormwater, no aggregated data were received,
    making these tables superfluous. On the other hand, controlled vocabularies, which
    were not imported from elsewhere, grew during data import as some data could not
    be mapped on the available values and were thus added to the vocabulary. From
    time to time, a reorganization of the controlled vocabulary was necessary, including
    updating the already imported data. To make sure that during this process of evolving
    classification the original value is not evolving into something incorrect, it
    is recommendable to additionally keep the value as contained in the raw data for
    later check-up. The probably most difficult but also most interesting topic regarding
    the database design is the identification of useful metadata and the selection
    or development of controlled vocabulary for these metadata. The most important
    metadata for concentration measurements is the substance analysed. Already here,
    several challenges are faced when combining data from different data sources:
    MP often are reported using different names, may it be a product brand name, the
    standardized chemical IUPAC name or another possibly shorter common name. Fortunately,
    nowadays in most cases a CAS number is reported along with the substance name,
    which helps identifying the chemical substance more easily. However, in some studies
    outdated CAS numbers are found or the CAS number is given in a report, but not
    directly together with the tabulated data. For some substances, no CAS number
    is available, as they are only known from environmental screening methods and
    the substance itself is not characterized yet (e.g. some pesticide metabolites
    found in the JDS). In these cases, the unique identifiers from the NORMAN network
    database were used. On the other hand, for some MP several forms of the compounds
    are reported, which are chemically different, either because differences in the
    structure or some carbon chains occur or because different salts of an acid or
    base are used as standard for the analysis, but which—from the perspective of
    water pollution—somehow describe the same pollution or are actually not differentiable
    as they occur dissociated in the water matrix. The reported CAS number is anyhow
    different in such cases, depending on the exact standard used for calibration
    in the laboratory. Here, a high expertise in chemistry (or even toxicology) is
    necessary to decide which substances can be evaluated together as one MP and where
    differentiation is necessary. A reliable database on substance identifiers, names
    and relations is of great assistance for such questions, and a database as presented
    here can help to set up a knowledge base regarding such issues. Some examples
    should showcase problems regarding substance identification and solutions implemented
    in the database. Nonylphenol is a substance used in industry, but also deriving
    from nonylphenol ethoxylate degradation in the environment, and it was identified
    as priority hazardous substance by the WFD. Actually, it is a group of substances
    with the same chemical formula C15H24O but different structures, and in industry
    it is mostly produced as a mixture of different isomers and structures. Chemical
    laboratories apply different standards for instrument calibration and therefore
    reported data include nonylphenol (CAS 25154-52-3), 4-nonylphenol (CAS 104-40-5)
    and branched 4-nonylphenol (CAS 84852-15-3). These were separately collected in
    the database, but the question arises as to whether or not these substances should
    be grouped together or not for evaluation purposes. Another interesting example
    is Mecoprop, an herbicide used on green roofs in the sealing membrane to protect
    it against penetration from roots. The product Mecoprop is applied as a 1:1 mixture
    (CAS 93-65-2) of two isomers, one of which is herbicidal active (CAS 25333-13-5)
    and one not (CAS 16484-77-8). Unfortunately, in the received data a fourth CAS
    number occurs (CAS 7085-19-0), for which the exact relation to the others is not
    clear to the authors, even if a substance info page of the European Chemicals
    Agency exists [24]. A pre-existing controlled vocabulary was applied in the case
    of land use metadata (for soil and groundwater sampling sites), taken from the
    CORINE land cover dataset and well documented in Kosztra et al. 46. This has two
    advantages, namely it can be assumed that all land uses occurring in Europe can
    be mapped to this classification system and missing information could be generated
    by analysis of the geodata based on the sampling site locations. Nevertheless,
    this classification system is a combination of land use and land cover information
    and better data models are under development [10]. Conclusions and outlook By
    combining concentration data from different data sources in a common database
    for the DRB, several new insights could be gained. Data availability is very heterogeneous
    for different substances and environmental compartments. To achieve a more balanced
    data availability, it would be necessary to harmonize monitoring networks and
    investigated substances. This would allow to investigate the spatial distribution
    of pollution. While surface and groundwater are rather well covered by existing
    data, many countries lack data for other environmental and technical compartments.
    This is either due a lack of monitoring or inaccessibility of data. We propose
    to develop a harmonized monitoring program for the DRB not only covering river
    monitoring along the Danube river itself and a few large tributaries (as currently
    implemented by the TNMN and the JDS), but also river monitoring in many tributaries
    and in other environmental and technical compartments. For such a harmonized monitoring
    approach, it would be important to collect metadata of potential sampling points
    in advance and ensure a well-balanced sampling design that facilitates statistical
    evaluation. During the collection of available data in the basin, deficits were
    identified in the data management systems and data literacy within the data holding
    institutions. To address these issues, it is strongly recommended to use well-designed
    database systems to manage monitoring data. The importance of proper handling
    of data cannot be overstated, especially when considering the high costs invested
    in sampling and chemical analysis. It is crucial to have a good understanding
    of technical aspects and licenses and ensure that the data are easily accessible
    for reuse. Capacity building regarding data literacy in, e.g. national water administrations
    and lobbying for making environmental monitoring data FAIR [66] can help to raise
    the benefits of the monitoring data for society. Applying sound methods for handling
    censored data is especially important when working with MP concentrations. To
    be able to apply these methods, it is of crucial importance that the single concentration
    values together with the analytical thresholds (LOQ) are available, as these methods
    do not work on previously aggregated data. When combining data from different
    data sources, metadata required for extrapolation is often missing, preventing
    the reuse of data for this purpose. Where metadata exists, the used vocabularies
    may differ, substances may be named differently and different CAS numbers (some
    of which may be outdated) are used as identifiers for the same substance. Mapping
    such vocabularies from source datasets onto a target vocabulary is a time-consuming
    task requiring qualified personnel. Nevertheless, this step is necessary to be
    able to evaluate data collectively. A potential solution would be to provide harmonized
    controlled vocabularies on an EU level (e.g. the EIONET WISE vocabularies, [28]
    and to implement them directly in national and transnational monitoring programmes.
    Application of artificial intelligence could also aid in expediting these tasks
    in the future. Data necessary for quantifying emissions to surface water do not
    solely originate from the water discipline. Other data about soil pollution and
    atmospheric deposition are also required. This data is usually collected by different
    departments or organizations and the metadata collected alongside the data might
    not be sufficient for answering the questions related to water pollution. Therefore,
    a database system with a well-chosen selection of useful metadata can aid in communicating
    metadata needs and improving transdisciplinary cooperation and data valorization.
    The current version of the database is a proof of concept and can be used by experts
    for scientific purpose. It holds the potential for many further investigations,
    such as expanding the substances analysed or conducting data analysis on other
    pathways, such as atmospheric deposition and stormwater runoff, for which results
    were not presented here. As the next step, the database will be developed into
    an operational state, where national administrations can easily upload and check
    their data. Further technical development of the database and user interfaces
    is required, as well as capacity building for data literacy in the involved institutions.
    Nonetheless, the database is a valuable tool in its current form. It helps establish
    emission inventories by identifying data gaps that can be filled through monitoring
    programs. Additionally, it provides a first set of input data for emission modelling
    using the pathway-oriented approach. Given its usefulness, we have made it available
    for download at https://doi.org/10.48436/xwve4-h7v43. Availability of data and

  description: Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising approach for the controlled
    release of nutrients, particularly phosphorus and potassium. These essential plant
    nutrients are often applied in excess, leading to environmental pollution and
    loss of efficiency in crop production. Innovative economic and highly efficient
    fertilizers are urgently needed to achieve the targeted crop production worldwide
    in the presence of limited land and water resources. Therefore, in this study,
    novel, eco-friendly, cost-effective and enhanced efficiency nano-enabled fertilizers,
    NEF (nWTF1and nWTF2) were synthesized by impregnation of nanostructured water
    treatment residuals (nWTR) with (KH2PO4 + MgO) at 1:1 and 3:1 (w/w) ratios respectively
    using a planetary ball mill. The nWTR, nWTF1 and nWTF2 were extensively characterized.
    The water retention behavior and the sustained release of nutrients from the fabricated
    nano-enabled fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2) in distilled water and sandy soil were
    investigated and monitored over time. The water retention capacity of the soil
    treated with nWTF2 after 26 days was 9.3 times higher than that of soil treated
    with conventional fertilizer. In addition, the nWTF2 exhibited lower release rates
    of P, K and Mg nutrients for longer release periods in comparison with the conventional
    fertilizers. This is a significant advantage over traditional fertilizers, which
    release nutrients quickly and can lead to leaching and nutrient loss. The main
    interaction mechanisms of PO4–K–Mg ions with nWTR surface were suggested. The
    results of the kinetics study revealed that power function was the best suitable
    model to describe the kinetics of P, K and Mg release data from NEF in water and
    soil. The produced NEF were applied to Zea maize plants and compared to commercial
    chemical fertilizer control plants. The obtained results revealed that the nano-enabled
    fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2) significantly promoted growth, and P content compared
    with the commercial chemical fertilizer treated plants. The present work demonstrated
    the power of nano enabled fertilizers as efficient and sustained release nano-fertilizers
    for sustainable agriculture and pollution free environment.

    has emerged as a promising approach for the controlled release of nutrients, particularly
    phosphorus and potassium. These essential plant nutrients are often applied in
    excess, leading to environmental pollution and loss of efficiency in crop production.
    Innovative economic and highly efficient fertilizers are urgently needed to achieve
    the targeted crop production worldwide in the presence of limited land and water
    resources. Therefore, in this study, novel, eco-friendly, cost-effective and enhanced
    efficiency nano-enabled fertilizers, NEF (nWTF1and nWTF2) were synthesized by

    and critical review Article Open access 08 July 2021 Towards a molecular-scale
    theory for the removal of natural organic matter by coagulation with trivalent
    metals Article 12 March 2024 Introduction World population is predicted to average
    9.8 billion by the year 20501. Thus, a significant demand of world agriculture
    production is anticipated. FAO2 predicted 70% increase in global production of
    grain by 2050 to cover such demand. To achieve the targeted crop production worldwide
    in the presence of limited land and water resources, a significant increase in
    agricultural fertilizer application is required. Phosphorus and potassium based
    fertilizers are essential plant nutrients that are commonly used to improve crop
    yields. Because traditional fertilizers are inefficient in delivering nutrients
    to plants, they are often applied in excess which eventually cause nutrients loss,
    eutrophication and serious environmental problems related to soil and water contamination3,4.
    To control these economic and environmental obstacles, innovative development
    of low-cost highly efficient fertilizers is needed to improve nutrients retention
    for optimal crop production and to minimize environmental disruptions of globally
    sustainable agriculture. The choice of utilization of cheap and nontoxic industrial
    waste materials for economic gain could provide environmental safety and sustainability
    to mankind and assist in maintaining soil quality5,6. The use of innovative nanotechnology
    in agriculture (i.e. Nano-enabled fertilizers (NEF) development) is considered
    one of the most promising approaches to significantly slow and sustained release
    of fertilizer, increase crop production and prevent the loss of nutrients into
    the environment7,8. To address these challenges, nano-enabled fertilizers should
    be supplied to the plants over an extended period of time to noticeably reduce
    the fertilizer application rate. With the aid of ball milling technology, novel
    economic controlled release nanostructured fertilizers could be developed through
    incorporating a natural byproduct in nanoscale as a carrier to generate nano-enabled
    sustained release fertilizers having one or more nanoscale components9,10,11.The
    advantages of using eco-friendly nano-carriers are tuning the fertilizers to release
    nutrients in a controlled manner through the sustainable reuse of industrial byproducts
    sources12,13,14,15,16. Water treatment residuals (WTRs) are waste products of
    drinking water industry, composed mainly from sediment, silica and iron salts—Fe2
    (SO4)3- or aluminum salts (Al2(SO4)3 which are regularly used in coagulation,
    flocculation, and sedimentation processes for water purification16. Huge amounts
    of WTRs are produced yearly worldwide. The low-cost and eco-friendly WTRs have
    become popular due to its efficacy in removing contaminants17,18,19,20. An earlier
    research has demonstrated that WTRs in nanoscale considerably increase its active
    adsorption surface area and consequently increase its capacity for heavy metals
    adsorption. Elkhatib et al.16 successfully synthesized nanostructured WTRs sorbent
    with the aid of planetary ball mill and reported that very small percentage (< 3.5%)
    of P was released from P-saturated nWTRs demonstrating P stability in P-nWTR system.
    The excellent adsorption capability of nWTR for inorganic pollutants indicates
    its potential applicability as a carrier for plant nutrients. Data are not available,
    however, in the literature on using the low-cost efficient nWTRs as a carrier
    in the field of controlled release fertilizers. To date, comparatively few nano-
    enabled fertilizers (NEFs) have been developed with little is known concerning
    their potential of agricultural application and safety5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.
    Therefore, research is urgently needed to clarify ways to enhance resource efficiency
    through developing economic and natural NEFs. The main goal of this study was
    to produce eco-friendly, cost-effective and enhanced efficiency nano-enabled fertilizer
    based eco-friendly material (nWTRs) and evaluate its nutrients release pattern
    and kinetics. This research provides—for the first time-information for the potential
    use of nanostructured WTRs as a carrier to sustain plant nutrients release and
    to present an eco-friendly solution through the sustainable reuse of natural sources.
    Materials and method Preparation and characterization of nWTRs The collected WTRs
    were transported from drinking water treatment plant (Alexandria, Egypt) to the
    laboratory. The bulk WTRs was mechanically ground using a stainless steel hammer
    mill, passed into a 0.51 µm sieve to obtain the WTRs powder (Fig. 1).The WTR powder
    (15 g) was ground to the desired nanoscale following the method of Elkhatib et
    al.12 by using Fritsch Planetary Mono Mill Pulverisette 6 classic line equipped
    with 80-ml stainless steel grinding bowl and 150 g of 1 mm steel grinding balls
    (10). The milling operation was conducted by alternating 10 min of milling with
    5 min of rest to avoid excessive heat. The nanostructured WTR (nWTR) carrier was
    stored in ziploc polyethylene bags until further use. Sizes, shape, surface morphology
    of nWTRs were explored by TEM (H-7650, Hitachi, Japan). The crystallography phase
    of nWTRs was characterized through X-ray diffractogram, XRD (Bruker D2 Phaser
    diffractometer) and the diffractogram was recorded in the 2θ range = 0–100°. The
    surface chemical structure of the produced samples was evaluated by X-ray photoelectron
    spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 1 Schematic diagram of synthesis steps of nano- enabled
    fertilizers (NEF) based water treatment residuals nanoparticles (nWTR). Full size
    image Synthesis and characterization of nano-enabled fertilizer based nWTR The
    conventional fertilizers (KH2PO4 and MgO, powder) used as P–K–Mg nutrients sources
    were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Inc (Massachusetts,
    US). The nanostructured WTR (nWTR) carrier and the (KH2PO4 + MgO, powder) were
    mixed at 1nWTR: 1 KH2PO4 +MgO and 3 nWTR: 1 KH2PO4 +MgO (w/w) ratios and placed
    in a planetary ball mill (Pulverisette-7, Fritsch, Germany) at 200 rpm for 30
    min. The produced two impregnated nano-enabled fertilizers are referred to nWTF1
    and nWTF2 respectively (Fig. 1). Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive
    X-Ray analyzer (SEM–EDX, INCAx-Sightmodel 6587, Oxford instruments, UK) was employed
    to identify the elemental composition and surface characteristics of the nano-carrier
    (nWTR) and the produced nano- enabled fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2). The functional
    groups analysis of nWTR, nWTF1 and nWTF2 was performed by Fourier transform infrared
    spectroscopy (FTIR, Alpha, Bruker, Germany). Soil collection and analysis A sandy
    soil (Typic torripsamment) was sampled from EL-Alamien, Alexandria, Egypt at sampling
    depth of 0–15 cm. The soil samples collected were air-dried, crushed, and sieved
    through 2 mm sieve. Soil physical and chemical characteristics were determined
    using standard methodology21. The measured soil properties are presented in supplemental
    materials (Table S2). Water-retention behavior of nWTF1 and nWTF2 in soil The
    water retention behaviors of the nano-enabled fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2) in
    sandy soil were determined following the method of Wei et al.22. The method in
    details is presented in supplemental materials. Release behavior of nWTF1 and
    nWTF2 The sustained release pattern of P, K & Mg nutrients from the fabricated
    nano-enabled fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2) in distilled water and sandy soils
    were investigated22,23. The experiments are detailed in supplemental materials.
    Mathematical modeling of P, K and Mg release profiles The P, K and Mg released
    data obtained from the NEF release experiments were fitted to four different kinetic
    models (first order, Elovich, Parabolic diffusion and power function) (Tables
    1, 2 and 3) to investigate the release kinetics of P, K and Mg from water and
    soil amended with NEF and to pin point the best predictive model capable of describing
    the results24,25,26,27. Table 1 Kinetics Models for P release from NEF in water
    and soil. Full size table Table 2 Kinetics Models for K release from NEF in water
    and soil. Full size table Table 3 Kinetics models for Mg release from NEF in water
    and soil. Full size table Pot experiment Pot experiment was conducted to estimate
    the effect of NEF on Zea maize growth and phosphorus content in plant. Three treatments
    with three replicates were performed in the pot experiment, comprising the C (control,
    the soil treated with P, K and Mg conventional fertilizers), nWTF1 and nWTF2.
    All treatments were received the same amount of phosphorus (150 mg kg−1). A sandy
    soil was air-dried, sieved (2 mm) and packed into pots (95 mm diameter, 50 mm
    deep), with a total of 500 g soil. Firstly 300 g of the sandy soil was placed
    in the pots. All treatments received nitrogen fertilizer (urea) at a rate of 60
    mgN g−1 per pot. Then the fertilizer samples mentioned above were evenly spread
    on the top of the soil. The P, K and Mg contents of nWTR (nano-carrier) and sustained
    release fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2) are presented in Table S4 (Supplementary
    materials). After that, 200 g of soil was placed to cover the fertilizer samples.
    Finally three seedlings were placed in each pot. The plants were grown for 25
    d before harvesting. All plants were grown under greenhouse conditions and were
    watered with 50 mL of water (each pot) day after day. At the early seedling stage,
    the stem diameter and height of the plant were measured. At harvest (25 days),
    plant shoots and roots were weighed (fresh mass) and dried at 60 °C before being
    weighed again (dry mass). The tissues were then ground, digested in a 1: 3 mixture
    of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, and analyzed. The P content in maize seedling
    was determined using the method reported by Reuter and Robinson28. Statistical

    Excel. Different letters assigned to means indicate statistically significant
    differences (P ≤ 0.05). Results and discussion Characterization XRD and TEM studies
    The Diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern for crystal products did not reveal any
    sharp diffraction characteristic peak over a broad range of d-spacing which evidently
    demonstrated the poorly ordered particles within the nWTR (Fig. 2a). It is also
    indicates that, even though the SEM–EDX results highlight the predominance of
    silicon and aluminum in nWTR, it is likely to be amorphous aluminum and silicon20,29.
    The EDX elemental analysis of nWTR before P, K and Mg sorption shows high percentages
    of silicon (41.59%) as well as oxygen (22.51%) and moderate fraction of Al (17.99%).
    Figure 2 TEM (a) and XRD (b) analysis of nWTR carrier. Full size image The amorphous
    nature and abundance of iron and aluminum in nWTRs could have strong impact on
    P and K adsorption by nWTR. Amorphous Fe and A1 oxides greatly influence the physical
    and chemical properties of the soil. Ion adsorption, especially, phosphorus (P),
    ionic charge, swelling and aggregate formation are significantly modified by the
    presence of amorphous Fe and Al oxides in soil19,20,30. The features and the size
    of the WTR nanoparticles (nWTR) were explored using TEM analysis. The TEM image
    of nWTR (Fig. 2b) shows the agglomerated state of nWTR and ascertains nanoscale
    sizes of nWTR particles (22.34–99.38 nm). The specific surface area and total
    pore volume of bulk WTR are 53.1 m2g−1 and 0.020 cm3 g−1 respectively while nWTR
    has a specific surface area of 129 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.051 cm3
    g−1. The nWTR sample is characterized by approximately 2–3 times larger surface
    area and total pore volume than bulk WTR samples which demonstrates the high reactivity
    of nWTR and makes it potential candidate for nutrients adsorption. Similar results
    were reported by Elkhatib et al.20 and Pająk31. SEM and EDX analysis The SEM and
    EDX were performed to explore surface characteristics, particles arrangement and
    element compositions of nWTR before and after loading with two different rates
    of K, P and Mg nutrients. The SEM image of nWTR before loading with nutrients
    shows irregular structure with various geometries and sizes in the nanoscale range
    of 18.74–33.72 nm (Fig. 3a). The SEM images of nWTF1 and nWTF 2 after loading
    P, K and Mg are presented in Fig. 3b,c respectively. The morphology of nWTF1 and
    nWTF2 nanoparticles remarkably changed for each nano-fertilizer studied which
    could be a result of the K, P and Mg adsorption processes32,33. The SEM images
    show clearly coating film of P, K and Mg on the nWTF1 and nWTF2 nanoparticles
    surface. Meanwhile, the SEM images verified TEM results and affirmed that the
    nWTF1 and nWTF2 nanoparticles produced are in the nanoscale range. In addition,
    the SEM image of the nMgO (Fig. S1b) shows that its particle sizes range from
    18.30 to 20.92 nm. Figure 3 SEM analysis for the synthesized nanoparticles (A)
    nWTR, (B) nWTF1 and (C) nWTF2. Full size image The EDX elemental analysis of nWTR
    before P, K and Mg sorption shows high percentages of silicon (41.59%) as well
    as oxygen (22.51%) and moderate fraction of Al (17.99%) and comparably low percentages
    of Ca (10.14%), C (2.64%), Mg (1.89%) and P (1.02%) (Fig. S2a). After loading
    nWTR with KH2PO4 and MgO (nWTR1) shows noticeable increases in potassium (41.49%),
    phosphorus (8.04%) and magnesium (4.69%) and decreases in Si (15.46%) and Al (6.26%)
    contents in nWTR1 comparative to nWTR as shown in Fig. S2b. Similar trend is noticed
    with nWTR2 nanostructured fertilizer (Fig. S2c) due to the impregnation of K,
    P and Mg nutrients in to nWTR structure. The remarkable changes observed in the
    SEM and EDX analysis indicate the successful loading and adsorption of P–K–Mg
    nutrients on the nano-carrier (nWTR). The zeta potential is important measurable
    indicator of nanoparticles stability and the degree of repulsion between the charged
    particles in the dispersion. The zeta potential analysis of nWTR is presented
    in (Fig. S1a).The nWTR demonstrated negative zeta potential value of − 21.3 mV
    at pH 6.5 which indicates high negative surface charges and electrostatic stability34.
    Fourier transmission infrared (FTIR) measurements The FTIR spectrum of nWTR presented
    in Fig. 4 showed characteristic bands at 3390, 1636 and 128 cm−1 corresponding
    to –OH stretching, HO–H bending vibrations and C=C vibrations respectively, with
    weaker bonds usually vibrate slower than stronger bonds35. The observed band at
    1005 cm−1 is assigned to silicate ions, whereas the band that appears at 518 cm−1
    is associated with Al–O bending vibration30. After loading of P, K and Mg onto
    nWTR, the FTIR spectra of nWTF1 and nWTF2 (Fig. 4) showed bands shift suggesting
    the interaction of KH2PO4–MgO conventional fertilizers and nWTRs. The FTIR bands
    of nWTF1 and nWTF2 spectra (3390, 1636, and 518 cm−1) shifted to diverse wave
    numbers (3120, 1639 and 523 cm−1) and (3370, 1639, 1003 and 679 cm−1) respectively.
    In general, higher wave number shifts in FTTR bands are marked by strengthen of
    the chemical bonds and vice versa. The observed changes in the location and strength
    of bands at wave numbers range 3390–518 cm−1 in nWTF1 and nWTF2 spectra can be
    attributed to the interaction of KH2PO4 and MgO with the active functional groups
    on nWTRs surfaces (i.e.–OH, C–O, Al–O and H bonds)16,36,37. Figure 4 FTIR spectra
    of nWTR, nWTF1 and nWTF2. Full size image X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
    analysis The chemical states and elemental composition of nWTRs surfaces were
    investigated using XPS analysis (Fig. 5a). The nWTRs full spectrum showed the
    existence of Mg, Na, O, N, Cl, and Si. The high resolution of O1s spectra (Fig.
    5b) exhibited three peaks at binding energies of 31.84 eV and (533.17, 533.73
    eV) assigned to metal carbonates and Organic C=O groups, respectively38. The three
    peaks originated from Si2p at 102.67 and 104.68 eV were indicative of aluminosilicate
    and silica SiO2 groups (Fig. 5c).In addition, three peaks were observed in the
    high resolution C1s spectra (Fig. 5d) at 284.57, 285.72 and 287 eV due to C–C
    & C–H, C–O–R and C–R groups respectively 39,40. The displayed two peaks of N1s
    spectra at 398.38 and 399.8 eV (Fig. 5e) were attributed to azide (N*NN*)40, and
    N-C=O separately39.Furthermore, the tow peaks of Mg1s spectra at 303.9 and 1305.25
    eV (Fig. 5f) were assigned to Mg metal and MgCO3 respectively41, whereas the peak
    of Na1s spectra at 1072.57 eV (Fig. 5g) was attributed to sodium compounds40.
    As expected, the Si2p, O1s and C1s spectra of nWTR (Fig. 5b–d) confirm the presence
    of oxygen (O 1s), silicon (Si2p,), and carbon (C 1s) elements which in agreement
    with the FTIR, XRD and EDS analysis. The integral areas of peaks were normalized
    and the percentages of bonding groups are shown in Table S3. Figure 5 XPS analysis
    of nWTRs. The XPS scanning spectra of nWTR (a) shows six major peaks, XPS high

    region of nWTR. Full size image Possible mechanisms for P–K–Mg adsorption by nWTR
    carrier The FTIR spectroscopy technique was used to study the interaction between
    the adsorbates and functional groups on the adsorbent surface. The interpretation
    of the FTIR is based on the chemical structure of the nWTR before and after loading
    with K–P–Mg nutrients. Vanishes or shifts of FTIR peaks demonstrate interactions
    of the adsorbates with functional groups on adsorbents surface. Comparison of
    nWTRs FTIR spectrum with that of nWTRs loaded with KH2PO4 + MgO has established
    the involvement of the functional groups on nWTRs surface (OH, O–Al–O, and Fe
    hydroxide groups) in the interactivity of nWTRs with the K–P–Mg nutrients. FTIR
    spectra of nWTR and nWTR-K–P–Mg loaded are shown in Fig. 4. In accordance with
    XRD, FTIR, and XPS results, the suggested adsorption mechanisms of PO4–K–Mg onto
    nWTR carrier are presented in Fig. 6.The proposed scheme (Fig. 6) shows that the
    anticipated adsorption mechanisms of PO4–K–Mg nutrients by nWTR are: (1) hydrogen
    bonding (2) electrostatic interaction (3) and Al–HPO4 and Fe–HPO4 complexes formation:
    (1) Hydrogen bonding The produced nWTRs contain hydroxyl group (H-acceptor) whereas
    the loaded conventional fertilizers (KH2PO4 + MgO) contain a strongly electronegative
    hydrogen donor (O). Therefore, hydrogen bonding occurs between H-donor (O) of
    the fertilizers (KH2PO4 + MgO) and H-acceptor (OH) of nWTRs. The shift of the
    absorption peaks at 3390 and 1636 cm−1 corresponding to –OH stretching and HO–H
    bending vibrations might support H-bonding formation during the KH2PO4 + MgO loading
    process (Fig. 6). (2) Electrostatic interactions The strong affinity of the function
    groups of nWTR (–OH, C–O and C=O) for cationic nutrients species of nWTR1 & nWTR2
    (K, Mg) greatly indicates electrostatic interactions participation in K and Mg
    adsorption process (Fig. 6). (3) The Al–HPO4 and Fe–HPO4 complexes formation is
    quite possible through binding Al and/or Fe of nWTRs to O atom of KH2PO4 + MgO
    (3) (Fig. 6). Figure 6 Plausible mechanisms of P–K–Mg adsorption on to nWTR carrier.
    Full size image Nano-fertilizer parameters and release studies Water-retention
    (WR) behavior of the nano-enabled fertilizer (NEF) in soil The nano enabled fertilizer
    (NEF) is capable of conserving soil moisture when the material of the nano-carrier
    is good water absorbent. The water preserved by the carrier during irrigation
    can be progressively released to the soil to dissolve the mineral nutrients in
    the nano-carrier for effective release to the plants via diffusion and to fulfill
    the plant water demands in drought-prone areas42. The WR behavior of soil with
    and without nano-enabled fertilizers (NEF) was evaluated against time. Figure
    7 shows that addition of NEF (nWTF1 and nWTF2) to the soil increased its water
    retention performance. The WR in the control soil was about 47% on the 5th day,
    reached 3.6% on the 24th day, whereas, the WR of the soil mixed with nWTF1 and
    nWTF2 was 74.40% and 83.01% on the 5th day and reached 20.41% and 33.38% on the
    24th day respectively. After 26 days, the water content of the control soil was
    almost evaporated whereas nWTF1 and nWTF2 fertilizer treatments showed WR values
    of 12.70% and 20.69% respectively after 60 days. It is quite clear that the nano-enabled
    fertilizers used effectively improved water retention capacity of the soil and
    slowed down water evaporation with nWTF2 being the most efficient due its highest
    content of nWTR43. Therefore, nWTF2 can extend irrigation cycles, and enhance
    drought tolerance of plants. Similar results have been reported by using slow-release
    urea fertilizer based starch and hydrogel44. Figure 7 Water retention behavior
    of soil without and with nano-enabled fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2). Error bars
    correspond to mean ± standard error of the mean. Full size image Release behavior
    of nano-enabled fertilizer (NEF) in water Nutrient release curve is a key feature
    characterizing the nutrients efficient release performance of NEF. The release
    behaviors of P, K and Mg from the prepared NEF were examined in water. Figure
    8a–c shows that the release rates of P, K and Mg from control (standard sources,
    KH2PO4 + MgONP) were much faster than the released rates of P, K and Mg from the
    NEF. The released rates of P from control, nWTF1 and nWTF2 in water reached 30.24%,
    22.56% and 13.14% respectively within 192 h (Fig. 8a). For K release, the cumulative
    rate of K released from C was about 28.74% within 192 h in distilled water (Fig.
    8b) as compared to 18.82% and 17.79% of K released from nWTF1 and nWTF2 respectively
    within the same time frame. For Mg release, the Mg cumulative percentage released
    from control was about 100% within 192 h in distilled water whereas, the cumulative
    release percentages from nWTF1 and nWTF2 at the same time interval were 63.11%
    and 46.79% respectively (Fig. 8C). The long duration of P–K–Mg released from tested
    fertilizers increased with increasing nWTR content. These results demonstrate
    the potential use of nWTF1 and nWTF2 as promising sustained release fertilizers
    with nWTF2 being the most efficient. Figure 8 Cumulative release of P (A), K (B)
    and Mg (C) from control and NEF in water. Full size image Nutrients release behavior
    of nano-enabled fertilizer (NEF) in soil The release behaviors of P–K–Mg from
    control and prepared NEF were examined in soil column experiment and the results
    are presented in Fig. 9. The nutrients studied (P–K–Mg) were added to the sandy
    soil in the form of NEF (nWTF1& nWTF2) to improve nutrients availability to plants
    through alleviating nutrients loss by leaching and enhancing soil nutrient retention45,46,47.
    Figure 9 Cumulative release of P (A), K (B) and Mg (C) from control and NEF in
    soil. Full size image The results in Fig. 9 show that the released rates of P,
    K and Mg from control, nWTF1 and nWTF2 in soil were much lower than those in soil.
    The phosphorus cumulative release percentages from control, nWTF1 and nWTF2 in
    soil have reached 22.41%, 8.12 and 4.51% respectively within 384 h (Fig. 9a).
    Meanwhile, the cumulative ratio of K released from control was about 35.71% within
    16 days (384 h.) in soil leachate as shown in Fig. 9b which is almost 5 and 7.7
    times higher than that of nWTF1 (6.90%) and nWTF2 (4.65%) respectively. Moreover,
    The Mg cumulative percentage released from control in soil leachate was about
    47.01% within 384 h, whereas the cumulative release percentages of Mg from nWTF1
    and nWTF2 at the same time interval were 33.78% and 24.82% respectively, shown
    in Fig. 9c. Remarkably, the cumulative release percentages of P, K and Mg in soil
    leachate were in the following order: Classical fertilizers >> nWTF1 > nWTF2.
    It is therefore concluded that nWTF2 exhibits a preferable sustained-release property
    and is considered a promising efficient and sustainable alternative to substitute
    classical P, K and Mg fertilizers. In addition to the encouraging features of
    using nWTF2 rather than classical fertilizers to deliver nutrients, the nWTR carrier
    used is safe, eco-friendly, and adaptable to soil, plants, and other organisms.
    The excellent P–K–Mg efficient-release achievement is accredited to the characteristics
    of the nWTR carrier, including high water retention and electrostatic attraction
    for K and Mg, the interaction between potassium hydrogen phosphates and Al & Fe
    oxyhydroxides groups on the surface of nWTR and formation of (Al- and Fe) complexes
    as well as H-bonds formation during the KH2PO4 and MgO loading process. Elkhatib
    et al.16 reported that very small percentage (< 3.5%) of P was released from P-saturated
    nWTRs demonstrating P stability in P-nWTR system. The excellent adsorption capability
    of nWTR for inorganic pollutants indicates its potential applicability as a carrier
    for plant nutrients. Kinetics and modeling of P, K, and Mg release from NEF in
    water and soil In the present study, the released data obtained from leaching
    experiments in water and soil were used to assess the suitability of various kinetic
    models (first order, Elovich, parabolic diffusion and power function) to describe
    the kinetics of P, K and Mg release from water and soil amended with NEF. To obtain
    proper information from kinetic models and their parameters, the used models must
    properly fitted to the experimental data. If results are fitted with lower errors,
    the release process can be better interpreted. Quality fitting can only be achieved
    in linear and nonlinear models by calculating the standard error of estimates
    (SE) for the models used. Thus the validation of the used kinetic models was based
    on determination coefficient (R2) and standard error of estimate (SE)17,27. The
    experimental release data of P, K, and Mg from NEF in water and soil were modeled
    using four kinetic models to understand macronutrients release kinetics and to
    predict the release rate. The four kinetic models tested and its parameters together
    with R2 and SE values are displayed in Tables 1, 2 and 3. The experimental data
    of P, K, and Mg best fitted the power function model with the determination coefficient
    (R2) between 0.964 and 0.995 and SE between 0.017 and 0.115 for P, R2 between
    0.967 and 0.993 and SE between 0.017 and 0.115 for K and (R2) between 0.938 and
    0.992 and SE between 0.028 and 0.066 for Mg. The power function model has shown
    the lowest SE values which indicates that this model is the most suitable model
    for describing the P, K and Mg kinetics release data from NEF and conventional
    fertilizers in water and soil (Tables 1, 2, 3 and Fig. 10). In the power function
    model the reversibly P, K and Mg adsorbed phases are mainly related to the initial
    concentration of P, K and Mg and are proportional to the fractional power of time
    and controlled by the desorption mechanism48,49,50. The values of apparent desorption
    rate coefficients (Kd) of power function model for P, K and Mg are presented in
    Tables 1, 2 and 3. In general, desorption rate coefficient “Kd” values of conventional
    fertilizers were the highest in comparison with NEF. For all the studied treatments,
    P, K and Mg release followed the order: conventional fertilizers > nWTF1 > nWTF2.
    The difference in the effect of studied treatments on macronutrients release is
    related to the amount of nWTR content in the prepared NEF. In our previous studies20,
    we have shown the high P adsorption capability of nWTR. Approximately 95% of P
    was rapidly adsorbed within 100 min of adsorption forming chemically stable phosphate
    phases (inner-sphere complexes) and facilitating slow P removal from the systems.
    The low Kd values obtained from nWTF2 in the current study suggests its use as
    a very promising and practical solution to improve fertilizer use efficiency.
    Figure 10 Release kinetics model of P (A), K (B) and Mg (C) in water and P (D),
    K (E) and Mg (F) in soil. Full size image Comparison of P and K sustained release
    from nWTR fertilizers and the other fertilizers The release of P and K from nano
    enabled fertilizers (nWTF 1 and nWTF2) is compared with different fertilizers
    reported in literature (Table 4). It can be seen that the nWTF2 outperformed all
    the listed fertilizers in controlling P and K release from soil and also outperform
    most of the listed fertilizers in controlling P and K release in water. Table
    4 Sustained release of P and K from nWTR fertilizers and the other fertilizers
    reported in literature. Full size table Plant growth parameters Data presented
    in Fig. 11 displayed that application of nano-enabled fertilizers (nWTF1and nWTF2)
    can have a significant impact on growth parameters of maize plants as compared
    to the commercial fertilizers (control). Both nWTF1and nWTF2 treatments gave the
    highest values of plant height (36 cm and 37.5 cm) respectively, whereas the lowest
    value (29.27 cm) was recorded with control (Fig. 11b). Additionally, nWTF1and
    nWTF2 treatments exhibited the highest values of shoots fresh, shoots dry and
    roots fresh weights (1.44 g and 1.52 g), (0.12 g and 0.13 g) and (0.53 g and 0.68
    g) respectively as compared to control (1.10 g, 0.11 g and 0.43 g) respectively
    (Fig. 11d,e). In contrast, the highest value of stem diameter was recorded with
    nWTF1 treatment (3.37 mm) followed by nWTF2 treatment (3.17 mm) (Fig. 11c). The
    phosphorus content in maize shoot and root tissues under nWTF2 treatment achieved
    the highest P concentrations in shoots (0.29%) and in roots (0.187%), followed
    by nWTF1 treatment (0.26% in shoots and 0.184% in roots). The lowest P content
    in shoots (0.21%) and in roots (0.13%) was recorded in control treatment plants
    (Fig. 12a). The use of nWTF1and nWTF2 proved to be effective in improving plant
    growth and significantly (p < 0.05) increased phosphorus content in maize plants
    (Figs. 11 and 12). Figure 11 (a) Picture of maize (corn) plants at 25 days (b)

    and root tissues. Full size image Our results are consistent with Hassani et al.58
    who reported that application of nano-fertilizer to peppermint (Mentha piperta
    L.) resulted in the greatest number of branches and leaves, highest wet and dry
    weight of leaves, wet and dry weight of stems and wet and dry weight of plant.
    As described by Usman et al.59, the use of nano fertilizers lowers eutrophication,
    allows fertilizers to reach their intended location more efficiently, accelerates
    seed germination which resulting in a high yield in a short period of time. Thus
    nano-fertilizers are considered as smart delivery systems with distinct role in
    crop production. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential use of the
    nano-enabled fertilizer (nWTF1and nWTF2) for enhanced plant growth and sustainable
    controlled release of nutrients. The use of nWTR as a carrier in the produced
    NEF not only reduces waste but also provides an environmentally friendly alternative
    to traditional chemical fertilizers and can additionally be utilized to manufacture
    value-added products as climate-smart environmental solution. Further studies
    are needed to investigate its long-term effect on crop yield and to optimize the
    preparation of nano-enabled fertilizers accordingly. Conclusion Promising nano-enabled
    fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2) were produced by impregnation of nanostructured
    water treatment residual (nWTR) with (KH2PO4 + MgO) at 1:1 and 3:1 (w/w) ratios
    respectively using a planetary ball mill. Application of the produced nano-fertilizers
    to the sandy soil effectively improved the capacity of the sandy soil to retain
    water during the 60 days study with nWTR2 being the most efficient. The water
    content of the control soil was almost evaporated after 26 days, whereas the soil
    treated with nWTF2 fertilizer showed water retention value of 20.69% after 60
    days. The leaching behavior study demonstrated that nWTF2 significantly controlled
    P–K–Mg nutrients release due to its lowest leaching losses of P–K–Mg (4.5–4.7–24.8%)
    respectively in comparison with nWTR1 (8.1–6.9–33.8%) and classical fertilizer
    (22.4–35.7–47%). These results showed that the nano-enabled fertilizers exhibited
    a sustained release of nutrients, with a gradual decline in the release rate over
    time. This is a significant advantage over traditional fertilizers, which release
    nutrients quickly and can lead to leaching and nutrients losses. The low standard
    error (SE) values of power function model verified its high potentiality to predict
    NEF release data and ascertained that the reversibly P, K and Mg adsorbed phases
    were mainly related to the initial concentration of P, K & Mg and were proportional
    to the fractional power of time. The obtained results from pilot experiment on
    zea maize plants revealed that the nano-enabled fertilizers (nWTF1 and nWTF2)
    significantly promoted growth, and P content compared with the commercial chemical
    fertilizer treated plants. The pilot experiment was carried out to evaluate the
    effect of the proposed NEF on growth and nutrient (P) content of maize plants
    within a short time period of 25 days after fertilizers application. We highly
    recognize that field trials are necessary to investigate the long-term impacts
    of the proposed NEF on growth and productivity of corn and other plants. Therefore,
    long term future studies at pot and field scale should be conducted to assess
    plant productivity, nutrients availability together with their environmental impacts.

  description: Grassland ecosystems store approximately one-third of the global terrestrial
    carbon stocks, which play a crucial role in regulating the carbon cycle on regional
    and global scales, but the current scientific understanding of the variation in
    net carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) on grassland ecosystems is still limited. Based
    on the eddy covariance technique, this study investigated the seasonal variation
    of ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP) from 2018 to
    2020 in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau in northwest China. The results
    indicated that the annual cumulative average NEE value was − 0.778 kg C/m2, the
    growing season cumulative value accounted for approximately 83.81%, which suggested
    that the semiarid grassland showed a notable soil carbon sink. The correlation
    analysis revealed that soil temperature (Ts) (RReco = 0.71, RGPP = 0.61) and soil
    water content (SWC) (RReco = 0.47, RGPP = 0.44) were the two main driving factors
    in modulating the variation of daily average GPP and Reco (P < 0.01). Therefore,
    the monthly average of GPP and Reco increased with the increase in Ts (RGPP =
    0.716, P < 0.01; RReco = 0.586, P < 0.05), resulting in an increase in the carbon
    sequestration capacity of the grass ecosystem. This study also showed that soil
    moisture has a promoting effect on the response of Reco and GPP to Ts, and the
    correlation among GPP, Reco, and Ts was much stronger under wet conditions. For
    instance, the coefficient of determination of Reco and GPP with Ts under wet conditions
    in 2018 increased by 0.248 and 0.286, respectively, compared to those under droughty
    conditions. Additionally, the temperature sensitivity of Reco (Q10) increased
    by 46.13% compared to dry conditions. In addition, carbon exchange models should
    consider the synergistic effect of Ts and SWC as one of the main driving factors
    for theoretical interpretation or modeling. Under the potential scenario of future
    global warming and the frequent extreme weather events, our findings have important
    implications for predicting future CO2 exchange and establishing an optimal ecological
    model of carbon flux exchange.

    Grassland ecosystems cover approximately 40.5% of the Earth’s land surface excluding
    Greenland and Antarctica and store about one-third of the global terrestrial carbon
    stocks. These ecosystems play a crucial role in regulating the carbon budget balance
    and carbon cycle processes on both regional and global scales1. Grassland areas
    experience cold winters and warm summers, characterized by low precipitation and
    high evaporation rates. According to various hydrothermal conditions, grasslands
    can be classified into four types: desertification grasslands, meadow grasslands,
    shrubland grasslands, and typical grasslands2. Grassland ecosystems around the
    world are primarily located in arid and semiarid regions, making them highly susceptible
    to global climate change3. These ecosystems have a short growth cycle, a rapid
    renewal rate, and relatively fragile productive capacity4. Ahlström et al. combined
    an ensemble of ecosystem and land-surface models with an empirical observation-based
    gross primary production (GPP) product, and demonstrated that the carbon sink
    of global terrestrial ecosystem was mainly dominated by tropical forests5. Whereas
    the trend and interannual variability of the sink are dominated by semi-arid ecosystems
    whose carbon balance was strongly linkage with general circulation-driven variations
    in both precipitation and temperature. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding
    of the seasonal variation patterns and mechanisms of carbon flux exchange characteristics
    is crucial for accurately assessing the regional carbon budget balance in different
    grassland types in semi-arid regions. Net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) mainly
    refers to the changes in carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the
    atmosphere. It is influenced by factors such as plant photosynthesis, carbon storage
    in the canopy air, and carbon emissions from biological and abiotic respiration
    consumption in the ecosystem. It is determined by ecosystem respiration (Reco)
    and GPP6,7. Reco includes plant autotrophic respiration and soil microbial decomposition
    of soil organic matter, as well as litter respiration flux8. GPP refers to the
    quantity of organic matter produced by the fixation of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis
    in green plants, measured per unit of time and area9. Many studies have shown
    that various environmental factors, including both biological and abiotic factors,
    can affect the exchange of carbon flux in grasslands10,11,12. These environmental
    factors include air temperature, soil temperature (Ts), precipitation (Pre), soil
    water content (SWC), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and surface cover characteristics.
    The different environmental factors that control carbon flux exchange have different
    influences on different time scale. Niu et al. studied the carbon fluxes of a
    desertification grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. They examined the responses
    of these fluxes to environmental factors on different time scales using random
    forest models and correlation analysis. The study found that photosynthetic photon
    flux density and soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm were important environmental
    factors in controlling the daily variation of NEE and GPP in most integration
    periods, whereas Ts and SWC were more important for Reco13. In meadow grasslands,
    photosynthetic active radiation is a dominant factor that affects the daily variation
    of NEE. However, in typical grasslands, shallow soil water content (at 5 cm depth)
    also plays a significant role in the daily variation of NEE14. Jia et al. investigated
    the seasonal and interannual fluctuations in Reco and its correlation with temperature,
    soil moisture, and GPP in a temperate semi-arid shrubland located in northern
    China. They believed that low soil moisture had little effect on Reco when Ta
    was below 15 °C, but it led to smaller Reco rates when Ta was above 15 °C15. The
    temperature range (or other environmental conditions) should be considered when
    examining the main and interactive effects of moisture and temperature on respiration.
    Leaf area index (LAI) was significantly positively correlated with Reco and GPP,
    whereas NEE was significantly negatively correlated with LAI. Shi suggested that
    the sink/pool relationship of the present ecosystem is largely influenced by rainfall,
    including its intensity and seasonal distribution16. For typical semi-arid grasslands,
    there have been many previous studies. For example, Yao et al. investigated the
    variations of NEE and the mechanism of environmental response on different time
    scales over the semiarid Loess Plateau in northwest China. They discovered that
    NEE was primarily influenced by soil moisture during the growing season, while
    soil temperature affected the changes in NEE during the dormant seasons17. Du
    et al. analyzed the carbon exchange characteristics and main environmental impact
    factors of grassland ecosystems in different locations over semi-arid regions.
    They indicated that the respiration of the ecosystems in semi-arid regions was
    primarily influenced by soil temperature and soil moisture. The start time, intensity,
    and temporal distribution of effective precipitation during the growing season
    jointly determine the function and the duration of net carbon absorption in semi-arid
    grassland ecosystem18. Some studies have also indicated that in certain semi-arid
    grasslands or under specific environmental conditions, there was no significant
    correlation between daily changes in carbon flux and photosynthetic active radiation
    or soil temperature19,20. These differences are due to the vast territory of China
    and the diverse natural and climatic conditions in different regions. Although
    previous studies have provided a foundation for studying the driving factors of
    carbon exchange in various grassland ecosystems, there is still a lack of understanding
    regarding the seasonal variation and dominant factors of carbon fluxes in the
    semi-arid typical grassland of the Loess Plateau in northwest China. Soil temperature
    and moisture are two key factors that regulate plant distribution and productivity21.
    It is generally believed that global warming will accelerate photosynthesis and
    respiration22, promoting plant productivity23. Fu indicated that photosynthesis
    plays a crucial role in regulating ecosystem respiration on different time scales24.
    Additionally, temperature affects plant growth and distribution through physiological
    processes like photosynthesis and respiration25,26,27. Appropriate moisture conditions
    are crucial for promoting carbon flux, dry soil may limit Reco by reducing the
    activity of plants and soil microorganisms, as well as by limiting the diffusion
    of enzymes and carbon substrates in the soil28,29. High SWC may also limit Reco
    by reducing the soil oxygen concentration and aerobic respiration rate of soil
    organisms30. The interaction between water and temperature also results in changes
    in the carbon flux response process22. Soil moisture not only affects the scale
    of the ecosystem or the rate of soil respiration, but it also modifies the response
    of respiration to temperature, and there is mounting evidence that the temperature
    sensitivity of respiration decreases with higher temperatures and lower soil moisture
    levels31,32,33,34. Quantifying the interactions between various driving factors,
    especially temperature and humidity, on carbon fluxes is crucial for making more
    accurate predictions about the impact of climate change on carbon neutrality15.
    Based on the aforementioned issues, we conducted a three-year continuous observation
    on NEE from 2018 to 2020 over the semi-arid grassland of the Loess Plateau in
    northwest China. During this period, we also estimated Reco and GPP. The main
    objectives of this paper were to evaluate: (1) the daily, seasonal, and interannual
    variations of carbon fluxes (GPP, Reco, and NEE), and (2) the combined effects
    of Ts, SWC, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), VPD, precipitation, and
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on carbon exchange. We hypothesized
    that the semi-arid grassland is a moderate carbon sink within the ecosystem. And
    in addition to temperature and moisture, there are other factors that play a significant
    role in the changes in carbon fluxes, as previous studies have shown that the
    univariate linear regression results of temperature and moisture with carbon exchange
    were not satisfactory. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between
    carbon exchange capacity and environmental factors in the region would complement
    the research on the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems under global climate
    change, and provide an essential support and a theoretical basis for a thorough
    understanding of ecological reconstruction and restoration in practice, as well
    as for solving these problems. Materials and methods Site description The experimental
    site is situated at the Semiarid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou
    University (SACOL), located on the top of Cuiying Mountain in Yuzhong Campus of
    Lanzhou University in Yuzhong County, Gansu Province (Lat.:35.946 °N, Lon.:104.133
    °E, elevation 1965.8 m) (see Fig. 1). It belongs to semi-arid continental climate
    with annual mean air temperature of 6.7 °C and annual sunshine duration of about
    2600 h. The average annual precipitation here is 382 mm, mainly from June to October.
    The annual evaporation is 1343 mm, with a frost free period of 90–140 days. The
    study area is characterized by typical residual hills, ridges, and gullies on
    the Loess Plateau, with a typical semi-arid grassland vegetation type. The average
    height of herbaceous vegetation in autumn is about 30 cm, followed by summer with
    an average height of 24 cm, the vegetation coverage reaches about 80% in summer
    and autumn, and the average plant height in spring is 15 cm. In winter, as the
    grassland vegetation evolves, the average plant height is only about 10 cm. The
    vegetation types are mainly Artemisia frigida, Stipa, and wild chrysanthemums,
    accompanied by some Camellia sinensis and dwarf wild cassia35,36,37. Figure 1

    was installed since 2017 to monitor the fluxes of CO2, water vapour, energy, and
    momentum. It consisted of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell,
    USA) and an open-path CO2/H2O infrared gas analyzer (LI-7500, LI-COR, USA) mounted
    at 2.88 m above ground, the anemometer and the infrared gas analyzer supply digital
    output of the fluctuations in 3-D wind velocity, sonic temperature, water vapor
    and CO2 densit38. The data was collected with the frequency of 10 Hz, and the
    averaged values were calculated every 30 min, which would be stored in the data
    logger. The gas analyzers are calibrated by technical engineers using professional
    equipment in every spring to calibrate CO2, water vapor, and dew point values.
    Along with the flux measurements obtained by the EC system, this study continuously
    measured standard meteorological and soil parameters with an array of sensors.
    Air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a temperature and relative
    humidity probe (HMP45C-L, Vaisala, Finland) mounted on the tower at the height
    of 2.0 m, then calculated the VPD according to those measurements. Soil temperature
    (STP01-L, Hukseflux, USA) and soil moisture (CS616-L, Campbell, USA) were measured
    at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 cm beneath the ground surface. A spectral reflectance
    sensor (SRS-NDVI, DECAGON, USA) was installed at 4 m above ground level for measuring
    NDVI. Precipitation was measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge at 0.3 m (52,202,
    Young, USA), each turn of the tipping bucket measured 0.1 mm precipitation. PAR
    was measured at 1.5 m above the ground, using a quantum sensor (LI-190R, LI-COR,
    USA). The instruments and measurement parameters used in this study are listed
    in Table 1 36,39,40. All times reported in this article are in the Beijing time
    zone (Greenwich Mean Time + 8). The above instruments were installed in August
    2017, the operation, calibration, and maintenance of the all instruments used
    followed the manufacturers’ standard procedures. Table 1 The key instruments and
    measurements at SACOL during the whole period. Full size table Data processing
    and quality control Half-hourly NEE was calculated using EddyPro software (LI-COR,
    Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) based on the 10 Hz raw data (Details can be referred to
    https://www.licor.com/env/products/eddy_covariance/software.html). The following
    processing procedures were applied: (1) de-spiking: eliminate outliers that are
    far beyond reasonable values and have obvious errors due to instrument failures,
    weather effects, and random noise; (2) coordinate rotation: rotate the two-dimensional
    coordinate axis and calculate a series of statistics such as mean, pulsation,
    variance, and covariance, Then calculate the preliminary results of turbulent
    flux; (3) necessary corrections to the flux: such as density fluctuation correction
    (WPL)–the Webb, Pearman and Leuning density correction for effects of air density
    fluctuations on CO2 fluxes–to adjust air density changes caused by heat and water
    vapor fluctuations41, etc.; (4) quality control of flux data: including physical
    reasonable range testing, turbulence stationarity testing, and adequacy testing
    of turbulence development42, providing the flag “0” for high-quality fluxes, “1”
    for intermediate quality fluxes, and “2” for poor quality fluxes. Only fluxes
    flagged with “0” or “1” were adopted for further analysis. Based on the turbulence
    flux data obtained from the above processing, this study follows the standard
    correction method proposed by Papale et al. to perform data quality control on
    the NEE data of the site43. Positive value for NEE indicates that the region emits
    CO2 flux into the atmosphere, whereas negative value indicates that the region
    absorbs CO2 flux from the atmosphere. Due to instrument failures and outlier data
    often resulting in missing observational data, it is necessary to fill in the
    missing data in order to examine the carbon balance of ecosystems. Two methods
    were used to fill in the missing data. Linear interpolation was used for gaps
    of 2 h or less, and the data gaps of less than 2d were filled using MDV method44
    (mean diurnal variation), while the data gaps of greater than 2d were considered
    missing value and would not be filled in. After filling in NEE data, we could
    calculate the corresponding Reco and GPP. We assumed that GPP is zero at nighttime,
    and the NEE between nighttime vegetation and atmosphere only comes from ecosystem
    respiration: $$NEE_{night} = {\\text{Re}} co_{night} .$$ (1) Ecosystem respiration
    Reco can be defined as: $${\\text{Re}} co = {\\text{Re}} co_{night} + {\\text{Re}}
    co_{day} = NEE_{night} + {\\text{Re}} co_{day} ,$$ (2) wherein, Reconight and
    Recoday are ecosystem respiration at night and during the day respectively. By
    fitting NEE nighttime data on a monthly basis and using the Reco function relationship
    established using nighttime Reco data, daytime Reco data can be obtained33. Reco
    is mainly influenced by soil temperature and soil moisture45. This study uses
    (3) to fit the relationship between nighttime Reco and soil temperature and soil
    moisture, and uses 1-month time window18: $${\\text{Re}} co = a \\times e^{{\\left(
    {b \\times T_{{\\text{s}}} } \\right)}} \\times SWC^{c} .$$ (3) Among them, SWC
    is the soil water content, Ts is the soil temperature, and a, b, and c are the
    parameters to be fitted. Temperature sensitivity (Q10) is usually used to quantitatively
    describe the dependence of soil respiration process on soil temperature. The Reco
    was first parameterized with a traditional Q10 model to fit the soil temperature
    at 5 cm depth44,46: $${\\text{Re}} co = a \\times e^{{b \\times T_{{\\text{s}}}
    }} ,$$ (4) where a and b are regression coefficients. The respiratory temperature
    sensitivity coefficient (Q10) is: $$Q_{10} = e^{10 \\times b} .$$ (5) The GPP
    of an ecosystem can be defined as Ref.47: $$GPP = {\\text{Re}} co - NEE.$$ (6)
    The VPD was calculated by the measurements of air temperature (Ta) and relative
    humidity (RH)48: $$VPD = 0.611 \\times e^{{\\frac{17.27 \\times Ta}{{Ta + 237.3}}}}
    \\times \\left( {1 - RH} \\right).$$ (7) Results and discussion Meteorological
    conditions In the graph depicting changes in SWC at depths of 5, 10, 20, and 40
    cm due to precipitation events in the region from 2018 to 2020, notable interannual
    and seasonal fluctuations in both precipitation and SWC were observed. It is worth
    noting that the precipitation data was unavailable for the periods from May 24th,
    2018 to December 31st, 2018, and November 23rd, 2019 to February 17th, 2020 (Fig.
    2). The precipitation is primarily concentrated from May to October, representing
    over 90% of the total precipitation for the year. The precipitation process exhibits
    a relatively consistent phase with solar radiation and surface temperature, meaning
    that rain and heat occur during the same period. This synchronization is highly
    beneficial for vegetation photosynthesis, growth, and metabolism, and consequently,
    it has an impact on carbon control. The seasonal variation of SWC is significant,
    with the highest SWC occurring in the middle of the growing season and the dormant
    season from November to April of the following year, during which there will be
    several snowfall events. The changes in SWC are generally consistent with precipitation.
    However, the upper layers of soil show a great sensitivity and responsiveness
    to precipitation events compared to the deeper layers. After rainfall triggers
    a soil moisture pulse, SWC in the upper layers decays at a faster rate than in
    the deeper layers. But, except for a day or two after rainfall, SWC at the depth
    of 5 cm is always less than 10 cm for the rest of time. This may be attributed
    to the rapid evaporation rate of water in the upper layers of the soil. Overall,
    precipitation events greater than 5 mm can impact the moisture content of the
    surface soil moisture at a depth of 10 cm, while precipitation events greater
    than 10 mm can affect the soil moisture at a depth of 20 cm. Precipitation events
    greater than 20 mm can affect soil moisture at a depth of 40 cm, and this impact
    has a lag of about 2 days. Different precipitation intensities will have a significant
    impact on the root respiration, decomposition, and metabolism processes of grassland
    vegetation in semi-arid areas. This, in turn, will adjust the diurnal and seasonal
    changes in carbon exchange. Previous studies have shown that precipitation less
    than 5 mm in arid and semiarid areas primarily affects SWC in the near-surface
    soil, and that precipitation events greater than 5 mm can effectively supplement
    moisture in the root layer moisture at greater depths in a desert soil zone49
    These larger pulses are commonly referred to as \"effective precipitation\". Similar
    conclusion has been drawn on semi-arid grasslands. Figure 2 Time series of 30-min
    averaged soil volumetric water content (SWC in in m3m−3) at 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm,
    and 40 cm depths versus precipitation in mm/day at SACOL for (a) 2018, (b) 2019,
    and (c) 2020. Note that the precipitation data for June-December 2018 and from
    November 2019 to February are missing due to the instrument failure. Full size
    image It is worth noting that during the winter dormancy period, the SWC generally
    experiences a sudden increase in early March, reaching a maximum value of 0.15
    to 0.20 m3·m−3, and then gradually decreases over time until the end of April.
    This is mainly attributed to the continuous melting of frozen soil as the temperature
    gradually increases, which in turn increases the soil moisture content of different
    layers. Ts_5cm, VPD, and PAR displayed significant unimodal, intra-annual seasonality
    (Fig. 3). Interannual differences in meteorological variables were minimal, with
    an average daily Ts_5cm of 11.237 °C, and the average annual Ts_5cm were 11.09 ± 9.88,
    11.22 ± 9.39, and 11.4 ± 9.24 °C in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The maximum
    values of Ts_5cm and SWC_5cm in 2018 were higher than in other observation years
    (the maximum values of daily average Ts_5cm and SWC_5cm in 2018 were 27.984 °C
    and 0.344 m3 \\(\\cdot\\) m−3, respectively; in 2019, they were 26.521 °C and
    0.288 m3 \\(\\cdot\\) m−3; in 2020, they were 26.703 °C and 0.278 m3 \\(\\cdot\\)
    m−3). Throughout the observation period, the soil temperature stabilized above
    15 °C after entering the growing season in May. This temperature range is conducive
    to plant growth. The maximum values of Ts_5cm and SWC_5cm occurred during the
    middle of the growing season, namely July and August. VPD is an important indicator
    that reflects the level of atmospheric drought, ranging from 1.81 to 28.49 hPa
    and follows a unimodal distribution, it is typically high during the growing season
    and low during the dormant season. VPD is related to the moisture content of the
    air and also varies with changes in precipitation50. Research has shown that the
    meteorological factors that dominate the interannual variation of VPD in semi-arid
    areas are temperature and absolute humidity51, which is reflected in the correlation
    coefficients between shallow soil temperature and VPD from 2018 to 2020 in this
    study, which were 0.642, 0.699, and 0.762 (p < 0.001), respectively. The maximum
    PAR were 685.66, 628.4 and 702.96 µmol/(m2·s) in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.
    These levels were recorded during the growing period. Figure 3 Temporal evolution
    of daily mean (a) soil temperature at 5 cm depth (Ts in °C), (b) vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD in hPa), and (c) photosynthetic active radiation (PAR in μmolm−2

    different color lines. Light blue, yellow, and green lines show the years of 2018,
    2019, and 2020, respectively. Full size image Diurnal and seasonal variations
    of NEE, Reco, and GPP Strong seasonal variations in GPP, Reco, and NEE of the
    semiarid grassland on the Loess Plateau ecosystem were observed (Fig. 4, considering
    the growth of plants in the region during winter and the impact of low temperature
    on the quality of the instrument, this study did not use data from January and
    February of the observation years, and the shaded area corresponds to the growing
    period). Figure 4 Daily mean of carbon fluxes in μmolm−2 s−1 (NEE, Reco, and GPP)
    versus precipitation in mm/day at SACOL for (a) 2018, (b) 2019, and (c) 2020.
    The solid curve shows the 5-day running averages of the carbon fluxes. Full size
    image The CO2 release phenomena was most readily observed in winter and CO2 absorption
    was obvious in summer. This could be attributed to photosynthesis, which suggests
    that more plants are able to absorb more carbon during the growing season, in
    contrast to less photosynthesis occurring with fewer plants in the dormant season7.
    The period of high net CO2 uptake period occurred during the early growing season
    of 2019, which can be attributed to the higher amounts of rainfall that was experienced
    during the period. The NEE changes throughout 2019 and 2020 decreased in the early
    stage of the growing season, then began to rise in the middle of the growing season,
    and decreased again in winter, indicating an overall carbon sink state. The daily
    average NEE values are − 1.87, − 3.018 and − 2.93 g C/m2 for 2018, 2019, and 2020,
    respectively. The difference may be attributed to several factors, including the
    meteorological conditions of high temperature and humidity in the observation
    area in 2018, variations in the proportion and duration of missing data over the
    three-year observation period, or the influence of not taking into account the
    data from January and February. In general, GPP and Reco exhibit single-peak seasonal
    changes every year, reaching their maximum values in the summer. Due to the rise
    in temperature and increased photosynthesis, which has been shown to enhance plant
    productivity52, the carbon exchange process in ecosystems dominated by carbon
    absorption has accelerated. In September (during the late growing season), both
    Reco and GPP decrease as the plants age and the temperature drops. Similar results
    have been found in arid desert grassland53, temperate desert grassland54, and
    temperate semi-arid sandy grassland in China52. In the winter of 2019 and 2020,
    GPP showed a declining tendency at the beginning and then rose in late, while
    NEE showed the opposite trend (Fig. 4b,c). Maybe because at the end of the growing
    season in autumn, when plants begin to die and photosynthesis weakens, there is
    a decline in GPP and an increase in NEE. When deep winter arrived, the temperature
    continued to decrease, inhibiting respiration and causing GPP to exceed Reco.
    As a result, there was a decrease in NEE55. There was a study that has also shown
    that in winter, due to low air and soil temperatures, soil microorganisms, root
    respiration, and photosynthesis basically stop56. However, the solubility of CO2
    in water increases as the decrease of temperature. At this time, CO2 in soil pores
    is readily absorbed by soil moisture and accumulates in the permafrost layer.
    CO2 concentration in the atmosphere diffuses towards the soil due to its higher
    concentration compared to that in soil pores, resulting in negative NEE values
    during winter. On the other hand, in the winter of 2020, we observed a slight
    increase in photosynthetically effective radiation (Fig. 2c), which may have also
    contributed to the increase in GPP during that period. GPP increases after precipitation
    during the growing season. Precipitation promotes plant growth and provides better
    conditions for photosynthesis, leading to an increase in GPP. It means that the
    capacity of carbon sinks increases with higher levels of precipitation. The daily
    changes of GPP and NEE show an inverse \"U\" and \"U\" shaped variation curve
    (Fig. 5). During the daytime, as the light intensity increases, NEE gradually
    decreases (carbon absorption increases), reaching a negative value at 7:00 or
    8:00, and peaking at noon (12:00 to 14:00). Then, it gradually increases until
    sunset when the ecosystem transitions from net carbon absorption to net carbon
    release (18:00 or 19:00). The variation of NEE is asymmetric, with a greater decrease
    in carbon absorption rate before reaching the peak than after reaching the peak.
    Because the photosynthesis process ceases to occur at night and respiration produces
    CO2 from the ecosystem, the ecosystem becomes a net source of CO2. With average
    overnight NEE values of 1.354, 1.182, and 1.181 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s) during
    the three years of observation, and average daytime NEE values of − 3.347, − 3.662,
    and − 3.7681 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s). Taking into account both daytime and nighttime
    carbon dioxide fluxes, the ecosystem was found to be a net carbon dioxide sink
    on a daily basis. Figure 5 Diurnal variations of (a) one year-round average, (b)
    growing-season average, and (c) dormant-season average carbon fluxes in μmolm−2
    s−1 (NEE, Reco, and GPP) at SACOL for 2018 (top pannel), 2019 (middle pannel,
    (d–f)), and 2020 (bottom panel, (g–i)), repectively. Full size image During the
    growing season, nighttime Reco is slightly higher than daytime Reco (the average
    daytime Reco values were 2.763, 2.22, and 2.183 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s) for 2018,
    2019, and 2020, the corresponding nighttime Reco values were 3.048, 2.724, and
    2.5 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s) respectively). There may be two reasons for this
    phenomenon: Firstly, soil respiration is dependent on photosynthesis, as the litter
    and root exudates released by plants are crucial for microbial metabolism. However,
    the carbon sequestered by photosynthesis is transported to the roots after a few
    hours and released through rhizosphere respiration at night57,58. Secondly, during
    the day, the air temperature is higher than the soil temperature, and the gas
    pressure is also higher. This can suppress the emission of soil CO2. But the soil
    temperature at night is higher than the air temperature, which facilitates the
    diffusion and release of soil CO259,60. The daily dynamics of NEE, GPP, and Reco
    in the dormant season are similar to those in the growing season, but the intensity
    of NEE and GPP in the dormant season is lower than that in the growing season.
    The peak values of NEE, GPP, and Reco during the observation period were − 4.27,
    5.766, and 1.774 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s), respectively, which were significantly
    lower than the values during the growing season, which were − 6.955, 9.317, and
    3.541 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s). The variation of Reco is a horizontal line approximately,
    but the respiration rate during the day is slightly higher than at night. Also
    observed from Fig. 5 is that overnight Reco was much higher during the growing
    season than during the dormant season, highlighting the importance of photosynthetic
    activity on the ecosystem respiration. Some studies have shown that semi-arid
    grasslands have a significant carbon uptake function17,18,61. In this study, the
    average daily NEE were -0.492, -0.806 and -0.75 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s) in 2018,
    2019 and 2020 (The significant difference in daily NEE between 2018 and other
    observed years may be due to excessive missing data during the dormant season).
    The average peak value during its observation period is -5.316 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\)
    s). The carbon absorption capacity of the semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau
    is higher than that of the Mongolian typical temperate continental short-grass
    steppe62 (the peak hourly value of NEE was -3.6 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s)) and
    the Horqin semiarid sandy land60 (the daily average of NEE is 0.14 ± 0.04 g C/(m2
    \\(\\cdot\\) d)), but lower than the Mediterranean grazed grassland opening in
    a region of oak/grass woodland in California33 (the maximum value of NEE was −
    4.8 g C/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) d)), the typical steppe in Inner Mongolia3 (the mean
    of NEE was − 0.95 ± 0.31 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\) s)) and the semiarid desert steppe
    in northern China63 (the seasonal means of NEE was  − 3.09 µmol/(m2 \\(\\cdot\\)
    s)). Moreover, the carbon absorption capacity of grasslands in arid areas is significantly
    weaker than that in humid areas64,65,66,67. These differences may be due to differences
    in environmental factors such as radiation, temperature, and moisture, and on
    the other hand, plant species are also important factors affecting grassland ecosystem
    photosynthesis52. Effects of environmental factors on NEE, Reco, and GPP The carbon
    fluxes of the ecosystem are influenced by multiple environmental variables that
    primarily affect the biological and physical processes67. Based on the characteristics
    of single peak interannual variations similar to temperature in Reco and GPP,
    we have reason to speculate that soil temperature will have a significant impact
    on these two carbon fluxes (Figs. 3c and 4). The correlation analysis (Figs. 6,
    7, 8) reveals the relationship between the daily average of environmental factors
    and carbon flux in different seasons. GPP and Reco were positively correlated
    with Ts_5cm for most of the time, Ts can explain 11.56–33.64% of the growing season
    Reco changes (p < 0.01) and 17.64% to 25% of the GPP changes (p < 0.01). In contrast,
    there was a weak negative correlation between NEE and Ts_5cm during the growing
    season of 2019 and 2020. This indicates that the response of GPP to Ts during
    the growing season was greater than that of Reco to Ts60 (Table 2). Similar results
    were also found in alpine meadows55. However, the impact of temperature on net
    carbon absorption is generally not significant, as indicated by low partial correlation
    coefficient and poor P-values, which is consistent with previous studies17,22.
    GPP and Reco are mostly positively correlated with SWC, while NEE in the growing
    season is negatively correlated with SWC. These results indicate that higher Ts
    and lower water stress during the growing season are beneficial for CO2 absorption,
    while higher soil temperature during the dormant season may reduce net CO2 absorption.

    and GPP) and environmental factors (Ts_5cm, SWC_5cm, PAR, NDVI, VPD) for the growing

    in 2018. The white square shows there is missing data. * denotes a significance

    Full size image Table 2 Linear regression equations between carbon fluxes (Reco
    and GPP) and soil temperature at 5 cm depth (Ts) at SACOL during the growing season
    from 2018 to 2020. Full size table PAR, NDVI, and precipitation are negatively
    correlated with the daily average of NEE in most years and seasons. VPD and NEE
    showed a highly significant negative correlation (p < 0.01) during the growing
    seasons of 2019 and 2020, as well as throughout the entire year. In most years
    during the growing season, there is a strong positive correlation (p < 0.01) between
    PAR and NDVI with Reco and GPP. The high significance of PAR during the dormant
    season on GPP may prove that, as mentioned earlier, the abnormal increase in GPP
    in the winter of 2020 was indeed influenced by PAR. PAR and NDVI both indirectly
    affect NEE by influencing GPP and Reco. VPD has a significant impact on the daily
    average Reco and GPP during the observation period, especially during the growing
    season (p < 0.01). From the calculation formula, it can be observed that VPD is
    more influenced by air temperature, so the relationship between VPD and temperature
    and carbon exchange is relatively consistent. Studies have shown a general upward
    trend in global VPD over the past 10 years68, and VPD in the semi-arid region
    of northwest China is relatively high compared to other regions51. We speculate
    that in the future, as drylands continue to expand69, VPD may have a significant
    impact on global carbon sequestration. Carbon fluxes are affected by numerous
    complex and interconnected environmental factors, which exhibit significant variations
    across different time scales12,70. The increase in precipitation enhances soil
    moisture in the semi-arid area, stimulates plant growth and microbial activity,
    and promotes the transfer of carbon from aboveground plant components to the roots.
    During the growing season, GPP and Reco were positively correlated with Pre, while
    NEE was negatively correlated with Pre (Fig. 9e). The response of soil moisture
    to precipitation during the growing season is sensitive (Fig. 2). NEE and SWC_5cm
    showed a negative correlation, but GPP and Reco were positively correlated with
    SWC_5cm. Additionally, GPP was found to be more sensitive to soil water availability
    compared to Reco. It showed different slopes when plotting the linear fitting
    diagram (Fig. 9a), which is consistent with the research results of semi-arid
    temperate grasslands71 and desert grasslands72. That is because the main impact
    factors on NEE and GPP are plants, changes in Reco are mainly influenced by the
    carbon availability of the soil carbon pool and microbial activity73. On semi-arid
    grasslands, plant roots are typically found in the topsoil layer, therefore the
    deep soil water supply of grasses is limited, and GPP is more limited by drought
    than Reco74. As for soil temperature, there is a significant positive correlation
    between GPP and Reco and soil temperature during the growing season (Fig. 9b).
    The correlation between the monthly average value of PAR and carbon fluxes (NEE,
    Reco, and GPP) are not significant (Fig. 9c). Figure 9 Relationship between monthly
    carbon fluxes (NEE, Reco, and GPP) and environmental factors at SACOL during the
    growing seasons from 2018 to 2020, (a) SWC_5cm, (b) Ts_5cm, (c) PAR, (d) VPD,
    (e) precipitation, and (f) NDVI. The light blue, yellow, and green solid lines
    represent the optimal linear fitted lines for NEE, Reco, and GPP, respectively.
    Full size image VPD is negatively correlated with NEE, possibly due to the sensitivity
    of stomata to VPD75, which leads to stomatal closure under drought conditions.
    The coefficient of determination between VPD and NEE is greater than that of temperature,
    indicating that VPD is more influential than Ts in driving NEE under drought conditions.
    Both GPP and Reco show a positive correlation with VPD, but neither variable is
    statistically significant. this indicates that VPD is not the primary factor influencing
    the monthly values of Reco and GPP during the growing season (Fig. 9d). This is
    contrary to the results in section \"Effects of environmental factors on NEE,
    Reco, and GPP\", this indicates that the short-term impact of VPD on carbon exchange
    abilities during the growing season is more important than the long-term impact.
    NDVI is positively correlated with GPP and Reco (Fig. 9e,f), and GPP has a stronger
    response to precipitation than Reco, indicating that changes in water availability
    have a greater impact on plants than on soil microorganisms. Therefore, the increase
    in GPP may be attributed to the increase in vegetation caused by precipitation
    (R = 0.439). During the growing season, the carbon sink capacity in the semi-arid
    area of the Loess Plateau increases with higher precipitation and decreases with
    lower precipitation. This study found that NDVI has a more significant impact
    on the monthly average of Reco and GPP compared to the daily average (Figs. 6,
    7, 8). This is evident from the coefficients of determination and P-values. This
    indicates that NDVI affects the long-term changes in carbon exchange capacity
    between these two carbon fluxes. In addition to SWC, Ts, precipitation, and biomass,
    Reco is also a significant factor in explaining GPP during the growing season76,77.
    The result of the linear regression model (Fig. 10) indicates that the contribution
    of GPP to the variation of Reco is 70.6%. Reco increases with the increase of
    GPP. Photosynthesis and respiration are tightly coupled processes, plant respiration
    relies on stored carbohydrates, while primary production supplies the carbon substrate
    for respiration. That is to say, photosynthetic products regulate the carbon cycle
    above and below the ground in semi-arid grasslands. Similar results have been
    observed in the semiarid desert steppe and shrubland of China6,15,63,72, the Mediterranean
    C3/C4 grassland33,78 and oak–grass savannah79. Figure 10 Relationship between
    monthly value of Reco and GPP at SACOL during the growing seasons from 2018 to
    2020. The blue solid line show the linear fitted line. Full size image The interaction
    between soil temperature and moisture and ecosystem carbon fluxes During the three
    years of observation, a highly significant positive linear relationship was found
    between Ts and SWC (2018: R = 0.53, p < 0.001; 2019: R = 0.551, p < 0.001; 2020:
    R = 0.561, p < 0.001). Low SWC occurs below 0 ℃, while medium SWC occurs between
    0 and 15–18 °C. High moisture conditions typically coincide with high temperature,
    while low temperatures and drought often occur simultaneously. Some studies predict
    that the interaction between moisture and temperature has a stronger impact on
    ecosystem carbon flux80,81. In most cases, Reco shows exponential growth with
    the increase of Ts (P < 0.01). When SWC < 0.1 m3 m−3, Reco slowly increases with
    the increase of Ts (average Q10 = 1.459 during the observation year). When SWC ≥ 0.2
    m3 m−3, Reco rapidly increases (Q10 = 2.132). This indicates that a low SWC can
    inhibit the sensitivity of Reco to Ts. Moreover, the correlation coefficient between
    GPP and Reco and Ts is higher when SWC is high (Fig. 11). Some studies show that
    drought conditions can lead to a decoupling of soil respiration and temperature29.
    That is to say, under drought conditions, carbon exchange is still very low even
    under suitable temperature conditions. As long as moisture conditions are favorable,
    GPP will rapidly increase with the increase in Ts. However, in this study, the
    impact of drought stress on GPP was not significant, but it did have an effect
    on Reco. This may be because the dry litter layer and upper soil are the sites
    for most heterotrophic respiration, whereas photosynthesis can draw water support
    from the roots in deeper soil82. Figure 11 The scattering plots of Reco versus
    Ts_5cm (top panel) and GPP versus Ts_5cm (bottom panel) under different soil moisture
    conditions at SACOL for 2018 (left), 2019 (middle), and 2020 (right), respectively.
    The red solid circles denote the dry soil conditions (SWC_5cm ≤ 0.10m3m−3). The
    blue solid circles denote the wet soil conditions (SWC_5cm ≥ 0.20m3m−3). The green
    solid circles denote the moderate wet soil conditions (0.10 m3m-3 < SWC_5cm < 0.20m3m−3).
    The solid curves indicate the corresponding fitted lines. Full size image In most
    cases, when the temperature is above zero, GPP and Reco are more sensitive to
    temperature than when it is below zero (Fig. 12). At the temperature above zero,
    the response of Reco and GPP to SWC in 2018 is minimally affected by different
    temperature conditions. Similarly, the response of GPP to SWC in 2019 and 2020
    is also unaffected by temperature conditions. High temperatures suppressed the
    response of Reco to SWC in 2019 and 2020, but no such phenomenon was observed
    in 2018. This difference may be related to the varying soil moisture conditions
    observed from 2018 to 2020. Therefore, appropriate SWC can alleviate low-temperature
    stress and maintain high GPP and Reco values. However, even under appropriate
    temperature conditions, as long as the SWC is low, GPP and Reco will be significantly
    inhibited. Therefore, from the perspective of ecosystem productivity, the potential
    harm of water stress on the GPP is greater than that of low-temperature stress83,
    which is consistent with the findings in alpine meadow50. Figure 12 The same as
    Fig. 11, except for the scattering plots of Reco versus SWC_5cm (top panel) and
    GPP versus SWC_5cm (bottom panel) under different soil moisture conditions at
    SACOL for 2018 (left), 2019 (middle), and 2020 (right), respectively. Full size
    image Water and temperature are often considered as two major abiotic factors
    that influence the ecosystem carbon exchange processes in grassland ecosystems21,33.
    During the growing season, the multiple linear regression results of carbon exchange
    and various meteorological factors (Ts_5cm, SWC_5cm, PAR, and VPD) from 2018 to
    2020, considering the interaction between temperature and moisture (Ts_5cm * SWC_5cm),
    showed a significant increase in the coefficient of determination of the models
    in these tables (Tables 3, 4 and 5) compared to the models that did not consider
    the interaction between temperature and humidity (not provided in the text). The
    increase in the coefficient of determination was particularly notable for Reco
    and GPP, and the majority of these models passed the significance test (p < 0.01).
    From these tables, it can be seen that the combination of multiple meteorological
    factors simultaneously explains the highest proportion of changes in Reco (up
    to 46.1%) and GPP (up to 33.87%). So, it is necessary to consider the interaction
    between SWC and Ts when establishing carbon exchange equations in the study region.

    fluxes (NEE, Reco and GPP) and environmental factors (Ts, SWC, PAR, VPD) at SACOL

    except for the growing season in 2019. Full size table Table 5 The same as Table
    3, except for the growing season in 2020. Full size table Conclusions Based on
    the eddy covariance technique, this study quantified the three-year-long carbon
    exchange fluxes over the Loess Plateau semi-arid grassland of northwest China.
    The study also analyzed the variations in these fluxes and identified the driving
    factors. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) The daily average
    NEE values were − 1.87, − 3.018, and − 2.93 g C/m2 for 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.
    The annual cumulative average NEE value was − 0.778 kg C/m2, and the cumulative
    value during the growing season accounted for approximately 83.81%. Overall, the
    semi-arid grassland was proven to be a moderate carbon sink within the ecosystem.
    (2) Ts_5cm and NDVI were identified as two significant environmental influencing
    the daily variation of Reco (RTs_5cm = 0.71, RNDVI = 0.71) and GPP (RTs_5cm = 0.71,
    RNDVI = 0.61) during most integration periods (p < 0.01). Additionally, NDVI had
    a strong indirect impact on NEE due to its high correlation with GPP. As for the
    monthly values, Ts_5cm and SWC_5cm showed significant positive correlations with
    Reco (RTs_5cm = 0.59, RSWC_5cm = 0.52) and GPP (RTs_5cm = 0.72, RSWC_5cm = 0.68)
    during the growing season (p < 0.01). However, apart from precipitation, the correlation
    between NEE and other driving factors was very weak. (3) Reco increased with GPP
    (R = 0.84, p < 0.001), indicating a strong coupling between photosynthetic C uptake
    and respiratory C loss, and photosynthetic products regulate the carbon cycle
    both above and below the ground in semi-arid grasslands. (4) Compared to dry soil
    conditions, the temperature sensitivity of Reco (Q10) under wet soil conditions
    increased by 46.13%, and the potential impact of water stress on the GPP was greater
    than that of low temperature stress. In addition, considering the interaction
    between soil temperature and soil moisture would help in constructing the carbon
    exchange calculation model. In the context of future dryland expansion, these
    results provide a valuable experience for future work in predicting and estimating
    carbon sources and sinks in typical semi-arid regions. To further confirm the
    impact of various environmental factors on different carbon fluxes, future research
    can integrate eddy covariance techniques, soil respiration measurements, and isotope
    analysis. This will allow for a more comprehensive analysis and examination of
    the relevant mechanisms and processes. Data availability The data that support
    the findings of this study will be available from the corresponding author, J.

  description: 'Background: Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infect more than a quarter
    of the world’s human population. In the absence of vaccines for most animal and
    human gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN), treatment of infections primarily relies
    on anthelmintic drugs, while resistance is a growing threat. Therefore, there
    is a need to find alternatives to current anthelmintic drugs, especially those
    with novel modes of action. The present work aimed to study the composition and
    anthelmintic activity of Combretum mucronatum leaf extract (CMLE) by phytochemical
    analysis and larval migration inhibition assays, respectively. Methods: Combretum
    mucronatum leaves were defatted with petroleum ether and the residue was extracted
    by ethanol/water (1/1) followed by freeze-drying. The proanthocyanidins and flavonoids
    were characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and ultra-high performance
    liquid chromatography (UPLC). To evaluate the inhibitory activity of this extract,
    larval migration assays with STH and GIN were performed. For this purpose, infective
    larvae of the helminths were, if necessary, exsheathed (Ancylostoma caninum, GIN)
    and incubated with different concentrations of CMLE. Results: CMLE was found to
    be rich in flavonoids and proanthocyanidins; catechin and epicatechin were therefore
    quantified for standardization of the extract. Data indicate that CMLE had a significant
    effect on larval migration. The effect was dose-dependent and higher concentrations
    (1000 µg/mL) exerted significantly higher larvicidal effect (P < 0.001) compared
    with the negative control (1% dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) and lower concentrations
    (≤ 100 µg/ml). Infective larvae of Ascaris suum [half-maximal inhibitory concentration
    (IC50) = 5.5 µg/mL], Trichuris suis (IC50 = 7.4 µg/mL), and A. caninum (IC50 =
    18.9 µg/mL) were more sensitive to CMLE than that of Toxocara canis (IC50 = 310.0 µg/mL),
    while infective larvae of Toxocara cati were largely unaffected (IC50 > 1000 µg/mL).
    Likewise, CMLE was active against most infective larvae of soil-transmitted ruminant
    GIN, except for Cooperia punctata. Trichostrongylus colubriformis was most sensitive
    to CMLE (IC50 = 2.1 µg/mL) followed by Cooperia oncophora (IC50 = 27.6 µg/mL),
    Ostertagia ostertagi (IC50 = 48.5 µg/mL), Trichostrongylus axei (IC50 = 54.7 µg/mL),
    Haemonchus contortus (IC50 = 145.6 µg/mL), and Cooperia curticei (IC50 = 156.6 µg/mL).
    Conclusions: These results indicate that CMLE exhibits promising anthelmintic
    properties against infective larvae of a large variety of soil-transmitted nematodes.

    Metrics Abstract Background Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infect more than
    a quarter of the world’s human population. In the absence of vaccines for most
    animal and human gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN), treatment of infections primarily
    relies on anthelmintic drugs, while resistance is a growing threat. Therefore,
    there is a need to find alternatives to current anthelmintic drugs, especially
    those with novel modes of action. The present work aimed to study the composition
    and anthelmintic activity of Combretum mucronatum leaf extract (CMLE) by phytochemical
    analysis and larval migration inhibition assays, respectively. Methods Combretum
    mucronatum leaves were defatted with petroleum ether and the residue was extracted
    by ethanol/water (1/1) followed by freeze-drying. The proanthocyanidins and flavonoids
    were characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and ultra-high performance
    liquid chromatography (UPLC). To evaluate the inhibitory activity of this extract,
    larval migration assays with STH and GIN were performed. For this purpose, infective
    larvae of the helminths were, if necessary, exsheathed (Ancylostoma caninum, GIN)
    and incubated with different concentrations of CMLE. Results CMLE was found to
    be rich in flavonoids and proanthocyanidins; catechin and epicatechin were therefore
    quantified for standardization of the extract. Data indicate that CMLE had a significant
    effect on larval migration. The effect was dose-dependent and higher concentrations
    (1000 µg/mL) exerted significantly higher larvicidal effect (P < 0.001) compared
    with the negative control (1% dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) and lower concentrations
    (≤ 100 µg/ml). Infective larvae of Ascaris suum [half-maximal inhibitory concentration
    (IC50) = 5.5 µg/mL], Trichuris suis (IC50 = 7.4 µg/mL), and A. caninum (IC50 = 18.9
    µg/mL) were more sensitive to CMLE than that of Toxocara canis (IC50 = 310.0 µg/mL),
    while infective larvae of Toxocara cati were largely unaffected (IC50 > 1000 µg/mL).
    Likewise, CMLE was active against most infective larvae of soil-transmitted ruminant
    GIN, except for Cooperia punctata. Trichostrongylus colubriformis was most sensitive
    to CMLE (IC50 = 2.1 µg/mL) followed by Cooperia oncophora (IC50 = 27.6 µg/mL),
    Ostertagia ostertagi (IC50 = 48.5 µg/mL), Trichostrongylus axei (IC50 = 54.7 µg/mL),
    Haemonchus contortus (IC50 = 145.6 µg/mL), and Cooperia curticei (IC50 = 156.6
    µg/mL). Conclusions These results indicate that CMLE exhibits promising anthelmintic
    properties against infective larvae of a large variety of soil-transmitted nematodes.
    Graphical Abstract Background Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are among
    the most common parasitic infections in the world and affect more than a quarter
    of the world’s human population, most of all poor social strata in (sub)tropical
    regions. The most common STH infecting humans are Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris
    trichiura, and Ancylostoma duodenale, with approximately 1 billion children requiring
    preventive chemotherapy in 2021 [1]. In addition, several STH of veterinary importance
    are zoonotic agents known to develop, temporarily become established, or persist
    in humans. Among them are Ascaris suum originating from pigs [2] and Ancylostoma
    caninum [3] and Toxocara spp. originating from canids and felids [4]. Nematode
    of the genera Ascaris and Trichuris cause the most common helminth infections
    in humans and pigs worldwide [5]. In both cases, the worms that infect pigs and
    humans are closely related and difficult to distinguish morphologically [6]. The
    somatic migration of A. suum larvae in pigs results in significant liver condemnation
    [7]. Ascaris suum and possibly Trichuris suis are zoonotic parasites [2] and are
    closely related to A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, which infect more than 1
    billion and 464.6 million people worldwide, respectively [8, 9]. The hookworm
    A. caninum and the ascarids Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati are important gastrointestinal
    parasites of dogs and cats as they may cause enteritis, dehydration, inappetence,
    despondency, diarrhea, emaciation, weight loss, and can even lead to death in
    severe cases [10, 11]. Soil-transmitted gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) are
    also a major threat to livestock including sheep, goat, and other ruminants [12,
    13]. GINs of the family Trichostrongylidae (Haemonchus, Teladorsagia, Trichostrongylus,
    Cooperia, Ostertagia) and Chabertiidae (Chabertia, Oesophagostomum) are the causative
    agents of parasitic gastroenteritis, which is one of the primary imperatives to
    ruminant production [14, 15] as it can result in weight loss, diarrhea, dehydration,
    anemia, reduced milk production, and reproductive changes [13]. Because of the
    absence of vaccines for most helminth infections, a primary means of controlling
    both human and livestock helminths relies almost entirely on synthetic anthelmintic
    drugs. However, overuse of anthelmintic drugs has led to worldwide emergence of
    anthelmintic resistance [16,17,18]. The development of anthelmintic resistance
    in zoonotic helminths will affect the number of drug options given to humans,
    which will become increasingly limited [19]. Due to chemoresistance, there is
    a great effort to investigate novel approaches for solving the problem of anthelmintic
    resistance by screening traditional medicinal and potential tropical plants with
    high amounts of bioactive compounds [20,21,22]. One potential way to develop cheaper
    and effective anthelmintic drugs is to study indigenous herbal remedies [23].
    Evaluation of the activity of traditionally used medicinal plants with documented
    anthelmintic properties is gaining increasing attention. Several reports, mainly
    from the African continent, indicate the efficacy of plant extracts against helminth
    infections in animals [24,25,26]. The traditional use of medicinal plants in veterinary
    medicine has been practiced for a long time due to the variable availability and
    affordability of synthetic anthelmintics, especially in rural areas [19]. Combretum
    mucronatum Schumach & Thonn (Combretaceae) is a forest liane widespread in tropical
    regions, particularly in the African Savannah forest [27]. In Cameroon, it is
    used to treat malaria and helminthiasis [28], as well as wounds in other parts
    of Western Africa [20]. Strong anthelmintic activity against Trichuris muris has
    been documented [29]. Spiegler et al. [30] identified epicatechin, oligomeric
    procyanidins, and flavonoids as the main compounds of C. mucronatum leaf extract
    and found the procyanidins and the crude extract to be active against the model
    organism Caenorhabditis elegans [30]. However, investigations on anthelmintic
    activities of C. mucronatum against parasites of domestic animals and humans are
    not available. Therefore, the current work aimed to investigate the phytochemical
    composition and the anthelmintic activity of C. mucronatum leaf extract by thin
    layer chromatography (TLC) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)
    as well as larval migration inhibition assays, respectively. Methods Collection
    of plant material and preparation of the extract Leaves of Combretum mucronatum
    were collected in January 2021 in Ngaoundere, Adamawa region of Cameroon (North
    Latitude of 7°85′88.57\" and East Longitude of 13°59′39.19\"). The sample was
    identified by Prof. Tchobsala, a botanist from the University of Maroua (Cameroon).
    The specimens of C. mucronatum were authenticated and a reference sample was deposited
    at the National Herbarium in Yaoundé, Cameroon under code no. 32193 HNC. The remaining
    plant material was washed with water, shade-dried at room temperature, and subsequently
    grounded to powder. Hydroethanolic extracts were prepared as described previously
    [30]. Briefly, powdered C. mucronatum leaves (1 kg) were defatted with petroleum
    ether by Soxhlet extraction. The residue was extracted by ethanol:water (1:1 v/v)
    by use of rotor stator extractor (Ultra-Turrax, IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen,
    Germany) at 7500 rpm for 10 min under ice cooling. This extraction was repeated
    three times and the resulting mixture was filtered with filter paper (Schleicher
    & Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany) under vacuum. The clear solutions were combined
    and concentrated under vacuum (Rotavapor R-210, Büchi, Flawil, Switzerland) at
    40 °C. The obtained aqueous solution was frozen at −20 °C and lyophilized (Alpha
    1–4 LD plus Christ, Osterode, Germany). The dried CMLE was stored at 4 °C until
    further use. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) TLC is a simple and fast technique
    that allows for the rapid identification of classes of natural products and the
    ascertainment of the number of compounds present in complex mixtures such as plant
    extracts [31]. CMLE was dissolved in methanol (MeOH) to a concentration of 10
    mg/mL, and 10 µL of the solution were spotted onto silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck
    KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) with an autosampler (CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland). The
    spotted plates were placed into a glass TLC chamber (saturated solvents for 20
    min) and developed over a distance of 8 cm in different mobile phases. For flavonoid
    determination, ethyl acetate:water:formic acid (75:15:5, v:v:v) was used as mobile
    phase and plates were sprayed with Naturstoff reagent (1% (w/v) diphenylboryloxyethylamine
    (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for detection. Acetonitrile:water:formic acid
    (30:8:2, v:v:v) was used as mobile phase to separate proanthocyanidins, which
    were visualized by spraying the plates with vanillin/hydrochloric acid reagent
    (1% w/v vanillin in MeOH, followed by addition of 8% Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in
    glacial acetic acid) and heating to approximately 100 °C. Detection was performed
    at λ = 254 nm, 366 nm, and white light using a CAMAG TLC Visualiser II (visionCATS
    software, version 3.0) before and after spraying with the respective detection
    reagents. Standardization of CMLE by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
    (UPLC) Analytical UPLC was performed according to a validated method for C. mucronatum
    [32] on an ACQUITY UPLC system with High Strenght Silica (HSS) T3 1.8 µm, 2.1 × 100
    mm column; PDA λe detector (λ 210–400); QDa mass-selective detector (positive
    scan 100.00–1000 Da); autosampler, in-line degasser, and run by Waters Empower
    3 software (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). A binary gradient of mobile phase A (containing
    0.1% formic acid in water) and B (containing 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile)
    was established as follows: t0min A 98%, t1min A 90%, t2min A 90%, t4min A 85%,
    t10min A 85%, t11min A 0%, t12min A 98%, t13min A 98%. Column temperature: 40
    °C; injection volume: 2 µL; flow rate: 0.5 mL/min. Reference standards for external
    calibration: epicatechin, catechin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), and
    procyanidin C1 (isolated and identified as described previously [30]). Reference
    solutions of epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidin C1 were made by dissolving
    reference compounds in methanol at concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 100, and 400
    µg/mL. CLME was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. A total of
    five samples of the extract (S1 to S5) were prepared. Prior to injection, all
    samples were centrifuged at 6000 × g (Mikro 120, Hettich Germany) and supernatants
    were transferred to vials for further analysis to quantify procyanidin C1 and
    its monomers for standardization. The linear regression equations were Y = 1996.4X
    − 2551.9 (R2 = 0.9983) and Y = 2823.6X − 29,397 (R2 = 1) for catechin and epicatechin,
    respectively, where Y is the peak area and X defines the respective concentration.
    Larvae of narrow sense STH and ruminant GIN for in vitro studies Infective larvae
    of ascarids, whipworms, hookworms, and ruminant (tricho-)strongyle GIN were cultivated
    from eggs collected at an abattoir or isolated from fecal surplus samples of animals
    carrying experimental nematode infections for parasite maintenance purposes. Ascarids
    (Ascaris suum, Toxocara canis, and Toxocara cati) Eggs of A. suum were retrieved
    from adult females isolated from the intestine of pigs at an abattoir, using only
    eggs excreted within the first day after isolation. Isolation of T. canis (field
    isolate HannoverTcanis2020) and T. cati (field isolate HannoverTcati2019) eggs
    from fecal samples of experimentally infected dogs and cats was performed via
    sedimentation–flotation technique. Eggs were embryonated in tap water for at least
    6 weeks at room temperature (RT) with periodic oxygenation to allow development
    of infective third-stage larvae (L3) within the eggs. Hatching of infective L3
    of A. suum, T. canis, and T. cati was performed as described by Raulf et al. [33]
    with slight modifications. Briefly, embryonated eggs were incubated in 10 mL of
    12% NaOCl (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 5 min (T. canis and T. cati) or
    9 min (A. suum). The suspension was washed with 500 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered
    saline (PBS) over a 10 µm sieve. Eggs were transferred to a 50 mL tube, centrifuged
    at 1500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of culture medium
    (Roswell Park Memorial Institute media series, Roswell Park Memorial Institute
    media series (RPMI)-1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/100
    µg/mL streptomycin, and 250 ng/mL amphotericin B). To promote larval hatching,
    the eggs were gassed with CO2 for 5 min and poured onto 40 µm cell sieves inserted
    into a 6-well tissue culture plate (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) filled with
    culture medium. Larvae were allowed to migrate for 24–48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2
    and were maintained in culture medium until being used in larval migration inhibition
    assays (LMIA). Whipworms (Trichuris suis) Eggs of T. suis (field isolate CopenhagenTs2016)
    were isolated from fecal samples of experimentally infected pigs via sedimentation–flotation
    technique and allowed to embryonate to infective first-stage larvae (L1) within
    the eggs for at least 8 weeks at 37 °C in tap water with periodic oxygenation.
    For hatching of infective L1, embryonated eggs were suspended in 10 mL of 3.6%
    sodium hypochlorite, 0.1 N sulfuric acid solution, and incubated at 37 °C for
    45 min. The suspension was washed six times in sterile PBS followed by centrifugation
    at 800 × g for 10 min after every washing step. The eggs were resuspended in culture
    medium and transferred to 6-well plates [33]. Larvae hatched within 2 days of
    incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and were separated from eggshells by migration
    through a 15 µm sieve for 2 h before being used in LMIA. Hookworms (Ancylostoma
    caninum) Feces of dogs experimentally infected with A. caninum (field isolate
    CostaRicaAc2009) were coprocultured for 7–10 days at 26 °C and 70% humidity for
    development of infective L3. Larvae were retrieved from feces by Baermann–Wetzel
    technique and stored at 4 °C until further use. Infective L3 of A. caninum were
    artificially exsheathed according to a method described by Coles et al. [34].
    Briefly, larvae were incubated at room temperature with 0.12% of sodium hypochlorite
    in PBS for 6 min followed by washing with sterile PBS over a 10 µm sieve. The
    larvae were transferred to a 15 mL falcon tube and left to rest at 37 °C for 2
    h. L3 were resuspended in culture medium and maintained until being used in LMIA.
    Ensheathed infective L3 of A. caninum were also used in LMIA. Ruminant gastrointestinal
    nematodes (GIN) Feces of ruminants experimentally infected with recent field isolates
    as per the International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements
    for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH) guidelines [35] (sheep:
    Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus colubriformis,
    Trichostrongylus axei, Chabertia ovina, Cooperia curticei; cattle: Cooperia punctata,
    Cooperia oncophora, Ostertagia ostertagi, Oesophagostomum radiatum) were coprocultured
    for 7–10 days at ~ 26 °C for development of infective L3. The L3 were retrieved
    from the coproculture by the agar layer technique and stored at 4 ~ 8 °C until
    further use. Infective L3 were exsheathed as described by Coles et al. [34] with
    slight modifications. Briefly, larvae were incubated at room temperature with
    0.2% sodium hypochlorite in PBS for 6–9 min. Afterward, larvae were rinsed with
    PBS over a 15 µm sieve and left for rest in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Exsheathed
    L3 were placed on 20 µm or 25 µm sieves for migration for 2 h at 37 °C before
    being used in LMIA. Larval migration inhibition assays (LMIA) For each assay,
    a stock solution of the hydroethanolic CMLE was freshly prepared by dissolving
    the extract in DMSO by vigorous vortexing, followed by adjusting the concentration
    of the dissolved extract to 10 mg/ml in culture medium with a concentration of
    DMSO not exceeding 1%. LMIA was performed as described by Demeler et al. [36,
    37]. This method uses a migration system that physically separates motile from
    non-motile larvae through a filter mesh (Sefar Nitex®, Sefar Holding AG, Thal,
    Switzerland). The mesh size allows active larvae, but not immotile larvae, to
    pass through the mesh. Accordingly, mesh sizes were chosen on the basis of the
    diameter of larvae of each parasite species. From stock solutions, four concentrations
    of extract (1, 10, 100, and 1000 µg/mL for STHs or 10, 100, 1000, and 2000 µg/mL
    for ruminant GIN) were prepared by serial dilution in culture medium in a 48-well
    plate to a final volume of 200 µL per well. Levamisole-HCl (purity ≥ 99.0, Glentham
    Life Sciences, 1 mM, 241 µg/mL in culture medium) served as positive control and
    DMSO (1% in culture medium) as negative control. A total of 10–20 larvae were
    pipetted into a well supplemented with the respective treatment solutions and
    incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h (T. suis), 48 h (ruminant GIN), or 72 h (ascarids,
    A. caninum). After incubation, the larvae were transferred to a 48-well migration
    plate equipped with sieves [37]. The migration plates were incubated at 37 °C,
    5% CO2 for 24 h. The migration chambers were then lifted and the sieve was inverted
    to the next well in the near row. Non-migrating larvae adhering to the sieve were
    washed into the corresponding well with 1000 µL of PBS. Determination of the inhibition
    of infective larvae migration was performed under a Zeiss ID03 inverted microscope
    (Carl Zeiss) and the percentage of non-migrating larvae was calculated relative
    to the total number of larvae per well. All trials were performed in three independent
    experiments using four technical replicates for each trial. Statistical analyses
    Data were presented as the average of at least three independent experiments.
    Data were summarized in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 16).
    Linear or nonlinear regressions were generated from the data using GraphPad Prism
    software (version 8.0.1, San Diego, California, USA). One-way analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons was used to analyze
    the data. A P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Phytochemical
    analysis Prior to the in vitro bioassays, the phytochemical composition of the
    hydroethanolic extract from the leaves of C. mucronatum (CMLE) was characterized
    by TLC and UPLC. Visualization of flavonoids by use of Naturstoff reagent (diphenylboryloxyethylamine,
    1% in MeOH) showed several bands under white light (Fig. 1A) and at λ = 366 nm
    (Fig. 1B) in TLC. Two strong yellow fluorescent bands together with a series of
    weaker bands in yellow–orange, yellow–green, and blue were observed at λ = 366
    nm (Fig. 1B), suggesting different types of flavonoids and phenolic compounds.
    Vanillin reagent revealed the presence of proanthocyanidins in the C. mucronatum
    extract (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1 TLC profiles of Combretum mucronatum leaf extract CMLE,
    detected with Naturstoff reagent under white light (A) and at λ = 366 nm (B),
    or detected with vanillin/HCl (C). Flavonoids appear as yellow bands (A, B), while
    strong red bands represent proanthocyanidins (C) Full size image High performance
    liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array (PDA) and mass spectrometry
    (MS) was used to identify potential marker compounds in CMLE. The trimeric procyanidin
    C1, as well as the typical flavan-3-ols epicatechin and catechin, were detected
    in positive ionization mode and at a wavelength of 280 nm. Catechin and epicatechin
    were quantified in CMLE by UPLC by using catechin and epicatechin standards. The
    calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 10–400 µg/mL for
    catechin and 25–400 µg/mL for epicatechin. Catechin and epicatechin contents were
    calculated as 16.4 ± 0.6 µg per mg dry extract and 1.0 ± 0.2 µg per mg dry extract,
    respectively. Procyanidin C1 (m/z 867 Da) was detected in the extract but not
    quantified, as the respective peak area was very small. There was no significant
    difference between the catechin and epicatechin content of five different samples
    (Table 1). This result shows that the compounds in the C. mucronatum extract were
    uniformly distributed, but also provides the content of the reference compounds
    as an additional phytochemical characterization. Table 1 Quantification of epicatechin
    and catechin in Combretum mucronatum leaf extract (CMLE) Full size table In vitro
    anthelmintic activity of Combretum mucronatum against larvae of narrow sense STH
    A dose-dependent inhibitory effect of CMLE was observed on the migration of most
    STH infective larvae (Fig. 2). With an IC50 of 5.5 (1.4–9.7) µg/mL, hatched infective
    larvae of A. suum were most susceptible to the treatment with CMLE (Table 2).
    At the highest concentration, inhibition of larval migration was more than 90%,
    which was significantly higher than the negative control with 7.5% larval migration
    inhibition (F(5, 11) = 30.51, P < 0.001). Ascaris suum larvae were more sensitive
    to high concentrations of the C. mucronatum extract than to levamisole (1000 µM)
    with inhibition of larval migration of only 36.3% (F(5, 11) = 30.51, P = 0.028)
    (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Inhibitory effects of Combretum mucronatum leaf extract (CMLE)

    larvae showed a high susceptibility to CMLE as indicated by an IC50 of 7.4 (−7.3
    to 22.1) µg/mL (Table 2). At the highest concentration of CMLE, all of the larvae
    were non-motile (Fig. 2), whereas only 74.0% of larvae were inhibited by levamisole
    (P > 0.05). Migration inhibition in the negative control was 1.2%, which was significantly
    lower compared with high concentrations of the CMLE (F(5, 12) = 81.89, P < 0.001).

    were also sensitive to the extract (Table 2), while ensheathed infective larvae
    were not affected by the extract (data not shown). At the highest CMLE concentration,
    the percentage of migration inhibition was 89.2%, which was significantly higher
    than that of the negative (1% DMSO) (F(5, 12) = 51.77, P < 0.001) as well as the
    positive control (1000 µM, levamisole-HCl) (F(5, 12) = 51.77, P < 0.001). Compared
    with the other STH, inhibition of the migration of Toxocara spp. infective larvae
    occurred only at higher doses. Accordingly, the IC50 values were considerably
    higher, with 310.0 (192.0–428.0) µg/mL for T. canis and even more than 1000 µg/mL
    for T. cati (Table 2). Statistical analyses showed that larvae of T. cati were
    less sensitive to CMLE than those of T. canis (F(4, 12) = 41.53, P < 0.001) at
    the highest concentration (1000 µg/mL), while at lower concentrations, there was
    no significant difference (95% CI −5 to 2, P = 0.59). The highest migration inhibition
    was observed at 1000 µg/mL with 86.4% of T. canis and 28.8% of T. cati larvae
    being non-motile. The percentage of non-migrating larvae was significantly higher
    than that of the negative control (0.35–1.53%; F(5, 12) = 123.3, P = 0.02 to F(5,
    12) = 51.77, P < 0.001). The highest concentrations of CMLE had a comparable effect
    to the positive control (95.8%) (F(1, 8) = 0.049, P = 0.83) against T. canis infective
    larvae. In vitro anthelmintic activity of Combretum mucronatum against larvae
    of ruminant GIN The effect of CMLE on the migration of exsheathed L3 of ruminant
    (tricho-)strongyles of ruminants was generally dose dependent. In the negative
    controls, the percentage of migration inhibition ranged from 0.0% to 9.4%. Hence,
    DMSO at 1% did not impact larval migration significantly, indicating that observed
    changes in larval migration in the treatment wells could be ascribed to the CMLE.
    At the highest concentration (2000 µg/mL), CMLE significantly inhibited migration
    of larvae of H. contortus (95.6 ± 3.8%), T. colubriformis (90.9 ± 3.6%), C. ovina
    (87.2 ± 5.2%), C. curticei (86.9 ± 3.4%), O. ostertagi (85.2 ± 6.4%), T. circumcincta
    (81.2 ± 10.4%), T. axei (77.7 ± 10.8%), C. oncophora (69.4 ± 4.6%), and Oe. radiatum
    (63.9 ± 4.1%). However, CMLE was inactive against C. punctata larvae, where the
    percentage migration inhibition ranged from 13.4% to 37.2%, while 96.4% inhibition
    resulted in the levamisole positive control (1 mM; Fig. 3). At a concentration
    of 2000 µg/mL, significant differences were observed between C. punctata and all
    other ruminant GIN (F(9, 28) = 11, P < 0.01 to 0.001). Fig. 3 Inhibitory effects

    Discussion The present study indicated that the extract CMLE from C. mucronatum
    typically contains proanthocyanins and flavonoids as main constituents. This result
    is in agreement with those obtained by Bekoe et al. [38] and Orman et al. [32],
    who found different flavonoids in the leaf extracts from C. mucronatum. Quantification
    of epicatechin and catechin, representing the monomeric units of the oligomeric
    procyanidins, was performed by UPLC. Unfortunately, the amount of procyanidin
    C1 in CMLE was too low for standardization. This result was in contrast to Spiegler
    et al. [30], who detected a considerable amount of procyanidin C1 in the leaf
    extract of C. mucronatum harvested from Ghana (West Africa). However, TLC analysis
    showed that CMLE contains the proanthocyanidins with a higher degree of polymerization
    that were not captured by HPLC. This might be explained by differences in climate,
    collection period, and harvest area among the studies [32]. The contents of epicatechin
    and low molecular weight procyanidins were particularly affected by seasonal and
    spatial variation [32] In addition, these authors have found that tannin, flavonoid,
    and saponin contents from Sterculia setigera and Sclerocarya birrea extracts were
    higher in Kem than those in Yola, two localities in Nigeria [39]. In contrast,
    epicatechin and catechin were well detectable, with a higher content of catechin
    (16.4 ± 0.6 µg per mg dry extract) compared with epicatechin (1.0 ± 0.2 µg per
    mg dry extract). Larval migration inhibition [37] and adult worm motility [40]
    tests are widely used in veterinary parasitology for the search for new anthelmintic
    compounds [41] or the detection of anthelmintic resistance [37]. The advantage
    of in vitro tests is that the compounds or plant extracts to be tested are in
    direct contact with the parasite life stages, allowing for initial efficacy screening.
    Moreover, these tests are relatively inexpensive. Spiegler et al. [30] and Koné
    et al. [29] previously reported in vitro efficacy of C. mucronatum extract against
    C. elegans and T. muris. The current study revealed anthelmintic activity of CMLE
    against a panel of STH including ruminant GIN. The effect of CMLE was generally
    dose-dependent and varied considerably between parasite species. Regarding narrow
    sense STH, A. suum, A. caninum, and T. suis were most sensitive to the extract
    as opposed to T. canis and T. cati, and striking differences in IC50 values against
    the Ascaris, Trichuris, and Ancylostoma (5.54–18.98 µg/mL) versus the Toxocara
    (310.02–7249.85 µg/mL) species were observed. A similar pattern was reported by
    Jato et al. [42] when testing a Phyllanthus urinaria extract against larvae of
    these genera. Both C. mucronatum and P. urinaria are traditional medicinal plants
    against helminthiases [20], and the substantially lower IC50 values against Ascaris,
    Trichuris, and Ancylostoma infective larvae as compared with Toxocara infective
    larvae might mirror their selection by traditional healers against parasite genera
    using humans as definitive host. Similarly, Spiegler et al. [43] reported that
    infective larvae of Trichuris vulpis were more sensitive to Paullinia pinnata
    root extract than infective T. cati larvae and C. elegans, while no effect of
    the P. pinnata extract on egg hatching of H. contortus or the motility of infective
    ensheathed H. contortus and ensheathed A. caninum larvae was observed. Infective
    ensheathed A. caninum larvae were also tested in the present study, but larval
    migration was not affected by CMLE (data not shown), compared with a significant
    migration inhibition of infective exsheathed A. caninum larvae. Consequently,
    ensheated infective STH/GIN larvae seem to be (more or less) protected against
    (at least some) bioactive plant compounds by their coverings, i.e., cuticle sheath,
    which also protect the larvae from desiccation and other damage in the environment.
    After being ingested by a suitable host, infective larvae hatch from the eggs
    or exsheath in the gastrointestinal tract. This process was artificially induced
    in the present study, and at this stage, infective larvae of most of the 15 STH/GIN
    species tested were susceptible to CMLE as indicated by a significant inhibition
    of larval migration. As with the narrow sense STH described above, migration inhibition
    of ruminant GIN infective larvae showed a dose-dependent pattern, except for C.
    punctata larvae, which were insensitive to CMLE. Similarly, Yongwa et al. [40]
    have shown that Senna italica extract has dose-dependent effect on infective L3
    of H. contortus. Likewise, Carica papaya has presented strong activity on infective
    larvae of H. contortus with dose-dependent effect [44]. In the present study,
    a high anthelmintic activity of the CMLE was observed on exsheathed infective
    larvae of T. colubriformis with IC50 values of 2.07 ± 2.98 µg/mL. Likewise, exsheathed
    infective larvae of T. axei, H. contortus, O. ostertagi, C. oncophora, and C.
    curticei have been shown to be sensitive against CMLE with slightly higher IC50
    values (cf. Table 3). Similar to the narrow sense STH tested, the current results
    also showed variable anthelmintic efficacies of CLME on different ruminant GIN
    species. This finding is in accordance with Molan et al. [45], who performed in
    vitro tests on infective larvae of H. contortus, T. circumcincta, and T. colubriformis
    and found divergent effects of extracts of sulla (Hedysarum coronarum), a legume
    forage. These authors have shown that T. colubriformis larvae were more refractory
    to the inhibitory effects of H. coronarum extract than larvae of the other species.
    Shepherd et al. [46] evaluated in vitro anthelmintic activity of heather extract
    on T. colubriformis and T. circumcincta larvae and found that it was effective
    against T. circumcincta, but not against T. colubriformis. Nevertheless, the parasite
    species as well as the extracted plant species drive differences in larvae mobility
    inhibition. For example, against H. contortus, our study showed a larval migration
    inhibition rate of more than 80% at 1000 µg/mL, which is stronger than that reported
    for other tanniferous plant extract against the same parasite by Barrau et al.
    [47]. Table 3 Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of Combretum mucronatum
    leaf extract (CMLE) against infective larvae of ruminant gastrointestinal nematodes
    Full size table It was proposed that the anthelmintic activity of CMLE against
    C. elegans was due to the procyanidin oligomers [30]. The current study showed
    that C. mucronatum harvested in Cameroon contains a low amount of procyanidin
    C1 as a representative oligomeric procyanidin, but has a good anthelmintic effect
    against larvae of STH/GIN. As suggested by TLC analysis, the efficacy of CMLE
    in this work could be due to oligomeric proanthocyanidins with a higher degree
    of polymerization that were not captured by HPLC. In addition, Greiffer et al.
    [48] have shown that a C. mucronatum leaf extract acted on the cuticle of C. elegans,
    inducing disruptions of the cuticle structure and molting defects at all larval
    stages. The authors have shown that the tissues of C. elegans were not affected
    by the treatment. Thus, the anthelmintic effect of CMLE found in the present study
    could be due to its action on the cuticle of helminth larvae. Previous research
    on the synergistic inhibition of the exsheathment of H. contortus infective L3
    by flavonoid monomers (luteolin or quercetin) and condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins
    or prodelphinidins) was shown [49]. Williams et al. [50] reported that procyanidin-rich
    extracts/fractions may have higher activity against Oesophagostomum dentatum,
    which is somewhat surprising given that prodelphinidins (PDs) are generally considered
    to have a higher biological effect than procyanidins (PCs) due to an additional
    hydroxyl group promoting increased hydrogen bonding with proteins [51]. Variation
    in the anthelmintic property of the extract tested in this study could be ascribed
    to the different susceptibility of parasite species toward tannins or different
    compounds present in CMLE. This result is in accordance with those found by Quijada
    et al. [52], who reported that condensed tannins have different modes of action
    against different parasite species. Considering their mode of action, anthelmintic
    drugs may be distinguished into nicotinic agonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors,
    GABA agonists, GluCl potentiators, calcium permeability increasers, β-tubulin
    binders, proton ionophores, inhibitors of malate metabolism, inhibitors of phosphoglycerate
    kinase and mutase, inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, and stimulators
    of innate immunity [53, 54]. Indeed, levamisole acts as a selective nicotinic
    agonist to induce contraction of nematode somatic muscle tissue and therefore
    leads to paralysis [55]. The known target sites on nematode parasites are proteins
    including ion channels, enzymes, structural proteins, and molecule transporters
    [53, 54]. Consequently, different bioactive compounds of C. mucronatum could have
    different targets to exert their anthelmintic activity on infective larvae. Generally,
    tannins bind proline-rich proteins with high affinity [56], and are thus believed
    to interfere with helminth parasites by binding to proline-rich collagenous tissues
    such as the cuticle [57,58,59]. Apart from a varying susceptibility toward components
    of the extract other than tannins, differences in the efficacy of CMLE against
    the different nematode species could also arise from differences in the cuticle
    composition. For example, the ratio of hydroxyproline compared with proline has
    been found to vary among species [60]. On the contrary, polyhydroxyproline binds
    tannins with a much lower affinity than polyproline [56], which could in part
    explain the observed differences in activity. In addition, several studies suggest
    that tannins are not the only principal secondary metabolites responsible for
    anthelmintic property on GIN, as synergistic effects of condensed tannins with
    flavonoid monomers were also previously shown [61, 62]. Furthermore, von Son de
    Fernex et al. [63] recorded a synergistic effect between quercetin and caffeic
    acid from Leucaena leucocephala on egg hatching of Cooperia species in their study.
    It should also be mentioned that substances or compounds that are effective in
    vitro are not necessarily effective in vivo. With respect to the anthelmintic
    activity of condensed tannins, extracts of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), for
    example, showed in vitro activity against different GIN of sheep and cattle [47,
    64]. However, in vivo activity was determined as the reduction of fecal egg count
    was observed against H. contortus in lambs that were fed sainfoin [65], but not
    against O. ostertagi and C. oncophora in calves receiving the pelleted plant as
    feed [66]. Therefore, in vivo validation deserves further investigations prior
    to potential use for helminth control in domestic animals. Conclusions The results
    obtained in the present study showed that an extract from the leaves of Combretum
    mucronatum possesses anthelmintic activity against infective larvae of different
    parasitic nematode species. Infective larvae of STH such as T. suis, A. suum,
    and A. caninum were more sensitive to the CMLE than those of Toxocara species.
    Moreover, CMLE had a significant effect on ruminant GIN larvae, except for C.
    punctata. Regarding its phytochemical composition, different phenolic compounds
    represented the major class of natural products in the extract. Whether the extract
    is suitable for the in vivo treatment of helminth infections has to be clarified
    in further studies. Availability of data and materials Data supporting reported

    are interactive communities of interface-associated microbial cells, enclosed
    in an extracellular polymeric matrix [EPM] made of compounds such as polysaccharides,
    proteins, extracellular DNA, and lipids. While relatively unknown to the general
    public, they are ubiquitous in nature and human-built environments generating
    an estimated US $5 trillion impact on global economic activity. (Cámara et al.
    2022) The general perception of biofilms tends to be often negative due to their
    association with persistent infections or biofouling in industrial settings. However,
    it is important to acknowledge the advantageous aspects associated with biofilms.
    These complex microbial assemblies have been utilised in a wide array of applications,
    spanning from wastewater treatment and bioremediation (Verma et al. 2023; Mishra
    et al. 2022) to food fermentation, (Yao et al. 2022; Rahman et al. 2023) enhancement
    of agricultural soil health, (Seneviratne et al. 2017) as well as the development
    of biological sensors for environmental monitoring. (Prévoteau and Rabaey 2017)
    The engineering and management of biofilms hold significant potential benefits
    including pollutant removal capabilities (Arindam and Suman 2016) or the possibility
    of pharmaceutical production. (Hayta et al. 2021; Patwardhan et al. 2022). In
    agriculture, biofilms have the potential to be used as biofertilisers, biostimulants,
    soil bioremediators and biocontrol agents. Assembling biofilms in the rhizosphere
    can provide many benefits from improved plant growth and health to contributing
    to the overall health and stability of soil ecosystems. (Ajijah et al. 2023) Biofilms
    can help to increase the availability of nutrients and their uptake by plants
    by facilitating root nodulation and nitrogen fixation. (Poole et al. 2018) As
    an example, the use of rhizobia biofilms provides an important aspect of sustainable
    agriculture practice, especially in growing legumes, utilising the symbiotic relationship
    between rhizobia and plants to enhance nitrogen availability in the soil whilst
    reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. (Carareto Alves et al. 2014;
    Terpolilli et al. 2012) Numerous microorganisms, including Pseudomonas, Bacillus,
    Rhizobium, Xanthobacter, Enterobacter, to name a few, play a pivotal role in the
    breakdown of organic matter around roots and in the solubilisation and uptake
    of minerals such as iron, zinc, manganese, chlorine, silicone, copper, and others,
    essential for processes necessary for plant development and health such as photosynthesis,
    respiration, or protection against oxidative stress. (Mitter et al. 2021; Salas-González
    et al. 2021) Biofilms have also been shown to protect plants from pathogens by
    providing a physical barrier and through the production of antimicrobial compounds.
    (Berendsen et al. 2018; Salomon et al. 2017; Berlanga-Clavero et al. 2022) A notable
    example of such protection from pathogens has been described by Snathanam et al.
    (Santhanam et al. 2015), who demonstrated through large-scale field trials, that
    inoculation of soil with a mixture of native bacterial isolates protected tobacco
    plants [Nicotiana attenuate], significantly reducing the incidence and mortality
    caused by fungal infection responsible for wilt disease. Another area where biofilms
    play a role is in regulating the levels of phytohormones in the rhizosphere, which
    can help to promote plant growth and development, and to regulate responses to
    environmental stresses, (Orozco-Mosqueda et al. 2023; Finkel et al. 2020) as demonstrated,
    for example by Finkel et al. (Finkel et al. 2020) who showed that Variovorax bacteria,
    by manipulating plant hormone levels, have the ability to reverse inhibition of
    Arabidopsis plants root growth, induced by other bacterial strains. Furthermore,
    biofilms help plants to cope with abiotic environmental stresses such as drought
    or salinity, by producing compounds that improve water retention and ion uptake.
    (Bhagat et al. 2021; Mathur and Roy 2021) Biofilms can contribute to the formation
    of soil aggregates, which can improve soil structure and stability, and increase
    water infiltration and retention. (Bhagat et al. 2021; Costa et al. 2018) In summary,
    microbial biofilms can promote the growth of a diverse range of plant species
    by creating a more favourable rhizosphere environment. Investigation into the
    manipulation, control and exploitation of biofilms has gained momentum and seen
    an increase in research activity and funding in the last decade. However, there
    are still many knowledge gaps with regards to the mechanisms of interaction between
    natural polymicrobial biofilms and plants, and how to exploit these interactions
    to promote plant growth and prevent crop diseases. Improved understanding of biofilms,
    in this context, is key to discovering, controlling and directing the behaviour
    of microbial communities to create a sustainable environment. International collaboration
    in this field is essential to advance global agricultural innovation and develop
    more sustainable food systems. Driven by this incentive, the UK’s National Biofilms
    Innovation Centre [NBIC], in collaboration with leading Argentine researchers,
    organised a workshop within the framework of the SAMIGE [Argentinean Society for
    General Microbiology] annual congress, to establish a dialogue between researchers
    and industry representatives from both countries (NBIC 2023). This workshop brought
    together complementary expertise on exploitation of biofilms in agriculture with
    the aim of addressing knowledge gaps, improving agricultural productivity through
    the uptake of new technologies in both countries and tackling the global issue
    of climate change by promoting soil health, reducing the use of chemical treatments
    and their environmental impact. This publication, in its ''white paper’ form,
    encapsulates the diverse discussions that occurred during the workshop and provides
    a comprehensive overview of the insights, perspectives, and outcomes that arose
    from the cooperative dialogue between the workshop participants. Three priority
    areas, that would benefit greatly from the future research collaborations between
    the UK and Argentina, emerged from the discussions and are described here. They
    are accompanied by proposed specific research activities that could be incorporated
    into future collaborative projects to address these priority areas. It is important
    to recognise that although the topics outlined below would be applicable to partnerships
    spanning various countries and regions globally, the primary focus of this white
    paper is not to offer an exhaustive review of these areas but to document the
    discussions held between these two countries. Priority areas for UK-Argentina
    collaboration Plant root biofilm composition as a sensor to optimise interventions
    Root microbiomes play a key role in plant health. (Custódio et al. 2022; Finkel
    et al. 2017) They provide essential functions to enhance plant nutrition and deliver
    protection against biotic and abiotic stressors. (Custódio et al. 2022; Finkel
    et al. 2017) The interactions of soil microbiome with plant roots are complex
    and enable the formation of biofilms on roots, which assist with nutrient acquisition,
    growth proliferation, removal of contaminants, protection against plant pathogens,
    and promoting the establishment of other beneficial microorganisms in the soil.
    As [i] a wide variety of environmental stressors affect microbial adhesion, microbe-microbe
    and root-microbe interactions; [ii] the root biofilm provides a physical barrier
    to the diffusion of modulatory molecules from the root; and [iii] protects the
    root against abiotic and biotic stresses such as pH changes, desiccation, osmotic
    stress, and pathogen attack, (Bogino et al. 2013) it is expected that the analysis
    of changes in the composition and properties of the root biofilm in response to
    environmental fluctuations can inform the status of the roots in response to these
    stresses. Therefore, by understanding the relationships between the properties
    and composition of root biofilms and the resistance / sensitivity of roots to
    biotic and abiotic stresses, we propose to use plant root biofilms, forming part
    of the wider microbiome, as a natural sensor to optimise interventions which promote
    plant health and crop production. The objective of this proposed area of research
    is to further our understanding on the role of root biofilms in promoting plant
    health and resilience to fluctuations in environmental conditions. This will unveil
    how these biofilms contribute to the resistance of plant roots to various biotic
    and abiotic stresses and enable the design of bespoke inoculants which bypass
    the negative impact of these. Comparison between environments in the UK and Argentina
    would enable the establishment of core differences and similarities between the
    two countries regarding healthy vs unhealthy root microbiota in a wider range
    of environmental conditions as the climate in the UK and Argentina differs significantly
    due to their geographical locations and topography. Additionally, it is proposed
    to focus on wheat and potatoes as two of the main crops grown in both countries,
    with similar climatic conditions for cropping but counter-seasonal growing. These
    two crops are proposed as they represent two different plant groups, one being
    a monocot [wheat] and the other dicot [potato] and having different characteristics
    and growth habits that influence how they are cultivated, propagated, and used.
    They also present two different scenarios of farming: extensive and intensive,
    respectively. To accomplish the outlined objectives aimed at addressing this priority
    area, the following collaborative activities are proposed: Establishing the microbial
    composition of biofilms in roots from wheat and potatoes grown in rich and poor
    soils from different environments in the UK and Argentina, utilising advanced
    multi-omics technologies and developing, where possible, new methods for biofilm
    studies under agriculturally relevant conditions. Using multi-omics approaches
    to establish correlations between plant sensitivity and resistance to biotic and
    abiotic stresses [pathogens, drought, salinity, extreme temperatures] and the
    composition of microorganisms in the root biofilms, including determination of
    changes in root structure and healthy growth parameters. Testing the main hypotheses,
    derived from correlation studies, by using microbial collections available from
    in vitro recolonisation experiments. This will advance the discovery of new methods
    to study root biofilm and facilitate the establishment of causality between biofilm
    properties and composition and relevant plant phenotypes that could be extrapolated
    to more relevant agricultural conditions. Development of databases to store data
    generated above and use of artificial intelligence to analyse these data, establishing
    correlations and allowing predictions to be made on plant health and crop yield
    based on the composition of plant-associated microbiomes. Design of strategies,
    based on the devised predictions, to manipulate soil and root biofilms / microbiomes
    to restore healthy soil biodiversity and aid crop production under adverse conditions.
    This could be achieved using bespoke seed inoculants with the appropriate healthy
    microbial composition, as proposed in ‘Priority Area 3’ of this paper. Targeting
    climate change and soil health Soil is a natural resource for global food production
    but also provides an essential environment for ecosystems, biodiversity, carbon
    sequestrations and water availability. (Eckardt et al. 2022) Climate change can
    have a major impact on soil and vice-versa, the changes in the use of land and
    soil can drastically influence climate change. (Eckardt et al. 2022) The increasing
    human population and demand for food and land use have put pressure on soils in
    recent decades. It has been estimated that a third (Global Land Outlook 2022)
    of global soils is now degraded. There is a complex relationship between climate
    change and soil health, influenced by plant-microbiota interactions. (Omae and
    Tsuda 2022; Trivedi et al. 2022) Climate change-induced shifts in temperature,
    precipitation, and extreme events impact microbial communities in the soil, affecting
    nutrient circulation and overall soil health. These changes also cause abiotic
    stressors like drought or heat, activating crucial responses in plant-microbiota
    symbioses that contribute to plant resilience. Microbial mechanisms in the rhizosphere
    related to improving abiotic stress tolerance in plants include the production
    of biopolymers and biofilms, which provide a protective matrix around roots and
    increase resilience of plants to these factors. (Trivedi et al. 2020) For example,
    beneficial interactions, such as mycorrhizal associations and nitrogen-fixing
    microorganisms, are triggered enhancing nutrient availability. (Omae and Tsuda
    2022; Trivedi et al. 2022) Unravelling the dynamics of plant-microbiota interactions
    and the adaptation strategies employed by plants and microbes to cope with changing
    environmental conditions is essential for developing sustainable agricultural
    practices. This knowledge is needed to understand the pivotal role of these interactions
    in maintaining soil health under the pressures of a changing climate. Furthermore,
    to design faster and environmentally friendly strategies, the principles governing
    the interaction between soil and climate changes must be understood. This would
    contribute to exploration of innovative approaches such as utilising biofilm-forming
    microbiota to preserve natural resources and develop more resilient crops, contributing
    to the advancement of environmentally friendly agriculture. (Custódio et al. 2022)
    Acknowledging the intricate connections between soil health, climate change, and
    the complex plant-microbiota interactions, targeting soil health and climate change
    has been identified as one of the priority areas, where the UK-Argentina collaboration
    could bring complementary knowledge, expertise, and know-how from and to both
    countries to address the shared challenges posed by global warming and environmental
    variability in both countries. As an example, global warming signs can be seen
    in the UK in recent years, with extreme weather leading to droughts and flooding
    that are becoming a problem in crop production. The climate in Argentina is hotter
    in general, with the predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
    [IPCC] suggesting that this situation is likely to get aggravated with the addition
    of increased localised torrential rainfalls in some areas. (IPCC 2022) The abiotic
    stress conditions such as drought, excess water and increasing temperatures in
    soils, are considered the most significant factors reducing agricultural productivity
    nowadays. Therefore, knowledge on how to manage soil health and crop production
    under increasing temperatures, droughts or excess water conditions could be transferred
    between the UK and Argentina. The aim of this proposed research area is to investigate
    and understand the dynamics of the relations between soil health, climate change
    and the adaptation strategies used by plants and microbes to cope with shifting
    environmental conditions. The ultimate goal will be to use this knowledge to maintain
    soil health and enhance agricultural productivity. This area interlinks strongly
    with the actions proposed in the ‘Priority Area 1’ and the proposed collaborative
    activities include: Maintaining focus on two different crop types, which are common
    to both regions: wheat [grain] and potatoes [root]. Sampling and sequencing the
    microbiota from biofilms commonly associated with potatoes and wheat roots in
    both countries under different environmental conditions [temperatures, rain fall,
    and compaction], and build collections of fully sequenced microbial isolates that
    contain the main determined taxonomic categories of microbes. Identification of
    environment-specific beneficial microbiota across the two countries, followed
    by validation, under controlled conditions and with the use designed microbial
    synthetic communities, of the importance of the identified microbes for crops
    performance under stress conditions. Optimisation of microbial combinations to
    be exploited in agricultural practices to provide protection to crops against
    droughts, floods and soil compaction. These microbial combinations should be designed
    to also contain beneficial traits associated with increased carbon sequestration
    in the roots, produce stable organic matter, and protect against plant pathogens.
    These approaches should lead to sustained agricultural production under changing
    environmental conditions. Intelligent seeds For many important crops, the cultivation
    cycle begins with a direct sowing of seeds. The use of seed coating technologies
    enables uniform distribution of inoculants, including plant beneficial microbes,
    (Custódio et al. 2022; Simonin et al. 2022) to the surface of the seeds. This
    maximises stable crop production while reducing the use of agrochemicals. The
    concept of “intelligent seed” has not yet been validated and forms a central focus
    of the proposed collaborative activities. The term ‘intelligent seed’ can encompass
    various perspectives but most of them are centred around tracing plant processes
    from the seed. One proposed strategy involves utilising high biofilm-producing
    microorganisms to enhance microbial survival in both seeds and plants through
    the colonisation in the rhizosphere. It has to be noted that the coating of seeds
    with biofilm may not necessarily be the method for introducing microorganisms
    into the seeds and rhizosphere. Sandhya et al. (Sandhya et al. 2009) demonstrated
    that inoculation of seed in a culture of biofilm-producing Pseudomonas putida,
    yielding a high content of exopolysaccharide, significantly increased the survival
    and biomass of Helianthus annuus [sunflower] under drought stress, highlighting
    the protective role of biofilms on root surfaces. For insights into the formulation
    of seed coatings as tools for delivering beneficial microbes to agricultural crops,
    we refer readers to Rocha et al. (Rocha et al. 2019) There is a growing need for
    approaches which would facilitate the use of customised microbial consortia. There
    is also an increasing demand for tailored formulations to enhance the flow and
    plantability of film-coated crops in the open field environment. The area of research
    proposed here aims to establish a correlation between the biofilm production capacity
    of various microorganisms, their multiplication in fermenters [liquid or solid],
    their survival capacity on seeds and in the rhizosphere post-inoculation, followed
    by the monitoring of plant development and health. Argentina has been developing
    state-of-the-art multipurpose seed coatings, which can incorporate both chemicals
    and digital technologies [seed-chips] providing real-time data on the impact of
    these chemicals on plant health parameters. These coatings have the potential
    to incorporate microbes which can form beneficial biofilms on plant roots upon
    germination. This would enable real-time monitoring of the impact of different
    inoculants on plant health. Currently, these technologies are only used in small
    field trials and would require suitable monitoring systems for large scale trials.
    To address the need for the development and implementation of technologies which
    enable large scale field monitoring, the UK has been developing advanced soil
    and growth monitoring technologies such as drone-based field monitoring and ground
    penetrating radars [GPR] which are increasingly applied by farmers for scouting
    and logistics in large fields. In addition, it has also been developing the next
    generation of sensor capabilities to monitor soil environmental parameters. The
    scale of arable cropping in Argentina provides an opportunity to gather large
    datasets, facilitating the development of crop modelling. These models could,
    subsequently, be extrapolated to inform the crop farming under the UK climate.
    In the UK, the models could be validated and refined using in-field sensors and
    regular UAV imaging, incorporating technologies such as LIDAR, hyperspectral and
    multispectral imaging. Based on the above complementary capabilities between Argentina
    and the UK the following collaborative activities are proposed to develop intelligent
    seeds and innovative monitoring systems, which would enable agile optimisation
    of inoculants based on their impact on plant health and soil parameters: Incorporation
    of beneficial biofilm-forming microbes in seed coatings containing the chip technology
    developed in Argentina, using already tested and well-performing microbial inoculants
    to provide a solid starting point. Development of drone-based monitoring systems
    in the UK for real-time reading of chips used in seeds. Development of pilot green-house
    experiments to enable monitoring of the effectiveness of drones in recording plant
    / soil health parameters induced by coated seeds related to plant infection control,
    followed by performance assessment of the system. Implementation of large field
    trials using optimised ground penetrating radars on fields seeded with intelligent
    coated seeds with different inoculants, containing biofilm-forming microorganisms,
    to compare their performance via monitoring plant / soil health parameters. Standardised
    databases would be built from the collected data, to inform performance optimisation
    of seed biofilm-forming inoculants. Conclusions International collaboration is
    essential for advancing global agricultural innovation and establishing sustainable
    food systems. Here, we describe the outcomes of discussions held between the UK
    and Argentina, highlighting three priority areas that could profit from future
    research collaborations between the two countries, while recognising that the
    topics described in this ‘white paper'' would be applicable to partnerships and
    cooperations between different countries and regions globally. For the three priority
    areas identified, early engagement of end users [farmers] will be paramount to
    maximise technology adoption. Business models of long-term cooperation will need
    to be established to maximise impact. There are many benefits that would come
    from building networks and collaborations between the UK and Argentina, yet the
    commitment from governments and support from funding bodies will be essential
    for the establishment of robust research programmes and long-term successful collaborations
    between researchers, industry and end users across both countries. Availability

    neonicotinoids in some Anopheles populations. Graphical Abstract Background Prevention
    based on chemical control of vector populations has contributed to a significant
    reduction in malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa over the past two decades [1].
    Chemical interventions rely heavily on repurposing of agrochemicals, which provides
    a rapid and cost-effective approach for screening new active ingredients used
    against vector populations [2, 3]. To effectively control Anopheles populations
    that are resistant to existing insecticides, dozens of agrochemicals have recently
    been tested against adult mosquitoes, and some promising candidates have been
    identified [2, 4,5,6,7]. However, cross-resistance—which occurs when resistance
    to one insecticide reduces susceptibility to another active ingredient, even where
    the insect has not been exposed to the latter product—can impact the efficacy
    of some agrochemicals against mosquitoes [8, 9]. For example, prior to the deployment
    of bed nets impregnated with pyrethroids across Africa, cross-resistance between
    dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroids as well as agricultural
    spraying drove resistance detected in some areas in West Africa [10]. Moreover,
    an important resistant mechanism currently widespread in Anopheles mosquitoes
    involves overexpression of detoxification enzymes that metabolize or prevent the
    insecticide from reaching its target within the cell [11, 12]. Metabolic resistance
    due to increased activity of detoxifying enzymes, including esterases (ESTs),
    glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs),
    is not specific. Therefore, enzymes selected by the exposure to existing insecticides
    can be used to metabolize new active ingredients. Classes of agrochemicals, including
    neonicotinoids, that are widely used for crop protection are particularly exposed
    to resistance development due to residual pesticides. Additionally, cross-resistance
    and CYP-based detoxification are both very common mechanisms leading to increased
    tolerance to neonicotinoids in insect pests [13,14,15,16,17]. Neonicotinoids,
    a class of eight insecticides, are among the most widely used pesticides in agriculture
    worldwide [18, 19]. They act as agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
    in the insect’s nervous system and create overstimulation which may result in
    paralysis and death [19]. Four formulations of clothianidin and one of imidacloprid,
    two neonicotinoids, are among the prequalified products for indoor residual spraying
    and space spraying targeting malaria vectors [20,21,22,23]. On the other hand,
    hundreds of formulations of imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, and acetamiprid
    are registered for crop protection and are intensively applied in some African
    countries [24, 25]. These chemicals are highly water-soluble and persistent in
    the environment, and thus may leach into surface waters [26,27,28]. In tropical
    regions, rain and human activities create puddles in farmlands, which become ideal
    breeding sites for malaria-carrying mosquito species such as Anopheles gambiae,
    An. arabiensis, and An. coluzzii [29,30,31]. When these breeding sites are contaminated
    with pesticides, chronic residual exposure can contribute to pre-adaptation of
    larval populations to synthetic chemicals [8]. Recent studies assessing the susceptibility
    of adult Anopheles mosquitoes to neonicotinoids suggested that some populations
    are developing resistance [32,33,34,35]. Cross-resistance driven by the spraying
    of agricultural neonicotinoids is suspected to be the main cause of resistance
    to clothianidin—an active ingredient which is not used in agriculture and has
    yet to be applied in public health programs. However, some wild An. funestus adult
    populations that are presumably not exposed to neonicotinoid residues in their
    larval habitat also display reduced susceptibility to some lethal concentrations
    of clothianidin [36]. This suggests that even without residual exposure, overexpression
    of preselected metabolic resistance enzymes may enhance the tolerance to neonicotinoids
    in some mosquito species [15,16,17]. Thus, evaluating the baseline susceptibility
    of wild anopheline populations as well as the impact of residual pesticide exposure
    and metabolic resistance enzymes on susceptibility could provide critical information
    for predicting the efficacy of neonicotinoids against anopheline populations.
    In Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, agricultural activities associated with intensive
    use of pesticides are pervasive in suburban and rural settings in the outskirts
    of the city. Mixtures containing neonicotinoids such as acetamiprid, imidacloprid,
    and thiamethoxam, as well as pyrethroids and fungicides, are frequently sprayed
    on diverse crops, creating ideal conditions for contamination of surface waters
    [24, 37]. By contrast, the center of the city provides an island where surface
    waters and aquatic species are less exposed to pesticide contamination. Two sibling
    species with contrasting susceptibility to neonicotinoids are sympatric in Yaoundé.
    Anopheles coluzzii adults—the only species present in densely urbanized areas
    of the city—remains susceptible to neonicotinoids, while its sibling species An.
    gambiae, which occurs in the countryside, has developed resistance [33, 34, 38].
    This geographical area thus provides a suitable geographical setting for assessing
    variability in susceptibility to neonicotinoids between closely related Anopheles
    species. Most studies evaluating baseline susceptibility to new insecticides focus
    on testing insecticide-induced mortality in adult mosquitoes [2, 4, 7, 39,40,41,42].
    Although the level of tolerance among immature stages can provide insights into
    the role of residual pesticide exposure in resistance selection, this aspect has
    received little attention. Here, we followed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines
    for testing of mosquito larvicides [43] to simultaneously assess the lethal effects
    (mortality) and some sublethal endpoints (survival, growth, and emergence) in
    An. gambiae and An. coluzzii. Larvae were collected from Yaoundé and exposed to
    lethal concentrations of a pyrrole (chlorfenapyr), a pyrethroid (deltamethrin),
    or three neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and clothianidin). We found
    that in contrast to An. coluzzii, some An. gambiae larvae, especially populations
    from agricultural settings, were able to survive, grow, and emerge in water containing
    lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids. A stronger adaptation to acetamiprid
    and imidacloprid—two neonicotinoids that are widely used for crop protection in
    Cameroon and are known to be persistent in soil–water systems—was observed. We
    discussed the role of pesticide exposure and of cross-resistance mechanisms in
    the development of neonicotinoid resistance in immature stages of Anopheles mosquitoes.
    Methods Study sites The study was carried out in urban and suburban areas of Yaoundé,
    the capital of Cameroon. Yaoundé lies in the equatorial forest domain of central
    Africa. Urban areas are surrounded by rural settings characterized by degraded
    forests. The city experiences four climatic regimes, with two rainy seasons and
    two dry seasons. Approval to conduct a study in the Center Region (no. 1-140/L/MINSANTE/SG/RDPH-Ce),
    ethical clearance (no. 1-141/CRERSH/2020), and research permit (no. 000133/MINRESI/B00/C00/C10/C13)
    were granted by the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Scientific Research
    and Innovation of Cameroon. We surveyed four sites, including farmland located
    in the suburbs (Nkolondom, 3°56′43″ N, 11°3′01″ E), two densely urbanized neighborhoods
    (Etoa Meki, 3°52′53″ N, 11°31′40″ E and Combattant, 3°52′53″ N, 11°31′40″ E),
    and another suburban area (Nkolnkoumou, 3°52′29″ N, 11°23′2″ E) (Fig. 1). The
    average distance between sites was 4–5 km. Fig. 1 Examples of breeding sites where
    wild mosquito larvae were sampled. Anopheles gambiae larvae were collected from
    standing water between furrows and ridges in the agricultural area (A) or from
    puddles created by human activities in Nkolnkoumou (suburban area) (B). Anopheles
    coluzzii larvae were sampled from human-made puddles in densely urbanized settings
    (C) Full size image Sampling The study focused on the two sibling species An.
    gambiae and An. coluzzii—belonging to the An. gambiae complex [An. gambiae sensu
    lato (s.l.)]—which are the most abundant malaria vector populations in Yaoundé
    [31, 44, 45]. Larvae were collected from locations where extensive surveys have
    been conducted on An. gambiae s.l. populations for several years. The geographical
    distribution and relative frequencies of the two sibling species An. gambiae and
    An. coluzzii in Yaoundé have been well studied [31, 33, 34, 45, 46]. The nominal
    species An. gambiae sensu stricto (hereafter referred to as An. gambiae) is the
    only member of the species complex present in the agricultural site Nkolondom,
    whereas the most densely urbanized areas (e.g., Combattant and Etoa Meki) harbor
    exclusively An. coluzzii [45,46,47]. Populations from the suburban neighborhood,
    Nkolnkoumou, are a mixture of ~ 80% An. gambiae and 20% An. coluzzii [33, 34,
    38]. Typical An. gambiae s.l. breeding sites were inspected during the rainy seasons
    in 2022, and larvae were collected using the standard dipping method [48]. Larvae
    were transported in plastic containers to the insectary where they were identified
    as species using reference morphological keys [49, 50] and immediately tested
    in a controlled room (27 °C, 80% relative humidity, light/dark = 12:12 h). In
    rural and urban settings, larvae thrive in rain-dependent puddles [31]. In the
    agricultural site, Nkolondom, An. gambiae larvae occur in standing waters created
    by the rain and/or irrigation between furrows and ridges (Fig. 1). Breeding sites
    contain high concentrations of organic pollutants in some densely urbanized settings
    and are likely contaminated with pesticide residues in agricultural areas in Yaoundé
    [31, 45]. Insecticides We selected and tested five insecticides with different
    levels of application in agriculture and in public health in Cameroon. This included
    two neonicotinoids (acetamiprid and imidacloprid), which are known to be highly
    persistent in soil and surface waters and are among the most widely used pesticides
    in Cameroon [27, 37]. Imidacloprid is also the active ingredient in a formulation
    prequalified for indoor/outdoor space spraying [23]. A third neonicotinoid (clothianidin)
    which is also persistent but is not currently used in agriculture or in public
    health in Cameroon was tested [24, 37, 51]. Clothianidin is the active ingredient
    in four new indoor residual spraying formulations [23]. We also tested chlorfenapyr,
    a pyrrole, and deltamethrin, a pyrethroid. Chlorfenapyr is used in a new generation
    of long-lasting insecticidal nets that have not yet been officially deployed on
    a large scale in Cameroon [23, 52]. Deltamethrin is a pyrethroid used in long-lasting
    insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying for two decades which can also
    be found in a variety of crop-protection formulations registered in Cameroon [10,
    37]. The following commercial formulations were tested: chlorfenapyr (Pestanal,
    analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich), acetamiprid (Aceplant 40EC, 40 g/l, emulsifiable
    concentrate, JACO, Yaoundé, Cameroon), imidacloprid (Plantima 30SC, 30 g/l, concentrated
    suspension, JACO, Yaoundé, Cameroon), clothianidin (Pestanal, analytical standard,
    Sigma-Aldrich), and deltamethrin (Decis 25EC, 25 g/l, emulsifiable concentrate,
    Bayer Cropscience S.L., Valencia, Spain). Stock solutions were prepared by diluting
    the formulation in absolute ethanol or distilled water. Lethal concentration determination
    To assess the lethal and sublethal effects of each insecticide, we reared field-collected
    larvae in water containing a nominal concentration of the insecticide causing
    100% mortality in a susceptible strain within 24 h (lethal concentration), and
    we measured mortality as well as some life history parameters. The mosquito life
    cycle includes four larval stages prior to pupation and emergence of a male or
    female adult [48]. The four stages comprise the first (L1), second (L2), third
    (L3), and fourth (L4) instars and can last between 1 and 2 weeks depending on
    the mosquito species, the feeding regime, and the environmental conditions. We
    monitored mortality and life table parameters from L3 to emergence. Third-instar
    larvae of Anopheles are abundant in the wild, are easy to identify morphologically,
    and typically complete transformation into L4, pupation, and emergence within
    approximately 7 days. The lethal concentration used for each insecticide was determined
    as follows: we exposed L3 larvae of the susceptible strain An. gambiae Kisumu
    to increasing concentrations of the insecticide, starting from 0.001 mg/l, and
    we retained the lowest concentration causing 100% mortality within 24 h. Anopheles
    gambiae Kisumu, established as a laboratory strain since 1975, is susceptible
    to common classes of insecticides used in mosquito control, including pyrethroids,
    organophosphates, carbamates, and organochlorines. Four replicates were tested
    for each insecticide dose in addition to a control without insecticide (i.e.,
    containing only water). This experimental setup based on WHO guidelines for laboratory
    and field testing of mosquito larvicides has been successfully used to evaluate
    survival in larvae of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti reared in water
    containing a pesticide [43, 53]. Batches of 25 larvae were placed in 500-ml plastic
    trays filled with 200 ml of borehole water containing the desired concentration
    of insecticide and covered with a net. Borehole water was used for routine maintenance
    of Anopheles mosquito colonies in the insectary and was thus preferred to distilled
    water. Water was collected from a borehole located in Odza, Yaoundé (3°47′60.0″N,
    11°31′60.0″E). To minimize variability, we collected a large quantity of water
    that was used for all the experiments. Biological activity testing Larvae were
    collected from the field in the morning and brought to the insectary. Third-instar
    larvae were sorted immediately and rinsed in a tray containing borehole water
    before being transferred into test trays. Four replicates of 25 larvae were tested
    in 500-ml plastic trays that were filled with 200 ml borehole water containing
    the lethal concentration of the insecticide detected as described above. For each
    insecticide, a control test was conducted concomitantly by rearing two batches
    of 25 larvae in water alone. Water was not changed throughout the experiment,
    and 10 mg of TetraMin® fish food was added to each tray daily. Every 24 h, the
    number of L3, L4, pupae, and adults was counted in each tray. Larvae were considered
    dead if they were unable to move when touched with a dropper. Dead larvae were
    removed from the test containers and were not replaced. Adults were also removed
    using a mouth aspirator. Survival, growth, pupation, and emergence were assessed
    daily for 7 days, which was sufficient for L3 larvae to reach the adult stage.
    Data analysis The lethal endpoint of insecticide exposure was assessed using the
    mortality rate at 24 h. The sublethal effects of the different insecticides were
    addressed using survival probability as well as L4 transformation rate, pupation
    rate, and emergence rate. L4 transformation rate was defined as the percentage
    of L3 larvae transformed into L4 at a given time point. Pupation rate represented
    the percentage of L3 that made it to the pupa stage, and emergence rate the percentage
    of L3 that reached the adult stage. Mean and standard error, computed with the
    packages plyr and ggplot2 in R (version 4.2.), were used to estimate L4 transformation
    rate, pupation rate, and emergence rate at 24-h intervals. Fisher’s exact test
    was applied for pairwise comparisons between populations. The ratio between the
    number of dead larvae and the initial number of individuals was calculated every
    24 h and provided an estimate of survival probability. Kaplan–Meier survival curves
    were plotted using the packages ggplot 2, ggfortify, and survival in R [54]. Larvae
    that reached the adult stage were treated as censored data. Confidence intervals
    were computed for the four replicates, and a log-rank test was used to determine
    if survival was significantly different between treatments and between populations.
    Results 24-hour lethal toxicity We studied the lethal and sublethal effects of
    agrochemicals on field-collected Anopheles larvae using lethal concentrations
    of 0.10 mg/l for chlorfenapyr, 0.035 mg/l for clothianidin, 0.075 mg/l for imidacloprid,
    0.15 mg/l for acetamiprid, and 1.5 mg/l for deltamethrin. The pyrrole chlorfenapyr
    was the most toxic among the five insecticides tested. All field-collected larvae
    were fully susceptible to this insecticide and were killed within 24 h (Fig. 2).
    By contrast, neither neonicotinoids nor deltamethrin were able to cause 100% mortality
    within 24 h in wild larvae. In water containing neonicotinoids or deltamethrin,
    mortality was significantly lower in all field-collected larvae compared to the
    susceptible strain An. gambiae Kisumu (Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.05). Mortality
    rates were typically below 40% in deltamethrin. Pairwise comparisons also revealed
    that An. gambiae larvae from Nkolondom displayed lower mortality to deltamethrin
    compared to the sister population (Nkolnkoumou, Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.005)
    and to immature stages of An. coluzzii collected from Etoa Meki (Fisher’s exact
    test, P = 0.003). Susceptibility to neonicotinoids varied strongly between species
    and geographical areas. Anopheles coluzzii larvae collected from the two urban
    neighborhoods, Combattant and Etoa Meki, were more susceptible, with mortality
    rates between 70 and 80%, except clothianidin, for which only about 50% of larvae
    were killed after 24 h. Both An. coluzzii populations displayed comparable mortality
    in clothianidin (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.87), in acetamiprid (P = 0.62), and
    in imidacloprid (P = 1) (Fig. 2). Conversely, An. gambiae larvae were substantially
    more tolerant to neonicotinoids, especially individuals collected from the farm
    (Nkolondom), which displayed less than 10% mortality in water containing the insecticide.
    Mortality rates were also significantly lower among larvae from Nkolondom compared
    to conspecific individuals collected from Nkolnkoumou in acetamiprid (Fisher’s
    exact test, P < 0.0001), in clothianidin (P < 0.0001), and in imidacloprid (P < 0.0001).
    Fig. 2 24-h mortality of mosquito larvae reared in water containing a lethal concentration
    of agrochemical. A concentration killing 100% of larvae from the susceptible strain
    An. gambiae Kisumu was used to test field-collected individuals. Wild populations
    were susceptible to chlorfenapyr but showed varying levels of tolerance to four
    other agrochemicals. Mortality values were lowest in An. gambiae larvae collected
    from an agricultural area (Nkolondom). Error bars represent the standard error
    of the mean. *Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.05 Full size image Survival probability
    Rearing field-collected larvae in water containing a lethal concentration of agrochemical
    affected their survival probability as revealed by Kaplan–Meier survival curves
    (Fig. 3). Larvae that survived lethal toxicity within the first 24 h were monitored
    for 7 days. Survival within 7 days mirrored the results of 24-h mortality and
    confirmed high fitness of some Anopheles larval populations in water containing
    a lethal concentration of a neonicotinoid of deltamethrin. There was no significant
    difference in survival between the two An. coluzzii larval populations tested
    in deltamethrin or in neonicotinoids (P > 0.05, log-rank test) (Fig. 3). In deltamethrin,
    An. gambiae larvae from Nkolondom had a higher survival probability compared to
    immature stages of An. coluzzii from Etoa Meki (log-rank test, P < 0.0001) and
    to those of An. gambiae from Nkolnkoumou (P = 0.005). When field-collected larvae
    were reared in water containing a neonicotinoid, differences in survival were
    more pronounced between the sibling species An. gambiae and An. coluzzii. Notably,
    An. gambiae larvae from Nkolondom had significantly higher survival rates in acetamiprid
    (log-rank test, P < 0.0001) and in imidacloprid (P < 0.0001) compared to the urban
    population of An. coluzzii (Etoa Meki). In water containing clothianidin, immature
    stages from the agricultural site (Nkolondom) displayed higher survival compared
    to conspecific (Nkolnkoumou, log-rank test, P = 3.13E−07) and to heterospecific
    (Etoa Meki, P < 0.0001) larval populations. Survival of 100% was obtained in all
    control experiments without insecticide. Fig. 3 Kaplan–Meier survival curves (lines)

    image L4 transformation rate Focusing on neonicotinoids, we used life table analysis
    to further dissect some of the sublethal adjustments that likely contribute to
    the development of resistance to repurposed agrochemicals in Anopheles larvae.
    We started by comparing L4 transformation rate between field-collected larval
    populations. Consistent with their high tolerance revealed by mortality and survival
    analyses, a large proportion of An. gambiae L3 larvae were able to turn into L4
    in water containing a lethal concentration of neonicotinoid (Fig. 4a). The highest
    transformation rate was observed in populations from Nkolondom: 90 ± 3% in water
    containing acetamiprid followed by 75 ± 9% in imidacloprid within 2 days and 60 ± 3%
    in clothianidin after 3 days. Similarly, in larvae collected from Nkolnkoumou,
    a semi-rural site harboring ~ 80% An. gambiae, transformation rates varied from
    60 ± 6% for acetamiprid, to 35 ± 16% and 23 ± 7% for imidacloprid and clothianidin,
    respectively, after 2–4 days. On the other hand, An. coluzzii larvae were strongly
    inhibited in water treated with a neonicotinoid, leading to very low transformation
    rates between 0 and 10% among immature stages from Etoa Meki or Combattant. No
    difference in transformation rate was observed between both An. coluzzii populations
    (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.216). Conversely, the rate of transformation from
    L3 to L4 in acetamiprid, imidacloprid, or clothianidin was eightfold (P < 0.0001),
    ninefold (P < 0.0001), and fourfold (P < 0.0001) higher, respectively, in An.
    gambiae larvae from Nkolondom compared to immature stages of An. coluzzii samples
    from Etoa Meki. Similarly, An. gambiae larvae from the agricultural site had higher
    transformation rates in neonicotinoids compared to those collected from Nkolnkoumou
    in the suburban area (Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.05) (Fig. 4a). In control tests
    (without insecticide), transformation rates were 100% after 2–3 days, and there
    was no significant difference between the four field populations (P > 0.05). Fig.

    image Pupation rate Pupation rate was consistent with L4 transformation and highlighted
    the low susceptibility of agricultural and semi-rural populations of An. gambiae
    to neonicotinoids (Fig. 4b). The agricultural population of An. gambiae (Nkolondom)
    had the highest pupation rates, 77.5 ± 4% in water containing acetamiprid, and
    45 ± 11% in imidacloprid. The exotic insecticide, clothianidin, at a nominal concentration
    of 0.035 mg/l, had the strongest inhibitory effect among neonicotinoids, although
    15–20% of An. gambiae larvae completed pupation. Anopheles coluzzii larvae had
    low pupation rates with less than 5% pupae obtained in any neonicotinoid tested.
    Notably, none of the An. coluzzii populations were able to pupate in clothianidin.
    Pupation rate was significantly higher in larvae from Nkolondom versus Nkolnkoumou
    in acetamiprid (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.004) and in imidacloprid (P = 2.77E−2)
    but not in clothianidin (P = 0.063). All larvae reached the pupa stage in all
    the control tests within 72 h, and there was no difference between larval populations
    reared in water without insecticide (P > 0.05). Emergence rate All (100%) An.
    gambiae and An. coluzzii pupae emerged in control water without insecticide between
    the first and the sixth day in standard laboratory conditions. The emergence rate
    of An. coluzzii larvae was 0%, 2%, and 4% in water containing clothianidin, acetamiprid,
    or imidacloprid, respectively, after 6 days (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, at least half
    of An. gambiae L3 larvae tested emerged between 2 and 7 days in acetamiprid and
    in imidacloprid. Only An. gambiae larvae collected from Nkolondom were able to
    emerge in clothianidin, albeit at a lower rate (7 ± 3%) compared to the other
    neonicotinoids. The emergence rate after 6 days in acetamiprid and in imidacloprid
    was 32-fold (Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.0001) and eightfold (P < 0.0001) higher,
    respectively, in An. gambiae larvae (Nkolondom) compared to juveniles of An. coluzzii
    (Etoa Meki). Within the An. gambiae species, larvae from the farm emerged at a
    higher rate compared to individuals form Nkolnkoumou in imidacloprid (P = 0.012)
    and in clothianidin (P = 0.014), but not in acetamiprid (P = 0.249). Discussion
    In this study, we have used standard bioassays to simultaneously assess the lethal
    and residual effects of pesticide exposure in mosquito larvae. We found that monitoring
    some sublethal changes in a controlled aquatic environment provides critical information
    on the current level of tolerance in larval populations. We have hypothesized
    that larval susceptibility profiles could provide complementary information for
    predicting the efficacy of repurposed agrochemicals against adult mosquitoes.
    However, the susceptibility of larvae to an active ingredient does not necessarily
    reflect that of adults and vice versa [43, 55]. Immature stages of insect pests
    can be more susceptible or more resistant to some insecticides than adults. Nevertheless,
    by comparing larval tolerance detected in this study to the susceptibility profiles
    of the corresponding adult populations tested in complementary surveys [33, 34,
    38], we could establish that any agrochemical killing less than 50% of wild-caught
    larvae after 24 h and allowing more than 5% emergence within 6 days is likely
    to have limited efficacy against Anopheles adult populations. Precisely, larval
    and adult susceptibility to neonicotinoids follow similar trends. Our results
    showed that larval populations whose adults were resistant to a neonicotinoid
    (i.e., mortality against the discriminating dose < 90%) typically displayed between
    3 and 45% mortality within 24 h and 7–60% emergence after 6 days in water containing
    a lethal concentration of the active ingredient [33, 34, 38]. Testing a larger
    number of insecticides on diverse Anopheles species would provide more robust
    guidelines for interpreting mortality, growth, and emergence of larvae reared
    in pesticide-laced water. Exposure of non-target insect species to sublethal doses
    of insecticides affects functions such as motility, behavior, growth, fecundity,
    and survival [27, 53, 56,57,58,59]. According to surveys conducted worldwide,
    the concentrations of neonicotinoids tested in the present study fell in the upper
    limits of average values that have previously been detected in contaminated waters
    and soils [26,27,28, 60]. Information on the level of contamination in agricultural
    areas such as Nkolondom is lacking, but neonicotinoids are extensively used for
    crop protection in this village, and mosquito larvae are presumably chronically
    exposed to pesticide residues [33]. Tomé et al. [53] showed that at concentrations
    varying from 0.1 to 15 particles per million (ppm), the insecticides azadirachtin,
    deltamethrin, imidacloprid, and spinosad displayed concentration-dependent effects
    on survival and motility in larvae and pupae from a laboratory strain of the yellow
    fever mosquito Ae. aegypti. Compared to Aedes mosquitoes, the An. gambiae Kisumu
    strain we tested was susceptible to lower insecticide doses, since 100% larval
    mortality was reached within 24 h with concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 1.5
    ppm. However, field-collected larvae of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii exhibit varying
    degrees of adaptation to the sublethal effects of exposure to neonicotinoids and
    deltamethrin in aquatic habitats. In a recent study, Wu et al. [59] revealed that
    survival rate decreased by 51.4%, 60.7%, and 48.6%, respectively, when F0 generations
    of the invasive pest Spodoptera frugiperda were exposed to sublethal concentrations
    (LC30) of chlorantraniliprole, dinotefuran, and beta-cypermethrin. In the present
    study, an approximately 50% survival rate was observed in An. gambiae larvae exposed
    to a lethal dose (LC99) of acetamiprid or imidacloprid. Similarly, in contrast
    to An. coluzzii, the pupation rate was not strongly impaired in An. gambiae larvae
    reared in a lethal concentration of neonicotinoids. For example, 70% of L3 An.
    gambiae achieved the pupal stage within 6 days in 0.15 ppm of acetamiprid. In
    comparison, a pupation rate of 70–80% has been observed in juveniles of Plutella
    xylostella exposed to a significantly lower dose (LC20) of emamectin benzoate
    [58]. Afza et al. [61] revealed that six synthetic insecticides (imidacloprid,
    thiamethoxam, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, and profenofos)
    at their sublethal doses (LC30) suppressed the emergence of adults of Coccinella
    septempunctata, whereas in our study, between 7 and 60% of An. gambiae larvae
    emerged in lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids. Residual pesticide exposure
    is an important driver of resistance to public health insecticides [32, 62,63,64,65,66,67].
    It has been hypothesized that resistance is selected in larval breeding sites
    where immature stages are unintentionally exposed to pesticide residues, and that
    this tolerance is expressed in adult populations [8]. We conducted a laboratory
    experiment to assess larval susceptibility, which provides key information on
    the selective processes that likely lead to the emergence of Anopheles larval
    populations with increased tolerance to some agrochemicals. In our study, mortality
    rates and life table parameters in wild larvae reared in artificial media containing
    a lethal concentration of the active ingredient revealed gradients of tolerance,
    likely reflecting past exposure to pesticide residues in nature. Based on mortality,
    survival, growth, pupation, and emergence rates, the least effective insecticides
    against An. gambiae larvae were acetamiprid and imidacloprid, two widely used
    neonicotinoids known to be highly persistent in soil and water [24, 28, 57, 68].
    This result suggests that residual pesticide exposure likely plays a key role
    in Anopheles larval resistance to neonicotinoids. This hypothesis has been supported
    by a laboratory experiment demonstrating that exposure of Anopheles larvae to
    sublethal concentrations of a mixture containing several herbicides, pesticides,
    and fungicides resulted in ~ 2.5 increase in tolerance to clothianidin [69]. Moreover,
    neonicotinoid resistance in An. gambiae and An. coluzzii adults is strongest in
    agricultural areas, suggesting a correlation between the use of agricultural neonicotinoids
    and resistance development. Expectedly, chlorfenapyr, which is unlikely to be
    a residual contaminant in breeding sites and has yet to be extensively used in
    public vector control programs, was highly toxic to An. gambiae and An. coluzzii
    larvae from Yaoundé. Deltamethrin, a pyrethroid widely used for crop protection
    in Cameroon, revealed low short-term larvicidal activity, but reduced survival
    within 7 days more effectively than acetamiprid and imidacloprid. Clothianidin
    also significantly inhibited growth, pupation, and emergence compared to acetamiprid
    and imidacloprid, although 7% of An. gambiae larvae from the farm emerged within
    7 days. This pattern is consistent with cross-resistance conferred by residual
    exposure to neonicotinoids used for crop protection and/or by some preselected
    metabolic resistance enzymes. However, the sample size of our study is small,
    and further surveys across a large geographical area are needed to further investigate
    the correlation between pesticide residues and the development of resistance to
    neonicotinoids. Larvae of the sibling species An. gambiae and An. coluzzii displayed
    similar levels of susceptibility to chlorfenapyr and to deltamethrin but exhibited
    striking variation in tolerance to neonicotinoids. This result reflects susceptibility
    profiles described in adult populations from Yaoundé: An. coluzzii adults are
    generally susceptible to neonicotinoids, while An. gambiae is resistant to at
    least four different active ingredients [33, 34, 38]. Variations have been observed
    in the level of resistance to pyrethroids as well as the frequency of some resistance
    alleles between An. gambiae and An. coluzzii from Yaoundé [70,71,72]. The intensity
    of overexpression of some CYPs and GSTs also differs between An. gambiae and An.
    coluzzii from this area [47]. Some of these enzymes could be involved in metabolic
    resistance to neonicotinoids and could contribute to the observed variation in
    susceptibility among larvae and adults of both species. On the other hand, in
    addition to potential specie-specific metabolic resistance, varying levels of
    selection pressure in their habitats may also explain the difference between An.
    gambiae and An. coluzzii. Notably, agricultural practices associated with the
    spaying of neonicotinoids are more prevalent in the countryside, and therefore
    An. gambiae may be more exposed to neonicotinoid residues than urban An. coluzzii
    mosquitoes. Although our findings are based on only two Anopheles species sampled
    from a relatively small geographical area, the results highlight levels of resistance
    that could be an obstacle to the use of neonicotinoids for malaria prevention
    [2, 32,33,34, 42]. Moreover, it has been shown that neonicotinoid-resistant adult
    mosquitoes from the Nkolondom farm display reduce susceptibility to SumiShield®
    50WG, a clothianidin formulation prequalified for indoor residual spraying [33].
    Future research directions include testing immature stages from different Anopheles
    species while evaluating their degree of exposure to neonicotinoid residues in
    larval habitats. A better understanding of the role of some detoxification enzymes
    will also provide critical insights into the cross-resistance mechanisms contributing
    to the emergence of neonicotinoid resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes. Conclusions
    Repurposing of agrochemicals has thus far provided a rapid mechanism for identifying
    new candidate insecticides used for malaria prevention. The example of neonicotinoids
    emphasizes the crucial role of evaluating susceptibility and cross-resistance
    in larval populations. Such information could be complementary to routine adult
    susceptibility testing based on standard mortality-based bioassays. Combining
    both approaches may offer a more robust framework to better evaluate preexisting
    levels of adaptation to agrochemicals used for malaria prevention. Availability

    management, restoration plans, and payment for ecosystem service policies, which
    is conducive to achieving regional sustainable development and improving human
    well-being. Peer Review reports Background Opencast mining, especially surface
    mining, is one of the most intense human disturbances to terrestrial ecosystems,
    often causing drastic changes in Ecosystem Services [1]. Opencast mining destroys
    the surface soil, vegetation, topography and other features, results in removal
    or modification of areas of natural ecosystems [2], affecting their capacity to
    supply Ecosystem Services Value (ESV). In China, the areas of opencast mining
    reached 4746 km2 in 2015, with an increase by 2.7 times after 2000, most of which
    are concentrated in arid and semi-arid regions, where ESV have declined to varying
    degrees in the mining areas [3]. Understanding the effect of opencast mining on
    ESV can provide guidance for ecological restoration in mining areas, and also
    provide a basis for sustainable management of mining areas. Opencast mining throughout
    the life of mine, from exploration and development to post-closure, have been
    impacting the ESV in mining areas. In the early stage of mining, the construction
    of infrastructure and roads will cause changes in land use, especially affecting
    the provisioning and regulating services of ecosystems [4]. During the mining
    process, on the one hand, mining causes direct damage to the surface ecosystem
    [3], on the other hand, it also disrupts the original water cycle process, leading
    to problems such as reduction of surface water system [5], decline of groundwater
    level [6], etc., resulting in the decline of ecosystem regulating and supporting
    services. After the mining is over, some residual waste rock piles, residues,
    etc. may produce water pollution and air pollution problems [7] throughand leaching
    processes, and may also cause spontaneous combustion of coal gangue [8], further
    affecting the ESV in mining areas. On the other hand, land reclamation, ecological
    restoration, natural vegetation recovery and other processes will also lead to
    the recovery of ESV in mining areas [9]. Therefore, the impact of opencast mining
    on ESV in mining areas is a long-term process, showing differentiated trends due
    to the mining life cycle. The assessment of ESV in mining areas is the premise
    of exploring the impact of opencast mining. ESV assessment is a hot topic in recent
    decades, and models such as InVEST [10], ARIES [11], MIMES [12] model have been
    developed. Many scholars have applied these models to assess the impact of mining
    on ESV in mining areas. Four ecosystem services of Curragh mine including carbon
    sequestration, air quality regulation, soil conservation and water yield were
    assessed in 1989, 1997, 2005 and 2013, and changes in ESV caused by mining disturbances
    were mapped with LandTrendr algorithm [13]. In Shengli coalfield, Inner Mongolia,
    remote sensing images from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were used to evaluate
    the ecological service value based on land use, and surface coal mining impacts
    on ESV were analyzed [14]. Six typical opencast mining areas in the Southern Slope
    of Qilian Mountain were selected and the ESV of mining areas from the 1975 to
    2016 were assessed, showing that the regional ESV decreased with the expansion
    of mining areas [1]. However, most of the previous studies reflected the impact
    of opencast mining on ESV in mining areas by changes in ecosystems in individual
    years, while neglecting that ESV in mining areas are a dynamic process, and few
    studies revealed the differences in the impact of different mining periods on
    ESV, making it difficult to reveal the regularity of opencast mining on ESV. mineral
    resources are crucial for the survival and development of society, providing over
    95% of the world’s energy, more than 80% of the world’s industrial raw materials,
    and over 70% of the world’s agricultural raw materials [15]. Most of the open-pit
    coal mines are located in arid and semi-arid ecologically fragile areas [9]. Opencast
    mining further deteriorates the ecological environment of the area, causing serious
    negative impacts on the economic, social development and well-being of the residents.
    This study selected two typical mining areas in China’s arid and semi-arid regions
    - Dongsheng mining area and Junggar mining area as the research objects, which
    are facing the dual pressure of ecological fragility and high-intensity resource
    exploitation. However, previous studies have paid insufficient attention to this
    field. The purpose of this study is: (1) Based on the GEE platform and long-term
    remote sensing data, to quantify the value, total static value and total dynamic
    value of nine ecosystem services in the study area from 1990 to 2020, We delineated
    mining impact and control areas according to administrative boundaries and mining
    concessions and compared the differences between them with statistical analyses,
    to understand the impact of opencast mining on the ESV; (2) To evaluate the dynamics
    of ecosystem services by using Mann-Kendall Tau-b with Sen’s Method (Sen + mk
    test) [16], and to analyze the value trends by using Joinpoint modeling, to compare
    the differences between the mining areas and the control areas, to explore the
    impact of opencast mining on the trends of ecosystem services. This paper is expected
    to reveal the dynamic changes and temporal differences of the value of ecosystem
    services in the opencast mining areas, and to provide theoretical basis for the
    ecological protection and restoration of the mining areas. Method Study area The
    study area is located in Dongsheng District, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous
    Region, China, in Junger and Yijinholo Banners, where the Dongsheng and Junger
    coal fields are distributed, and the mining method is mainly opencast mining (Fig.
    1). From 2002 to 2012, rising coal prices in China drove the large-scale development
    of coal mines, and as of 2023, most of the mines are still under development,
    but the mining areas are also undergoing gradual ecological restoration. In order
    to compare different regions, the impact boundaries of the mining areas and the
    non-mining areas were divided according to the administrative boundaries and the
    mining concessions. Assuming that the mining and non-mining areas are comparable
    in other aspects except for mining activities, the non-mining area serves as valid
    control areas to assess the environmental impact of mining activities. The development
    of mining concessions can lead to drastic changes in land cover, destroying the
    original habitat. The region is located in the northwest of China, belonging to
    an arid and semi-arid climate, with low annual precipitation, vegetation cover
    mainly consisting of shrubs and sparse forest land, and coupled with the impact

    In this study, based on the Google Earth Engine platform and remote sensing data,
    the nine ecosystem services value, static totals and dynamic totals were calculated
    for the study area from 1990 to 2020, and the calculations were performed at both
    the grid scale and the sample point scale. The study then compares the differences
    in the nine ecosystem service values and dynamic totals and their trends between
    mining impact areas and control areas, the study framework diagram is shown in
    Fig. 2. Fig. 2 The framework of this study: (a) data processing; (b) mapping long
    time series annual land use type; (c) measuring the value of long time series

    ESV Full size image Data resources The land use classification data for this study
    came from the CLCD dataset developed by Yang Jie and others from Wuhan University
    [20]. When using this dataset in this study, the types were reclassified according
    to the actual situation of the study area, which was obtained through Google Earth
    high-definition imagery. Shrub types were removed from the data and frozen tundra
    and bare leakage land were combined as unused land based on the actual conditions
    in the study area, the reclassification of the data was realized by GEE. Our statistics
    of other parameters for ESV, like GDP, yearly GDP index, and PCNI, were extracted
    from the Inner Mongolia Ordos Bureau of Statistics,1990–2020. The data used in
    this study are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Variables used to calculate the value
    of ecosystem services Full size table Ecosystem services value estimation Assignment
    of ESV Based on the studies of Costanza, d’Arge et al. [21] and Xie et al. [22],
    we adapted the ecosystem service equivalent weight coefficients in our application
    to the unique ecological and mining development conditions of the study area.
    Among the eight LULC types in our map, shrub type represents the land covered
    by shrubs, short trees and orchards growing on the plain, and its ecological function
    is similar to that of shrubs. Impervious surfaces have a negative impact on three
    ecological functions, such as water supply, waste treatment and other ecosystem
    services, which reduce the overall ESV of the entire ecosystem [23]. Table 2 lists
    the weights of the land use types mentioned in this paper for ecosystem services.
    According to the data provided by the Inner Mongolia Statistical Yearbook, the
    average actual grain yield of cultivated land from 1990 to 2020 was 4405 kg/ha,
    and the average grain price in 1990 was 3.05 CNY/kg. Therefore, the ESV per unit
    area (per hectare) was 1919.32 CNY. Subsequently, Table 3 shows the unit area
    value coefficients of each LULC in ordos. Table 2 Equivalent weight factor of
    ecosystem services per hectare in Ordos [22] Full size table Table 3 ESV of per
    hecta re (unit area) of different LULC categories in Ordos (CNY/ha) Full size
    table Calculation of ESV Once the average annual ecosystem service value per unit
    area of each LULC category has been determined, the ESV for the study area can
    be calculated using the following formula: (1) (2) (3) ESV K, ESVf, ESVs refer
    to the ESVs of LULC category k, service type f, and the total static ecosystem
    value. Ak represents the areas of LULC category k, and VCkf is the value coefficient
    (CNY/ha/a) for category k and service function type f. Dynamic adjustment of ESV
    To ensure the comparability of all ESVs at different times, it is necessary to
    calculate the equivalent economic value, which accounts for the effects of price
    level, inflation and other factors. In this study, Ordos depends on coal mining
    resource development as a pillar industry, which exerts a huge impact on GDP.
    we use the following equation to calculate the equivalent economic value, and
    we set 1990 as the constant and base year for calculating the annual average ESV:
    (4) (5) ESV c is the comparable ESV. Eavg, Ean, Em are economic values of one
    weight factor, while Eavg is the average evalue and Ean is calculated by the Em
    in current year m during the study period, n refers to the constant year (start
    year here). ∅ is the yearly GDP index. As the society develops and the living
    standard improves, people will pay more attention to ecosystem services, leading
    to their increased willingness to pay for ecosystem services. Therefore, the static
    ESV values should be adjusted by the socio-economic coefficient. Pearl’s S-shaped
    growth curve can be used to describe the characteristics of ecological value [24].
    (6) (7) (8) ESVd refers to the dynamic ESV. Ac is the dynamic adjustment coefficient.
    t represents the social development stage. En is the Engel coefficient. We modified
    the GEE code of Liang et al. [25] to calculate the value of the f-th ecosystem
    service, the ESVs and the ESVd of the study area using the API and the code editor
    on the Google Earth Engine platfrom. The calculation model included the following
    steps: (1) We customized the weight values of the equivalence coefficients; (2)
    We calculated the value of the type f ecosystem service and the total static ecosystem
    service value; (3) We calculated the total value of the dynamic ecosystem service
    value by integrating social development variables. In addition, ESV was calculated
    on a 10 km × 10 km grid scale. To compare ESV at mining impact areas with those
    at control areas, 300 sample points were randomly distributed within the study
    area (see Fig. 4(a)). A 1 km buffer zone was created around each sample point,
    and the value per unit area within the buffer zone was calculated as the value
    for the sample point. Mann-Kendall tau-b with Sen’s method Sen + MK test can detect
    the strength of the change in ESV. Sen slope estimator is used to calculate the
    trend value of ESV change, which is usually combined with MK nonparametric test,
    that is, first calculate the Sen trend value, and then use MK method to judge
    the trend significance [5, 26]. Theil-Sen Median trend analysis (Sen trend analysis)
    is a robust nonparametric statistical method for trend calculation. Compared with
    linear regression trend analysis, Sen trend analysis can avoid the influence of
    missing data and data distribution shape in time series, and eliminate the interference
    of outliers on time series. The calculation formula of Sen trend degree is shown
    in formula (1). (9) In the formula, ESVdj and ESVdi are the time series data of
    ESVd. When βESV > 0, it means that ESV shows an upward trend; when βESV < 0, it
    means that ESV shows a downward trend. Mann-Kendall test (MK test) is usually
    used in combination with Sen trend analysis. This method is a nonparametric statistical
    test method, which is not affected by missing values and outliers, and does not
    require the sample data to follow a certain distribution. The statistical test
    method is shown in formulas (2) to (5). (10) (11) (12) θ (13) In the formula,
    ESVdj and ESVdi are the time series data of ESVd; sign is the sign function; S
    is the test statistic; Z is the standardized test statistic, Used to test whether
    there is a significant trend in the time series data, the larger the Z-value,
    the more significant the trend [27, 28]. n is the number of data. Given the significance
    level α, if |Z| > Z1 − α/2, it indicates that there is a significant trend change.
    In this study, α = “0.05”, that is, to judge the significance of the trend change
    of ESV time series at the 0.05 significance level. Joinpoint regression model
    Joinpoint regression, also known as segmented regression, piecewise regression,
    etc., is essentially to establish segmented regression based on the time characteristics
    of sample distribution, divide the research time into different intervals by several
    connecting points, and perform curve fitting and optimization for each interval,
    and then evaluate the variable change characteristics of different intervals with
    specificity within the global event range in more detail. There are two types
    of joinpoint regression models: linear model (y = xb) and log-linear model (ln
    y = xb). In this study, the log-linear model is selected, and the regression equation
    is as follows: (14) where yt is the dependent variable, t is the independent variable
    (time), k is the number of breaks, Ti is the time point of the i-th break, (t − Ti)+
    is the positive part of (t − Ti), β0 is the intercept, β1 is the slope of the
    first segment, βi + 1 is the change in slope at the i-th break, and εt is the
    error term. The join points play a key role in connecting different segments in
    the join point regression model. In this study, we used Joinpoint5.0.2 software,
    which is free software developed and maintained by the National Cancer Institute
    of the United States, to perform the joinpoint regression analysis. This software
    can automatically fit and compare models with different numbers of join points
    and provide rich graphical and tabular outputs. The software can be downloaded
    from the website: Joinpoint Regression Program (cancer.gov). We use Weighted BIC
    method to select the model, that is, the number of joinpoints. Annual percentage
    change (APC) is a method to represent the trend of ESV change over time, that
    is, the joinpoint regression model fits the connected log-linear segments, and
    the calculated APC value is used to indicate the rate of constant percentage change
    of ESV in each segment on a logarithmic scale. Average annual percentage change
    (AAPC) is a summary measure of the change trend within a fixed time segment specified
    in advance by the model, that is, using specific numbers to describe the average
    APC of all observation times. The last step of joinpoint regression model calculation
    is to convert the weighted average of slope linear coefficients into annual percentage
    change. In nonlinear models, the calculation formulas of APC and AAPC are as follows
    (15) (16) (17) In the formula, x is the year, y represents ESVd, b0 is the outcome,
    bi is the regression coefficient, that is, the slope coefficient of each segment,
    wi is the number of years contained in each time segment. In this paper, if the
    calculation result shows that APC value is greater than 0, it means that the ESVd
    of the study area shows a downward trend during that time segment. If APC = AAPC,
    it means that the number of joinpoints selected by the optimal model of the software
    is 0. In this case, the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of APC value can be used
    to judge whether the trend change in that period segment has statistical significance.
    The calculation involves all test levels of α = 0.05. Statistical analysis The
    sample points of the mining impact areas and the control areas were 268 and 242
    respectively. In this study, nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney U) was used to identify
    whether there was a significant difference between the mining impact areas and
    the control areas at the confidence level of 0.05. All data were analyzed by SPSS
    and Matlab software; in addition, this study used R language to extract the average
    level, fluctuation degree and outliers of 9 kinds of ecosystem services GR, CR,
    WS, SFR, WT, BP, FD, RM, RC of all sample points in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020.
    Results Spatiotemporal changes of ESV in opencast mining areas Figure 3(a) illustrates
    the spatial pattern of dynamic ESVd per hectare from 1990 to 2020. The spatial
    pattern of dynamic ESV is consistent and locally variable. The high-value zones
    are primarily located in the northwestern and southeastern parts of the study
    area, while the low-value zones are mainly situated in the northeastern, central,
    and southern parts of the study area. The low-value zones in the northeastern
    part of the study area changed gradually from strips to patches. In contrast,
    the low-value zones in the central part of the study area showed a gradual shift
    towards contiguous patches. Figure 3(b) shows that the total dynamic ESV levels
    in the study area decreased significantly, first decreasing, then increasing,
    and then decreasing again, with a general trend of decline. The average value
    decreased from 687,245.13 CNY in 1990 to 72,442.34 CNY in 2020, representing an
    89.45% decrease. Fig. 3 ESV in the study area, 1990–2020. a Temporal and spatial
    distribution pattern of ESVd per hectare (b) Changes in total ESVd values in the

    ESV The aim of this section is to explore the differences in ecosystem service
    value for each type in mining impact and control areas. As shown in Fig. 4(b),
    RC had the lowest median values in 1990, 2.67 and 2.47 for impact and control
    areas, respectively, which increased to 3.62 and 5.15 by 2020. RM had median values
    that were only slightly higher than those of RC, about 4.81 and 5.12 in 1990,
    but decreased to 4.78 and 3.78 by 2020. The other ecosystem service types (BP,
    CR, F, GR, SFR, WS and WT) had higher values, with SFR having the largest share
    in the graph. Fig. 4 a Sample points; b Boxplots of nine types ecosystem service
    value in mining impact areas and control areas Full size image For the type of
    ESV, in 1990, the median ESV in mining impact areas was slightly higher than that
    in control areas, except for F and RM. The median values of SFR were 153.94 and
    139.07 for mining impact and control areas, respectively. However, the range of
    fluctuations in values for control areas was much greater, with quartile distances
    ranging from 49.54 (WS) to 1.09 (RM), while the interquartile range for the mining
    impact areas was only between 18.00 (SFR) and 0.48 (RM). An independent t-test
    was performed to test whether there was a significant difference between the mining
    impact and control areas. The results showed that there was a significant difference,
    as the p-values for BP, CR, F, GR, RC, RM, SFR, WS and WT were all less than the
    0.001 level of significance. However, by 2020, the mean values of BP, CR, GR,
    SFR, WS and WT in the control areas exceeded those in the mining impact areas.
    The median values of SFR were 156.72 and 157.24 for the mining impact and control
    areas, respectively. The median values of WS were 53.33 and 58.62, and those of
    WT were 106.03 and 113.07, respectively. The quartile spacing remained stable
    from 1990 to 2020. The results of the significance test showed that the p-values
    of BP, CR, F, RC, RM, SFR and WT were less than the 0.05 level of significance
    and indicated significant differences. The impact of opencast mining on the trend
    of ESV changes The trend of ESV changes in the opencast mining areas We used the
    Sen + MK test to calculate the spatial distribution of the trend of ESV changes
    based on the grid scale, as shown in Fig. 5, during the period 1990–2020, the
    ESV in the study area showed an overall improving trend. The areas with improved
    ESV were mainly distributed in the western and north-eastern parts of the study
    area, while the areas with degraded ESV were mainly located in the south-eastern,
    north-central and south-central parts, which had a high degree of overlap with
    the distribution of mining concessions; statistical results show that 67% of the
    extremely degraded areas in the study area are located within the boundaries of
    mining concessions. Table 5 summarises the areas of each type of ESV change from
    1990 to 2020. It can be seen that the areas of improvement were much larger than
    the areas of degradation during the study period. Among them, the areas of significant
    ESV degradation accounted for 17.19% of the total areas of the study area, and
    slight degradation accounted for 4.09%; the areas of slight ESV improvement accounted
    for 7.30%, and significant improvement accounted for 41.15%; and the areas of
    stable and unchanged ESV accounted for 30.27%. Fig. 5 The trend of ESV in the
    study area, 1990–2020 Full size image Table 5 The areas and proportion of ESV
    change trends from 1990 to 2020 Full size table The trend of ESV changes in the
    coal mining impact areas As shown in Fig. 6, for the control areas, there were
    three turning points in 1997, 2005 and 2009, the APC (95% CI) corresponding to
    the four intervals were APC1990–1997 = 1.09 (95% CI:0.7 ~ 1.5, P < 0. 001), APC1997–2005 = 0.43
    (95% CI:0.8 ~ 2.4, P = 0.028), APC2005–2009 = 1.01 (95% CI:-0.3 ~ 2.3, P = 0.122),
    APC2009–2020 = 0.51 (95%CI:0.3 ~ 0.7, P < 0.001), and global AAPC1990–2020 = 0.7
    (95%CI:0.5 ~ 0.9, P < 0.001). The global AAPC results showed that ESV in control
    areas in Erdos increased by an average of 0.7% per year during 1990–2020. Regarding
    the mining impact areas, the value of ecological system service showed three turning
    points in 1996, 1999 and 2007, corresponding to the four intervals of APC (95%
    CI) were APC1990–1996 = 0.00(95% CI:-0.1 ~ 0.1, P = 0.934), APC1996–1999 = 0.78(95%
    CI:0. 1 ~ 1.5, P = 0.03), APC1999–2007 = 0.09 (95%CI:0 ~ 0.2, P = 0.062), APC2007–2020 = − 0.67
    (95%CI:-0.7 ~ − 0.6, P < 0.001) and global AAPC1990–2020 = − 0.2 (95%CI:-0.3 ~ − 0.1,
    P < 0.001), indicating that the ESV in the mining impact areas decreased by an
    average of 0.2% per year. Overall, the trends were markedly different between
    the mining impact areas and the control areas, and the year 2008 marked the point
    at which the control areas overtook the mining impact areas. Fig. 6 Trend results

    ESV With the rapid development of China’s economy, China’s mining industry (especially
    coal) has grown dramatically, driving the large-scale changes in land use and
    land cover (LULC) in the Ordos mining areas. In the [17] past 30 years, natural
    ecosystems, especially grasslands that are common in the agro-pastoral transition
    zone in northern China, have been fragmented and degraded due to the rise of mining
    and related land use [29]. The economic development brought by mining has generated
    spillover effects, increasing the built-up areas, especially near the mining areas,
    which is a characteristic of LULC change types in resource areas. Compared with
    grasslands, the decline trend of forest cover in the study area was not obvious,
    which mainly benefited from the forest protection policies of the national and
    local governments [30]. At the same time, the gradual restoration of forestland
    increased the vegetation cover range. From 1990 to 2020, the trend of ESVd (Ecosystem
    Service Value decline) in the study area exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity.
    The regions experiencing substantial decreases in ESVd were closely associated
    with mining development areas. In our analysis, we treated mining impact areas
    and control areas separately. However, it’s essential to recognize that this approach
    assumes uniform distribution of mining impact due to the extensive range and degree
    of influence from opencast coal mining on the surrounding ecological environment.
    One limitation of this assumption lies in its neglect of spatio-temporal correlation
    within the impact areas. The ESVd values for each assessment unit are not independent;
    they exhibit correlations across different temporal and spatial positions. Ignoring
    these spatial and temporal effects can introduce biased standard errors and lead
    to inaccurate significance tests [31, 32]. To gain a deeper understanding of the
    spatial dynamics, we propose employing a spatial dependency framework. For instance,
    the Spatial Error Model (SEM) accounts for spatial dependence in observational
    data errors [33]. By doing so, one can better reveal the spatio-temporal differences
    in impact, ultimately enhancing the quality and effectiveness of evaluation. Figure
    6 illustrates a significant decrease in mining concessions from 2010 to 2020,
    aligning with the rapid expansion of mining areas. Notably, 67% of the regions
    exhibiting significant declines (as shown in Fig. 5) fall within mining concessions,
    highlighting the negative impact of opencast mining on ecosystem services. While
    there has been a 41.15% improvement in ESV, driven by natural forests and incremental
    restoration efforts adopted by several mines, Fig. 3(b) reveals a significant
    overall decline in ESV across the entire region. This discrepancy suggests that
    ecological restoration efforts are still lagging behind the pace of mining development
    [3, 4, 34]. The response of different ESV to opencast mining Among the nine ESV
    in Ordos, SFR had the highest level, which might be because Ordos was mainly dominated
    by grasslands, accounting for more than 75% of the city’s area. Grasslands had
    a strong water conservation function, which could increase rainfall infiltration,
    reduce runoff and evaporation,, and promote groundwater recharge [35]. RC had
    the lowest level, which might be because there were no large-scale human landscape
    construction and tourism development projects in the city [36]. In addition, the
    raw material service in Ordos increased significantly from 1990 to 2000, which
    might be because the city implemented ecological construction measures such as
    returning farmland to forest, afforestation, etc., during this period, increasing
    the forestland area and forest stock volume [37]. From 1990 to 2020, coal mining
    had a certain impact on the nine ESV. Specifically, the ESV of the non-mining
    impact areas was higher than that of the mining impact areas during this period,
    indicating that the mining impact areas was under continuous ecological and environmental
    pressure during this period, such as land reclamation, water resource consumption,
    pollutant discharge, etc., which reduced the quality and function of the ecosystem.
    In addition, the fluctuation degree of data in the mining impact areas was obviously
    smaller than that in the control areas, which might be because the LULC types
    and ecosystem services functions in the non-mining impact areas were more diversified,
    and there were larger differences and trade-offs between different types of land
    and services. While the LULC types and ecosystem services functions in the mining
    impact areas were relatively simple, mainly dominated by grasslands, providing
    relatively single types of services. Implications for protection and restoration
    of arid and semi-arid mining ecosystems In the early stage of coal mining, the
    ecosystem in the mining areas was mostly in the initial stage, and the original
    ecosystem was less affected by human activities. In the accelerated development
    and stable development stages of coal mining, ecological problems became prominent,
    and the ecosystem was seriously damaged. If ecological restoration was timely,
    it could achieve positive succession of the damaged ecosystem, or slow down the
    negative succession of the ecosystem [34]. However, if no measures were taken,
    under the current economic and technological conditions, the ecosystem would continue
    to degrade or regress to an extreme ecosystem. In the development decline and
    closure stages of coal mining, if ecological restoration was the main focus and
    economic development was the auxiliary, then the ecosystem in the mining areas
    would continue to recover [38, 39]. However, if relevant ecological restoration
    measures were reduced or cancelled until after the closure of the mine, then ecological
    problems in the mining areas would persist and spread, causing regional ecological
    problems after the closure of the mine. It can be seen that timely and reasonable
    human intervention and management can achieve positive succession of the ecosystem,
    that is, the restoration/reconstruction of the ecosystem [40]. This restoration
    and reconstruction can be a reset of the destroyed trajectory, or a new structure
    construction. The consequences can achieve complete or partial recovery of the
    structure and function of the original ecosystem, or establish a new stable ecosystem.
    The reclamation and restoration of the mining areas should strengthen the restoration
    of Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn and Ni in the soil [35]. For reclaimed areas, adjust vegetation
    types appropriately and select economically suitable vegetation such as alfalfa,
    alkali grass, larch, caragana for planting and restoration; for unreclaimed spoil
    dumps, first carry out reclamation, then conduct heavy metal content detection
    and select suitable restoration vegetation [26]. In addition, in order to enhance
    the resilience of the ecosystem, it is also necessary to pay attention to the
    interaction between the ecosystem and human system [41]. It should be based on
    the comprehensive ability of various social subjects to cope with economic, ecological
    and other factors that damage society and fundamentally transform it. For example,
    government should conduct macro-regulation on mining areas from economic, social,
    ecological and other related policies; enterprises should seek green mining technology
    and carry out engineering transformation and construction of mining areas technical
    facility system with high productivity and low pollution; scientific research
    institutions should conduct continuous monitoring and evaluation on ecological
    security of mining areas; three parties should communicate with each other and
    form a “government-enterprise-scientific research” combined resilience regulation
    model. Conclusion Evaluating the impact of opencast mining on ESV is of great
    significance for the management and sustainable development of mining impact areas.
    Taking Ordos coal mining areas as an example, this study measured the spatiotemporal
    changes of ESVd in the opencast mining areas areas for 30 years based on GEE platform,
    and analyzed the impact of coal mining on the i-th type ESV, as well as the impact
    on the trend of ESVd changes. This study can provide a method and reference for
    the long-term impact of ESV. The conclusions of this study include: (1) From 1990
    to 2020, the dynamic ESV levels in the study area were fluctuating with an overall
    trend of decline. The mean value decreased from 687,245.13 Yuan in 1990 to 72,442.34
    Yuan in 2020, with a decrease of 89.45%. (2) For the different subcategories of
    ecosystem services, most of them were significantly different (p < 0.001) between
    mining-impacted and non-impacted areas, with biodiversity protection (BP), climate
    regulation (CR), gas regulation (GR), soil formation and retention (SFR), water
    supply (WS) and waste treatment (WT) showed a significant decrease between 1990
    and 2020. (3) In the past 30 years, the ESV of the study area showed an overall
    improvement trend, where the improved area accounted for 48.45% of the total area
    of the study area. However, the degraded area also accounted for 21.28, and 17.19%
    of the area belonged to severe degradation. Through the overlay analysis with
    the mining right boundary range, we found that most of the severely degraded areas
    are distributed within the mining concessions, Accounting for 67% of significantly
    degraded areas. (4) The trend of ESV changes in the mining-affected area and the
    non-affected area showed significant differences. The ESV of the non-affected
    area increased continuously, with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of
    0.7(95%CI:0.50 ~ 0.9, P < 0.001) from 1990 to 2020; while the ESV of the mining-affected
    area first stabilized and then decreased significantly, with an AAPC of − 0.2(95%CI:− 0.3 ~ − 0.1,
    P < 0.001) from 1990 to 2020. The turning point occurred in 2007, with an annual
    percentage change (APC) of − 0.67(95%CI:− 0.7 ~ − 0.6, P < 0.001) from 2007 to
    2020. The results of this study not only contribute to a clear understanding of
    the impact of opencast mining on the long-term trend of ESV changes, but also
    provide a basis for the formulation of spatially targeted ecosystem management,
    restoration plans and ES payment policies. This will help to maintain and improve
    human well-being while achieving regional sustainable development. Availability

    important anthropogenic greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon
    dioxide (CO2). It contributes to about 15% of the global anthropogenic greenhouse
    gases emitted yearly when assuming a greenhouse warming potential (GWP) of 25
    times CO2 over 100 years (IPCC, 2007). Indeed, the CH4 emissions to the atmosphere
    continue to increase, with the last 3 years (2020 to 2022) having the highest
    annual global increase since 1983 [1]. Microbial methanogenesis by anaerobic methanogens
    is the largest biogenic source of atmospheric methane (CH4) [2]. In particular,
    water-logged rice paddies contribute approximately 25% to the total annual CH4
    budget in the atmosphere [3], making them a critical source of anthropogenic CH4
    emissions into Earth’s atmosphere. The present-day estimates of the annual emission
    rate from water-logged rice paddies range between 20 and 100 Tg/year [4]. Straw
    is one of the most abundant stocks of renewable biomass from crop production and
    one of the major organic carbon sources added to paddy soils as fertilizer. Rice
    straw, as a lignocellulosic biomass, is comprised of cellulose (32–37%), hemicellulose
    (29–37%), lignin (5–15%), and pectin (2–3%). The straw components serve as substrates
    for a complex microbial community that finally degrades the biopolymers to CO2
    and CH4 [5,6,7,8]. In consequence, the anaerobic decomposition of rice straw [9]
    ultimately enhances CH4 production and emission [10]. The methanogenic degradation
    of rice straw involves the activity of a complex microbial food web consisting
    of various functional guilds, including hydrolytic, fermenting, and syntrophic
    bacteria, as well as methanogenic archaea. This microbial consortium fulfills
    a cascade of anaerobic degradation steps that involve polymer hydrolysis, fermentation,
    syntrophic conversion of fatty acids, homoacetogenesis, and methanogenesis [8,
    11, 12]. Historically, three methanogenic pathways have been recognized to contribute
    to CH4 production (substrates in parenthesis): acetoclastic (acetate), hydrogenotrophic
    (H2 and CO2), and methylotrophic (methanol and other methylated compounds) methanogenesis
    (Fig. S1). Acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis have been shown to
    dominate CH4 production at a ratio of 2:1 in rice paddies [13, 14]. The analysis
    of Italian rice field soil concluded that methylotrophic methanogenesis plays
    only a minor role in rice paddy soils [15]. Numerous studies have been conducted
    to understand organic matter decomposition and CH4 production in rice field soils
    [16,17,18]. In particular, paddy soil slurries amended with rice straw have been
    frequently used over the last two decades to investigate the metabolic processes
    involved in the anaerobic degradation of plant polymers [6, 7, 19,20,21]. Over
    recent years, this research has primarily been done on two geographically distinct
    paddy soils sampled in Italy and the Philippines [16, 19, 22,23,24]. The methanogenic
    communities in these two soils differ in composition and response to straw amendments
    [25, 26]. Studies on the Italian paddy soil already involved systems-level analyses
    of the methanogenic community dynamics on both rRNA (structure) and mRNA (function)
    levels, but only for the early stage of rice straw degradation [12]. By contrast,
    the research on the methanogenic community in Philippine rice field soil is limited
    to the analysis of total DNA using primarily PCR-based amplicon sequencing of
    particular biomarkers. However, this methodological approach can only address
    specific aspects of community potential and provides information neither on the
    active microbial groups nor their functional gene expression at the time of sampling
    [23, 24, 26, 27]. This prompted us to apply a multi-methods approach to disentangle
    the compositional and functional dynamics of the methanogenic community in Philippine
    rice field soil over an incubation period of 120 days. Anoxic paddy soil slurries
    amended with rice straw were used as a model system. Given the previous results
    on paddy soil microbial communities from various geographically distinct areas
    [16, 19, 28], we expected to detect a dominant expression of acetoclastic and
    hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by a complex methanogen community. Central to
    our research was the combination of metabolite measurements and metatranscriptomic
    analysis of total RNA, thereby enabling us to simultaneously unravel changes in
    the structure (rRNA) and function (mRNA) of the methanogenic community. In addition,
    we applied quantitative PCR (qPCR), reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
    of biomarkers (16S rRNA, mcrA), and targeted metagenomics to assemble draft genomes
    of key methanogens (Fig. S2). The observed community dynamics led us to divide
    the long-term incubation period into three successional phases defined as the
    early phase (days 3 to 21), the intermediate phase (days 21 to 28), and the late
    phase (days 28 to 120). Materials and methods Sample collection and experimental
    design Soil was obtained from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
    in Los Banos, Republic of the Philippines. The Philippine-IRRI is located about
    66 km south of Manila (14° 09′ 45″ N, 121° 15′ 35″ E, 21 m a.s.l.) [29, 30]. The
    main physicochemical characteristics of the Philippine rice field soil were previously
    described [23, 30,31,32]. Soil processing followed a standard procedure, including
    mechanical crushing, storage of the air-dried soil at room temperature, sieving
    (< 2 mm) before its immediate use, and preparation of straw-amended slurries [33,34,35].
    Briefly, soil slurries were set up in 125-ml pressure bottles by thoroughly mixing
    40 g dry soil, 0.5 g rice straw (1 cm pieces), and 50 ml of deionized and autoclaved
    water. This amount of rice straw has been commonly used in paddy soil slurry studies
    [6, 12, 20, 36]. It corresponds to 37.5 t ha−1, which is about three times higher
    than under field conditions [37]. The bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers
    and flushed with N2 for 15 min to establish anoxic conditions. The slurries were
    then incubated at 30 °C for up to 120 days. Destructive sampling was performed
    after 3, 7, 11, 14, 21, 28, 35, 60, and 120 days of incubation, with three replicate
    slurries per time point. Slurry material was sampled from each replicate, promptly
    shock-frozen using liquid nitrogen, and then stored for molecular analysis at
    − 80 °C. Pore water samples were taken and kept at −20 ℃ until metabolite analysis.
    The experimental design is displayed in Fig. S2. Metabolite measurements Concentrations
    of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the liquid sample of the soil slurries
    were measured by HPLC equipped with an ion-exclusion column (Aminex HPX-87-H,
    BioRad, München, Germany) and coupled to a UV–Vis detector (Sykam, Fürstenfeldbruck,
    Germany) [38]. In addition, gas samples were taken from the same set of slurries
    for process measurements. A GC-8A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany)
    containing a Haysep Q column was used to measure CH4 and CO2. Data were analyzed
    with PeakSimple software (SRI Instruments, Bad Honnef, Germany) and calculated
    by linear regression [12, 36, 39]. DNA and RNA extraction Total DNA was extracted
    from soil slurries using the DNeasy® PowerLyzer® PowerSoil kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
    Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis
    and fluorometry were used to check for the integrity and quantity of each DNA
    extract. Fluorometric measurements were done on a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer using
    the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The RNeasy®
    PowerSoil Total RNA Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used for the extraction
    of total RNA. The extraction procedure followed the manufacturer’s instructions.
    The RNA extracts were treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, USA) and purified
    using the RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). The integrity
    of purified RNA was assessed using the ExperionTM RNA HighSens Analysis Kit (Bio-Rad,
    CA, USA), while the yield was determined with the QubitTM RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo
    Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription
    qPCR (RT-qRCR) Primer sets and temperature profiles for quantitation of bacterial
    16S rRNA and mcrA genes (qPCR) and their transcripts (RT-qPCR) are shown in Table
    S1. The mcrA gene is a standard biomarker to detect and quantify methanogens in
    environmental samples [36, 39, 40]. In RT-qPCR, randomly reverse-transcribed RNA
    was generated using the GoScript Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Mannheim,
    Germany) according to the manusfacturer’s instructions. The standard curve for
    quantifying bacterial 16S rRNA genes and transcripts was constructed using the
    genomic DNA of Escherichia coli (calibration range from 10 to 109 copies). The
    standard curve for quantifying mcrA genes and transcripts was constructed using
    a mcrA fragment cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy plasmid (Promega, WI, USA) (calibration
    range from 10 to 108 copies) [39]. The mcrA fragment used for cloning was obtained
    from the genomic DNA of Methanosarcina barkeri [41]. The qPCR reactions were carried
    out on an iCycler Real-Time PCR Detection System (CFX ConnectTM, Bio-Rad). The
    PCR efficiency was at least 85% (R2 > 0.98). The presence of unspecific products
    was checked by melt curve analysis. Illumina library preparation and sequencing
    Libraries for sequencing were prepared for both metatranscriptomic (cDNA) and
    metagenomic (total DNA) analysis. Metatranscriptomics Twenty-seven RNA samples
    (three replicate slurries × 9 time points) were subjected to cDNA library preparation
    using the NEBNext® Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (New
    England Biolabs, USA). The cDNA library synthesis procedure strictly followed
    the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA integrity and yield were checked on a Bio-Rad
    analyzer using the ExperionTM DNA 12K Analysis Kit (Bio-Rad). The 27 cDNA libraries
    were sequenced (RNA-Seq) on the NovaSeq 6000 platform in paired-end mode (2×150
    bp) by Novogene Genomics Service (Novogene Co., Ltd., UK). Metagenomics DNA extracts
    from the triplicate slurries of a given time point were mixed in equal amounts
    before metagenomic library construction. A total of three metagenomic libraries
    (one each for three incubation periods: 21, 28, and 35 days) were constructed
    using the TruSeq DNA Library Prep Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
    (Illumina). The metagenomic libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq-2500
    platform in paired-end mode (2×250 bp) at the Max Planck Genome Centre Cologne,
    Germany. Computational analysis of metatranscriptomic datasets Pre-processing
    The quality filtration of raw reads was performed using Trimmomatic [42]. Default
    settings were applied with the exception that the minimum sequence length was
    set at 100 bp. Quality control of the filtered reads was visualized using FastQC.
    Analysis of 16S rRNA and putative mRNA reads was carried out using a bioinformatic
    pipeline reported previously [12]. Briefly, reads mapping to rRNA and non-coding
    RNA were filtered by SortMeRNA 2.0 against SILVA (release 128) [43] and RFAM reference
    databases [44], respectively. The remaining reads were considered putative mRNA.
    The sequencing statistics are shown in Table S2. Analysis of 16S rRNA Upon extraction
    from the metatranscriptome, the rRNA-derived reads were assembled to near full-length
    16S rRNA sequences over 40 iterations using EMIRGE with the SILVA 132 SSU rRNA
    database [45]. This assembly approach was done separately for the 27 rRNA sequence
    datasets. The assemblies were grouped into population-specific 16S rRNA sequence
    types using an identity cutoff of 97% [46, 47]. Taxonomic assignment was performed
    using BLASTN implemented in DIAMOND (v0.9.25), applying an e-value cutoff of 1e−5
    for the database searches against the SILVA 132 SSU rRNA database. The output
    file by DIAMOND was further processed in MEGAN6 Ultimate Edition v6.20 (Computomics,
    Tübingen, Germany) for a more detailed taxonomic classification [48]. The abundance
    of each assembled 16S rRNA sequence type was estimated using BBMap v38.62 [49].
    All nearly full-length 16S rRNA sequences (> 1200 bp), which were affiliated with
    the family Methanosarcinaceae, were extracted for phylogenetic comparison. The
    sequence alignment was done using MUSCLE [50] and manually refined. A neighbor-joining
    tree was constructed in MEGAX using 500 bootstrap replications [51]. Reference
    sequences were downloaded from the Genomic Taxonomic Database (GTDB) (https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/).
    The neighbor-joining tree was visualized by iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/) [52].
    The sequencing statistics of near-full-length 16S rRNA sequences are shown in
    Table S3. Analysis of mRNA Trinity (v2.2.0) was used for de novo metatranscriptome
    assembly [53]. Total mRNA reads from all 27 cDNA libraries were pooled into one
    transcriptomic dataset for subsequent contig assembly using Trinity scripts [54].
    A total of 472,280 quality-checked contigs were obtained. The mRNA reads of each
    cDNA library were individually mapped back onto the contigs using Bowtie [55].
    An FPKM matrix of mRNA reads mapped onto a particular contig was produced for
    all relevant contigs using RSEM [56] within Trinity (v2.2.0). Taxonomic assignment
    and functional annotation of the mRNA contigs were done using BLASTX implemented
    in DIAMOND (v0.9.25) [57], applying an e value cutoff of 1e−5 for database searches
    against NCBI’s non-redundant (nr) protein database. mRNA contigs encoding putative
    laccases and multicopper oxidases were identified by searches against LccED (Laccase
    and Multicopper Oxidase Engineering Database; [58]). To investigate the gene expression
    of particular metabolic pathways, related mRNA contigs were extracted using MEGAN6
    Ultimate Edition [12, 48]. The mRNA sequencing statistics are shown in Table S4.
    The identification of mRNA contigs encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes)
    was achieved by searches against the dbCAN database using BLASTX implemented in
    DIAMOND (v0.9.25) and applying the default e value cutoff of 1e−3. Functional
    CAZyme modules involved in the degradation of cellulose, xylan, chitin, and other
    hemicelluloses were defined by grouping related enzymatic functions based on their
    enzyme commission numbers. A mapping file for functional annotation was created
    using all available entries in dbCAN. The mapping file was stored as an indexed
    SQLite database and queried using a custom Python script. The resulting annotations
    are based on matching dbCAN top hits for mRNA contigs queried against the mapping
    file and defined CAZyme modules. The functional annotation of CAZyme-affiliated
    mRNA contigs to CAZyme functional modules was achieved using custom Python scripts
    described by Peng et al. (http://github.com/wegnerce/peng_et_al_2018.) [12]. Their
    taxonomic assignment was done using BLASTX implemented in DIAMOND (v0.9.25) against
    the NCBI nr protein database. Computational analysis of metagenomic datasets Assembly
    and binning Raw reads were quality-filtered using Trimmomatic v0.38 [42]. Upon
    quality filtration, the three metagenomes recovered from slurries after an incubation
    period of 21, 28, and 35 days were combined for the assembly of contigs. Metagenomic
    assembly and binning were done using the MetaWRAP pipeline [59]. The quality-filtered
    reads were first assembled to larger contigs using metaSPAdes v3.13.0 [60]. Metagenomic
    binning was performed with MetaBAT v2.12.1 [61] and MaxBin v2.2.5 [62], using
    contigs longer than 1000 bp. Completeness and contamination of metagenome-assembled
    genomes (MAGs) were assessed by CheckM v1.0.17 [63]. The sequencing statistics
    are shown in Table S5. Genome annotation Open reading frames (ORFs) in each MAG
    were identified using Prokka v1.14.5 [64]. The ORFs were then queried against
    the nr protein database using DIAMOND (v0.9.25) with an e value of 1e−5 [57].
    Functional annotation was performed based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
    Genomes (KEGG) database using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm in MEGAN6
    Ultimate Edition v6.20 [48]. FastANI was used to calculate genome average nucleotide
    identity (ANI) values [65]. Whole-genome sequences were visualized and compared
    using CGView software [66]. Transcript mapping onto Methanosarcina MAGs To determine
    how strongly particular methanogenic pathways and key pathway genes were expressed
    by different Methanosarcina populations, forward and reverse reads of the mRNA
    sequences were pooled and mapped onto the MAGs using BBMap v38.62 pipeline (minimum
    sequence identity set to 0.97) [46, 47, 49]. Competitive mapping of the mRNA reads
    was done using BBSplit in BBMap v38.62 [49]. Each metatranscriptome replicate
    of a given sampling time point (days 3, 7, 11, 14, 21, 28, 35, 60, and 120) was
    mapped separately onto a mix of Methanosarcina genomes including M. fluorescens
    (Group I), strain MSH10X1 (Group II), M. barkeri (Group III), and M. horonobensis
    (Group IV), and it was determined to which genome the metatranscriptomes of a
    given incubation time point match best. The relative mapping efficiencies were
    calculated based on the normalized number of mRNA reads that were competitively
    mapped onto each Methanosarcina reference genome. Phylogenetic analysis CheckM
    (v1.0.17) was used to predict the 16S rRNA genes in the MAGs and for their taxonomic
    assignment [63]. Subsequently, a genus-level 16S rRNA gene tree for Methanosarcina
    spp. was constructed in MEGAX using the neighbor-joining algorithm and 500 bootstrap
    replications. Reference sequences were extracted from Methanosarcina genomes downloaded
    from GTDB. Statistical analysis All means ± standard errors (SE) are based on
    the analytical results of three independent replicate slurries (metabolite measurements,
    qPCR, RT-qPCR, and metatranscriptomic community dynamics on rRNA and mRNA levels).
    Significant differences in the qPCR and RT-qPCR measurements across the nine incubation
    time points were determined using one-way ANOVA. The resulting P values were corrected
    for multiple tests using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method (PFDR
    < 0.05) [67]. In metatranscriptomic analysis, the relative abundance values calculated
    for taxon-specific 16S rRNA and mRNA contigs (domain and family level), and for
    mRNA contigs assigned to particular KEGG categories (functional gene expression
    analysis), were normalized to transcripts per kilobase million (TPM). This was
    done to normalize for varying sequencing depths. Tukey’s honest squared difference
    test (Tukey HSD) in STAMP was used to determine whether the taxon-specific rRNA/mRNA
    abundances and the expression of particular functional categories significantly
    differed across the 120-day incubation period (significant with p < 0.05) [68].
    The DESeq2 package v1.24.0 in R (v3.6.1) was used to further test for significant
    differences in taxon-specific rRNA abundance and the mRNA abundance of key pathway
    genes between two sampling time points [69]. In particular, it was tested whether
    the taxon-specific rRNA abundance on a particular sampling time point significantly
    differed from the initial abundance at the first sampling (day 3) or vice versa
    whether the taxon-specific rRNA abundance at day 3 significantly differed from
    those of all other sampling time points. The same analysis approach was applied
    to the mRNA abundance of key pathway genes. All P values generated with STAMP
    or DESeq2 were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method
    to control the false discovery rate (FDR) with PFDR < 0.05. Results Metabolite
    turnover Metabolite measurements in the straw-amended slurries were made over
    the 120-day incubation period. Acetate transiently accumulated and reached its
    peak concentration (10.57 mM) at day 7. Thereafter, the acetate concentration
    decreased within 7 days to 1.42 mM on day 14 and then showed a steady state between
    production and consumption, ranging from 0.83 to 1.30 mM until day 120 (Fig. 1a).
    Concurrently, the butyrate concentration peaked on day 7 (2.88 mM) and then decreased
    to low but detectable steady-state levels (0.08 to 0.18 mM) (Fig. 1b). Propionate
    accumulated from day 3 (0.57 mM) onwards, with a peak concentration on day 14
    (1.68 mM). Subsequently, its concentration decreased towards day 35 (0.65 mM),
    and then, propionate exhibited a steady state at low but clearly detectable levels
    (0.35 mM) (Fig. 1c). First CH4 production was detectable around day 3 (2.5 kPa),
    while its headspace concentration increased significantly towards day 21 (62.15
    kPa). Then, the CH4 production rate was decreased between days 21 and 28 (Fig.
    1d), but increased again from days 28 to 35. The greatest net CH4 production rate
    was observed between days 11 and 21, concomitantly to the decline of acetate and
    butyrate to low steady-state concentrations, and in part to the net consumption
    of propionate (Fig. 1d). Fig. 1 Measurement of intermediates and methane in the
    paddy soil slurries over the 120-day incubation period at 30 °C. Intermediate
    turnover of acetate a, butyrate b, and propionate c, and methane production d.
    The inserts show the near-steady-state concentrations of acetate for the incubation
    period 14 to 120 days a, butyrate for the incubation period 11 to 120 days b,
    and propionate for the incubation period 35 to 120 days (c) in high-resolution.
    Data are means ± SE (n = 3) Full size image qPCR and RT-qPCR Genes and transcripts
    of bacterial 16S rRNA and methanogenic mcrA were quantified over the 120-day incubation
    period (Fig. 2, Tables S6, S7, S8, S9). Changes in the copy numbers of bacterial
    16S rRNA genes and transcripts (Fig. 2a, c) and mcrA genes and transcripts (Fig.
    2b, d) showed an M-like up and down over incubation time. The copy numbers of
    bacterial 16S rRNA genes and transcripts peaked first on day 21 (1.2 × 1010 genes
    vs. 4.8 × 1011 transcripts g-1 dry soil) and again on day 35 (1.2 × 1010 genes
    vs. 4.2 × 1011 transcripts g-1 dry soil), with an intermediate decrease on day
    28 (5.7 × 109 16S rRNA genes vs. 2.7 × 1011 transcripts g-1 dry soil) (Fig. 2a,c).

    genes (qPCR) and their transcripts (RT-qPCR) in Philippine paddy soil slurries
    over the 120-day incubation period. Copy numbers of bacterial 16S rRNA genes (a)
    and transcripts (c) per gram of dry paddy soil. Copy numbers of mcrA genes (b)
    and transcripts (d) per gram of dry paddy soil. Data are means ± SE (n = 3). Differences
    between two incubation time points were determined using one-way ANOVA (PFDR < 0.05).
    The exact copy numbers per gram of dry paddy soil are shown in Tables S6, S7 (genes)
    and S8, S9 (transcripts) Full size image Likewise, the copy numbers of mcrA genes
    and transcripts peaked first on day 21 (2.9 × 109 mcrA genes vs. 9.2 × 1010 transcripts
    g-1 dry soil) and again on day 35 (3.4 × 109 mcrA genes vs. 6.5 × 1010 transcripts
    g-1 dry soil), with an intermediate decrease on day 28 (1.3 × 109 mcrA genes vs.
    3.8 × 1010 transcripts g-1 dry soil) (Fig. 2b, d). After day 35, the gene and
    transcript copy numbers of both bacterial 16S rRNA and mcrA strongly decreased
    towards day 120 (Fig. 2). The bacterial metatranscriptome (16S rRNA, mRNA) Taxon-specific
    dynamics The family-level population dynamics varied over incubation time (Figs.
    3 and S3, Tables S10 and S11). At the rRNA level, the relative abundance of Geobacteraceae
    peaked between days 7 and 11 (Fig. 3a). Thereafter, the abundance of Clostridiaceae
    and Peptococcaceae peaked at day 21, while Lachnospiraceae showed the maximum
    abundance on day 28 (Fig. 3a,c). In the late phase (days 35 to 120), Heliobacteriaceae
    and Anaerolineaceae showed increased rRNA abundances and were, together with Geobacteraceae,
    the predominant bacterial populations (Fig. 3a,c). Fig. 3 Relative abundance changes
    of dominant bacterial families (> 2%) on rRNA (a, c) and mRNA (b, d) levels, respectively.
    The percentage abundances are given in relation to total bacterial 16S rRNA and
    mRNA, respectively. Data are means ± SE (n = 3). Asterisks * (PFDR≤0.05), ** (PFDR≤0.01),
    and *** (PFDR≤0.001) indicate significant differences. Asterisks shown aside from
    the taxonomic names indicate that in STAMP, the relative rRNA or mRNA abundances
    significantly changed through the whole incubation period. Asterisks directly
    shown in the plots indicate that in DESeq2, the rRNA or mRNA abundance in that
    particular sampling time point significantly differed from the original abundance
    at the first sampling (day 3) or vice versa that the relative rRNA or mRNA abundance
    at day 3 (Symbiobacteriaceae) significantly differed from all other sampling time
    points. Significance values (PFDR) are only indicated on rRNA and mRNA levels
    for the taxon-specific abundance peak. The complete set of PFDR values obtained
    by DESeq2 analysis for all sampling time points is shown in Tables S10 (rRNA)
    and S11 (mRNA) Full size image Like on the 16S rRNA level, the mRNA abundance
    of the Geobacteraceae peaked on day 7, covering 22% of total community-wide mRNA
    and 36% of total bacterial mRNA. This was followed by a rapid abundance decline
    towards day 21 and another increase thereafter (Figs. 3b and S4). The Peptococcaceae
    reached their peak mRNA abundance on day 21 (Fig. 3d). Likewise, Clostridiaceae
    (day 21) and Lachnospiraceae (day 28) showed peak mRNA abundances consistent with
    those observed on the rRNA level. The Acidobacteriaceae and Anaerolineaceae displayed
    higher mRNA abundances in the late phase (days 35 to 120) than in the early phase
    (days 3 to 21) (Fig. 3d). In addition, putative syntrophic populations, such as
    Peptococcaceae and Heliobacteriaceae, reached a second peak abundance during the
    late phase (Fig. 3b, d). Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) A total of 13,632
    mRNA contigs were annotated to encode CAZymes involved in degrading cellulose
    (e.g., cellulases, cellulose-1,4-beta-cellobiosidase), xylan (e.g., endo-1,4-beta-xylanase),
    other hemicelluloses (e.g., alpha- and beta-glactosidase), and chitin (chitinases)
    (Fig. S5a and Table S12). The majority of CAZyme transcripts were taxonomically
    assigned to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Except for chitinases,
    CAZyme transcripts affiliated with Firmicutes steadily decreased in abundance
    with incubation time, while those affiliated with Planctomycetes increased. The
    abundance of CAZyme transcripts affiliated with Proteobacteria varied over incubation
    time. The abundance of CAZyme transcripts affiliated with Actinobacteria was particularly
    high during the final incubation period (day 120), except for CAZyme transcripts
    involved in degrading other hemicellulases (Fig. S5b and Table S12). The methanogen
    metatranscriptome (16S rRNA, mRNA) Methanosarcinaceae, Methanocellaceae, and Methanotrichaceae
    were the prevailing methanogenic families throughout the complete incubation period
    (Fig. 4a, b; Tables S10 and S11). The Methanosarcinaceae was the dominant methanogen
    group, showing two-peak abundance dynamics. The family-level rRNA and mRNA abundances
    peaked first around days 11 and 14, then decreased until day 28, but increased
    thereafter again and reached a second activity peak between days 35 and 60. The
    Methanocellaceae were first detectable on day 11. Following the peak abundance
    on day 21, the relative rRNA and mRNA abundances steadily decreased towards day
    120. Significant transcript levels of the Methanotrichaceae were only detectable
    on mRNA level during the late phase, with the peak abundance at day 120. Fig.
    4 Relative abundance changes of the dominant methanogenic families (> 2%) on rRNA
    (a) and mRNA (b) levels, respectively. Their percentage abundances are given in
    relation to total archaeal 16S rRNA and mRNA, respectively. Data are means ± SE
    (n = 3). Asterisks * (PFDR≤0.05), ** (PFDR≤0.01), and *** (PFDR≤0.001) indicate
    significant differences. Asterisks shown aside from the taxonomic names indicate
    that in STAMP, the relative rRNA or mRNA abundances significantly changed through
    the whole incubation period. Asterisks directly shown in the plots indicate that
    in DESeq2, the rRNA or mRNA abundance in that particular sampling time point significantly
    differed from the original abundance at the first sampling (day 3). Significance
    values (PFDR) are only indicated on rRNA and mRNA levels for the taxon-specific
    abundance peak. The complete set of PFDR values obtained by DESeq2 analysis for
    all sampling time points is shown in Tables S10 (rRNA) and S11 (mRNA) Full size
    image Defining the dominant Methanosarcina populations The assembled near-full-length
    16S rRNA sequences grouped into four distinct Methanosarcina populations (Groups
    I to IV) (Fig. 5a). These differed in their abundance dynamics (Fig. 5b). The
    Group II population was most closely related to Methanosarcina sp. MSH10X1 and
    predominant throughout slurry incubation. Methanosarcina Group IV was the second
    most abundant population and closely affiliated with M. horanabensis. The Group
    II and Group IV populations showed opposite 16S rRNA abundance dynamics, with
    both Group II minimum abundance and Group IV maximum abundance at day 11 (51%
    [Group II] versus 34% [Group IV] of total Methanosarcina 16S rRNA) (Fig. 5b).
    The Methanosarcina Group I and Group III populations displayed low but relatively
    stable transcript abundances (collectively < 20% of total Methanosarcina 16S rRNA)
    throughout slurry incubation (Fig. 5b). Fig. 5 Phylogenetic tree of the four Methanosarcina
    populations detected in the paddy soil slurries (a) and their relative abundance
    dynamics over incubation time (b). a The neighbor-joining tree was constructed
    based on near full-length 16S rRNA sequences (> 1200 bp) assembled by EMIRGE from
    the metatranscriptomic datasets (415 sequences) and reference sequences extracted
    from Methanosarcina genomes in GTDB. b The relative abundance dynamics of the
    four distinct Methanosarcina populations (Groups I to IV) were inferred from the
    assembled 16S rRNA sequences. Data are means ± SE (n = 3) Full size image Mapping-independent
    expression analysis of methanogenic pathways The collective mRNA abundance of
    major methanogenesis pathways (Fig. 6a and Table S13) and the transcript abundance
    of particular pathway marker genes (Fig. 6b and Tables S13, S14) varied with incubation
    time. Acetoclastic methanogenesis was the dominant methane production pathway
    with the greatest transcript abundance in the early phase (36.4% of total mRNA
    assigned to KEGG level 3 category “methane metabolism”). This involved the peak
    transcript abundance of the following pathway marker genes: cdhAB, cdhCDE, ack,
    and pta (Fig. 6b). The changes in their relative expression level agreed well
    with the overall mRNA abundance dynamics of the Methanosarcinaceae during the
    early phase (Figs. 4b, 6 a-c). Transcripts of genes (acs) indicative of Methanotrichaceae-driven
    acetoclastic methanogenesis steadily increased in relative abundance during the
    late phase. Their peak abundance occurred on day 120, at which the relative expression
    level of genes indicative of Methanosarcinaceae-driven acetoclastic methanogenesis
    had significantly declined (Figs. 4b and 6b, c). Fig. 6 Relative mRNA abundance

    c. A list of the full gene names is shown in Table S14. The relative abundance
    values are given in relation to total mRNA affiliated to the KEGG level 3 category
    “methane metabolism”. The relative expression levels were calculated based on
    TPM values. Data are means ± SE (n = 3). Asterisks * (PFDR≤0.05), ** (PFDR≤0.01),
    and *** (PFDR≤0.001) indicate significant differences. Asterisks shown aside from
    the gene names indicate that in STAMP, the relative mRNA abundance significantly
    changed through the whole incubation period. Asterisks directly shown in the heatmap
    (b) indicate that in DESeq2, the mRNA abundance in that particular sampling time
    point significantly differed from the original abundance at the first sampling
    (day 3) or vice versa that the relative mRNA abundance (ack) at day 3 significantly
    differed from all other sampling time points. Significance values (PFDR) are only
    indicated for the peak transcript abundance(s) of each key pathway gene. c The
    percentage of acs transcripts affiliated with Methanocellaceae (acetate assimilation)
    was 68.1% on day 120, while those affiliated with Methanotrichaceae (acetoclastic
    methanogenesis) contributed 31.9%. The complete set of PFDR values obtained in
    DESeq2 analysis for all sampling time points is shown in Table S13 Full size image
    Members of the Methanocellaceae were the prevailing H2/CO2-utilizing methanogens,
    with genes encoding hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (fwd, ftr, mch, mtd, mer)
    being most expressed by this family-level group (Fig. 6b, c). Their gene expression
    dynamics agreed well with the overall mRNA abundance dynamics of the Methanocellaceae
    (Figs. 4b and 6a, b). In addition, transcripts of genes (mtaA, mtaBC, mtbA, mtbBC,
    mtmBC, mttBC) indicative of methylotrophic methanogenesis were detected, with
    mtaBC exhibiting the greatest transcript abundance throughout slurry incubation.
    The relative abundance of transcripts involved in methylotrophic methanogenesis
    increased from day 3 onwards and reached the first peak abundance (5.8% of total
    mRNA assigned to KEGG level 3 category “methane metabolism”) on day 14, but then
    decreased towards day 21 (2.1%). Thereafter, the relative transcript level of
    methylotrophic methanogenesis increased again and reached a second peak (3.4%
    of total mRNA assigned to KEGG level 3 category “methane metabolism”) around day
    60 (Fig. 6a, b). This two-peak (14 and 60 days) abundance pattern of mRNA encoding
    methylotrophic methanogenesis agreed well with the overall abundance dynamics
    of Methanosarcina-affiliated rRNA (Fig. 4a) and mRNA (Fig. 4b), in both early
    and late phases. Indeed, the taxonomic assignment of the transcripts involved
    in methylotrophic methanogenesis showed that they were entirely expressed by the
    Methanosarcinaceae (Fig. 6c). Gene expression of methanogenic pathways by Methanosarcina
    Group II Methanosarcina MAGs Metagenomic sequencing yielded 54,672,109 reads after
    quality control (Table S5). The assembly of quality-filtered reads generated 781,362
    contigs greater than 1000 bp and 21,770 contigs greater than 5000 bp. This resulted
    in three medium-quality Methanosarcina MAGs, ranging in completeness from 62 to
    82.5% (Table S5). One each was obtained from slurry material sampled after 21,
    28, and 35 days of incubation. The three MAGs shared high average nucleotide identity
    (ANI) values (> 95%). Compared to Methanosarcina genomes in GTDB, the three MAGs
    shared the greatest ANI values with Methanosarcina sp. MSH10X1 (> 85%) (Fig. S6a).
    In addition, the three MAGs shared high nucleotide sequence identities of their
    mcrA genes (98%). When compared to Methanosarcina reference genomes, the three
    MAGs also shared the greatest mcrA nucleotide sequence identity values with Methanosarcina
    sp. MSH10X1 (> 94%) (Fig. S6b). The inclusion of a near full-length 16S rRNA gene
    sequence (1400 nt) from MAG_21 in the Methanosarcina 16S rRNA tree confirmed that
    the three MAGs belong to Methanosarcina Group II and are most closely related
    to Methanosarcina sp. MSH10X1 (Fig. S7). Their predicted genome size (3.42 Mbp)
    was highly similar to that of strain MSH10X1 (3.56 Mbp) (Fig. S8). Comparative
    genomics revealed that the three MAGs share the majority of functionally annotated
    genes with the reference genomes of Methanosarcina Groups I to IV (922 common
    genes), while they encode 141 unique genes (Fig. S9 and Table S15). A synteny
    analysis showed that the organization of the mtaABC genes encoding methanol:CoM
    methyltransferase/methanol corrinoid protein displays in the three Methanosarcina
    MAGs a higher similarity to that in Methanosarcina sp. MSH10X1 than to their organization
    in the other reference genomes (Fig. S10). The three Methanosarcina MAGs and the
    genome of strain MSH10X1 contained five gene copies of mtaA and three gene copies
    of mtaBC (Fig. S10 and Table S16). Mapping-dependent gene expression analysis
    KEGG-annotated transcripts were mapped onto the three MAGs (Figs. 7a and S11).
    On KEGG level 2, transcripts involved in energy metabolism showed the greatest
    mapping efficiency (54% to 86% of total mapped mRNA) throughout slurry incubation,
    while transcripts encoding the translational apparatus were mapped with high frequency
    (30–32% of total mapped mRNA), particularly during the first week of slurry incubation
    (Fig. S11a and Table S17). On KEGG level 3, transcripts involved in methane metabolism
    were dominantly mapped (51 to 80% of total mapped mRNA) onto the MAGs throughout
    slurry incubation (Fig. S11b and Table S18). On KEGG level 4, transcripts involved
    in acetoclastic methanogenesis and methylotrophic methanogenesis were mapped with
    high frequency (Fig. 7a and Table S19). Overall, the transcript mapping frequency
    of the methylotrophic pathway (5.1–7.2% of total mapped mRNA) was lower than that
    of the acetoclastic pathway (7.5–12.4% of total mapped mRNA). Among total methanogen
    mRNA, mtaABC transcripts showed the greatest mapping frequency (Fig. 7a). Fig.
    7 a Relative abundance of pathway-specific mRNA and transcripts of key pathway
    genes in relation to total mRNA that could be mapped onto the Methanosarcina MAGs.
    A list of the full gene names is shown in Table S14. Mapping onto the MAGs was
    conducted for each mRNA dataset retrieved in triplicate from the same incubation
    time point (days 21, 28, and 35). The small dots indicate the mapping efficiency
    of each mRNA replicate dataset, while the large dot represents the mapping efficiency
    averaged across all three mRNA replicate datasets of a given sampling time point.
    The complete set of PFDR values obtained in DESeq2 analysis for all sampling time
    points is shown in Table S19. b Relative transcript dynamics of acetoclastic and
    methylotrophic methanogen pathways inferred from the competitive transcript mapping
    across the mix of Methanosarcina Group I to IV reference genomes. The relative
    mapping efficiencies were calculated based on TPM values. Data are means ± SE
    (n = 3). The mapping statistics are shown in Table S20 Full size image Competitive
    transcript mapping onto the four reference genomes Competitive mapping of metatranscriptomic
    mRNA reads onto the composite reference genomes of Methanosarcina Groups I to
    IV revealed that the vast majority of transcripts involved in acetoclastic and
    methylotrophic methanogenesis were mapped onto the genome of Methanosarcina sp.
    MSH10X1 (Group II). The only exception was metatranscriptomic reads obtained from
    the paddy soil slurries after 7-day incubation. On that day, a certain number
    of transcripts involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis were also mapped onto the
    genomes of Methanosarcina flavescens (Group I) and Methanosarcina horonobensis
    (Group IV) (Fig. 7b and Table S20). Discussion Our study revealed successional
    dynamics of distinct methanogen populations over the 120-day incubation period.
    This was closely linked to changes in the expression level of major methanogenesis
    pathways, which will be discussed in greater detail in the following text. A discussion
    on the dynamics of the bacterial community is made in supplementary text (Additional
    File 3). Linking metabolite turnover with methanogen dynamics Typical intermediates
    (i.e., acetate, propionate, butyrate) of the methanogenic food web transiently
    accumulated and were then rapidly consumed. Acetate is the most abundant intermediate
    during the anaerobic organic matter breakdown [19, 70]. Generally, it is the direct
    substrate for acetoclastic methanogens, including Methanosarcinaceae and Methanotrichaceae
    [70,71,72]. The transient accumulation of acetate with highest peak concentration
    on day 7 followed by its fast methanogenic consumption was closely linked to the
    increase in both the activity (defined by increased mRNA abundance) of Methanosarcinaceae
    (days 7 to 14, Fig. 4b) and the CH4 production rate (days 11-21, Fig. 1d). Thereafter,
    the decline in Methanosarcinaceae’s activity (days 14 to 28, Fig. 4b) corresponded
    well to a transient decrease in CH4 production (days 21 to 28, Fig. 1d). Propionate
    and butyrate are the next important intermediates of organic matter conversion
    under anoxic conditions [73]. Acetate, H2, and CO2 generated by the syntrophic
    conversion of propionate and butyrate can feed acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic
    methanogens. The oxidation of propionate (G0'' = +76 kJ/mol) and butyrate (G0''
    = +48,3 kJ/mol) is highly endergonic under standard conditions but can be accomplished
    by syntrophy with an H2-utilizing methanogen, which maintains a low H2 partial
    pressure [74]. The rapid consumption of butyrate between days 7 and 11 (Fig. 1b)
    corresponds well to the initial activity increase of H2-utilizing Methanocellaceae
    (Fig. 4b). The net consumption of propionate from day 14 towards day 28 indicates
    that in addition to butyrate, propionate fueled acetoclastic methanogenesis (Fig.
    1c). Composition and activity dynamics of the methanogenic community Our study
    identified three successional phases defined by two activity peaks separated by
    an intermittent decrease of methanogenic activity (Fig. 4). Methanogenic archaea
    obtain energy for growth by converting C1 and C2 compounds, including CO2, formate,
    acetate, ethanol, methanol, and other methylated compounds, to methane [75,76,77].
    Thus, the succession of methanogen guilds is due to changes in available substrates
    and their utilization for energy conservation. Methanosarcinaceae were the first
    methanogens to be stimulated in response to substrates (acetate) released by the
    anaerobic degradation of rice straw and may be considered early- or rapid-responding
    methanogens (Figs. 1a and 4b). With the ongoing anaerobic degradation of complex
    carbon, the activity of Methanocellaceae as intermediate responders was stimulated,
    primarily due to their role as syntrophic methanogen partners in the bacterial
    conversion of propionate to acetate, H2, and CO2 (Figs. 1c and 4b) [78,79,80,81].
    Methanosarcinaceae and Methanotrichaceae are an excellent example of how two family-level
    groups compete for the same substrate. Methanosarcinaceae prevailed in acetoclastic
    methanogenesis at the high acetate concentrations during the early phase, but
    after acetate declined to a very low level, the late-responding Methanotrichaceae
    significantly increased in competitiveness and acetoclastic activity (Figs. 1a
    and 4b). The abundance dynamics of total mRNA affiliated to either Methanosarcinaceae
    or Methanotrichaceae agreed well with changes in the relative expression level
    of their pathway genes indicative of acetoclastic methanogenesis (Figs. 4b and
    6b, c). With a higher maximum rate of acetate utilization and maximum growth rate
    (Y * k), a higher half-saturation coefficient (KS), and a higher yield coefficient
    compared with Methanotrichaceae, elevated acetate concentrations are favorable
    for growth and activity of Methanosarcinaceae. By contrast, members of the Methanotrichaceae
    are superior at low acetate concentrations due to the investment of energy to
    activate acetate, thereby leading to a lower k and KS [82,83,84]. Hence, our results
    are consistent with the concept that both substrate availability and substrate
    concentration (threshold concept) are key factors controlling the structure and
    function of methanogenic communities. A transient activity decline around day
    28 was observed in the absolute abundance of biomarkers, including both genes
    and transcripts of bacterial 16S rRNA and methanogenic mcrA (Fig. 2). This activity
    decline was also well evidenced by changes in the metatranscriptomic abundance
    of methanogen rRNA and mRNA (Fig. 4). Previous research has shown that over the
    first 4 weeks of straw decomposition, labile polymers are much faster hydrolytically
    released than recalcitrant compounds; with the latter having a longer residence
    time [70, 85]. The anaerobic decomposition of labile straw components, such as
    pectin and xylan, primarily occurs by a bacterial food web attached to rice straw
    [6, 36]. Exhaustion of the labile straw components leads not only to a change
    in the microbial colonization of rice straw but also to a transient decline in
    methanogenic precursors. In particular, hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria are
    increasingly detached from rice straw and released into the soil [6, 36]. In consequence,
    the transition from degrading the labile straw components to decomposing recalcitrant
    C compounds presumably leads to an overall decline in community activity around
    day 28 until critical sizes of functionally active populations and methanogenic
    precursor pools are re-established, thereby leading to a second activity peak
    during the late phase. Characterization of dominant Methanosarcina populations
    The intra-family analysis of Methanosarcinaceae identified four distinct populations,
    with the Group II population prevailing over the complete 120-day incubation period
    (Fig. 5). This implies the same methanogen population with close affiliation to
    Methanosarcina sp. MSH10X1 dominated Methanosarcinaceae during the early and late
    activity phases (Figs. 4 and 5). An ANI value of 95% is considered species demarcation
    [65]. Thus, our three Methanosarcina MAGs recovered from slurry samples incubated
    for 21, 28, and 35 days presumably belong to the same species. Moreover, the high
    ANI value found between the three Methanosarcina MAGs and Methanosarcina sp. MSH10X1
    (around 85%) suggests that the MAGs and strain MSH10X1 represent different but
    closely related species of the Group II population. (Fig. S6a). Phylogenetic analysis
    of the 16S rRNA gene located on the Methanosarcina MAG-21 and representative full-length
    16S rRNA sequences assembled from our metatranscriptomic datasets further substantiate
    that the three Methanosarcina MAGs are closely affiliated to Methanosarcina sp.
    MSH10X1. This provides additional evidence for the dominant role of the Methanosarcina
    Group II population in the slurry incubations (Fig. S7). Expression of methanogenic
    pathways by Methanosarcina spp. Previous paddy soil studies have demonstrated
    that acetoclastic methanogenesis is the major methane production pathway operated
    by members of the Methanosarcinaceae [16, 19, 28]. Indeed, we observed a high
    expression level of key genes (ack, pta, and cdhA-E) related to acetoclastic methanogenesis
    by Methanosarcina populations. The expression of ack and pta reached their peak
    abundance in the early phase, while their transcripts were detected only on a
    low level in the late phase. Obviously, acetoclastic methanogenesis was the major
    pathway operated by Methanosarcina spp. in the early phase (Fig. 6). The competitive
    mapping results further confirmed the major role of acetoclastic methanogenesis
    in Methanosarcina populations (including Groups I, II, and IV) during the early
    phase (Fig. 7b). However, we also detected the expression of key genes encoding
    methylotrophic methanogenesis (mta, mtb, mtm, and mtt), but in particular transcripts
    of mtaBC (accounting for 0.8 to 5.2% of total mRNA affiliated to the KEGG level
    3 category “methane metabolism”). The enzyme methyltransferase/methanol corrinoid
    protein encoded by mtaBC is a specific biomarker for methanol-dependent methanogenesis
    (Fig. 6b). The transcripts involved in methylotrophic methanogenesis were affiliated
    with Methanosarcinaceae. While their greatest expression level agreed largely
    with the two activity peaks of Methanosarcinaceae, the first peak abundance of
    methylotrophic mRNA showed a time shift relative to the peak transcript abundance
    of acetoclastic methanogenesis in the early phase (Figs. 7b and 4b). Thus, it
    is reasonable to conclude that Methanosarcinaceae produce CH4 via acetoclastic
    and methylotrophic methanogenesis in the Philippine paddy soil under anoxic conditions.
    The competitive mapping approach resulted in the mapping of nearly all methylotrophic
    mRNA to the Group II representatives, thereby implying that Methanosarcina Group
    II was the major player in methylotrophic methanogenesis (Fig. 7b). Detection
    of the genes encoding methylotrophic methanogenesis on the three Methanosarcina
    MAGs further substantiates this conclusion (Fig. 7a). Actually, Methanosarcina
    strain MSH10X1 prefers methanol and trimethylamine as substrates over acetate,
    H2/CO2, and other methylated compounds [86]. The utilization of methanol and trimethylamine
    resulted in the greatest methane yield produced by strain MSH10X1. This pure-culture-based
    finding agrees well with our result that Methanosarcina Group II is most competitive
    under conditions favoring methylotrophic methanogenesis. The expression dynamics
    of the acetoclastic and methylotrophic pathways by the Group II population strongly
    differed over the 120-day incubation period, thereby providing evidence that they
    were differentially regulated in response to major changes in substrate availability
    (Figs. 6 and 7b). In addition to methanol released during pectin degradation,
    certain amounts of methanol released during the decomposition of xylan [87, 88]
    and lignin [89,90,91] may have fed methylotrophic methanogenesis. Recalcitrant
    lignin may have been the primary source of methanol for methylotrophic methanogenesis
    during the second expression peak around incubation day 60. Here, it is noteworthy
    that compared to other major rice farming areas (China, Italy), the Philippine
    rice field soil is particularly rich in humic acids [32]. The anaerobic decomposition
    of lignin and the release of methanol requires the activity of bacterial laccases-like
    enzymes that anaerobically depolymerize lignin into smaller polymer units to which
    the enzyme pool of the anaerobic bacteria can get access to decompose them into
    monomers [90, 91]. Among the bacterial community, members of the Geobacteraceae
    are the most promising candidates for being involved in the anaerobic lignin degradation.
    These bacteria showed not only the expression of putative laccase genes but also
    their greatest relative expression level during the later phase (days 28 and 35)
    (Table S21). Thus, a functional interplay may have occurred between members of
    the Geobacteraceae and the Methanosarcina Group II population, a view that is
    further supported by the correspondence of their abundance dynamics on both rRNA
    and mRNA levels (compare Figs. 3 and 4; and see Additional File 3 for further
    details). Another putative candidate for being involved in the degradation of
    recalcitrant lignin may be members of the Peptococcaceae, given the reasonable
    correspondence of their rRNA and mRNA peak abundances with the expression peaks
    of methylotrophic methanogenesis. The Peptococcaceae have been identified as putative
    aromatic ring-cleavage bacteria in rice field soil under lignin-degrading methanogenic
    conditions [92]. Final remarks Understanding the sources and controls of microbial
    methane production and the response mechanisms of methanogenic communities in
    rice field soils is critical for modeling predictions of global methane emissions.
    Metatranscriptomics, coupled in part with metagenomics, provided us with detailed
    insights into the role and dynamics of key functional guilds participating in
    the methanogenic organic matter breakdown in Philippine paddy soil. A particular
    Methanosarcina population closely related to strain MSH10X1 dominated the methanogen
    community over the complete incubation period. This species-level population showed
    a significant successional change in the methanogenic pathways operated during
    the incubation period, with acetoclastic methanogenesis being highly active during
    the very early phase (around day 7) and methylotrophic methanogenesis being active
    during the later stages involving two independent expression peaks after an incubation
    period of 14 and 60 days. Collectively, our research findings expand our hitherto
    knowledge of the methanogenic pathways being active in paddy soils and show that
    methylotrophy is a predominant methanogenesis pathway in certain rice field soils.

    the MAGs and Group I to IV reference genomes. The green columns indicate the total
    number of predicted genes in the MAGs and Group I to IV reference genomes. The
    black and grey dots specify presence or absence of this particular set of characterized
    genes in the Methanosarcina MAGs and the Group I to Group IV reference genomes.
    Comparative genomics revealed that the three Methanosarcina MAGs (21, 28, 35)
    share their majority of predicted genes with the reference genomes of Methanosarcina
    Groups I to IV (922 characterized genes in common), while they encode 141 unique
    genes as specified in Table S15 (Additional File 2). The unique genes were associated
    with the following KEGG level 2 categories: cell wall component biosynthesis,
    cofactor biosynthesis, membrane transport, energy metabolism, cell motility, and
    genetic information processing. All the genes encoding essential enzymes for acetoclastic
    (K00925, K00625, K00192, K00193, K00194, K00195 and K00197), hydrogenotrophic
    (K00200-K00205, K11260, K11261, K00627, K01499, K00319 and K00320), and methanol-dependent
    methanogenesis (K14080, K04480 and K14081) were identified on all three Methanosarcina
    MAGs as specified in Table S16 (Additional File 2). Fig. S10. Methanol-dependent

    MAGs (21, 28, 35) and affiliated with particular KEGG categories on level 2 (a)
    and 3 (b). The triplicate metatranscriptomes of a given incubation time point
    were individually mapped onto a particular MAG as follows: (i) triplicate metatranscriptomes
    generated from RNA of the sampling days 3, 7, 11, 14, and 21 onto MAG_21; (ii)
    triplicate metatranscriptomes generated from RNA of the sampling day 28 onto MAG_28;
    and (iii) triplicate metatranscriptomes generated from RNA of the sampling days
    35, 60, and 120 onto MAG_35. The relative mapping efficiencies were calculated
    based on the normalized number of mRNA reads that could be mapped onto each ORF
    of a given Methanosarcina MAG. The dot sizes indicate relative mapping efficiencies.  Additional

    can be used under limited water condition for crop combating during moderate to
    lower stress conditions. Peer Review reports Introduction Maize is one of the
    vital cereals crops after wheat and rice grown in wide range of climates including
    tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. Likewise other cereals
    crops maize crop also faces many biotic and abiotic constraints during life cycle.
    These include insect pest infestation, diseases, drought and nutrients deficiency
    [1]. Among these factors drought stress has considerable effect on crop growth
    and development [2]. Water is an important integral part of the plants, plays
    important role in maintaining growth, turgidity and acts as a reagent in plant
    cells. Water stress is the most prominent abiotic stress that has a significant
    effect on crop productivity in agriculture lands around the globe. Increasing
    population and changing climate are likely to increase water scarcity by declining
    water sources, which will leads to decline in crop productivity in the world [3].
    The researchers makes it very clear that reducing irrigation causes large losses
    in yield in maize. However, in some circumstances, this form of water deficit
    may allow for water savings through reduced irrigation water use at little yield
    cost [4]. Since these cropping and irrigation conditions are comparable to those
    that local farmers face, it is crucial to understand how the crops will react
    to a moderate water shortfall. As a result of osmotic stress, plant cells produce
    more solution metabolites to avoid a water shortage and a drop in turgor pressure.
    The metabolites, which include nitrogen components like proline and other amino
    acids, polyamines, and ammonium, build as a result of osmotic adjustment [5].
    Organic solutions accumulate up in the cytosol and are crucial for osmotic regulation
    and cell retention, while a moisture deficit increases [6]. Physiological and
    biochemical alternation coordinated at the cellular and molecular levels results
    in drought resistance. Osmotic adjustment and more rigid cell walls could be part
    of these changes. Plant growth and productivity are negatively impacted by abiotic
    stress, which induces a range of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and
    molecular changes [7]. Drought tolerance mechanisms can be classified into three
    broad categories such as drought escape, drought avoidance, and biochemical tolerance
    of the tissues to water deficit [8]. Plants ability to withstand drought was demonstrated
    by the Cell Membrane Stability (CMS) experiment, which measures the integrity
    of cell membranes [9]. Maize has been shown to be extremely susceptible to drought
    [10]. The leaf area index were determined by [11] to be decreased by the degree
    of water stress. Likewise, deficit irrigation planning for maize is challenging
    without lowering production [12]. Deficit irrigation is a scheduling approach
    in which irrigation is purposely carried out so that the crop’s water requirements
    are not entirely met, and plants are allowed to take soil moisture above the water
    that is easily accessible in the plant roots [13]. Inoculating plants with plant
    growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) has been proven to protect them from a variety
    of abiotic stresses [14,15,16]. Previous research in the literature have demonstrated
    that Burkholderia spp., Bacillus spp., Pseudumonas spp., Azospirillum spp., and
    Rhizobium spp. reduce the severity of drought in wheat, barley, maize, and beans
    [17,18,19]. However, the PGPB’s mode of action can be direct or indirect, and
    it can encourage plant growth in both stressful and non-stressful situations [20,
    21]. The current experimental trial was planned to evaluate the impact of Bacillus
    spp. and deficit irrigation during early growth stage (vegetative) of maize crop.
    Materials and methods The experiment was performed in glass house located at research
    site of Isparta University of Applied Sciences Isparta, Turkey in 2022. Experimental
    trial was conducted in Completely Randomized Design having 3 replications and
    a total of 24 pots were used (Fig. 1). Factorial experiment of 2 factors (Irrigation
    and Bacillus) were performed. Irrigation levels were (no stress: 100% (I1) and
    deficit irrigation: 75 (I2), 50 (I3), 25 (I4) % of required water amount to reach
    pot capacity). The product of Biotrinsic FP-30 (Bacillus spp. based strain) was
    obtained from Indigo Turkey. Based on company recommendations (36 mg (milligram)
    per 100 mg of seed) were applied. In this experiment the variety KWS Kerubino
    hybrid (Zea mays L., indentata) was used which is classified as strong grain variety
    in the FAO 570 mortality group and has a broad-leaved, thick and robust stem,
    and a body structure that is resistant to lodging. It is highly adaptable to different
    climatic and environmental conditions. The seed were inoculated with Bacillus
    strain prior to seeding in the pot. Total of 250 gram of seeds were inoculated
    with 0.072 mg of Bacillus. After inoculation, the seeds were mixed thoroughly
    for while followed by sowing. Fig. 1 Overview of the experiment Full size image
    Required amount of fertilizers (Nitrogen-Phosphorus) was calculated from MAP (Mono
    ammonium phosphate) and AS (Ammonium sulphate). During sowing, phosphorus was
    applied at a rate of 100 kg ha− 1 and nitrogen at a rate of 200 kg ha− 1 (50%
    at sowing and 50% at 30–40 cm height stage). Each pot of 7 kg soil was applied
    with 0.45 gram of MAP for phosphorus. The applied amount of nitrogen was calculated
    (1.3 gram N from MAP) the rest of nitrogen was calculated from AS. Each pot was
    supplied with 5.33 gram of AS as nitrogen base fertilizers @ 100 kg ha− 1. The
    rest of half dose nitrogen was applied at 30–40 cm height stage of crop (40 days
    after sowing). The examined soil properties are presented in Table 1. Table 1
    Soil physiochemical properties Full size table All pots of the experiment were
    weighted for their initial weight and were filled with equal amount of soil. The
    volume of the pot was calculated as 742 cm− 3 (surface area as 0.28 m− 2). After
    seeding all the pots were irrigated with same amount of water and the field capacity
    of the pot were measured (approx. 24 h after irrigation). Afterward the remaining
    irrigations were performed based on water usage (evapotranspiration). All the
    pots of experimental trial were followed on daily basis for their weight and moisture
    loss and irrigation were performed according with the base amount of water (field
    capacity-2230 ml) by keeping the levels of irrigation under the consideration.
    Based on basal application of water the amount was decreased accordingly for all
    the treatments. Afterward, the irrigation was performed based on 30% moisture
    loss from the no stress treatments (I1) by weighing the pots. Using [22] equation
    for the soil water balance, evapotranspiration (ET) from each pot was calculated
    (Eq. 1). (1) Where ET stands for evapotranspiration, I for irrigation water depth,
    P for precipitation, Cp for capillary rise, Dp for deep percolation, Rf for runoff
    loss, and S for change in soil water content. Hence, there was no precipitation,
    capillary rise, deep percolation and runoff loss as the study was carried out
    in glasshouse. Downward flux below the crop root zone that was neglected because
    the lower side of every pot was covered with plastic bag in order to avoid drainage
    loss. The amount of evapotranspiration was equal to the irrigation was applied.
    Therefore, Eq. 1 was simplified to Eq. 2: (2) Equation 3 were used to compute
    the water usage efficiency (WUE) in the treatments [23, 24] (3) Where, WUE is
    water use efficiency, FBa is actual fresh biomass obtained and ET is evapotranspiration.
    To determine the relationship between a relative decrease in evapotranspiration
    and a relative decrease in yield Eq. 4 was employed [25]. (4) Where, Ky is the
    yield response factor, ETa and ETm are the actual and maximum evapotranspiration
    (mm), and FBa and FBm are the actual and maximum fresh biomass, respectively.
    After 60 days the crop was harvested, fresh and dry biomass, plant height (cm),
    stem diameter (mm), leaf area (cm− 2) root length (cm), root fresh and dry weight,
    were measured. Scale was used to measure plant height and root length, digital
    calliper to measure stem diameter, and digital weight balance to measure plant
    weight. Equation 5 was used to calculate relative water content [26]. (5) Where,
    RWC stands for relative water content. DW stands for Dry weight, FW for Fresh
    weight, and TW for Turgid weight. The experiment was laid out for 2 months between
    31st June-31st August. Pots were placed at the center of glass house and were
    tagged with proper label of corresponding treatment (Fig. 1). After 60 days of
    the experiment, above soil biomass (plant part) was harvested and kept in the
    plastics bags to avoid evaporation loss for further analysis. Root of the plant
    was removed with proper care from the pots by applying water in order to ease
    the extraction and to avoid damage. Afterward the roots were analyzed for their
    length fresh and dry weight. The collected data were statistically examined using
    the analysis of variance method in accordance with a completely random design
    by using Statistix software (version 8.1). When the F-test was significant, the
    least significant differences (LSD) test was used to link data means [27]. Results
    Water use efficiency Water use efficiency (WUE) which is a measure of crop output
    per unit of applied water. The interactive values of both irrigation levels and
    bacteria were presented in Table 2 while the mean values of the individual treatments
    were presented in Table 4. The level of irrigation water that produced the maximum
    biomass (193 g pot− 1) and water use efficiencies (0.72 g pot− 1 mm− 1) was observed
    with application of I1 with bacteria. Keeping in consideration the least decline
    in biomass and WUE by the interactive effect of irrigation level I2 inoculated
    with bacteria (0.61 g pot− 1 mm− 1 WUE) when compared with 100% water level without
    bacteria there was no difference in water use efficiency and plant fresh biomass.
    Analysis of variance shows significant effect of irrigation levels and bacteria
    on water use efficiency of maize crop. Plants supplied with 100% irrigation water
    resulted in the highest WUE (0.67 g pot− 1 mm− 1) followed by I2 water application
    with WUE (0.56 g pot− 1 mm− 1) while the lowest WUE (0.08 g pot− 1 mm− 1) was
    recorded in pots applied with 25% water (Table 4). According to the results obtained
    from this study, the interactive effect of the both factors was not significant
    at different irrigation levels and Bacillus has influenced biomass of plant and
    WUE. Table 2 Interactive values of evapotranspiration, fresh biomass and water
    use efficiency (WUE), leaf area, plant dry biomass and relative water content
    Full size table Irrigation (evapotranspiration) relationships between fresh biomass
    Evapotranspiration and plant biomass yield have a linear relationship at 1% significant
    level (R2 = 0.963) as seen in Fig. 2. According to the findings of the study,
    the yield response factor (ky) was 1.43. This result illustrates that the maize
    fresh biomass (vegetative growth) was sensitive to water deficit. Fig. 2 Relationships
    between evapotranspiration (irrigation water used), and crop biomass (a) and the
    relationships between the relative evapotranspiration deficit and the relative
    yield decline for maize (b) Full size image Plant fresh biomass (g) Response of
    plant fresh biomass to various irrigation levels and biofertilizers is presented
    in Table 3. The effect of both irrigation and bacteria inoculation was found significant
    while the interactive effect of treatments was no significant. Plants applied
    with 100% of water (I1) produced more biomass (180.42 g) compared with I2 and
    I3 water application having fresh matter of (113 g) and (39.17 g) respectively.
    The growth and biomass of the plants were suppressed in case of 25% water application
    resulted in stunted growth and low biomass (5.63 g) production. Seeds inoculated
    with bacterial strain produced more vigorous biomass (91.65 g) compared with seeds
    without any treatment of bacteria (77.31 g). Table 3 Growth attributes of maize
    as affected by irrigations levels and Bacillus spp Full size table Plant dry biomass
    (g) The effect of water application and Bacillus was found significant on plant
    dry biomass of maize plant (Table 3). Likewise, the interactive effect of biofertilizers
    and water application was also found significant. Application of 100% water showed
    more plant dry biomass (73.58 g) followed by 75% of water having dry matter of
    (47.58 g). Lowest plant dry biomass was observed in pots applied with 25% of water
    (2.20 g). Application of I1 water along with bacteria treatment resulted in pronounced
    effect with drier biomass followed by I2 water application and I3 water application.
    There were no significant differences among the means of bacterial and nonbacterial
    treatment (Table 3). Plant height (cm) The amount of irrigation had a substantial
    impact on maize plant height (P ≥ 0.05) as shown in Table 3. However, there was
    no significant effect of biofertilizers on the plant height. The interactive effect
    of the both factors was also non-significant. By mean comparison taller plants
    (125 cm) was recorded under well-watered condition (I1) followed by I2, I3 and
    I4 irrigation treatments which was (104 cm), (82) and (44 cm) respectively. Stem
    diameter (mm) The effect of both factors irrigation and biofertilizers was found
    significant for the stem diameter of plant. Plants treated with 75% (I2) water
    of field capacity resulted in maximum stem diameter (20.85 mm) followed by I1
    irrigation (18.02 mm). Plants subjected to stress conditions (I4) was observed
    with thinner and weak stem diameter (7.86 mm). Among biofertilizers treatments,
    pots treated with bacteria (B+) strains shows maximum stem diameter (15.67 mm)
    in comparison with control (B-) having stem diameter of (14.64 mm). The comparative
    effect of irrigation and biofertilizers was non-significant (Table 3). Leaf area
    (cm− 2) Leaf area of maize was significantly affected by both irrigation and biofertilizers.
    The interactive effect of the treatments was also recorded significant (Table
    3). Plants treated with I1 treatment were observed with maximum leaf area (350.72
    cm− 2) compared with deficit amount of water I2, I3 and I4 treatments with leaf
    area (258.84 cm− 2), (131.94 cm− 2) and (51.31 cm− 2), respectively. Seeds inoculated
    with bacterial strain also affected leaf area of maize plant. Inoculated seeds
    with bacteria were observed with expanded and maximum leaf area (214.20 cm− 2)
    compared with non-inoculated pots with leaf area (182.20 cm− 2). Among the interactions,
    pots inoculated with bacteria and supplied with 100% water were observed to have
    more leaf area (386.00 cm− 2) in comparison to the rest of treatments (Fig. 4).
    Root length (cm) Both irrigation levels and biofertilizers has significant affected
    root length of maize plant. The interactive effect of irrigation and biofertilizers
    was found non significant (Table 3). Among irrigation levels plants treated with
    I1 water resulted in maximum root length (92.83 cm) followed by I2 treatment with
    root length of (78.75 cm) which was statistically not at far with I3 level of
    water application (74.83 cm). Plants supplied with limited water (I4) resulted
    in shorter root length (56.41 cm). Among biofertilizers, Bacillus inoculated plants
    were observed with maximum vigorous roots (79.20 cm) compared with control (72.20
    cm) treatment (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Root length of maize crop as affected by irrigation
    levels and bacteria Full size image Root fresh weight (g) The effect of irrigation
    and biofertilizers on fresh root of weight presented in Table 3. Significant effect
    of both factors irrigation and biofertilizers was observed on fresh weight of
    root. The interactive effect of treatments was non significant. Pots applied with
    required amount of water (I1) were noted with more fresh matter (91.50 g) followed
    by I2 water application (69.83 g). Pots with least amount of water supply (I4)
    resulted in minimum fresh matter (6.29 g) production. Among biofertilizers treatments,
    pots with inoculated strain of bacteria produced maximum root fresh weight (53.52
    g) compared with control without bacteria application (46.10 g). Root dry weight
    (g) The effect of irrigation and bacteria inoculation was found significant on
    the dry weight of roots Table 3. Interactive effect of both factors was found
    no significant. Application of water in demand of plant (I1/field capacity) resulted
    in more dry weight of roots (28.66 g) compared with I2 treatment with root dry
    weight of (21.25 g g). Pots subjected to stress conditions (I4) were observed
    with lowest root dry weight (3.00 g). Likewise, bacteria treated seed produced
    maximum root dry biomass (16.70) compared with non-treated seed/pots (14.08).

    levels and Bacillus inoculation is presented in Table 4. Irrigation and bacteria
    has significantly affected leaf relative water content. Integrative effect of
    both treatments was also significant. Plants applied with 50% (I3) water resulted
    in highest RWC (81.95%) followed by I2 water application. Lowest Leaf RWC was
    recorded in leaf of plants applied with 25% irrigation. Among bacterial treatments
    non inoculated plants had more RWC (74.20%) value compared with inoculated plants
    (68.88%). When the interactive values of both the treatments was compared highest
    RWC (84.81%) was recorded in plants inoculated with Bacillus spp. and I3 treatment
    which was statistically at far with those of non inoculated treatment and I3 level
    of irrigation (Fig. 4). Table 4 Relative water content (%) and water use efficiency

    Plant characteristics including height, leaf area, stem diameter, and fresh and
    dry weight as affected by irrigation levels and Bacillus specie are presented
    in Table 3. Among the irrigations, levels the growth parameters were significantly
    increased with the amount of irrigation water. In the case of 100% water application
    highest growth in plant height stem diameter leaf area were observed followed
    by 75% irrigation and so on. Shortest plant height was recorded in pots applied
    with 25% water. This was probably of more water availability to the crop as water
    is an important component of plant cell and play vital role in cell division,
    enlargement and turgidity of the cell. These findings are in line with those of
    [28] who stated that highest moisture is important for cell division and growth.
    Stem diameter values increased parallel to increasing irrigation water [29]. The
    effect of bacterial inoculated seeds were found only for the leaf area and plant
    fresh weight of maize crop. Bacillus spp. treated pots resulted in more expanded
    leaf area compared with control (without bacteria). This could be due to due to
    more roots formation as a result plant extracted more water led to more leaf area
    and foliage production. Number of leaves on maize increased by roughly 12.4% and
    8.3%, respectively, when plant growth-promoting bacteria were used as compared
    to the control [30]. Similar studies have been carried out and researchers determined
    that the growth hormones released by the bacteria were responsible for the increased
    cell length, cell growth, and cell division that resulted in an increase in the
    number of leaves. The interactive effect of the treatments were found no significant
    for all growth aspects except leaf area and plant dry biomass. Inoculated seeds
    with 100% water application resulted in highest leaf area followed by non inoculated
    seeds. Lowest leaf area was noted in non-inoculated plots supplied with 25% of
    water. The differences in the plant growth during vegetative growth may be related
    to the photosynthetic processes that are closely associated with leaf and whole
    biomass growth [31, 32]. Variability in roots characteristics of maize was measured
    as root length, root fresh and dry weight. Plant treated with 100% of irrigation
    was observed with highest root characteristics followed by 75% water application.
    Lowest root aspects was noted in plants treated with 25% water. The increase in
    root formation with water application possibly due to moist rhizosphere in pots
    as a result the plants had showed its potential of lengthening their roots. These
    outcomes are consistent with those reported by [33], who observed significant
    variation in roots of maize with deficit irrigation levels. Drought stress has
    a significant impact on root development, root properties, and behaviour [34].
    In addition, plants treated with Bacillus spp. (inoculated plants) had the longest
    roots and the heaviest roots in both fresh and dry weight when compared with control
    plants. Numerous studies have examined PGBs, notably Bacillus spp., which exhibit
    a variety of features that enable them to mobilize soil nutrients and synthesise
    phytohormones that promote plant growth [35,36,37]. Inoculated maize seeds with
    the PGPR Azospirillum lipoferum produced more root tips, more root branching,
    and longer cumulative roots [38]. By increasing the production of proline, amino
    acids, and soluble sugars, Bacillus spp. Inoculation mitigate the effects of drought,
    increase plant development, and improve soil water and nutrient uptake [39]. Water
    use efficiency as a tendency of water holding was significantly affected by irrigations
    levels. WUE increased as the level of irrigation increased which means, a lower
    level of biomass was produced per mm of water used by the plants compared with
    required amount of irrigations. Highest WUE was recorded in pots applied with
    100% of irrigation. Water use efficiency was decreased by decreasing the level
    of water from 100 to 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively. Increase in WUE with increase
    in amount of irrigations could be due to more availability of water to the crop
    as a result plant has produced more biomass per unit of water applied. These results
    are consistent with those of [40], who reported significant increase in WUE with
    irrigation levels from low to high. The increase in WUE is a consequence of an
    overall decrease in plant transpiration caused on by a decrease in green leaf
    area as a result of the water shortage, which has probably reduced soil surface
    evaporation [41]. The combined variance analysis revealed that bacteria and irrigation
    practises both significantly impacted relative water content (RWC). Interactive
    effect of both treatments was also significant. Relative water content was decreased
    by increasing stress on plants. Highest RWC value was recorded in leaves of plants
    supplied with 50% irrigation followed by 75% and 100%. Plants exposed to stress
    conditions has shrinked and non turgor leaves when allow for water intake can
    restore their turgor therefore plants subjected to stress had highest relative
    water content. The findings of the current study accord with those of [42]. Among
    bacterial treatments, highest RWC value was recorded in leaves of plants having
    no inoculation in compared with inoculated plant leaves. In interactive effect
    of both treatments, highest RWC value was observed in inoculated plants applied
    with 50% irrigation which was statistical at par with non-inoculated treatment.
    During times of drought stress PGPB delay losses in leaf water potential, and
    speed up returns to control levels once water-limiting conditions are lifted [43].
    Conclusion It can be endorsed from the outcome that, under sufficient water conditions
    maize crop should be irrigated with the required amount of irrigation for obtaining
    maximum production. In case of limited conditions, water application can be minimized
    to moderate level up to 75% percent by alternate approach. In our study Bacillus
    spp. showed its pronounced effect in improving growth characters of maize crop.
    Bacillus spp. inoculation increased plant biomass, root biomass, and water use
    efficiency of maize plant during early growth stage of maize despite of water
    stress and can be used under limited water condition for crop combating during
    moderate to lower stress conditions. In addition to this, the yield response factor
    (ky) value in this study was determined as 1.43 (≥ 1) which demonstrates that,
    maize very sensitive to a lack of water in the soil during vegetative period.

  description: Global warming accelerates water cycle, causing more droughts globally
    that challenge monitoring and forecasting. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) is used to assess drought characteristics and response time of natural
    and economic systems at various timescales. However, existing SPEI datasets have
    coarse spatial or temporal resolution or limited spatial extent, restricting their
    ability to accurately identify the start or end dates or the extent of drought
    at the global scale. To narrow these gaps, we developed a global daily SPEI dataset
    (SPEI-GD), with a 0.25° spatial resolution from 1982 to 2021 at multiple timescales
    (5, 30, 90, 180 and 360 days), based on the precipitation from European Center
    for Medium Weather Forecasting Reanalysis V5 (ERA5) dataset and the potential
    evapotranspiration from Singer’s dataset. Compared to widely used SPEIbase dataset,
    the SPEI-GD can improve the spatial-temporal resolution and the accuracy of SPEI
    in areas where meteorological sites are lacking. The SPEI-GD significantly correlates
    with site-based SPEI and soil moisture. Our dataset solidly supports sub-seasonal
    and daily-scale global and regional drought research.

    to 2021 at multiple timescales (5, 30, 90, 180 and 360 days), based on the precipitation
    from European Center for Medium Weather Forecasting Reanalysis V5 (ERA5) dataset
    and the potential evapotranspiration from Singer’s dataset. Compared to widely
    used SPEIbase dataset, the SPEI-GD can improve the spatial-temporal resolution
    and the accuracy of SPEI in areas where meteorological sites are lacking. The
    SPEI-GD significantly correlates with site-based SPEI and soil moisture. Our dataset
    solidly supports sub-seasonal and daily-scale global and regional drought research.

    Open access 13 May 2023 Background & Summary Drought is a major natural hazard
    caused by a persistent water deficit over a period of time1, which can cause devastating
    impacts on regional agriculture2,3,4, water resources5 and vegetation coverage6,7,
    as well as on human health8, with far-reaching influences in an increasing globalized
    world9. For example, during 2003 central Europe drought, the gross primary productivity
    was estimated to reduce by 30%, which was equal to 4-year net carbon uptake of
    European ecosystem10. A more severe drought attacked Russia in 2010, which caused
    ~55,000 deaths, reduced crop yields by ~25%, and led to ~US$15 billion total economic
    loss5,11. As global warming accelerates the terrestrial water cycle12, droughts
    have increased substantially in many regions13,14 and are projected to become
    more frequent, severer and longer in the warmer future1,15. Therefore, deeply
    understanding and monitoring drought is crucial to carry out risk management and
    adaptive strategy for drought hazard. Droughts are usually classified into four
    categories: meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomic drought16.
    Propagation can occur in different droughts. That is to say, the lack of precipitation
    accompanying meteorological drought can lead to the deficiency of soil moisture,
    runoff or regional water availability, implying that meteorological drought can
    propagate into agricultural, hydrological or socioeconomic drought17,18,19. Meanwhile,
    different types of drought have differed characteristics, in terms of intensity,
    duration and frequency, making it very difficult to characterize quantitatively20,21.
    In addition, different physical mechanisms can cause drought at different timescales.
    For droughts at interannual or decadal timescales, large-scale internal climate
    variability (e.g. El Niño–Southern Oscillation or Pacific Decadal Variability)
    play critical roles22,23. For droughts at seasonal timescale, the local and remote
    land-atmosphere feedbacks are dominant drivers24,25. For droughts at sub-seasonal
    timescales or rapid-onset drought (flash drought), which can develop into severe
    droughts within a few weeks, the primary drivers are large precipitation deficits
    and abnormally high evapotranspiration26,27. These various and multiscale droughts
    can interact among above climate drivers to produce complex drought characteristics,
    raising great challenges for drought forecasting and impact mitigation28. In order
    to accurately assess droughts, several drought indices have been proposed. The
    Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) requires only long-term precipitation data
    and is recommended by the World Meteorological Organization29. Its biggest strength
    lies in the ability to characterize the response time of different usable water
    sources to precipitation deficits by varying the timescales after a relatively
    simple calculation30,31. However, SPI neglects the effects of evaporation stemming
    from temperature and other meteorological factors, which leads to misrepresentation
    of actual drought conditions especially in arid regions32,33. The Palmer Drought
    Severity Index (PDSI) is calculated using a rather complex water-budget system
    based on historic records of precipitation, temperature and the soil characteristics34,35.
    Therefore, PDSI measures soil moisture deficit and is more suitable for characterizing
    agricultural drought36. The SPEI combines the sensitivity of the PDSI to changes
    in evaporation demand (caused by temperature fluctuations and trends) with the
    multitemporal nature of the SPI32. It not only accounts for the effect of evaporation
    on drought, but also characterizes different types of droughts at multiple timescales37,38.
    This makes SPEI more informative in the aspect of actual drought effects over
    various natural systems and socioeconomic sectors21,30. There are two widely used
    global SPEI datasets: SPEIbase39 and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre Drought
    Index (GPCC-DI)40. The monthly SPEIbase is developed from Climatic Research Unit
    Time Series datasets with a 0.5° spatial resolution, while monthly GPCC-DI is
    developed from GPCC precipitation data and Climate Prediction Center’s temperature
    data with a 1° spatial resolution. The coarse spatial resolution of the two datasets
    restricts them to be only conducted at the regional or global scale. Meanwhile,
    the monthly temporal resolution also limits their ability to analyze droughts
    at sub-seasonal scales or those with a duration less than one month. Although
    some higher spatial or temporal resolution SPEI datasets have been produced recently21,33,41,42,
    the spatial extents of these datasets are limited to specific regions (e.g., China,
    pan-African, Central Asia). With the climbing number of sub-seasonal drought researches
    such as“flash drought”, which require data at a pentad or daily scale, the existing
    SPEI datasets hardly meet the increasing demand. Therefore, it is urgent to develop
    a SPEI dataset with daily timescale and global spatial coverage simultaneously.
    In such a context, this study developed a global daily SPEI dataset (SPEI-GD)
    with a 0.25° spatial resolution based on daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration.
    The dataset covers the period from 1982 to 2021 and provides five timescales (5,
    30, 90, 180 and 360 days). We then evaluated the accuracy of the SPEI-GD against
    coarser SPEIbase and site-based SPEI, the SPEI-GD was proved to identify more
    precisely both the spatial extent of drought and the onset and end time of drought.
    These improvements are critical for monitoring and assessing drought, especially
    for the accelerating flash drought. Methods Precipitation The hourly precipitation
    data with a 0.25°spatial resolution for the period 1982–2021 was obtained from
    the ERA5 dataset (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form).
    The hourly precipitation was summed to the daily scale. The ERA5 is the latest
    reanalysis data from European Center for Medium Weather Forecasting Reanalysis
    (ERA) and replaces the ERA‐Interim, which has been proved to be highly reliable
    for investigating climate change43. The ERA5 uses more historical observations
    (especially satellite data) in advanced data assimilation and modelling systems
    to estimate atmospheric conditions more accurately44. The 4D-Var data assimilation
    technique in cycle 41r2 is applied as well, which can help to explain errors between
    observation and prediction models, giving users more confidence in analysing atmospheric
    parameters at different scales of time and space45. Potential evapotranspiration
    The gridded potential evapotranspiration (PET) data developed by Singer et al.46
    for the period 1982–2021 was used (https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.qb8ujazzda0s2aykkv0oq0ctp).
    This PET data was produced based on output from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset,
    over the period from 1981 to present, with hourly temporal resolution and 0.1°
    spatial resolution. This PET data was calculated via the FAO’s Penman-Monteith
    (PM) method, which required seven climate variables including zonal and meridional
    components of wind speed, air and dew point temperature, net solar and net thermal
    components of radiation, and atmospheric pressure at the Earth’s surface. Compared
    to the Priestley-Taylor (PT) method, the PM method considers adiabatic sources
    of energy to drive evaporation. Therefore, Singer’s PET can not only have a broadly
    similar geographical pattern to the PET products (GLEAM and PT-JPL) based on the
    PT method, but also more accurately characterize low PET values in northern latitudes
    (due to low atmospheric energy availability), and high PET values in equatorial
    region and the Southern Hemisphere46. In addition, Sheffield et al. have shown
    that the PM method takes full account of changes in available energy, humidity,
    and wind speed, while the Thornthwaite method simply takes into account temperature,
    resulting in an overestimation of PET35. To match the precipitation, the spatial
    resolution of Singer’s PET was resampled to 0.25° based on bilinear method, and
    the originally hourly data was integrated to daily data. SPEIbase In order to
    verify the reliability of the SPEI-GD in this study, the SPEIbase for the period
    1982–2020 was used (https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/332007). The SPEIbase
    is based on monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from the Climatic
    Research Unit of the University of East Anglia following the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith
    estimation of potential evapotranspiration39. The SPEIbase offers SPEI data at
    multi-timescales between 1 and 48 months, with a 0.5° spatial resolution and a
    monthly temporal resolution. To date, it covers the period between January 1901
    and December 2020. The SPEIbase has been evaluated and applied by many studies47,48,49,50.
    In comparative analysis, in order to match the spatial resolution of SPEIbase,
    the spatial resolution of new developed SPEI-GD was resampled to 0.5° based on
    bilinear method. Daily and site-based SPEI Developed by Wang et al.41 for the
    period 1982–2018, the daily and site-based SPEI was used to evaluate the performance
    of SPEI-GD. This data based on multiple factors (daily precipitation, daily average
    air temperature, daily minimum air temperature, daily maximum air temperature,
    and sunshine duration) from 1961 to 2018 at 427 meteorological stations across
    China (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12568280). It should be noted that
    the daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated by the Hargreaves model
    based on temperature and solar radiation51,52. Although air temperature and solar
    radiation can explain at least 80% of evapotranspiration variability, they also
    introduce uncertainty into this site-based SPEI data. Soil moisture The SPEI-GD
    was compared with surface soil moisture (SSM) and root zone soil moisture (RSM)
    from Global Land-surface Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM) version
    3.6 dataset (https://www.gleam.eu/#downloads) to further assess its robustness.
    By this way, daily SSM and RSM data with a spatial resolution of 0.25° during
    1982–2021 were obtained. GLEAM is designed to estimate land surface evaporation
    and root zone soil moisture based on remote sensing observations and reanalysis
    data53,54. The root zone soil moisture is derived from a multilayer water balance
    driven by precipitation observations and updated with microwave soil moisture
    estimation. To correct random forcing errors, observations of surface soil moisture
    were also assimilated into the soil profile. Aridity index Climate regions based
    on aridity index (AI) were used to further verify the correlation between SPEI-GD
    and soil moisture. The annual mean aridity index developed by Zomer et al.55 for
    the period 1970–2000 with nearly 1 km spatial resolution was applied (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7504448.v5).
    The AI was calculated by the ratio of precipitation to PET, where PET was calculated
    according to the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith formula. According to the assessment,
    there is a high correlation between this dataset and the station-based data. AI
    values are unitless, increasing with more humid condition and decreasing with
    more arid conditions. Therefore, the climate regions were divided according to
    the AI values: hyper-arid (AI < 0.03), arid (0.03 ≤ AI < 0.2), semi-arid (0.2 ≤ AI < 0.5),
    sub-humid (0.5 ≤ AI < 0.65), and humid (AI ≥ 0.65). The spatial resolution of
    Zomer’s AI was resampled to 0.25° based on bilinear method. SPEI calculation The
    calculation of SPEI requires the accumulating deficit or surplus (Di) of water
    balance40 at different timescales (5, 30, 90, 180, and 360 days). Di were calculated
    by subtracting PET from precipitation using the following equation at a given
    day i: $${D}_{i}={P}_{i}-PE{T}_{i}$$ (1) The obtained Di were summed at different
    timescales Dkj,i, which represented a given day i and year j depending on the
    chosen timescale k (days). The equation is as follow: $$\\begin{array}{l}{D}_{j,i}^{k}={\\sum
    }_{l=365(366)-k+i+1}^{365(366)}{D}_{j-1,l}+{\\sum }_{l=1}^{i}{D}_{j,l}\\quad if\\;i\\;
    < \\;k\\;and\\;\\\\ {D}_{j,i}^{k}={\\sum }_{l=i-k+1}^{i}{D}_{j,l}\\quad if\\;i\\;\\ge
    \\;k\\end{array}$$ (2) where 365(366) represents the number of days in a non-leap
    or leap year, respectively. The Dkj,iwere then normalized into a log-logistic
    probability distribution, which was recommended to be the best for calculating
    SPEI32,56. The probability density function of log-logistic is as follow: $$f\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{\\beta
    }{\\alpha }\\left(\\frac{x-\\gamma }{\\alpha }\\right){\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{x-\\gamma
    }{\\alpha }\\right)\\right]}^{-2}$$ (3) where the parameters β, γ and α indicate
    shape, origin and scale, respectively. The probability distribution function of
    log-logistic is as follow: $$F\\left(x\\right)={\\left[1+{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha
    }{x-\\gamma }\\right)}^{\\beta }\\right]}^{-1}$$ (4) Finally, the SPEI was obtained
    by standardizing the F(x) using the following equation: $$SPEI=W-\\frac{{C}_{0}+{C}_{1}W+{C}_{2}{W}^{2}}{1+{d}_{1}W+{d}_{2}{W}^{2}+{d}_{3}{W}^{3}}$$
    (5) where C0 = 2.515517, C1 = 0.802853, C2 = 0.010328, d1 = 1.432788, d2 = 0.189269,
    and d3 = 0.001308. The values of W were calculated as below: $$W=\\sqrt{-2ln\\left(P\\right)}$$
    (6) where P = 1 − F(x), when P ≤ 0.5. If P > 0.5, the P is replaced by (1 − P)
    and the sign of SPEI is reversed. The negative and positive SPEI indicate dry
    and wet conditions, respectively. The classifications of dry and wet conditions
    based on SPEI are presented in Table 1, which is similar to the classifications
    of SPI57. Due to low hydroclimatic variability, the SPEI was not reliable over
    sparsely vegetated and barren areas39,56, the two specific land cover types were
    masked based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classification
    of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) landcover product (MCD12C1v061)58.

    table Data Records The global daily SPEI dataset59 (SPEI-GD) at 0.25° spatial
    resolution from 1982 to 2021 are provided open access via Zenodo, available at
    https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8060268. This depository includes the five files
    of the daily SPEI data with five timescales (5, 30, 90, 180, and 360 days). All
    data are geographical latitude-longitude projection and NetCDF format. Technical
    Validation To compare the daily SPEI-GD with the monthly SPEIbase, in this study
    we compared the SPEI of the selected month of SPEIbase with the SPEI of the last
    day of the corresponding month of SPEI-GD at multi-timescales (30, 90, 180 and
    360 days). For example, when comparing with SPEIbase at the 1-month timescale
    of June 1995, the SPEI at the 181st day (corresponding to the last day of June
    1995) of SPEI-GD at 30 days’ timescale would be used. Based on such correspondence,
    the correlation between SPEI-GD and SPEIbase was further analyzed using the Pearson’s
    correlation coefficient, and only statistically significant results were accepted
    and presented. Meanwhile, the Pearson’s correlation was also conducted to reveal
    the relevance between the site-based SPEI and SPEI-GD over China. Because neither
    SPEIbase nor site-based SPEI provided SPEI at a timescale shorter than one month,
    we did not validate SPEI-GD at a 5 days’ timescale. It is worth noting that the
    SPEI-GD at 5 days’ timescale used the same parameters as the SPEI-GD at other
    timescales. Soil moisture is an important drought assessment index28, and previous
    studies have found that it has the highest correlation with 6-month SPEI60, and
    this relationship has been applied to verify the accuracy of new SPEI dataset21,33.
    Therefore, the correlation between daily SPEI-GD at 180 days’ timescale and daily
    soil moisture (SSM and RSM) were evaluated both temporally and spatially. Evaluation
    of the SPEI-GD with monthly SPEIbase The global pattern of SPEI at an example
    day (30 June 1995) at multi-timescales (30, 90, 180 and 360 days) obtained from
    the daily SPEI-GD were shown in Fig. 1 in comparison with SPEI obtained from monthly
    SPEIbase at the corresponding month (June 1995) and timescales (1, 3, 6 and 12
    months). The reasons for choosing June 30 were as follows: on the one hand, the
    variabilities of precipitation and temperature in June were relatively higher,
    the differences of SPEI driven by different precipitation and temperature were
    larger, and thus June was a good time to prove the robustness of SPEI-GD; on the
    other hand, June 30 is the end of June, the daily timescale (30, 90, 180 and 360
    days) of SPEI-GD could exactly correspond to the monthly timescale (1, 3, 6 and
    12 months) of SPEIbase. As for 1995, it was just a random year in the time span
    of the SPEI-GD. The daily SPEI-GD and monthly SPEIbase showed quite similar dry
    and wet patterns. However, their details differed to some extent, especially in
    tropical rainforest of the Southern Hemisphere, where the SPEI-GD showed higher
    SPEI than SPEIbase, implying a lower severity of drought. Fig. 1 Spatial patterns
    of multi-scales SPEI in June 1995 based on daily SPEI-GD and monthly SPEIbase.
    In order to match the temporal scales, the 30, 90, 180 and 360 days of SPEI-GD
    corresponds to 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of SPEIbase, respectively. The SPEI for the
    181st day of SPEI-GD corresponds to that for June of SPEIbase in 1995. The daily
    SPEI-GD is calculated from ERA5 precipitation and Singer’s PET with a 0.25° spatial
    resolution, while the monthly SPEIbase is calculated from CRU TS datasets with
    a 0.5° spatial resolution. Full size image Furthermore, the SPEI-GD showed much
    more spatial details due to higher spatial resolution. Specifically, the spatial
    dry and wet patterns presented by SPEIbase mostly showed isolated high-value (absolute)
    centers, while SPEI-GD presented not only high-value centers, but also relatively
    low values around these centers. In the case of drought assessment, SPEI-GD could
    identify the spatial extent of the impacts caused by severe drought center, as
    well as the extent of potential impacts caused by the moderate drought around
    the center. Meanwhile, the spatial information of the gradient change of drought
    degree displayed by SPEI-GD could be conducive to the attribution analysis of
    drought, combined with the spatial change of climatic factors (e.g., precipitation,
    PET or temperature). These advantages have led to discrepancies between SPEI-GD
    and SPEIbase in identifying spatial extent of drought, especially across Eurasia.
    This is because the daily resolution of SPEI-GD showed the spatial extent of both
    the long-time severe drought and the short-time mild drought, while the monthly
    resolution of SPEIbase smoothed out the mild drought and showed only the long-time
    severe drought. As the timescale of SPEI increases, the duration of water deficit
    gradually escalates as well. For example, in June 1995, northern North America
    experienced a long-time and extremely severe drought (lasting at least more than
    a year), while north-central Asia experienced a short drought (lasting about 90
    days). This trait can be used to separate meteorological (30 days’ timescale),
    agricultural (90–180 days’ timescale), and hydrological (360 days’ timescale)
    droughts21,41. To further quantify the difference between SPEI-GD and SPEIbase,
    the correlation between them was calculated spatially at multi-timescales (Fig.
    2). In general, the SPEI-GD and SPEIbase were more consistent at longer timescale.
    This is because longer timescale not only integrates more water deficits, but
    also loses more information on water changes, making the two SPEI series smoother
    and thus more correlated. Furthermore, the correlation existed obviously spatial
    heterogeneity, with high correlations in America, Europe and China, while low
    correlations in Amazon, central Africa and central Asia. The input data of SPEIbase
    relies heavily on meteorological stations, and the number of stations in latter
    regions is very few, resulting in low accuracy of SPEIbase. In contrast, the newly
    developed SPEI-GD data in this study is based on reanalysis data, which combines
    data from multiple sources such as satellites, observation sites and models, largely
    avoiding the problems caused by the lack of input data. Fig. 2 Statistically significant
    (p < 0.05) correlation between SPEI-GD and SPEIbase at different timescales during
    1982–2020. The numbers of lower left corner of each subplot indicate the timescale,
    with days for SPEI-GD, and months for SPEIbase. For spatial matching, the original
    resolution of 0.25° of SPEI-GD was resampled to 0.5°, consistent with SPEIbase.
    Full size image Additionally, the correlations between SPEI-GD and SPEIbase at
    different timescales in different seasons were compared over the entire period
    (Fig. 3). The correlation coefficients in each season were averaged in the corresponding
    months in each hemisphere. For example, summer correlation coefficients were averaged
    from the monthly correlation coefficients for June to August in the Northern Hemisphere
    and December to February in the Southern Hemisphere. In general, the SPEI-GD and
    SPEIbase matched well with each other in all seasons, with median correlation
    coefficients greater than 0.70. Lower correlation coefficients were mainly found
    in the Amazon, central Africa and northern North America (Figs. S1–S4 in the Supplementary
    Information). Considering that SPEIbase was already widely used in drought monitoring
    in different seasons, the strong correlation between SPEI-GD and SPEIbase confirmed
    that SPEI-GD would also be highly reliable in drought monitoring in different
    seasons. The median correlation coefficients had a slight tendency to increase
    as the timescale increased. This is because the larger timescale smoothed out
    short-term fluctuations in the SPEI series. The lower correlation coefficients
    in summer may be attributed to the greater variability of temperature and precipitation,
    when the ERA5 and CRU data used to calculate SPEI-GD and SPEIbase respectively,
    were biased. Fig. 3 Statistically significant (p < 0.05) correlation between SPEI-GD
    and SPEIbase at different timescales in different seasons during 1982–2018. The
    numbers of lower middle corner of each subplot indicate the timescale, with days
    for SPEI-GD, and months for SPEIbase. Full size image Evaluation of the SPEI-GD
    with daily site-based SPEI Data products based on the inversion of site observations
    are considered to be the most reliable. In this study we further calculated the
    correlation between SPEI-GD and site-based SPEI, and specifically, the daily SPEI-GD
    of the raster at the station location of site-based SPEI was used (Fig. 4). In
    general, positive correlations with mostly larger than 0.5 (p < 0.05) between
    SPEI-GD and site-based SPEI were found at each timescale (30, 90, 180 and 360
    days), and especially, for 360 days. Considering the sample size of 13880 (38
    years with 365/366 days for each year) involved in the correlation analysis, a
    correlation coefficient of 0.5 or more indicated that the SPEI-GD developed in
    this study had a very high accuracy against site-based SPEI. However, the relatively
    low correlation coefficients in the arid regions of northwest China and drought-prone
    southwest China61 may result from the low hydroclimatic variability, and the large
    uncertainty in the SPEI series39,56. Fig. 4 Statistically significant (p < 0.05)
    correlation between SPEI-GD and site-based SPEI at different timescales during
    1982–2018. The numbers of upper center of each subplot indicate the timescale.
    SPEI-GD and site-based SPEI are both daily data. Full size image Comparison against
    surface and root zone soil moisture The SPEI-GD and SPEIbase were also compared
    with surface and root zone soil moisture at the timescales of 180 days and 6 months
    during 1982–2020. As shown in Fig. 5, SPEI-GD showed stronger positive correlations
    with SSM and RSM than SPEIbase globally, especially in Amazon and central Africa.
    Given the large uncertainty of SPEIbase in these regions as mentioned above, the
    results presented here suggested a higher accuracy of SPEI-GD than SPEIbase. In
    addition, both SPEI-GD and SPEIbase showed relatively higher correlations with
    RSM than SSM. This is mainly due to the fact that SSM is more susceptible to non-meteorological
    factors such as vegetation activities and human activities than RSM, and thus
    has a relatively lower correlation with the meteorological drought index of SPEI62.
    This interpretation can be further verified from Fig. 5e, which calculated the
    daily global mean of SSM, RSM, and SPEI-GD. The amplitude of SSM was relatively
    lower than RSM, and the time series were more stable. The correlation coefficient
    between global means of SPEI-GD and SSM was as high as 0.81 with 0.88 for that
    between SPEI-GD and RSM, further indicating the high accuracy of SPEI-GD. Fig.

    and soil moisture at the timescales of 180 days and 6 months during 1982–2020.

    time series of global mean SSM, RSM and SPEI-GD, where R indicates the correlation
    coefficient. Full size image In addition, the correlation between SPEI-GD, SPEIbase
    and soil moisture in different climate regions were calculated (Fig. 6). Overall,
    no matter SSM or RSM, their correlation with SPEI-GD were higher than that with
    SPEIbase in almost all climate regions, except hyper-arid region. Compared with
    SPEIbase, the increase of correlation coefficient of SPEI-GD with soil moisture
    was particularly significant in humid and sub-humid regions. In details, in the
    sub-humid region, the median correlation coefficient with RSM (SSM) increased
    from 0.40 (0.34) to 0.53 (0.43); in the humid region, the median correlation coefficient
    with RSM (SMM) increased from 0.35 (0.26) to 0.60 (0.46). The correlation between
    SPEI-GD and soil moisture gradually increased with decreased dryness, which was
    expected that higher water availability in wetter regions leaded to slower soil
    moisture consumption and thus more correlated with longer timescales SPEI. In
    contrast, the median correlation coefficient between SPEIbase and soil moisture
    was lower in sub-humid and humid region than in semi-arid region, possibly because
    the CRU data driving SPEIbase had a larger error in sub-humid and humid regions.

    Singer’s daily potential evapotranspiration, the global daily SPEI dataset (SPEI-GD)
    was produced. The SPEI-GD dataset covers the complete daily series of 40 years
    from 1982 to 2021 with a spatial resolution of 0.25°. The SPEI-GD provides multi-timescales
    accumulated SPEI, including 5, 30, 90, 180 and 360 days. We hope this new dataset
    can reduce the cost of time for researchers and avoid duplication of effort. Compared
    with existing SPEI datasets (SPEIbase and site-based SPEI for China), SPEI-GD
    not only has higher temporal and spatial resolution, and wider spatial extent,
    but also has a higher correlation with surface and root zone soil moisture from
    GLEAM, especially in areas where site observations are missing, such as Amazon
    and central Africa tropical rainforests. These results indicate our new dataset
    improves the spatial and temporal resolution of the available SPEI data while
    enhancing the simulation accuracy. These improvements can better support global
    or regional drought monitoring and response at a daily scale, such as quantifying
    the characteristics of sub-seasonal droughts63,64, including accurately extracting
    the onset and end days of various droughts instead of the onset and end months,
    as well as the number of drought duration days. Based on daily SPEI-GD data, the
    onset or end dates of the drought could be determined based on SPEI below or above
    a certain threshold. For example, a specific day with the first SPEI < −1 indicates
    the onset date of a moderate drought, and the followed day with SPEI > −0.5 indicates
    the end date of the drought. The number of days of drought duration could be determined
    by the difference between the onset date and end date. Through the analysis of
    these characteristics at daily scale, the evolution process of drought could be
    accurately clarified. Flash droughts are typically sub-seasonal droughts characterized
    by rapid onset that can develop into severe droughts within a few weeks28. The
    SPEI has been proved to be a reliable and robust metric to identify and quantify
    flash drought65,66,67, and a flash drought is defined to have: (1) a minimum length
    of 4 weeks in the development phase; (2) a ΔSPEI equals to or < −2 z-units; and
    (3) a final SPEI equals to or < −1.28 z-units. Due to the lack of daily SPEI,
    SPEI at 1-month timescale or weekly time resolution was used in previous studies,
    resulting in the characterizing of flash droughts (duration, and timing of onset
    and end) only at a weekly time resolution. Our SPEI-GD data with daily time resolution
    can further improve the temporal accuracy of flash drought characteristics (e.g.,
    which day its onset or end is, and how many days it lasted). There are also uncertainties
    that need to be explored in future works. Firstly, in SPEI calculation, we used
    the widely accepted log-logical probability distribution to fit the deficit or
    surplus of the water balance, which needed to be further compared with other fitting
    functions (Normal, Pearson type III and Generalized Extreme Value). Secondly,
    we mainly used the reanalysis data of ERA5 as input data. Future work could integrate
    observational data to improve the robustness of SPEI-GD, such as daily precipitation
    data from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), and daily temperature
    data from Climate Prediction Center (CPC). Lastly, we proposed the advantage of
    daily SPEI-GD in identifying flash drought characteristics, but the associated
    thresholds (e.g., the minimum lasted days in the development phase) needed to
    be further determined. Code availability Since the newly developed SPEI-GD dataset
    has a high temporal and spatial resolution (the amount of data in the intermediate
    process is about 2 000 GB), we ran codes on MATLAB and R programming Language,
    utilizing parallel computing tools and chunked computation algorithms to solve
    the problem of limited computer memory and long computation time. The code files
    are available at https://github.com/XuebangLiu/SPEI-GD. References Ault, T. R.

  description: 'There is a long history in environmental sciences to investigate and
    understand the fate of chemicals in the environment. For pesticides, this has
    led to systematic assessments of compounds by both academic and regulatory bodies,
    particularly for soil and water. As we show here, in recent years, there is an
    increasing interest in the potential presence of pesticide residues in air and
    related exposure risks. Based on a literature review for the years 2002–2022,
    we find a growing number of air monitoring studies with an average of 6.7 studies/year
    since 2020, with passive sampling methods contributing significantly to this rise.
    Most studies are concentrated in Europe and North America, with France leading
    in the number of monitoring studies. However, due to a lack of harmonization,
    and thus, the use of diverse methods and approaches, it remains challenging to
    derive potential exposure risks, to assess data quality of studies, and to compare
    datasets. In this perspective, we focus on current and emerging trends of different
    air monitoring approaches and highlight how they influence the interpretation
    of data. To improve the comparability and utility of data, and to ensure that
    air monitorings meet certain quality requirements, we propose a path forward,
    including: (1) Standardization and harmonization of methods: Adopting well-characterized

    There is a long history in environmental sciences to investigate and understand
    the fate of chemicals in the environment. For pesticides, this has led to systematic
    assessments of compounds by both academic and regulatory bodies, particularly
    for soil and water. As we show here, in recent years, there is an increasing interest
    in the potential presence of pesticide residues in air and related exposure risks.
    Based on a literature review for the years 2002–2022, we find a growing number
    of air monitoring studies with an average of 6.7 studies/year since 2020, with
    passive sampling methods contributing significantly to this rise. Most studies
    are concentrated in Europe and North America, with France leading in the number
    of monitoring studies. However, due to a lack of harmonization, and thus, the
    use of diverse methods and approaches, it remains challenging to derive potential
    exposure risks, to assess data quality of studies, and to compare datasets. In
    this perspective, we focus on current and emerging trends of different air monitoring
    approaches and highlight how they influence the interpretation of data. To improve
    the comparability and utility of data, and to ensure that air monitorings meet
    certain quality requirements, we propose a path forward, including: (1) Standardization
    and harmonization of methods: Adopting well-characterized and widely applied methods
    from air quality research as a basis for standardizing pesticide monitoring, with
    a clear distinction between relevant exposure and total air concentrations. (2)
    Tiered approach for monitoring programs: A dynamic concept where initial passive
    sampling identifies potential exposure risks, followed by active sampling for
    quantitative data, and, if necessary, extensive monitoring programs. This approach
    balances the need for detailed data with resource constraints. (3) Data interpretation
    and transparency: Public availability of data and clear reporting of methods,
    analysis, and uncertainties are crucial for the credibility and utility of monitoring
    studies. Overall, we see that harmonization of standards is critical for assessing
    exposure risks from pesticides in air and for informing regulatory decisions and
    mitigation strategies. Collaboration with the air quality and atmospheric research
    community is strongly recommended to leverage existing expertise in sampling,
    analysis, and data interpretation. Introduction There is an ever-increasing trend
    to investigate and understand the effects of human-made chemicals on the environment
    and human health [1]. This has led to a systematic assessment of such compounds
    by academic and regulatory bodies—especially for substances intentionally released
    into the environment, such as pesticides [2, 3]. Historically, the focus of such
    assessments has been mostly on soil and water. However, there is increasing interest
    in the potential presence of pesticides in the atmosphere—as demonstrated below.
    In modern farming, pesticides are essential in maintaining productivity as part
    of an integrated approach to pest, weed and disease management [4]. Despite significant
    improvements in mitigation measures during and after application [5,6,7], pesticides
    can be emitted into the atmosphere by volatilization and by wind erosion of particles
    on which the pesticide is sorbed [8,9,10,11]. As the atmosphere represents the
    largest and most dynamic of the environmental compartments, pesticide residues
    can be transported relatively far from their application areas to non-target areas
    [12,13,14]. Potential impacts on human health, the environment, and ecosystems
    are typically assessed in a risk assessment during registration of a substance,
    e.g., by measuring spray drift at the edge of a field as a worst-case scenario.
    Nonetheless, recent reports claim that current assessment procedures might be
    insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation [12, 13]. In contrast to this emerging
    trend for pesticides, there is a long history in atmospheric and air quality research
    for chemicals that are unintentionally introduced into the environment from traffic
    and industry, e.g., black carbon, PAHs, NOx, and persistent organic pollutants
    (POPs) [15]. Thus, sampling techniques and measurement methodologies for such
    compounds are well-known, offering the possibility to adapt these for the measurement
    of pesticides in ambient air. So far, pesticides in air have been sampled using
    numerous methods and approaches, and data were often generated with a range of
    objectives in mind, ranging from exposure assessments for operators, bystanders
    and residents [5, 12, 16, 17], to studies on airborne transport [7, 18, 19] and
    quantification of volatilization fluxes [9, 11, 20]. This lack of standardization
    has created a diverse array of information that needs to be understood to improve
    future air monitoring programs and to interpret previously collected data appropriately.
    Therefore, it is important to assess the applied sampling methods and generated
    data in terms of their capabilities and limitations. This work presents a perspective
    on current and emerging trends of the different approaches used to measure pesticides
    in air. It highlights the major differences in these approaches and how they influence
    both the setup of studies and the interpretation of data. Moreover, it also introduces
    a tiered approach for potential future monitoring programs, forming the basis
    for a cost-efficient risk assessment of pesticide residues in air. Although already
    suggested prominently in 2008 [10], there is still little guidance available on
    how to assess the quality of monitoring studies on pesticides in air and how to
    set up such monitoring programs to meet certain quality requirements. Thus, it
    is hoped that this work will inform both data generators and data users during
    their work and initiate improvements towards standardization of monitoring pesticides
    in air. Harmonization of sampling procedures and methods would have a positive
    impact on the quality and comparability of data. The integration of best practices,
    techniques, and standards from atmospheric chemistry can contribute to the advancement
    of reliable environmental risk assessments. Current status and emerging trends
    in the measurement of pesticides in the atmosphere A review of the scientific
    peer-reviewed literature on corresponding monitoring studies over two decades
    (i.e., 2002–2022) provides a picture of the current status and trends in the monitoring
    of pesticides in the air (see Additional file 1). The identified studies clearly
    show a strong geographical bias towards Europe and North America which likely
    reflects the larger public and political interest in monitoring data as well as
    the available resources. As shown in Fig. 1A, most monitoring studies on pesticides
    in air have been conducted in France (n = 14), followed by Spain and the USA (both
    n = 6), and Canada (n = 5). To the best of our knowledge, data from other parts
    of the world are solely available for Brazil (n = 3), Costa Rica, South Africa,
    and China (all n = 1). Fig. 1 A Sampling locations of studies on pesticides in
    ambient air. B Yearly number of published studies on pesticides in ambient air,
    grouped according to the applied sampling methods (passive sampling may include
    additional deposition sampling) Full size image Besides the large number of scientific
    publications on pesticides in air, French monitoring programs by regulatory agencies
    and governmental bodies certainly belong to the most detailed and extensive studies
    in Europe and world-wide. Since 2002, the French Air Quality Monitoring Associations
    (AASQA) conduct regular and continuous monitoring studies to collect data not
    only on common air pollutants (e.g., NOx, SO2), but also on pesticide residues
    in ambient air. By August 2023, the Phytatmo database contained data on 321 active
    substances from > 10,000 samples taken at 176 sites throughout metropolitan France
    and overseas [21]. As these programs commonly have been organized by regional
    or local authorities, only few data were available at the national scale until
    2018 when the most recent initiative was started. For a 12-month period (June
    2018–June 2019), the CNEP (Campagne Nationale Exploratoire des Pesticides dans
    l’air ambiant) monitoring campaign sampled residues of 75 pesticides in ambient
    air at 50 different field sites across France, resulting in 1800 samples and > 100,000
    data points for the investigated compounds. In contrast to previous monitoring
    studies, the CNEP program was the first nation-wide campaign with the goal to
    establish a harmonized inventory of pesticide levels in air based on synchronized
    measurements following a common protocol [22]. Although less represented in terms
    of publication numbers, Belgium has intensively investigated pesticide residues
    in air in the Wallonia region. The EXPOPESTEN and PROPULPP programs running from
    May 2015–May 2016 and from March–September 2018, respectively, focused specifically
    on the exposure of the population to plant protection products and protective
    measures to limit this exposure [23,24,25]. A much smaller monitoring program
    with about 10 air samples per year is maintained by the Swedish University of
    Agricultural Science in the South of Sweden (i.e., Vavihill and Hallahus). Nonetheless,
    data on air samples reach back to 2009 for up to 120 different substances [26,
    27]. Similar to France and Belgium, in Germany the federal Office of Consumer
    Protection and Food Safety is planning to conduct a multi-year monitoring program
    to investigate pesticide residues in air with the intention to facilitate more
    precise statements on exposure, transport and deposition. These data shall enable
    a more reliable and detailed risk assessment and, in the long term, to be incorporated
    into authorization procedures for plant protection products [28, 29]. In the US,
    the air monitoring program by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation
    (CDPR) is the most extensive initiative aimed at assessing the presence of pesticides
    in air. With a specific focus on agricultural regions where pesticide application
    is prevalent, since 2011 this program has operated a network of up to 8 monitoring
    stations strategically positioned across the state. These stations collect air
    samples at regular intervals, enabling the determination of air concentrations
    of up to 35 pesticides and 5 breakdown products. Due to taking continuous measurements,
    by the end of June 2023 the CDPR database already contained a total of 98,823
    ambient air sample records [30]. Besides the geographical bias towards Europe
    and North America, there is a clear time trend observable for the number of monitoring
    studies on pesticides in air (Fig. 1B). While the average number of publications
    remained rather low until 2010 (navg = 1.4 studies/year) with a slight increase
    during the following decade (navg = 2.9 studies/year), this number has more than
    doubled since 2020 (navg = 6.7 studies/year). This remarkable increase, likely
    driven by a combination of societal, political, and technical reasons, clearly
    shows that in recent years there has been an increased interest in measurements
    of pesticides in ambient air. Although these studies eventually have similar objectives,
    a very diverse method set has been applied for the measurements, which we group
    here according to the sampling methods used because of its significant impact
    on the results obtained. Noteworthy, the use of passive samplers and other methods
    (e.g., biomonitoring) has significantly contributed to the strong increase in
    study numbers since 2020. We speculate that this is at least partly due to the
    fact that the studies were often initiated from outside of the traditional air
    quality and atmospheric research community where active samplers are commonly
    applied. Thus, if this trend on measuring pesticides in air continues, guidance
    and standardization are needed to assess the quality of obtained monitoring data
    and to set up measurements which meet basic quality requirements and reliably
    yield the desired information. Air sampling methods, standards and data: limitations,
    advancements and challenges In general, air sampling methods can be separated
    into active and passive techniques depending on whether ambient air is actively
    drawn into the sampling device or not. Figure 2 gives an overview of the most
    common setups and a qualitative estimate on time resolution, technical complexity
    and costs, data accuracy and commercial availability. Fig. 2 A Established setup
    for active sampling (e.g., AFNOR XP X 43–058). [31] (B) Established setup for
    passive sampling (i.e., PUF-PAS). [36, 37] (C) Classification of sampling techniques
    regarding time resolution, technical complexity and costs, measurement accuracy,
    and commercial availability (passive sampling may also include biomonitoring)
    Full size image In active samplers (Fig. 2A), the sample air is drawn by a pump
    through a combination of a filter substrate for particle collection and a sorbent
    material for sampling of gaseous compounds. A critical parameter is the use of
    a pre-separator at the inlet of the sampling device which will determine if total
    suspended matter (TSP) or a certain size fraction of airborne particles is sampled
    (e.g., PM10–meaning that particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 µm have
    a 50% chance to be sampled). To the best of our knowledge, there are so far only
    four dedicated technical standards available on measuring pesticides in air—the
    French AFNOR XP X 43–058, the US EPA TO 4 and TO 10, and the derived ASTM D4861-23
    [31,32,33,34]. These standards summarize a selection of best practices regarding
    sampling methods, sample storage, transport, handling and analysis as well as
    the calculation of the final results. The US standards focus solely on pesticides
    in the gas phase and give guidance for active sampling on sorbent materials, such
    as polyurethane foams (PUFs), with high and low flow rates. Airborne particles
    may also be collected with these approaches, but the sampling efficiency is unknown
    [32,33,34]. In contrast, the French AFNOR standard describes sampling procedures
    for both gas and particle phases. It suggests the use of a pre-separator (PM10
    or PM2.5), a quartz microfiber filter for particulate matter, and a PUF sorption
    filter to retain pesticide residues in the gas phase. Depending on the chosen
    flow rates and corresponding sampling frequencies, the method gives daily to weekly
    samples. Extraction and analysis of the particle filter and the PUF is later combined.
    Therefore, this method yields only total concentrations for a certain compound
    in PMx and the gas phase. [31] Despite its implementation since 2007, hitherto
    only a few studies follow the AFNOR standard completely—even when conducted within
    France. Thus, it must be speculated that the standard is either not sufficiently
    known within the scientific community or that it is regularly ignored for other
    reasons, like a conflict with the intended study design. An important feature
    of the standard is that it is focused on human exposure via inhalation and respiration,
    which should not be confused with the determination of total air concentrations,
    which would also include larger particles (i.e., total suspended matter, TSP).
    In addition, the commonly applied omnidirectional inlets exhibit non-ideal sampling
    performance with increasing wind speeds and have been suggested to be biased by
    as much as 66% [35]. Moreover, as no differentiation between gas and particle
    phases is implemented, the procedure only gives limited information on transport
    and deposition mechanisms for a certain substance. Nonetheless, the standard remains
    the only official guidance on monitoring pesticides in air specifically including
    the measurement of particle-bound residues. For passive samplers the setup is
    commonly reduced to a disc of sorbent material (e.g., PUF), placed between two
    steel bowls, to sample volatile and semi-volatile compounds from the gas phase
    (Fig. 2B). The setup was first described by Shoeib and Harner [37] and allows
    ambient air to flow through the sampling device while protecting the sample from
    precipitation and solar irradiation. Variations of this setup employ additional
    polyethylene foam disc or glass fiber filters to sample also low volatile compounds
    in the particle phase [12, 38]. The technical simplicity and low cost of such
    samplers makes them easy to deploy even in very remote areas and is one of the
    main reasons for their use in global monitoring programs, such as the Global Atmosphere
    Passive Sampling (GAPS) network and the MONET program on POPs [39,40,41]. Common
    sampling times are in the range of several months after which the sorbent disc
    is extracted, and the extracts analyzed for the compounds of interest. However,
    in contrast to the simple sampling procedure and low maintenance efforts, it remains
    a major challenge to derive reliable air concentrations from the collected samples.
    We will focus here on a brief overview on the limitations and challenges as a
    detailed review was recently published by Wania and Shunthirasingham [36]. The
    largest challenge when deriving air concentrations from passive samplers is the
    estimation of sampling rates. It has been shown that sampling rates are highly
    variable and are associated with an uncertainty factor of up to ~ 30, as they
    are strongly influenced by wind speed, wind direction, and the physicochemical
    properties of the analytes [42, 43]. Additionally, parameters such as uptake capacity,
    ambient temperature, and time of linear uptake vs. time to equilibrium need to
    be considered for each target compound separately. Moreover, for low and semi-volatile
    compounds in the particle phase, the sampling process is further influenced by
    parameters such as particle size distribution. Thus, air concentrations for particle-bound
    substances are considered to exhibit uncertainties of at least an order of magnitude.
    Several studies attempted to reduce uncertainties and to derive air concentrations
    from passive samplings by determining sampling rates with an active sampler. However,
    in all studies a large variety in passive sampling rates is observed depending
    on location, season, and meteorological conditions, leading to very diverse sampling
    rates for the same compounds, and thus, requiring at least regular re-calibrations
    by active samplers [14, 44]. Besides these known difficulties, we emphasize that
    in contrast to POPs, which are widely monitored by passive samplers [39,40,41],
    pesticides are designed to degrade in the environment with half-lives in the range
    of several days to months, thus, adding an additional layer of complexity to the
    aforementioned difficulties in deriving air concentrations. Due to the large variety
    of passive sampler setups and the difficulties in deriving air concentrations,
    there remains a great uncertainty in the evaluation of the corresponding reports
    and data sets. This uncertainty could be reduced, at least in part, by standardization
    efforts, as has already been done in the past, e.g., for compounds such as ammonia
    or polyaromatic hydrocarbons and the corresponding European standards EN 17346
    and EN 15980 [45, 46]. This is particularly necessary if passive samplers continue
    to be increasingly used to determine pesticide residues in air, in order to reach
    a fundamental agreement in the scientific and regulatory community on how to interpret
    these monitoring data. Importantly, any standardization of passive sampling should
    not only focus on the technical aspects but needs to include guidance on how to
    report the uncertainties related to the sampling method as well as to the data
    analysis and interpretation. Only through such transparent reporting on uncertainty
    will the benefits of passive samplers be maintained, e.g., for trend analysis
    of pesticide residues in air. Although beyond the scope here, similar efforts
    would be helpful for deposition estimates via biomonitoring approaches using plant
    material, e.g., moss, curly kale, etc., as passive deposition samplers. In the
    future, besides the common active and passive sampling setups, online techniques
    could play an increasingly important role for monitoring of pesticides in ambient
    air (Fig. 2C). Such techniques mostly rely on mass spectrometric apparatus and
    have been used extensively in air quality and atmospheric research during the
    last decade. Examples include techniques such as proton transfer reaction mass
    spectrometry (PTR-MS) [47], aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) [48], and different
    combinations of thermal desorption/soft ionization mass spectrometry (e.g., EESI-MS,
    AeroFAPA-MS, online-APCI-MS, CIMS) [49,50,51,52,53]. These techniques typically
    offer near real-time measurements of single organic compounds in the gas and/or
    particle phase, and thus, are capable of accurately observing peak concentrations,
    which are otherwise diluted by sampling times of several hours or even days when
    using active samplers. Unfortunately, the high time resolution and data accuracy
    comes with higher technical complexity, costs, and limited availability of standards
    and personnel with the required technical knowledge. But there are also currently
    developments in the utilization of the ever-increasing amounts of data from atmospheric
    mass spectrometric online measurements that aim to achieve a better and more comprehensive
    recording of atmospherically relevant compounds through standardization and collective
    archiving (also referred to as data-driven mass spectrometry and aerosolomics)
    [54, 55]. Nevertheless, such online techniques will likely remain an exception
    for targeted measurement campaigns until these hurdles are lowered, despite their
    advantageous combination of high time resolution and high data accuracy. For established
    methods, ongoing developments regarding the choice of sampling equipment might
    extend analytical capabilities and the range of analytes, e.g., the use of PUF-XAD2-PUF
    sandwich sorbents. Using best practices from atmospheric research to measure pesticides
    in air: proposed path forward As the number of studies on pesticide residues in
    ambient air is increasing globally (cf. Figure 1), it is essential to ensure intercomparability
    of the obtained data. Therefore, guidance and standards are required to evaluate
    previous studies and to perform measurements that meet basic quality requirements
    and provide the intended information. In the following, based on best practices,
    routines and methods from air quality and atmospheric research, we propose the
    basis for future focus in research and corresponding policies. Moreover, we provide
    a generic template to initiate and plan future monitoring programs for pesticides
    in air. (1) Standardization and harmonization of methods In air quality and atmospheric
    research, active samplers with PM10 and PM2.5 inlets are widely used as these
    particle size fractions are inhalable and respirable, and thus pose the largest
    risk to human health. Therefore, several national and international technical
    standards are nowadays in place for such sampling setups in air quality studies
    (e.g., EN 12341, EN 15980) [46, 56], ensuring standardization, comparability,
    and a certain data quality. Although none of these standards explicitly focuses
    on pesticides in air, they offer a solid basis for further standardization of
    monitoring studies on pesticides in air, relying on well-characterized and widely
    applied methods. The above-mentioned French AFNOR XP X 43–058 standard is largely
    based on these air quality procedures [31], thus, offering a well-suited starting
    point for other national and international standardization approaches. However,
    it is essential for such efforts to distinguish clearly between the determination
    of exposure levels towards pesticides in PM2.5 / PM10 and the measurement of total
    concentrations of pesticides in air (i.e., TSP, spray drift, wind erosion, etc.).
    Especially for agricultural areas, wind eroded soil particles are typically larger
    than PM2.5, [57, 58] thus, indicating to collect PM10 samples if exposure towards
    pesticides adsorbed on airborne soil particles is to be measured. Moreover, a
    detailed risk assessment of pesticides in air can only be conducted when data
    on gas-particle-distributions are obtained, and effects on sampling efficiencies
    from windspeed and direction [35] are accounted for. Besides active sampling approaches,
    standardization is also essential for passive sampling approaches. So far, the
    assessment and interpretation of passive sampling datasets is drastically hampered
    by the large variety in sampling setups. This is especially frustrating as passive
    sampling is significantly more cost- and resource-efficient and can easily be
    carried out simultaneously at many locations, thus, bearing the potential for
    wide-spread use in air monitoring programs on pesticides. Standardization could,
    therefore, play a crucial role for the setup and allocation of resources for future
    monitoring studies. Examples for standardization of passive sampling methods are
    compounds such as ammonia or polyaromatic hydrocarbons and the corresponding European
    standards EN 17346 and EN 15980 [45, 46]. These already existing standards could
    be used as a basis to determine recommended sampling setups, chemical analysis,
    calculation of uncertainties, and data interpretation. Regardless of the applied
    sampling setup, standardization and harmonization efforts should not only focus
    on technical aspects and sample handling, but also include a dedicated plan for
    data treatment procedures. This is particularly of importance to ensure comparability
    between datasets from different studies. (2) Tiered approach for monitoring programs
    Large-scale air monitoring programs that attempt to follow high technical standards
    and apply active sampling strategies to assess the exposure of residents and bystanders
    (e.g., the CNEP program) are commonly extensive, lengthy, and expensive. Although
    the acquired data are of high quality and can establish a solid database for the
    determination of environmental fate and exposure risks, such approaches are very
    resource-intensive, and thus, can rarely be maintained for longer periods of time.
    Therefore, we propose to follow a tiered approach when there is a general interest
    in exposure for pesticides in air. This approach allows the generation of extensive
    large-scale data with less resources and the identification of increased exposure
    risks to residents and bystanders. As shown in Fig. 3, in a first step, a monitoring
    program on pesticides in air using passive samplers is set up for compounds of
    interest. To reduce logistic efforts, samplers can be added to existing sampling
    sites, e.g., for ground and surface water or air quality, and similar analytic
    approaches can be followed. An initial active sampling period in parallel to the
    passive samplers can aid in characterizing site- and compound-specific sampling
    efficiencies, and moreover, to determine whether compounds of interest are generally
    detectable with the applied setup. At this first tier, the acquired data cannot
    be used to determine air concentrations or undertake risk assessments. However,
    it is possible to detect multi-year trends, to observe unexpected transport mechanisms,
    and to identify sites that need a more detailed exposure risk assessment [18].
    In the past similar approaches have also been used to determine representative
    measurement sites for active samplings [59]. Nonetheless, it is essential to operate
    the samplers over several years and at several sites because data from single
    sampling sites or timepoints need to be evaluated in context [18, 60,61,62]. Furthermore,
    prior to the start of any measurements, the methods to be applied as well as sampling
    periods and frequencies should be well conceived and compatible with the monitoring
    objectives, as a subsequent change of parameters means a break in the time series
    making direct comparisons of past measurements impossible. Therefore, passive
    sampling should also be continued if Tier 2 and 3 samplings are necessary, in
    order to continue the time series. As commonly the number of substances to be
    monitored needs to be constrained because of limited analytical capacities, we
    propose to follow the prioritization approach of Hulin et al. [63] which preceded
    the French CNEP campaign. In a theoretical first step, the authors constructed
    a hierarchy of substances according to (1) national uses, (2) emission potential
    to air, (3) persistence in air, and (4) chronic toxicity. Secondly, substances
    were selected based on existing monitoring data. Afterwards, based on the theoretical
    and the observational data, substances were identified and prioritized for further
    monitoring. If the proposed first-tier monitoring program indicates an elevated
    exposure risk, we suggest a second-tier approach for more detailed investigations
    at the respective sites to confirm identified trends and elevated air concentrations.
    For this second tier, active sampling methods are mandatory to obtain quantitative
    data on air concentrations. Ideally, basic meteorological data are recorded simultaneously
    and physicochemical data of the substances of interest are considered when selecting
    appropriate sampling methods. Eventually, source regions of the substance of interest
    can be estimated or even specifically identified through a source apportionment
    approach via an integrative data analysis [55, 64,65,66]. In case the substance
    of interest exhibits elevated air concentrations and a certain exposure risk for
    residents or other reasons for further investigation were identified in the second-tier
    monitoring, a continuous, extensive monitoring program can be established at multiple
    sites. In addition, the toxicological profile of the substance should be evaluated
    in more detail, and if necessary, inhalation studies should be initiated. We suggest
    inferring the selection of sites from a combination of climatic conditions and
    application intensities, as recently suggested by Kubiak et al. [28] Moreover,
    a detailed investigation of sources and possible mitigation measures should be
    included at this stage. It should also be noted that air concentrations determined
    from second or third tier monitoring approaches will commonly need to be evaluated
    during the re-registration of a substance. Thus, such monitoring data from active
    samplings are linked to the registration status of a substance. In contrast to
    several existing monitoring programs and initiatives, an important feature of
    the proposed tiered approach is that it allows the identification of exposure
    risks while avoiding a technically complex national monitoring program with the
    concomitant large resource requirement. Thus, we emphasize that if a second-tier
    monitoring study did not suggest elevated risks, it is strongly advised to step
    back to tier one, i.e., monitoring by a well-characterized passive sampling approach
    that monitors trends for the selected site. By following this approach, costs
    are reduced, and resources are focused on substances and locations where high-quality
    monitoring is required. The same applies for tier three studies if no elevated
    air concentrations can be detected anymore (cf. Figure 3). Moreover, while regulatory
    processes and corresponding monitoring programs are mostly focused on national
    levels, we stress that for atmospheric transport such boundaries do not exist.
    Thus, it is essential to keep in mind the trans-national nature of transport and
    exposure via air when setting up such studies but also when analyzing and interpreting
    the acquired data. (3) Data interpretation and transparency Whether studies are
    conducted according to the proposed approach or in some other way, both the gathered
    data as well as their analysis should be made publicly available, following the
    open access and FAIR principles [67]. As a minimum for the reporting of acquired
    data, the following parameters need to be accessible: sampling site, methods,
    sampling periods and frequencies. Ideally, also details are given on sampling
    materials, inlet heights, manufacturers, storage conditions, and analytical characteristics
    such as limits of detection and recoveries. Also, study goals should be clear
    and available before the start of the measurements. Similarly, for the data analysis
    and interpretation, it should be made clear and transparent which calculations
    and conversions have led to the final results—and, importantly, what uncertainty
    is connected to these results. Ideally, data analysis is following standardized
    practices regarding, e.g., the treatment of measurement values below or close
    to the detection limit. Only then comparison of data from different studies and
    monitoring programs is readily feasible. Fig. 3 Dynamic tiered concept for future
    monitoring efforts. Level of complexity and level of confidence increase stepwise
    with confirmed exposure risks (red arrows) towards pesticide residues in air,
    whereas contradictory data (grey arrows) prompt a return to the previous tier
    Full size image In conclusion, we note that the measurement of pesticide residues
    in air is only one component for a comprehensive understanding and assessment
    of atmospheric transport potential, as well as for corresponding implications
    for environmental processes, air quality, and human health. For example, data
    on emission and deposition behavior of a substance are rarely available, but essential
    for reliable model predictions. Nonetheless, to assess potential exposure risks
    and the fate of pesticides in the atmosphere, we see that particularly the harmonization
    of technical standards and procedures is desperately needed. The development and
    establishment of such standards is key for any further regulatory advancements,
    such as discussions on the implementation of mitigation measures and acceptable
    air concentration levels. Moreover, it is essential that the air quality and atmospheric
    research community is included in such developments, as a large expertise on appropriate
    sampling procedures, analytical methods and data interpretation is readily available.

  description: Soil roadbed along the river suffers from water erosion at the bottom
    and collapse at the top under flood scouring, which leads to the suspension of
    upper pavement slab. In order to ensure the safety of soil roadbed along the river,
    this study explored the development mechanism of soil roadbed damage by flood
    in actual cases, and proposed the evolution process of instability under roadbed
    scouring. The stability law of roadbed along the river under flood scouring was
    analyzed, and the stability safety factor was corrected to analyze the sensitivity
    of water depth, flow rate, river bending angle and stability safety factor K in
    working conditions. The sensitivity of width and height of soil roadbed after
    flood scouring to water depth, flow velocity, river bending angle was investigated.
    Moreover, numerical simulation was carried out to determine the displacement nephogram
    and maximum shear stress nephogram of soil roadbed along the river under the conditions
    of road surface and roadbed load, vehicle loading or constant change of water
    depth. By comparing the above theories and engineering cases, the water damage
    mechanism of soil roadbed along the river was further verified.

    topography restricts the planning and design of mountain roads. Take central and
    western China for example, research data and field survey results show that there
    are a large number of roads along the river in the western mountainous areas.
    With the promotion of the West China Development strategy, there have been huge
    demands for new roads along the river. Roads along the river in mountainous areas
    are mostly semi-filled and semi-dug roadbed, which is vulnerable to long-term
    scouring by rivers and direct impact by floods or mudslides, resulting in disasters
    such as roadbed damage, pavement suspension or fracture. This seriously affects
    the traffic operation of roads in mountainous areas and poses great security risks
    to local economy and people''s lives and property. At present, the flood damage
    of highway along the river has not been cured, instead, it has become more and
    more frequent. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the evolution law
    of water erosion damage of roadbed along the river and implement immediate protection.
    Among the studies of roadbed instability due to river water erosion, Chen1 solved
    the formula of critical water erosion groove radius of roadbed gap according to
    the limit equilibrium theory to determine the gap formation mechanism. Zhao et
    al.2 carried out numerical simulation analysis to simulate the change of roadbed
    along river under flood scouring. According to Liang Dan et al.3, the erosion
    and waterout mechanism of roadbed along the river is essentially the interaction
    process between the erosion resistance of roadbed rock and soil and the impact
    force of roadbed near the wall. Kawajiri et al.4 explored the ground erosion and
    roadbed changes supporting piers by carrying out large-scale open channel model
    tests. Kurdistani et al.5 studied the effects of structural geometry, riverbed
    material and river hydraulic conditions on the downstream scour pattern of stepped
    weir. Campbell et al.6 investigated the integrated geophysical technology for
    underwater detection of bridge foundation related scour and erodible scour filler.
    Daneshfaraz et al.7 conducted numerical simulation of river scouring pile groups.
    Choudhary et al.8 developed ANFIS- and GEP-based model for prediction of scour
    depth around bridge pier. Based on the above analysis, it can be seen that the
    studies of erosion of roadbed along the river in many countries focus on soil
    slope erosion test (Khan et al.9, Guan et al.10), numerical simulation (Nguyen
    et al.11) and result analysis (Sharafati et al.12). Through the evolution of water
    erosion groove formed by flood scouring roadbed toe, this study analyzed the concrete
    mechanical instability evolution process of roadbed scouring in operation stage,
    and explored the sensitivity law of roadbed stability safety factor and related
    factors. It is an urgent problem to be solved for the concrete evolution process
    of instability of soil roadbed scouring along the river under the continuous action
    of flood, gravity and vehicle load and the suspension of the upper pavement slab.
    Scouring characteristics of roadbed along the river The studies of scouring mechanism
    of soil roadbed along the river focus on the following four aspects: the evolution
    mechanism of soil roadbed scouring instability, the main controlling factors of
    soil roadbed scouring, the easily damaged sections of soil roadbed scouring and
    the disaster time. First, the scouring process of soil roadbed along the river
    begins with sediment incipient motion. It is considered that the sediment particles
    or slope soil particles at the slope toe are washed away by river after sediment
    incipient motion. The porosity of the slope soil increases, the soil roadbed infiltrates,
    and the slope strength index decreases, which result in the instability and collapse
    of soil roadbed slope, the scouring damage of soil roadbed and the suspension
    or collapse of pavement slab. Second, there are three main factors influencing
    soil roadbed scouring along the river: soil roadbed conditions, water flow conditions
    and watershed boundary conditions. Third, the most unfavorable scouring position
    of soil roadbed along the river is at the concave bank of river bend. Fourth,
    the damage of soil roadbed along the river mainly occurs at the flood scouring
    stage at the soil roadbed side. As shown in Fig. 1a, flood scouring leads to the
    lack of soil roadbed at the concave bank and obvious suspension of pavement slab.
    Figure 1b is a plan view of roadbed washout at the concave bank, in which Sect.
    1–1 shows four stages of soil roadbed lack under flood scouring, as shown in Fig.
    2. Figure 1 Erosion of roadbed along the river. (a) Water damaged roadbed along
    the line, (b) River plan. Full size image Figure 2 Evolution process of suspended
    pavement slab. (a) Slope toe of roadbed along the river eroded by concave bank,
    (b) Water erosion groove of roadbed along the river, (c) Roadbed soil slides along
    the dangerous sliding surface, (d) Suspension of pavement slab caused by the sliding
    instability of roadbed soil. Full size image (1) Flood scouring stage: In flood
    season, the velocity and discharge of water flow increase rapidly, and there are
    a large amount of sediment and gravel in flood, which repeatedly washes away the
    soil roadbed slope toe. After the scouring action of the main flood circulation
    123 reaches the critical state of sediment incipient motion, the soil at the soil
    roadbed slope toe will be eroded by scouring water, as shown in Fig. 2a. (2) Formation
    and expansion stage of water erosion groove: Under normal river conditions, the
    strength of soil roadbed will gradually decrease after long-term immersion of
    the soil roadbed slope toe, and there will be potentially dangerous sliding surfaces
    in soil roadbed soil. Assuming that the rising flood in the flood season constantly
    washes away the toe of the water-eroded soil roadbed, the initial arc-shaped water-eroded
    groove a-b-c is locally derived from the soil roadbed. Four potential sliding
    surfaces I, II, III and IV are developed inside the roadbed, as shown in Fig.
    2b. (3) Soil roadbed sliding instability stage: After the soil roadbed is eroded
    by flood, the soil at the top of the water erosion groove will expand from a-b-c
    to def with the rise of flood level under the action of water flow and gravity.
    In the meanwhile, the upper soil will slide along the sliding surface I. Water
    erosion groove expands to h-i-g under continous flood scouring, and the upper
    soil slides along the sliding surface II, as shown in Fig. 2c. (4) Suspension
    and instability stage of pavement slab: the water erosion groove continuously
    expands to the vicinity of the limit state k-m–n. With the increase of the suspension
    ratio, when the pavement slab reaches the critical state of fracture and failure,
    fracture and failure will occur, as shown in Fig. 2d. Washout development mechanism
    of roadbed along the river Stress analysis of soil erosion at the roadbed slope
    toe Soil roadbed along the river is often washed by the river, and the sliding
    force on the slope surface caused by river impact and gravity at the soil roadbed
    slope toe is related to soil roadbed slope. The stress at the soil roadbed slope
    toe in Fig. 1a is analyzed, as shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3 Schematic diagram of
    stress analysis of sediment particles on roadbed slope. (a) Schematic diagram
    of the top surface of slope toe, (b) Schematic diagram of stress on the top surface
    of slope toe, (c) Schematic diagram of the bottom surface of slope toe, (d) Schematic
    diagram of stress on the bottom surface of slope toe. Full size image Load analysis
    of soil at the top of roadbed slope toe Assume that the inclination angle of roadbed
    slope is β,the included angle between water flow and the horizontal axis of roadbed
    slope is δ, the impact drag force is FD′, the lifting force is FL, the weight
    of soil is G′, the vehicle load is pi, the weight of pavement slab is qi, and
    the viscous force of sediment is Ck, as shown in Fig. 3a,b. The resultant force
    acting on the slope surface together is as below: $$ F = \\sqrt {\\left[ {F_{D}{^{\\prime
    }} \\sin \\delta + \\left( {G{^{\\prime}} + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)\\sin \\beta
    } \\right]^{2} + F_{D}{^{\\prime 2}} \\cos^{2} \\delta } $$ (1) The corresponding
    anti-sliding force is: $$ F_{R} = C_{k} + \\left[ {\\left( {G^{\\prime} + p_{i}
    + q_{i} } \\right)\\cos \\beta - F_{L} } \\right]\\tan \\beta $$ (2) The starting
    conditions of sediment at the roadbed slope toe are as follows $$ \\sqrt {\\left[
    {F_{D}{^{\\prime }} \\sin \\delta + \\left( {G^{\\prime} + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)\\sin
    \\beta } \\right]^{2} + F_{D}{^{\\prime 2}} \\cos^{2} \\delta } \\ge C_{k} + \\left[
    {\\left( {G^{\\prime} + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)\\cos \\beta - F_{L} } \\right]\\tan
    \\beta $$ (3) According to the above formula, the impact drag force of roadbed
    slope toe is as below: $$ F^{\\prime}_{D} = - \\left( {G^{\\prime} + p_{i} + q_{i}
    } \\right)\\sin \\delta \\sin \\beta + \\sqrt {\\left[ {C_{k} + \\left( {\\left(
    {G^{\\prime} + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)\\cos \\beta - F_{L} } \\right)\\tan \\beta
    } \\right]^{2} - \\left( {G^{\\prime} + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)^{2} \\sin \\beta
    \\cos^{2} \\delta } $$ (4) Analysis of soil load on the bottom surface of roadbed
    slope toe For the bottom surface of soil roadbed slope toe, as shown in Fig. 3c,d,
    the corresponding sliding resistance is as follows: $$ F_{R} = C_{k} + \\left(
    {G^{\\prime} + p_{i} + q_{i} - F_{L} } \\right)\\tan \\beta $$ (5) The impact
    drag force of soil roadbed slope plane is FD, and the condition of sediment incipient
    motion is: $$ F_{D} \\ge F_{R} = C_{k} + \\left( {G^{\\prime} + p_{i} + q_{i}
    - F_{L} } \\right)\\tan \\beta $$ (6) Set τc as the incipience drag force of soil
    roadbed toe bottom surface and τc′ as the incipience drag force of roadbed toe
    top surface. $$ \\frac{{\\tau^{\\prime}_{c} }}{{\\tau_{c} }} = \\frac{{F^{\\prime}_{D}
    }}{{F_{D} }} $$ (7) Substitute formulas (4)–(6) into formula (7) $$ \\begin{gathered}
    \\frac{{\\tau^{\\prime}_{c} }}{{\\tau_{c} }} = \\sqrt {\\left[ {1 - \\left( {1
    - \\frac{{C_{k} }}{{F_{D} }} + \\frac{{F_{L} }}{{F_{D} }}\\tan \\beta } \\right)\\left(
    {1 - \\cos \\beta } \\right)} \\right]^{2} - \\left[ {1 - \\frac{{C_{k} }}{{F_{D}
    }} + \\frac{{F_{L} }}{{F_{D} }}\\tan \\beta } \\right]^{2} \\cos^{2} \\beta \\cos^{2}
    \\delta } \\\\ - \\left[ {\\left( {1 - \\frac{{C_{K} }}{{F_{D} }}} \\right)\\cos
    \\beta \\sin \\delta + \\frac{{F_{L} }}{{F_{D} }}\\sin \\beta \\sin \\delta }
    \\right] \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (8) When δ = 0, that is, the water flow is orthogonal
    to the inclined direction of soil roadbed slope toe, the sediment incipience conditions
    of soil roadbed slope along the river are as follows: $$ \\frac{{\\tau^{\\prime}_{c}
    }}{{\\tau_{c} }} = \\sqrt {\\left[ {1 - \\left( {1 - \\frac{{C_{k} }}{{F_{D} }}
    + \\frac{{F_{L} }}{{F_{D} }}\\tan \\beta } \\right)\\left( {1 - \\cos \\beta }
    \\right)} \\right]^{2} - \\left[ {1 - \\frac{{C_{k} }}{{F_{D} }} + \\frac{{F_{L}
    }}{{F_{D} }}\\tan \\beta } \\right]^{2} \\cos^{2} \\beta } $$ (9) \\(F_{L} = 0\\),
    and the lifting force is ignored: $$ \\frac{{\\tau^{\\prime}_{c} }}{{\\tau_{c}
    }} = \\sqrt {\\left[ {1 - \\left( {1 - \\frac{{C_{k} }}{{F_{D} }}} \\right)\\left(
    {1 - \\cos \\beta } \\right)} \\right]^{2} - \\left[ {1 - \\frac{{C_{k} }}{{F_{D}
    }}} \\right]^{2} \\cos^{2} \\beta } $$ (10) According to Formulas (6)–(10), under
    the same water flow, the shear force required for sediment incipience on the soil
    roadbed slope is less than that on the bottom surface and sediment incipience
    is more likely to occur on the top surface of the slope toe. Therefore, the river
    water erosion drives the top surface of the soil roadbed slope toe earlier and
    easier compared with the bottom surface. Stress analysis of soil falling on the
    upper part of roadbed water erosion groove After the water erosion groove at the
    bottom of soil roadbed soil is missing, the stress on the upper soil changes,
    and the soil gradually falls. In videos of flood scouring the soil roadbed along
    the river, the soil on the upper part of the soil roadbed is irregular (the dotted
    lines in Fig. 2b–d), falls vertically to the bottom and is washed away by the
    flood, and the rest is deposited. Figure 4a,b analyze the stress. Assume that
    the horizontal dip angle of the upper soil roadbed soil is α′, the weight of the
    soil is Gi′, the vehicle load is pi, the weight of the pavement slab is qi, the
    shear resistance of the soil is Ne, the vertical dip angle is φ, the width of
    the upper part is Be, and the height is He: Figure 4 Schematic diagram of stress
    analysis of soil at the top of roadbed. (a) Stress analysis of outer soil falling
    at the top of roadbed, (b) Stress analysis of inner soil falling at the top of
    roadbed. Full size image Stress analysis is carried out for the outer and inner
    soil at the top of roadbed: $$ F = G_{i}^{\\prime } + p_{i} + q_{i} + \\left(
    {D - N_{e} } \\right)\\sin \\alpha $$ (11) The main reason for the falling of
    flaky soil at the top of roadbed is that the bottom part of is eroded by water,
    softened, slumped and washed away, which will lose its supporting function to
    the upper flaky soil. When the water erosion and scouring depth of the bottom
    water erosion groove reaches a certain size before the upper soil falls every
    time, the upper flaky soil will fall after overcoming the shear resistance between
    soil particles under the action of gravity. In this process, the depth dimension
    of the bottom water erosion groove is equivalent to the width Be′ dimension of
    the upper flaky soil. In addition, due to the environmental factors such as geography,
    topography, rainfall and seepage, seepage force will be formed, thus affecting
    the upper soil. Therefore, the flake size of the falling flaky soil is related
    to the density, material properties, water erosion depth, scouring depth, flake
    height of the soil and the hanging width, and most of the falling parts are flake
    structures. To sum up, from the stress analysis in Sects. 3.1 and 3.2, it can
    be found that the falling position of the roadbed soil along the river caused
    by water erosion is mainly determined by the water erosion groove of the bottom
    soil. Therefore, the change of the water erosion groove angle of the soil roadbed
    will affect not only the integrity and missing direction of the whole soil roadbed,
    but also the proportion and position of the upper pavement slab suspension. Stability
    analysis of roadbed washout along the river Overall stability analysis of roadbed
    with water erosion groove under the gravity of vehicle and pavement slab Based
    on field investigation and relevant literature review, it can be found that the
    mechanism of water-damaged settlement failure of soil roadbed along the river
    is similar to that of rainfall-induced landslide, and the sliding surface is usually
    arc-shaped. When the soil roadbed along the river is washed by flood, a water
    erosion groove is formed at the slope toe, and the upper soil still meets the
    principle of limit equilibrium in a stable state. Therefore, based on the circular
    sliding mechanism, this study used Bishop method to analyze the stability of soil
    roadbed washout along the river. Bishop13 assumed that: (1) The acting force of
    soil between strips is only normal force, and there is no tangential force; (2)
    The sliding soil conforms to the overall moment balance condition; (3) Each block
    conforms to the polygonal closing condition of force; (4) The anti-sliding safety
    factor of the bottom sliding surface of roadbed soil strip is the same, which
    is equal to the average safety factor of the whole roadbed sliding surface. The
    soil slope per unit length is calculated as a plane problem. Set the landslide
    surface of roadbed as arc AC, the center of the circle as O and the radius as
    R. The landslide ABC is divided into several soil strips, and the stress of which
    is analyzed, as shown in Fig. 5. The stress on the ith soil strip is as below:
    (1) Weight of soil strip, Gi = γbihi; Where, bi and hi are the width and average
    height of soil strip i; When there is a water erosion groove, Gi = γbrhr; Where,
    br and hr are the residue width and residue height of soil strip i. (2) Shear
    resistance Tfi, effective normal reaction Ni'' and pore water pressure uili acting
    on the bottom surface of soil strip i, where, ui and li are pore water pressure
    at the midpoint of the bottom surface of soil strip i and the length of sliding
    arc respectively; The Angle between the center line and the vertical of the soil

    Figure 5 Diagram of Bishop calculation of roadbed with water erosion groove under
    vehicle loading. Full size image For the vertical direction of soil strip i, according
    to the balance of force, the following formula can be obtained: $$ G_{i} + \\Delta
    X_{i} - T_{fi} \\sin \\alpha_{i} - N_{i}^{\\prime } \\cos \\alpha_{i} - u_{i}
    l_{i} \\cos \\alpha_{i} + p_{i} + q_{i} = 0 $$ (12) When the soil slope has not
    collapsed and remains stable, the shear strength Tfi on the sliding surface of
    soil strip i is expressed by effective stress, as below: $$ T_{fi} = \\frac{{\\tau_{fi}
    l_{i} }}{K} = \\frac{{{\\text{c}^{\\prime}}l_{i} }}{K} + N_{i}^{\\prime } \\frac{{\\tan
    \\varphi^{\\prime}}}{K} $$ (13) where, c′—Effective cohesion of soil, φ′—Effective
    internal friction angle of soil, K—Safety factor. Substitute (12), and Ni′ is
    $$ N_{i}^{\\prime } = \\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i} }} }}\\left( {G_{i} + \\Delta X_{i}
    - u_{i} b_{i} + p_{i} + q_{i} - \\frac{{{\\text{c}^{\\prime}}l_{i} }}{K}\\sin

    {1 + \\frac{{\\tan \\varphi^{\\prime} * \\tan \\alpha_{i} }}{k}} \\right) $$ (15)
    The moment balance analysis of the whole sliding soil body to the center O of
    the circle is carried out. Since the side wall action moments between adjacent
    soil strips cancel each other, and the action lines of Ni'' and uili of each soil
    strip i pass through the center O of the circle, the following formula can be
    obtained: $$ \\sum {\\left( {G_{i} + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)} x_{i} - \\sum {T_{fi}
    R = 0} $$ (16) Substitute formulas (14) and (16) into formula (13), and xi = Rsinα,
    b = bi = licosαi. According to Bishop method, the safety factor of roadbed stability
    under the action of pavement slab and vehicle is as below: $$ K = \\frac{{\\sum
    {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i} }} }}(c^{\\prime}b + \\left( {G_{i} + \\Delta X_{i} - u_{i}
    b + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)\\tan \\varphi^{\\prime})} }}{{\\sum {\\left( {G_{i}
    + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)} \\sin \\alpha_{i} }} $$ (17) ΔXi is estimated to determine
    K through the successive approximation method. The trial value of Xi and Ei should
    meet the equilibrium conditions of each soil strip. ∑ΔXi and ∑ΔEi of the whole
    sliding soil strip should be equal to zero. Bishop proved that the error is only
    1% when ΔXi = 0, and formula (17) can be simplified as follows: $$ K = \\frac{{\\sum
    {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i} }} }}\\left( {c^{\\prime}b + \\left( {G_{i} - u_{i} b +
    p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)\\tan \\varphi^{\\prime}} \\right)} }}{{\\sum {\\left(
    {G_{i} + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)} \\sin \\alpha_{i} }} $$ (18) Stability analysis
    of roadbed under flood scouring Stability analysis of roadbed under straight flood
    scouring Considering that the scouring force is parallel to the longitudinal section
    of the roadbed when the flood scours straightly along the river, as shown in Fig.
    6, the moment to the center O of the circle is 0. Therefore, formula (18) can
    be used to calculate for calculating the stability safety factor of soil roadbed
    along the river in the straight section. Figure 6 Diagram of straight flood scouring
    roadbed along the river. Full size image Stability analysis of roadbed under flood
    bend When the flood bends scour the soil roadbed along the river, the water flow
    acts perpendicularly to the longitudinal section of the soil roadbed, as shown
    in Fig. 7. The flood scouring force is simplified as concentrated force F. When
    it acts on the center line of the flood level, the moment to the center O of the
    circle is \\(M = F\\left( {R - \\frac{{H_{2} }}{{2\\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta_{1}
    }}} \\right)\\cos \\beta_{1}\\). Where β is the toe of the slope and β1 is ∠OCB,
    as shown in Fig. 8. In this study, in order to calculate the most dangerous state,
    let F act on the most dangerous position, that is, the toe of soil roadbed slope,
    and the moment of the center O of the circle can be simplified as M = FR. Figure

    to the momentum theorem Ft = 2mv⊥, where v⊥ is the velocity of water flow perpendicular
    to the river bank in the concave part of the river, v⊥ = vcos(θ/2), where v is
    the river flow velocity, θ is the angle of the river bend, m = ρv = ρQt, and Q
    is the flow of the river bend, F = 2ρQv⊥ is obtained, which is substituted into
    (18), and the stability safety factor at the bend along the concave part of the
    river road is obtained as follows: $$ K = \\frac{{\\sum {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i}
    }} }}(c^{\\prime}b + \\left( {G_{i} - u_{i} b + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)\\tan
    \\varphi^{\\prime}) + 2\\rho Qv_{ \\bot } R} }}{{\\sum {\\left( {G_{i} + p_{i}
    + q_{i} } \\right)} \\sin \\alpha_{i} }} $$ (19) When the soil slope is partially
    flooded. The hydrostatic pressure P1 acting on the sliding surface below the water
    level line, the water pressure P2 on the slope surface, the gravity of pore water
    and the reaction force Gw of soil particle buoyancy are balanced in the hydrostatic
    state. The action line of P1 passes through the center O of the circle. According
    to the moment balance, the moment of P2 to the center O of the circle and the
    moment of Gw to the center O of the circle cancel each other, as shown in Fig.
    8. Therefore, under the condition of hydrostatic state, the influence of water
    pressure on roadbed surface on the sliding soil can be calculated according to
    the buoyancy of the sliding soil below the still water surface, that is, the weight
    of the underwater soil strip is calculated according to the effective weight.
    The calculation formula of the stability safety factor is the same as formula
    (19). When it rains continuously, the mountain surface water flows downwards and
    seeps into the river through the roadbed. The water level in the slope is higher
    than that outside the slope, and the water in the slope generates seepage force
    outward, pointing to the slope surface, as shown in Fig. 8. Assuming that the
    saturation line is e–f–g, the area of the part (f–g–c) of the sliding soil under
    the saturation line is Aw, and the total seepage force D on the soil is as below:
    $$ D = JA_{w} = \\gamma_{w} iA_{w} $$ (20) where, J—Seepage force on unit volume
    of soil (KN/m3); i—The average value of hydraulic gradient in the area Aw under
    the saturation line, i is assumed to be equal to the gradient of the connection
    line of the saturation line f-g. γw—Saturated water severity. The action line
    of the seepage resultant force D is located at the centroid of area f-g-c, assuming
    that the action direction is parallel to f-g, and the arm of force of D to the
    center O of the circle is recorded as r. Therefore, considering the seepage force,
    formula (19) is substituted and the formula for analyzing the stability safety
    factor of roadbed along the river by Bishop method is as follows: $$ K = \\frac{{\\sum
    {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i} }} }}(c^{\\prime}b + \\left( {G_{i} - u_{i} b + p_{i} +
    q_{i} } \\right)\\tan \\varphi^{\\prime}) + 2\\rho Qv_{ \\bot } R} }}{{\\sum {\\left(
    {G_{i} + p_{i} + q_{i} } \\right)} \\sin \\alpha_{i} + \\frac{r}{R}D}} $$ (21)
    Homogeneous, laminar and stable gradual flow are assumed according to the hydraulics15,16,17,
    as shown in Fig. 9. Figure 9 Seepage calculation of impervious roadbed soil. Full
    size image The upper water level is H1, which can be approximated as the height
    H of roadbed along the river in this study. The height of lower water level is
    the height H2 of river water level, and the horizontal projection length of roadbed
    bottom is L. According to Darcy''s law, the average velocity of roadbed across
    the river is as below: $$ \\overline{v} = - k\\frac{dz}{{dx}} $$ (22) The seepage
    flow is qs: $$ q_{s} = \\overline{v}z = - kz\\frac{dz}{{dx}} $$ (23) The variables
    are separated from the above formula, and the upstream surface (\\(x = 0,{\\text{z}}
    = H_{1}\\)) H is integrated to the downstream surface (\\(x = L,z = H_{2}\\)):
    $$ H_{1}^{2} - H_{2}^{2} = \\frac{{2q_{s} }}{k}L $$ (24) $$ q_{s} = \\frac{{k\\left(
    {H_{1}^{2} - H_{2}^{2} } \\right)}}{2L} $$ (25) If the integral limit is changed
    to x = 0 ~ x, z = H1 ~ z, formula (25) becomes the equation of the saturation
    line. $$ q_{s} = \\frac{{k\\left( {H_{1}^{2} - z^{2} } \\right)}}{2x} $$ (26)
    From formula (26), $$ z = \\sqrt {H_{1}^{2} - \\frac{{2q_{s} }}{k}x} $$ (27) Substitute
    (25) into (27) $$ z = \\sqrt {H_{1}^{2} - \\frac{{H_{1}^{2} - H_{2}^{2} }}{Lk}x}
    $$ (28) According to the saturation line formula (28), Aw can be obtained. $$
    \\begin{aligned} A_{w} & = \\int_{0}^{L} {\\sqrt {H_{1}^{2} - \\frac{{H_{1}^{2}

    (29) Equations (28) and (29) are substituted into (21), the following formula
    can be obtained: $$ K = \\frac{{\\sum {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i} }} }}(c^{\\prime}b

    by river In order to calculate the stability safety factor of the residue roadbed
    soil of the highway along the river in water erosion, the self-weight of soil
    strips is recorded as Gir = γbirhir, where, bir and hir are the width and height
    of soil strip i of the residue roadbed soil after river water erosion, respectively,
    and they are substituted into Formula (30). $$ K = \\frac{{\\sum {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i}

    in Fig. 10, the roadbed along the river is partially scoured by flood. Based on
    the scour depth calculation formula of smooth revetment in Code for River Regulation
    Design (GB50707-2011)14, the scour depth is as below: $$ b_{s} = H_{2} *\\left[
    {\\left( {\\frac{{v_{ \\bot } }}{{u_{c} }}} \\right)^{n} - 1} \\right] $$ (32)
    where, bs-Local scour depth from roadbed bottom (m); H2-Water depth at scouring
    position (m); v⊥-Average vertical velocity near the shore (m/s); uc-Sediment incipient
    velocity (m/s). Figure 10 Schematic diagram of flood water erosion parameters.
    Full size image According to the stable sliding surface obtained by the Bishop
    method, combined with formula (32), the residue stable roadbed width is obtained
    as follows: $$ b_{r} = b - b_{s} = b - H_{2} *\\left[ {\\left( {\\frac{{v_{ \\bot
    } }}{{u_{c} }}} \\right)^{n} - 1} \\right] $$ (33) Based on formula (33), the
    calculation formula of hr corresponding to the critical soil strip for br is as
    follows: $$ h_{r} = \\frac{{\\sum {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i} }} }}\\left( {c^{\\prime}b_{ir}

    - \\sum {\\frac{{\\gamma b_{ir} \\tan \\varphi^{\\prime}}}{{m_{{a_{i} }} }}} }}
    $$ (34) According to the vertical distance hd between the roadbed drawn by the
    Bishop method and the vertex of the center line of unstable soil strip i, it is
    concluded that the height of the residual stable roadbed soil after river scouring
    and water erosion is Hr. $$ \\begin{gathered} H_{r} = h_{d} + h_{r} \\\\ = h_{d}
    + \\frac{{\\sum {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i} }} }}(c^{\\prime}b_{ir} + \\left( {p_{i}

    (35) The height of the roadbed bottom eroded by river water is as follows: $$
    \\begin{gathered} h_{s} = H - H_{r} \\\\ = H - h_{d} - \\frac{{\\sum {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i}

    operation and protect the stability of pavement slab and roadbed, the limit value
    of passing vehicles should be obtained18. Therefore, according to formula (36),
    the vehicle load Pl is as below: $$ P_{l} = \\frac{{\\sum {\\frac{1}{{m_{{a_{i}

    analysis The bend near K4 + 210 third-class highway in Shizhu County, Chongqing
    is taken as an example. This section is a semi-filled and semi-dug soil roadbed,
    with soil roadbed height H = 5 m and pavement width b = 4.0 m. The section along
    the river is a homogeneous soil-rock mixture slope. For the semi-filled and semi-dug
    roadbed, the medium-dense pebble soil, gravel soil, rounded gravel soil and breccia
    soil are used for filling, and the particle size of sand is less than 150 mm.
    The slope is a Class IV strong wind fossil slope, which is affected by groundwater19,20.
    The filling slope is 1:1. According to the Bishop''s method, soil strips are divided
    into 15 strips, and the stability safety factor K of soil slope is calculated
    by Formulas (18–37). The changing height and width of scouring water erosion at
    the bottom of roadbed along the river and the load limit value of vehicles passing
    on the road are calculated and predicted. Physical and mechanical indexes of roadbed

    selected for the above working conditions. After the design and construction of
    roadbed is completed, although the design K value has been determined, the sensitivity
    analysis of the demand value of stability safety factor for the above common working
    conditions of roadbed along the river under flood and water erosion can be taken
    as a reference to guide the safety and protection of roadbed according to the
    following analysis conclusions: (1) When the flood level H2 changes from 1.6 m
    to 4.0 m, the demand value of stability safety factor K of soil roadbed increases
    with the increase of the water depth; (2) When the river bend angle θ changes
    from 90° to 180°, the demand value of stable safety factor K decreases with the
    increase of the river bend angle; 3) When the water depth and velocity are fixed,
    the required value of stability safety factor K decreases with the increase of
    the river bending angle. (4) When the water depth is fixed, the required value
    of stability safety factor K increases with the increase of river velocity, and
    the increase rate decreases with the increase of the river bending angle. Particularly,
    the required value of stability safety factor K is constant for straight river
    section. (5) When the flow rate is fixed and the river bend angle is the same,
    the demand value of stability safety factor K increases with the increase of the
    water depth; (6) When the flow rate is fixed and the bend angle of the river becomes
    larger, the required value of the stability safety factor K decreases with the
    increase of the water depth. (7) By comparing the required value K with the original
    design value, it can be judged whether the soil roadbed along the river exceeds
    the original design stable state under the corresponding working conditions. When
    the required value of K is smaller than the original design value, the soil roadbed
    along the river is safe under the corresponding working conditions. When the required
    value of K is close to the original design value, it is in a critical state, so
    it is suggested to take corresponding reinforcement measures; As the required
    value of K is larger than or equal to the original design value, the soil roadbed
    along the river is likely to be damaged, and corresponding preventive measures
    should be taken. Therefore, by comparing the required value of K with the original
    design value, it can be timely and accurately judged whether the soil roadbed
    along the river is in a safe state under the corresponding working conditions
    to take corresponding reinforcement and damage prevention measures, so that pre-judgment
    and decision-making for disaster prevention and mitigation can be realized in
    advance. Sensitivity analysis of water depth, velocity, river bending angle and
    soil roadbed along the river br and hr In the depth of the water, flow velocity,
    river bending angle and soil roadbed along the river br and hr of sensitivity
    analysis, working condition of parameter selection are as follows: The slope toe
    gradient of roadbed along the river is 45°, 1:1, smooth revetment, the flood depth
    is H2 = 1.6 m, 2.0 m, 2.4 m, 2.8 m, 3.6 m and 4.0 m; the water flow velocity is
    v = 1.8 m/s, 2.0 m/s, 2.2 m/s, 2.5 m/s, 2.8 m/s and 3.1 m/s, and the typical river
    bending angle is θ = 90°,105°,120°,135° (Biswas et al.15), as shown in Figs. 18,
    19, 20 and 21. Figure 18 Sensitivity analysis of different v, H2 and br of the

    analysis of different v, H2 and hr of the roadbed along the river when θ = 120°,
    135°. Full size image In this working condition, the common parameters of soil
    roadbed and river are selected. When the soil roadbed along the river at different
    river bending angles is scoured under different river flow rates, the width and
    height of residue roadbed soil change. Through the sensitivity analysis of flow
    rate, river bending angle and river water level on the width and height dimensions
    of residue soil roadbed along the river, the following conclusions can be drawn:
    (1) When θ ≤ 120°, the erosion damage of the slope and toe of soil roadbed along
    the river increases with the increase of water depth and velocity, and the corresponding
    values br and hr decrease. (2) When θ = 90°, the slope and toe of soil roadbed
    along the river suffer from the strongest scouring destructive power, the corresponding
    br and hr decrease the most rapidly, and their corresponding scouring change rate
    are also the largest. However, with the increase of bending angle, the change
    rate of the scouring decreases. (3) The river bending angle is the most obvious
    factor that affects the slope and toe of soil roadbed along the river. Particularly
    when the river bending angle is 90°, slope protection measures should be taken.
    (4) When the river bending angle is θ = 135°, it can be seen from the calculation
    results that v = 2.2 m/s is the scouring boundary value of soil roadbed slope
    and toe along the river. when v ≤ 2.2 m/s, br and hr increase slightly with the
    increase of water depth which may be due to the slow flow speed and the increase
    of water depth, resulting in sediment deposition on soil roadbed slope and toe.
    When v > 2.2 m/s, the change law is consistent with that when θ ≤ 120°. (5) To
    sum up, the suspended pavement of soil roadbed along the river is mostly located
    in the concave bank, and the river bending angle is 90° ~ 135°. Numerical simulation
    analysis of roadbed along the river under flood scouring The model was established
    by FLAC3D: The size of the pavement slab and the soil roadbed is 5 m × 4.0 m ×
    0.3 m and 5 m × 4.0 m × 3 m respectively, and the slope is 1:1, as shown in Fig.
    22. The material parameters of this model are listed in Table 2. The model adopts
    automatic grid division, with 131,327 units and 117,677 nodes. The scouring simulation
    of soil roadbed slope along the river was carried out in turn under the river
    water depth of 1.6 m, 2.0 m, 2.4 m, 2.8 m, 3.2 m, 3.6 m and 4.0 m, the water flow
    velocity of 2.2 m/s, and the river bend angle of 90°. The changing trend of displacement
    and stress of roadbed soil was verified when the road vehicle was driven by a
    single wheel with 100KN against the outside of roadbed slope and the pavement
    slab. Figure 22 Diagram of numerical simulation model. Full size image Table 2
    Physical and mechanical indexes. Full size table Through numerical simulation
    of the displacement nephogram of soil roadbed along the river under the condition
    of only road surface and soil roadbed load, vehicle loading and continuous water
    depth changes, as shown in Fig. 23, the following change law can be found: (1)
    Under road surface and soil roadbed load, the displacement nephogram shows that
    the soil roadbed soil under the road surface is subjected to its gravity, resulting
    in vertical settlement displacement. With the increase of the soil roadbed depth,
    the settlement displacement decreases. This is because the soil at the bottom
    is compacted and the soil at the top is vertically settled. (2) When the vehicle
    is driving on the road surface, the settlement displacement of roadbed soil under
    the road surface increases. With the increase of roadbed soil depth, the settlement
    displacement is higher than that when there is only road surface and roadbed load.
    (3) When flood scours roadbed soil, the scour displacement at the soil roadbed
    slope toe changes and water erosion grooves appear. (4) The water erosion groove
    at the soil roadbed slope toe increases with the increase of flood water level,
    and the displacement of roadbed soil slope also increases with the increase of
    water level, which is connected with the soil at the bottom of pavement slab and
    tends to landslide in the form of sliding surface. Figure 23 Displacement nephogram

    nephograms of soil roadbed along the river under the conditions of only road surface
    and roadbed load, adding vehicle loading and continuous water depth change, as
    shown in Fig. 24, the following changing law can be found: (1) When only the road
    surface and soil roadbed are loaded, the maximum shear stress nephogram shows
    that the shear stress on the bottom roadbed soil is the largest, and it gradually
    decreases from bottom to top. This is because the bottom roadbed soil is compacted
    under the action of gravity. (2) When there are vehicles driving on the road,
    the shear stress of the road surface is the largest, followed by the overall shear
    stress of the roadbed soil, which is large and uniform, and the shear stress of
    the upper part of the roadbed slope is small. (3) When the flood scours roadbed
    soil, the maximum shear stress at the roadbed slope toe changes, and the water
    erosion grooves appear. (4) Under the action of maximum shear stress, the stress
    nephogram of soil roadbed slope changes, there is erosion and loss of roadbed
    soil. With the increase of water level, the height of loss gradually increases,
    and the maximum shear stress of roadbed soil changes as a sliding surface. Figure

    analysis of the above numerical simulation are consistent with the previous stability
    analysis conclusion. Conclusions The soil roadbed along the river is eroded by
    flood at the bottom and falls at the top, which leads to the suspension of the
    upper pavement slab. 1) By carrying out analysis of theoretical and case calculation,
    this study obtained the washout development mechanism of soil roadbed along the
    river, and proposed the process diagram of soil roadbed scouring instability.
    2) Based on the flood erosion, the stability law of roadbed along the river was
    analyzed, the sensitivity analysis of water depth, flow velocity, river bending
    angle and stability safety factor K under different working conditions was carried
    out. Also, the sensitivity law of the changes of water depth, flow velocity and
    river bending angle and the size of residue roadbed along the river after erosion
    was analyzed. 3) The erosion of roadbed toe along the river is greatly influenced
    by the direction of water flow, the expansion process of water erosion grooves
    at the roadbed slope toe is the key factor affecting roadbed collapse and pavement
    slab suspension along the river, and the water erosion movement at the top of
    roadbed toe is earlier than that at the bottom. 4) Through numerical simulation,
    the displacement nephogram and maximum shear stress nephogram of roadbed along
    the river under gravity, pavement load, vehicle load and water depth change were
    analyzed. By comparing the above theories with engineering cases, the water damage
    mechanism of roadbed along the river was further verified. Data availability All

    role in the economic growth of any country. With the increase of population, frequent
    changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging
    task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture
    also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current
    challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting
    edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn
    without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things)
    enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution.
    In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the
    field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters
    such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and
    weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed
    for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the
    crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced
    livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders,
    cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc.
    Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting
    techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This
    article demonstrates how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable
    productivity and quality of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning

    \ backbone for most developing countries. Most of these\ncountries suffer from\
    \ insufﬁcient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable\
    \ and\nfarm-speciﬁc information may signiﬁcantly contribute to more sufﬁcient\
    \ and sustained production.\nTypically, such information is usually fragmented\
    \ and often does ﬁt one-on-one with the farm or farm\nplot. Automated, precise\
    \ and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such\n\
    information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal\
    \ variability. The\nInternet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\
    \ are useful technology in this respect.\nThis paper investigates the usability\
    \ of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications. An\nin-depth qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of relevant work over the past decade was conducted.\n\
    We explore the type and purpose of agricultural parameters, study and describe\
    \ available resources,\nneeded skills and technological requirements that allow\
    \ sustained deployment of IoT and WSN\ntechnology. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant\
    \ gaps in utilization of the technology in the context of\nsmallholder farm practices\
    \ caused by social, economic, infrastructural and technological barriers. We\n\
    also identify a signiﬁcant future opportunity to design and implement affordable\
    \ and reliable data\nacquisition tools and frameworks, with a possible integration\
    \ of citizen science.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; wireless sensor network;\
    \ affordable digital data infrastructure;\ntechnology assist in smallholder data\
    \ acquisition; smart agriculture\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture contributes more\
    \ than 25% to the gross domestic product (GDP) [1] and\n55% to employment opportunities\
    \ in developing countries [2]. It is thus a prominent sector\nto target poverty\
    \ reduction, and is crucial for economic global policy-making. Smallholder\nfarming\
    \ forms a signiﬁcant component of this sector with a food production rate of more\n\
    than 70% globally and more than 60% in developing countries [3]. For instance,\
    \ in Ethiopia,\nsmallholder farming accounts for about 95% of total agricultural\
    \ production of the coun-\ntry [4]. An estimated 2.5 billion people practice smallholder\
    \ agriculture and, in doing so,\nmanage about 510 million farms [5].\nSmallholder\
    \ farmers often own a fragment of farmland and operate under perilous\nconditions\
    \ due to their heavy reliance on ecosystem services that can be scarce and poten-\n\
    tially show signs of degradation [6,7]. Unpredictable and extreme weather conditions\
    \ may\nbring drought or ﬂooding, which lead to soil erosion and depletion, hindering\
    \ farms from\noperating at full potential [8]. The limited ﬁnancial capacity of\
    \ smallholder farmers also\nmeans that their investments in yield-improving mechanisms\
    \ are restricted. As a result,\nan area of focus in these communities is an affordable\
    \ means to increase farm production\nwith efﬁcient and sustained utilization of\
    \ available resources [6].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093273\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n2 of 31\nThe development\
    \ of context-speciﬁc solutions is critical to improve and sustain better\nproduction\
    \ by smallholders. It is important to invest in agricultural practices that can,\
    \ not\nonly provide for future generations, but are also climate-resilient [9,10].\
    \ Such approach\nrequires a data richness that comes directly from the farm allowing\
    \ informed decision-\nmaking on issues such as how to prepare land, what to plant,\
    \ how much to consume and\nhow much to sell or store [11]. Real-time information\
    \ on farming systems, soil and crop\nhealth, water management, livestock management,\
    \ and agro-climatic attributes such as\nrainfall and soil moisture could enable\
    \ smallholder farmers to practice more sustainably\nand increase their productivity.\n\
    Sustainable agriculture consists of practices that opt to meet present and future\
    \ food\ndemands while fulﬁlling social and economic equity, protecting environmental\
    \ health\nand increasing proﬁtability [9,12,13]. Sustainable agriculture and optimization\
    \ of farm\nyield needs better understanding of local and farm level contexts of\
    \ farm production\nand productivity parameters, of which some are variable in\
    \ space and over time. At the\nsame time, most smallholder farms are found in\
    \ rural areas, which often display poor\ninfrastructure and sites are often inaccessible,\
    \ challenging the collection of these data. As a\nresult, information produced\
    \ is rarely complete and often does not quite ﬁt with farm levels.\nEven when\
    \ data are available it is commonly outdated and not representative of current\n\
    situations. Consequently, intuitive farming decisions and traditional farm practices\
    \ persist\namong associated communities and cause over-exploitation of the scarce\
    \ resources leading\nto poor production [14]. Thus, viable technological approaches\
    \ that are easily adoptable\nand reliable are needed for the efﬁcient acquisition\
    \ of in situ farm data. With proper\nenabling tools, such data can be obtained\
    \ affordably [11].\nRecently, with the advent of technology and powerful computing\
    \ infrastructures, it\nhas become possible to obtain, analyze, and generate sound\
    \ agricultural information in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. Remote sensing\
    \ (RS), proximal sensing (PS) and in-ﬁeld\nsensing (IfS) paved the way for enhanced\
    \ data acquisition complementing conventional\napproaches such as survey and physical\
    \ ﬁeld observation [15,16]. A detailed discussion of\neach approach is presented\
    \ in Section 3. The large spatial and temporal coverage and recent\nadvances in\
    \ high-resolution imagery, has made satellite technology indispensable to capture\n\
    farm-related data remotely. Recent works have shown how RS platforms like Sentinel-1/-2\n\
    and MODIS can be used to efﬁciently capture farm data [17–19]. PS technology,\
    \ with more\ncloser look than RS, is effectively utilized for better farm observation,\
    \ agricultural disaster\nmanagement, and agricultural land classiﬁcation [20,21].\
    \ IfS with spatially dispersed\nnetwork of small, inexpensive, and efﬁcient sensing\
    \ devices, known as wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has created opportunities for precise farm\nmonitoring [22,23].\nVarious\
    \ authors have reported the effective utilization of WSN and IoT for soil data\n\
    collection in large-scale farming [24–27]. It remains unclear how effective the\
    \ case can\nbe in smallholder agriculture. Thus, this paper aims to establish\
    \ scientiﬁc understand-\ning concerning:\n1.\nWhether IoT and WSN can also be\
    \ used and potentially beneﬁt smallholder farming\n2.\nWhether the immediate data\
    \ needs of the smallholder farmer are addressed, and\n3.\nWhich design and implementation\
    \ issues need to be considered for IoT and WSN\napplication in smallholder agriculture.\n\
    To this effect, we analyze literature on the state-of-the-art over the past ten\
    \ years,\n2011–2021. The analysis is done through a comprehensive literature review\
    \ and presented\nin sections below. The paper summarizes prior research work,\
    \ explores key limitations\nand prospects, and identiﬁes knowledge gaps. This\
    \ work also proposes a high-level,\nWSN-based IoT architecture for agricultural\
    \ application and discusses the challenges and\nopportunities related to IoT implementation\
    \ in smallholder agriculture. Published journals,\nwhite papers, conference proceedings\
    \ and real systems are the inputs to our work.\nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Section 2 describes the unique\ncharacteristics of smallholder\
    \ farms and the main factors affecting their productivity.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n3 of 31\nSection 3 discusses relevant approaches to data collection in\
    \ smallholder agriculture.\nWith these, we aim to layout a better insight of the\
    \ target population and bring about\nthe data gaps that needs to be ﬁlled. The\
    \ literature search methodology is explained in\nSection 4. An in-depth analysis\
    \ of the use of IoT and WSN in smallholder agriculture,\nbased on reviewed literature\
    \ and a high-level system architecture are presented in Section 5.\nDiscussion\

    Smallholder farmers are often characterized as being conservative, tech-resistant\
    \ and\nshowing a low adoption rate to innovations [28]. It is important to understand\
    \ the root\ncauses for these which may lie in the community. With this knowledge,\
    \ we may avoid\nthe incongruity between technology adoption and actual farmers’\
    \ conditions. Certain\nfarm or farming characteristics are common amongst smallholders\
    \ and distinguish them\nfrom large-scale enterprise farming. Almost by deﬁnition,\
    \ land size is a key property.\nBased on this, smallholder farms are those practiced\
    \ on a small portion of land, 2 ha on\naverage [7,29]. Most smallholder farms\
    \ are also known to practice farming on the basis\nof natural biophysical conditions\
    \ to crop growth, such as rain [29], and to apply a mix of\ncrop growing and livestock\
    \ breeding. However, the extent of these characteristics may vary\nwith demographic\
    \ and economic conditions of the location, the ecological zone and other\nterrain\
    \ parameters [7]. A systematic, multi-criterion deﬁnition needs to be formulated\
    \ from\nsimilar characteristics exhibited by the farmers. These characteristics\
    \ can be categorized in\nfour dimensions:\n•\nSocial attitude;\n•\nThe use of\
    \ resources and infrastructure;\n•\nAwareness and preparedness;\n•\nProductivity.\n\
    2.1. Social Attitude\nFamily ownership, subsistence farming, risk avoidance, communal\
    \ information needs\nand reliance on extension services are social characteristics\
    \ of smallholder farms. Most\nsmallholder farms are run by a family and mostly\
    \ for the family’s subsistence with small\nproduction [7]. The condition of total\
    \ dependence on the farm to feed the family creates atti-\ntudes of considerable\
    \ risk avoidance and resistance to costly farming practices with farmers.\nConsequently,\
    \ there is slow adoption of technology and new farming approaches [28]. In-\n\
    stead, low-return but sustained production practice is preferred over technology-supported\n\
    farming by most smallholders [7].\nSome forms of information provide added value\
    \ when shared amongst members\nof the farmer community. Adjacent plots owned by\
    \ different smallholders will often be\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n4 of 31\nunder\
    \ similar farming practices and communication between neighbor farmers is more\n\
    readily trusted. As a result, relevant information emerging in the community may\
    \ get\ncommunal use. Agricultural extension workers also assist farmers through\
    \ community\nlevel knowledge transfer regarding improved farm management, input\
    \ application and\nother tasks towards better productivity. They serve as a bridge\
    \ to pass on higher level\ndecisions to farmers and oversee their implementation.\
    \ This makes smallholder farms\nhighly dependent on extension workers for information\
    \ and know-how.\n2.2. Resource Usage and Infrastructure\nSmall farm size, farming\
    \ practices with mixed crops, limited access to ﬁnance and\nweak transport, communication\
    \ and on-farm infrastructure are conditions familiar to most\nsmallholder farms.\
    \ A farm’s land may be further split into smaller but discontinuous plots\nwhere\
    \ different crops are cultivated. This practice expresses a risk mitigation mechanism\
    \ to\nstabilize farm income and reduce the impact of failure shocks, even when\
    \ it is reported to\nhave negative correlation with yields [30]. Diverse cropping\
    \ on fragmented lands causes\ncomplications for technological assistance and innovation,\
    \ for one because plot and crop\nrequirements may vary. The required investments\
    \ make farmers resistant to such changes,\nwhich are better suited to and have\
    \ often been developed for larger-scale farming.\nTheir limited ﬁnancial capacity\
    \ also makes farmers less interested in technological\ninvestments. They heavily\
    \ rely on farming and have minimal or no alternative source of\nincome [7]. Most\
    \ farms are remote and suffer from poor physical and institutional infras-\ntructure\
    \ in provision of electric power, road access, irrigation, communication networks,\n\
    and access to social services [31]. These challenges hinder successful implementation\
    \ of\nagricultural innovation.\n2.3. Awareness and Preparedness\nIn the absence\
    \ of agricultural information systems, smallholders are vulnerable to\nnatural\
    \ hazards. Water excess or scarcity are particularly dangerous because most farms\n\
    apply rain-fed practices. Adoption of agricultural innovation and technology is\
    \ hard to\nachieve without systematic assistance and training. In addition, the\
    \ generally low literacy\nrate of smallholders causes low awareness and preparedness\
    \ for on-farm solutions. This\nrequires attention to be paid to minimal initial\
    \ investment level, ease of use, sensitivity to\nculture, language and other acceptance\
    \ barriers. Fuelled by scientiﬁc ﬁnds, it is crucial to\nexpand rural education\
    \ and regular capacity building of extension workers.\n2.4. Low Productivity\n\
    Various socio-economic, environmental and biophysical factors often correlate\
    \ strongly\nwith production levels of smallholders. They include genetically determined\
    \ behavior of\ncrops, soil properties, climate conditions, topography, farm ﬁnancial\
    \ status and illiteracy.\nWeak land management practices [32], the volume of family\
    \ labor [33] and uninformed\nuse of farm inputs are also factors that contribute\
    \ to poor farm productivity. The low\nproductivity is also often exacerbated by\
    \ crop disease and pests [34,35]. In addition to the\ninculcated effect of the\
    \ above factors, scarce research and development activities and lack\nof accurate\
    \ and timely information negatively impact farm yields [36,37].\nIt is worth noting\
    \ that these factors do not equally impact farming across all small-\nholder landscapes.\
    \ Their role and severity vary with micro-climate, region, and agro-\necological\
    \ zone. Understanding them as root causes within the space-time variability is\n\
    critical for ﬁnding contextual solutions. Our review, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.2, reveals soil\n(in its various properties) as the most central attribute\
    \ that impacts agricultural production.\nWe should thus strive to obtain accurate\
    \ on-farm information about relevant soil properties\nto allow valuable diagnostics.\n\
    Considering the aforementioned characteristics, smallholder farms can be deﬁned\n\
    as: family-run, small farms that are often fragmented into disjoint plots, that\
    \ are nature-dependent\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n5 of 31\nand have limited operational\
    \ budget, limited information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay\
    \ low production levels.\n3. Data Acquisition in Smallholder Agriculture\nComprehensive\
    \ data on farm inputs, natural resource utilization, and environmental\nand biophysical\
    \ attributes is required to assist in improving farming. There are four possible\n\
    ways to acquire both technical and socio-economic data at the smallholder farm\
    \ level. These\nare: conventional, or by remote sensing, proximal sensing and\
    \ in-ﬁeld sensing.\n•\nConventional data collection Interviews, focus group discussions,\
    \ surveys, sam-\nple collections and observations, on-farm trials and yield measurements\
    \ are the\nconventional primary data collection approaches used in agronomic research\
    \ and\nprojects [38–40]. These are techniques for which physical presence of the\
    \ data col-\nlector is needed, and they demand high resource mobilization, especially\
    \ human\nlabor. Sample collection, on-farm trials, observations and measurements\
    \ are used\nto collect physical data such as soil properties and fertility, crop\
    \ condition and yield\nestimates, while interviews, focus group discussions and\
    \ surveys can be used for socio-\neconomic data collection. In general, these\
    \ data collection techniques exhibit a number\nof challenges. (i) Prolonged collection\
    \ period to capture precisely spatio-temporal\nvariability [41]; (ii) non-traceability\
    \ as most smallholders have little formal education\nand do not keep written records\
    \ of parameters during farm work, leading to lack of\nevidence; (iii) data collection\
    \ is considered intrusive and less-trusted by farmers as the\nactivities are mostly\
    \ non-participatory and thus less transparent [40]. Collected data\nmay be biased\
    \ due to misinformed collectors or the use of poor sampling schemes.\nThis may\
    \ result in incomplete data with quality problems, subsequently leading to\nincorrect\
    \ conclusions. However, with careful and proper execution, conventional tools\n\
    are crucial for calibration and other statistical analytic purposes [38]. Such\
    \ data may\nalso complement and/or validate secondary data used in decision-making\
    \ systems.\n•\nRemote sensing Recent research efforts have shown the potential\
    \ of RS and GIS\ntechnologies for monitoring smallholder farms and ﬁlling data\
    \ gaps [42,43]. RS uses\nspace-borne and airborne systems and generates valuable\
    \ data such as crop phenotype,\ngrowth stages and crop health issues, soil type,\
    \ soil moisture and farm input uses [44].\nThe potential of RS to assess crop\
    \ and soil properties, and farm inputs is demonstrated\nin [17,19,43,45,46]. The\
    \ actual application of these tools is uncommon in developing\ncountries. The\
    \ lack of ground truth data, the high learning curve to understand\nand use the\
    \ outcomes, the coarse spectral resolution as well as lack of appropriate\ntraining\
    \ are reasons for their limited use. Small and fragmented farms, vegetation\n\
    heterogeneity, and atmospheric conditions also diminish quality and usefulness\
    \ of RS\ndata [47,48]. Nonetheless, RS has high potential in complementing conventional\
    \ data\ncollection approaches and holds promise to assist sustainable farming\
    \ practices.\n•\nProximal sensing A closer look at a farm ﬁeld can be achieved\
    \ with PS; sensors\npositioned approx. 2 m above the ﬁeld surface then capture\
    \ data [49]. A number of\nagricultural parameters including soil properties, crop\
    \ growth metrics and farm inputs\ncan be acquired through this platform [50,51].This\
    \ is done by electromagnetic sensors,\nground penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray\
    \ spectrometry sensors [15,47]. PS\nsensors are typically mounted on tractors,\
    \ spreaders, sprayers or irrigation booms. PS\ntechnology is relatively economical,\
    \ more accurate and offers higher spectral resolution\nthan RS [52]. However,\
    \ low temporal resolution, labor intensity and signiﬁcant cost\nhinder full usability.\
    \ The scarcity or absence of mechanized farming vehicles is\nanother barrier to\
    \ utilization of PS. A review of both RS and PS technology in soil data\ncollection\
    \ and associated challenges is provided in [53].\n•\nIn-ﬁeld sensing IoT and WSN\
    \ can complement the above approaches and help min-\nimize their mentioned challenges.\
    \ IoT is a platform through which objects can be\ninterconnected to generate and\
    \ exchange relevant and valuable information. Objects\ncan be both physical and\
    \ virtual. WSN is at the heart of this platform enabling reliable\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n6 of 31\ninteraction between dispersedly located objects. IoT and\
    \ WSN have application in\nthe broader agricultural domain. Monitoring, tracking,\
    \ automation, and precision\nagriculture can be mentioned in this context. Several\
    \ projects are known in the de-\nveloped world: the EU’s Food and Farm 2020 project,\
    \ the Kansas water preservation\nthrough sensors, and NanoGanesh are a few examples\
    \ [54]. The NanoGanesh project,\nfor instance, is an irrigation automation system\
    \ that creates mobile-based remote\ncontrol for water pumps and water tanks using\
    \ sensor information. The project helps\nfarmers to control water pumps, their\
    \ power supply, and provides vandalism alerts\nof ﬁeld-deployed equipment. Other\
    \ projects have designed affordable, all-inclusive\nfarm improvement mechanisms\
    \ that utilize IoT and WSNs [25,26,55,56]. Smallholder\nfarmers require information\
    \ and advice, down-scaled to the plot level, to improve their\npractice; stakeholders\
    \ such as agricultural extension agents, and (non-)governmental\naid organizations\
    \ also rely on such information for planning. The point-level data\noffered through\
    \ IoT and WSN makes the technology ﬁtting with only a limited number\nof sensors\
    \ per plot. Inexpensive sensors keep things affordable, also to smallholders.\n\
    In addition, IoT and WSN are simple and quick approaches for farm-level data collec-\n\
    tion that allow direct interpretation. Further discussion of IoT and WSN is presented\n\
    in Section 5.\n4. Literature Search Methodology\nAgriculture encompasses various\
    \ activities including crop farming and livestock\nbreeding. IoT and WSN can have\
    \ various applications in this broad domain including farm\nmonitoring, animal\
    \ tracking, and precision agriculture. Our literature search considered\nall these\
    \ sub-domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\n\

    were speciﬁcally studied. Section 5 presents a detailed discussion of ﬁndings.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n8 of 31\n5. IoT and WSN in Smallholder Agriculture\nWe\
    \ argued in Section 3 that IoT has sound justiﬁcation to assist in agriculture\
    \ data\ncollection and address the information gap that smallholder farms face.\
    \ Monitoring crops,\nsoil and weather at farm-level, continually and in (near)\
    \ real-time with reasonable cost\nmay provide closer insight into possible farm\
    \ investments for improved productivity.\nLivestock tracking, pest detection,\
    \ farm input application may support decision-making\nand better farm management\
    \ practice.Unfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is\nmost useful are also\
    \ those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism and other\nphysical\
    \ damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance the\n\
    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.\
    \ With proper\ndesign and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can\
    \ be made to beneﬁt from\nthe technology. In line with this, We propose an IoT-WSN\
    \ architecture for agricultural\napplications. The proposed architecture is presented\
    \ in Figure 3 and it has ﬁve layers:\nsensing, control, backhaul, application\
    \ and decision layer.\n \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless\

    \ architecture for agricul-\nture applications (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM:\
    \ Livestock Management, WM: Weather Monitoring,\nPAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation\
    \ Monitoring).\nAs can be seen in the ﬁgure, the sensing layer comprises objects\
    \ used to monitor and\ninteract with agricultural elements such as soil, livestock\
    \ or crop. Measurement sensors\nand their controlling nodes are found on this\
    \ layer. Nodes run embedded instruction on\nwhen to measure which agriculture\
    \ elements through one or more sensors. Data collected\nfrom this layer needs\
    \ to reach the control layer through wired or wireless communication\nprotocols.\
    \ Data rate, power consumption and communication range are some important\nfactors\
    \ that affect the choice. Less power-hungry and optimal communication are required\n\
    in agriculture applications. Examples of wireless communication protocols are\
    \ presented\nin Table 2. In real agricultural ﬁelds’ deployment, communication\
    \ signal could be weak\ndue to environmental obstructions such as tree. This might\
    \ cause frequent communication\ninterruption between sensing layer and the control\
    \ layer with signiﬁcant data loss. Design\nand/or implementation considerations\
    \ such as obstruction-aware deployment scheme or\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n9 of\
    \ 31\nnode’s temporary data buffering scheme are required. The control layer is\
    \ responsible for\naggregation of received data and transfer to the back end system.\
    \ It also controls actions\nof actuators through decisions coming from the back\
    \ end system. Based on the device’s\ncapability and application requirement, this\
    \ layer can be setup to perform additional\ntasks such as controlling the frequency\
    \ and time of data reading by sensor nodes and\ndata buffering. A node with higher\
    \ processing and communication capability is setup at\nthis layer. This node is\
    \ often referred as gateway and supports different communication\nprotocols. The\
    \ backhaul layer bridges the communication between the resource-constrained\n\
    gateway device and relatively resource-rich back end system. It manages the underlying\n\
    network and application communication protocols between gateway and network server\n\
    and between the network server and application server. In the later case, the\
    \ communication\nprotocols can be synchronous as in Message Queuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) or\nasynchronous as in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\
    \ The network communication\nprotocol can be the reliable Transport Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) or the efﬁcient User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP). In both cases, the protocol\
    \ choice depends on energy-efﬁciency, inter-\noperability and resource need. It\
    \ is possible for this communication to be disrupted due to\nunstable communication\
    \ infrastructure. Alternatives that could withstand such disruptions\nmay need\
    \ to be identiﬁed. The application layer deﬁnes the business rules and required\n\
    functionality of the agriculture application. This layer also creates the required\
    \ seamless\nintegration of data coming from heterogeneous sensors. Finally, the\
    \ decision layer performs\nanalysis of data received from devices based on the\
    \ business rules and user requirements.\nData analysis, report generation and\
    \ decision support all happen in this layer. The type of\ninformation that is\
    \ generated, target stakeholders, information re/presentation and delivery\ninterface\
    \ are all decisions that must be addressed at the level of this layer. The application\n\
    and decision layers shall address requirements of a speciﬁc agriculture application\
    \ domain\nand answer all users’ needs. This trickles down and dictate the type\
    \ and number of nodes\nto deploy at the sensing layer as well as the timing and\
    \ amount of data to read. Usefulness\nof decisions made at these two layers also\
    \ heavily rely on the quality of data generated at\nlower layers. Hence, data\
    \ validation and quality assurance measures needs to be in place\nat the lower\
    \ layers.\nTable 2. Wireless communication technology comparison with example.\n\

    \ connections with the Internet and the overall efﬁciency of the IoT applica-\n\
    tion operation. Important types of wireless communication technology are presented\
    \ in\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n10 of 31\nTable 2. Minimal operational resource\
    \ needs, scalability, long data range, high resistance\nto signal interference,\
    \ simple operation and maintenance requirements are critical criteria\nwhen choosing\
    \ a wireless communication technology for such environments.\nOur analysis reveals\
    \ that use of IoT and WSN in smallholder farming evolves around\nthe following\
    \ issues:\n•\nPurpose;\n•\nSensor deployment and implementation;\n•\nCommunication\
    \ technology;\n•\nPower sources;\n•\nComputing analysis;\n•\nQuality assurance.\n\
    We elaborate on these below.\n5.1. Purpose\nAgricultural productivity depends\
    \ on multiple parameters: those of soil, weather, crop\nand other farm management\
    \ practices especially. Careful investigation is, thus, required\nto identify\
    \ those parameters with most impact, to allow tuning farming practices through\n\
    continuous monitoring and analysis.\nFour areas have been associated by the research\
    \ community with the use of IoT and\nWSN in smallholder agriculture: precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), weather monitoring (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring\
    \ (PAIM) and livestock management (LM). In preci-\nsion agriculture, work focuses\
    \ on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other farm input\nmanagement actions.\
    \ PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs for optimal\nproduction.\
    \ The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation\n\
    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes\n\
    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59,62,65,66,68,69,73,77,90,99,103,108–110].\
    \ Moni-\ntoring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer\
    \ application and\npromotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67,75,87,98,101,111].\n\
    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT\
    \ and\nWSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70,82,83,89,94,105,112].\
    \ Weather\ndata by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other\
    \ variables are also in\nplay. The correct approach is to integrate with other\
    \ agro-climatic variables [67,88,105,113].\nCorrelation between soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity, and other environmental\nvariables needs to be\
    \ analyzed for agricultural applications. Existing agro-meteorological\ndata collection\
    \ infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This is mainly\n\
    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced\
    \ data are\npoor [83,94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may\
    \ complement these\nweather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they\
    \ can be deployed densely to pro-\nduce data of better spatial resolution, and\
    \ can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously\nat small time intervals. This\
    \ brings value in agricultural early warning systems.\nThe third area in which\
    \ IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest and\nanimal infestation\
    \ monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits to\nfarmlands\
    \ are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such threats\n\
    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing\n\
    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation\
    \ of\nleave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases.\
    \ Temperature\nand motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems.\
    \ IoT and WSN can help\nto set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the\
    \ required precision and temporal\nscale [60,61,81,92,93,114,115].\nLivestock\
    \ management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technol-\nogy\
    \ [79,80,86,104,116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in combination\n\
    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is\
    \ mostly an\nincome source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary\
    \ needs. Tracking of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n11 of 31\ncattle, monitoring animal\
    \ health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring body\nchanges can become\
    \ sensor-based.\nAmong the 53 papers reviewed, we found that PA is researched\
    \ widely with about\n64% of the works targeting it, as shown in Figure 4. The\
    \ classes in that ﬁgure are not\nmutually exclusive as some papers address more\
    \ than one application domain, as discussed\nin Section 5.1 and reported in [91,99].\
    \ Most data collected was used in water management\nand irrigation. Since smallholder\
    \ farms mostly apply rain-fed practices, other use cases\nthat address the much\
    \ needed information of the community shall be sought. These can be\ndeciding\
    \ which crop to plant, the sowing time and pest management [98,120,121]. Weather\n\
    sensor data may also help in situations like drought. Precise information on such\
    \ and\noptimal utilization of other existing farm resources is, thus, also of\
    \ paramount importance\nto this community.\n60%\n10%\n14%\n16%\nPA\nLM\nWM\nPAIM\n\

    \ uses of IoT-WSN\nin smallholder agriculture (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM: Livestock\
    \ Management, WM: Weather\nMonitoring, PAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation Monitoring);\
    \ classes may be mutually overlapping.\n5.2. Sensor Deployment Schemes\nMultiple\
    \ sensors make up a WSN. Sensor deployment in agriculture requires a\ncareful\
    \ design that takes into account the spatio-temporal variability of the parameters\n\
    of interest. For instance, soil moisture may display high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability\nwhile crop growth tends to be slow and monotonic over time, and\
    \ has higher predictability.\nAppropriate sensor deployment shall address such\
    \ variability. It also determines the\nnumber of devices to be used, with budget\
    \ implications. Moreover, some agricultural\nparameters, like soil moisture and\
    \ crop root growth, exhibit spatial variability over different\nsoil depths. Optimal\
    \ placement of sensors is required to address such requirements and\noptimization\
    \ of performance and coverage of the WSN [111].\nWork by [72] presents WSN deployment\
    \ from three perspectives: node movement\n(dynamic, static, hybrid), node type\
    \ (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and system hierarchy\n(single-tier, multi-tier).\
    \ In static node deployment, nodes are placed in a ﬁxed position\nfor the entire\
    \ sensing duration [122]. The dynamic node set-up allows mobility of nodes,\n\
    and a hybrid set-up integrates static and dynamic nodes. Homogeneous nodes are\
    \ those\nwith near-identical characteristics while heterogeneous nodes differ\
    \ in computation power,\nsensing capability and/or transceiver units. A tiered\
    \ hierarchy organizes nodes into clusters\nto extend the spatial coverage with\
    \ the same [123] or a different [122] number of nodes\nin each cluster. Sensor\
    \ placement in WSN typically follows a random [122] or grid-based\napproach [75,106,111].\
    \ In the ﬁrst, nodes are distributed randomly over the target location.\nIn a\
    \ grid-based set-up, nodes are arranged in a regular equidistant way, placed at\
    \ the edge\nor center of the polygon [106,124,125]. As most reviewed papers are\
    \ experimental, little\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n12 of 31\nis discussed regarding\
    \ node placement. A few papers mention cluster-based static sensor\nplacement\
    \ [75,106], and in livestock monitoring, nodes are tied to moving animals.\nThe\
    \ number and type of sensors in a WSN for agriculture monitoring are speciﬁc\n\
    to the application theme or purpose. Sparse air temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ may\nsufﬁce to collect weather data at village-level. High sensor density is\
    \ needed with motion\nsensors in livestock monitoring, unless the purpose is to\
    \ follow group movements only.\nMeasurements from some sensors can also serve\
    \ multiple needs. For instance, relative\nhumidity can be used for weather analysis\
    \ and in crop pest manifestation assessment.\nA dense deployment of nodes with\
    \ high frequency data collection generates a large amount\nof data. However, such\
    \ affects the network’s lifetime and comes with budget implications.\nThe papers\
    \ we reviewed use different sensor types. In PA applications, soil water content\n\
    or soil temperature measurement are common while in livestock management animal\n\
    movement is required. Some sensor types are also commonly found among applications:\n\
    soil moisture and relative humidity sensors are frequently used, as shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Air\nand soil temperature sensors are also often deployed sensors while others\
    \ like light, CO2,\nlocation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil acidity\
    \ (pH), wind speed and direction are\nless often applied [79,80,82,83,86,92,94,101,110,111,118,126,127].\n\

    \ reviewed papers (N = 53) showing important types in small-\nholder agriculture.\
    \ Papers typically report multiple sensor types in use.\nMost agricultural parameters\
    \ require time-series monitoring. Expected parametric\ntemporal variability is\
    \ the key factor to determine sensor reading frequency and period; in\nprinciple,\
    \ one wants to capture each signiﬁcant parameter value change. An additional\n\
    concern is especially the daily cycle in the sensor’s ambient conditions, which\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact comparability of sensor readings. Thus, sensors should\
    \ collect data at ﬁxed\nmoments in the day, where it needs to be understood that\
    \ ‘at 7 a.m.’ and ‘one hour after\nsunrise’ are different notions of time ﬁxation.\
    \ Still, post-processing of sensor data should\nanalyze whether the day/night\
    \ rhythm is manifest in the data, and how, if so, to correct\nfor it.\nIn PA,\
    \ for instance, as plants grow their demand for resources evolves. It may thus\
    \ be\nbeneﬁcial to monitor throughout the season for optimal production. In pest\
    \ monitoring,\nthe appropriate sensing period may fall between the ﬂowering and\
    \ senescence phases.\nFor some parameters, even within the active sensing window,\
    \ measurements are required\nmore frequently as, for instance, in soil moisture\
    \ compared to soil type [128]. In most\nreviewed papers, a data read frequency\
    \ may range between 15 and 30 min with no speciﬁc\njustiﬁcation. We observed more\
    \ emphasis given to the energy use efﬁciency of nodes and\nless focus to the efﬁcient\
    \ applicability of acquired data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n13 of 31\nAs discussed\
    \ in Section 2, smallholder farms have communal data needs and similar\ncharacteristics\
    \ in weather and soil attributes. Thus, it is more cost-effective to deploy a\n\
    variety of sensors than a dense scatter of redundant sensors to obtain a more\
    \ holistic view.\nA WSN node can listen to multiple sensors as most reviewed papers\
    \ actually do. This helps\nto improve understanding of site-speciﬁc interplay\
    \ between parameters. It also simpliﬁes\ncommunication management when more nodes\
    \ are deployed. Overall, an efﬁcient sensor\ndeployment scheme for smallholder\
    \ agriculture shall give due consideration to wide area\ncoverage, efﬁcient power\
    \ use, extended network lifetime, reduced signal loss, low cost\nand reliable\
    \ data generation. It is also crucial to acquire all needed data to the required\n\
    spatial-temporal resolution. These are discussed in less detail in the reviewed\
    \ papers. Only\nsome projects mention a systematic node deployment strategy [73,75,88,100,111].\
    \ Most of\nweather monitoring projects follow the World Meteorology Organization\
    \ (WMO) standard\nto set up their network [82,83].\n5.3. Data Communication Approaches\n\
    Efﬁcient communication needs to be established between the sensing and control\
    \ layer\nas well as between control and backhaul layer for transmission of sensed\
    \ data. The advance-\nment of the wireless communication technology has brought\
    \ signiﬁcant breakthroughs in\nIoT. Radio frequency identiﬁers (RFID) and short-range\
    \ wireless communications have\nBluetooth and ad hoc WSNs as examples. Though\
    \ these technologies are known to have\nlow power requirements and can operate\
    \ for a considerable amount of time, most also have\nshort-range coverage and\
    \ are not suitable for wide spatial coverage applications such as\nagriculture\
    \ [129]. Cellular wireless networks can be used to address this limitation but\
    \ as\nIoT keeps growing and more objects become connected, network trafﬁc management\
    \ and\nsignal generation becomes a concern and requires further design improvements\
    \ [130,131].\nA recent communication technology that tries to overcome these limitations\
    \ is the\nLow-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It elevates the short-range and\
    \ high cost of\npredecessor technology and can connect a wide domain of IoT applications.\
    \ LPWAN is\nsuitable for services with infrequent and small data exchange requirements.\
    \ However,\nit also spans wide spatial coverage with tolerable data loss, making\
    \ it appropriate for\napplications that target resource-constrained and remote\
    \ locations. Table 2 gives examples\nof wireless communication technology mostly\
    \ used in IoT.\nPreference trends for wireless communication technology in smallholder\
    \ agriculture\nover the past ten years are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen,\
    \ Zigbee and WiFi commu-\nnication protocols were predominantly used until recently,\
    \ while LoRa communication\nhas received more interest in the last three years.\
    \ Both Zigbee and WiFi have limited\nrange coverage but better data rates, making\
    \ them suitable for short- or medium-distance\napplications with high data needs.\
    \ The low duty cycle of the Zigbee protocol, which is an\noperational method of\
    \ reducing power consumption, and its large network size also made\nit preferred\
    \ in most smallholder agriculture applications [132,133]. A number of projects\n\
    also operate in standalone mode, a set-up in which a device acts both as a sensing\
    \ node\nand as controller or gateway.\nConsidering the backhaul communication\
    \ that allows gateways to transfer received\ndata to application servers, not\
    \ many alternatives exist in rural areas to cellular communi-\ncation. The penetration\
    \ of this technology has increased in developing countries reaching\nrural areas\
    \ [134–136]. Most publications use the technology for data transmission from\n\
    farms to central server. Trends in technology choice among the reviewed work is\
    \ shown\nin Figure 7. Despite wide penetration, cellular communication is frequently\
    \ unstable and\nunreliable in remote areas and may result in data loss. As a result,\
    \ more reliable options\nneed to be considered.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n14 of\

    Ethernet\nWifi\nLoRa\nCellular\nFigure 7. Trends of common backhaul communication\
    \ standards use in smallholder agriculture applications.\nThe choice of an efﬁcient\
    \ distribution and communication channel among sensing\nnodes is critical to achieve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and reliably collect data. It ensures that nodes\nhave increased\
    \ lifetime and regular responsiveness. To this end, a WSN mesh topology is\ncommon\
    \ among projects; a few mention the use of star topology [100,113] or a clustered\n\
    hierarchical topology [110]. In mesh network topology, nodes have routing capability\
    \ and\ncommunication can be established among each other. This allows reliable\
    \ data transmission\nand reduced data loss. It requires more power energy and\
    \ thus suitable for short range\ncommunication. In star topology, nodes are connected\
    \ to one central node with routing\ncapability, and make a star-like structure.\
    \ Child nodes transmit data to this central hub\nwith no guarantee of delivery.\
    \ The communication range between nodes and the sink shall\nthus be kept reasonable\
    \ or data could be lost. Clustered topology is a tree-like arrangement\nof two\
    \ or more star topology to enhance this communication range. The scale, deployment\n\
    environment and resource have a play on which topology to adopt.\n5.4. Energy\
    \ Sources and Saving\nAnother design consideration for IoT and WSN applications\
    \ in smallholder agriculture\nis the power consumption of devices as commonly\
    \ there is limited or no electricity access.\nA typical sensing node functional\
    \ set-up is shown in Figure 8: it has a radio transceiver,\na micro-controller\
    \ board that interfaces with sensors, and a power unit. Dependent on the\napplication,\
    \ a node can also have extra elements such as a power generator, mobilizer or\n\
    location ﬁnder [137].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n15 of 31\n \nExternal  parts \n\

    \ Analog-Digital-Converter;\nRF: Radio Frequency; Tx/Rx: Transmitter/Receiver).\n\
    Nodes can run on electricity mains, battery, or solar power. For nodes at the\
    \ sensing\nlayer, easily replaceable Li-Ion batteries are preferred power sources\
    \ because they are\naffordable and bring no technical complications. However,\
    \ frequent replacement is required\nand caution must be taken on the reliability\
    \ or quality of transmitted data due to their\nlimited lifetime. A work-around\
    \ is to apply an energy saving scheme such as sleep-and-\nawake [76,81,83]. This\
    \ allows reducing power consumption of nodes in idle state and\nthus extend battery\
    \ life. Solar power is also a promising option though it has seasonal\nﬂuctuations.\
    \ Nodes at the control layer need to run uninterrupted and require continuous,\n\
    reliable power supply. It also demands signiﬁcant power, which cannot be achieved\
    \ with\nsimple batteries. The wired electric mains is a sound source for such\
    \ requirements. It is,\nhowever, not always available and then solar panels [66,91,92,106,118,138],\
    \ rechargeable\nbatteries [81,84,93,94] or power banks [101] are the possible\
    \ options.\n5.5. Computational Analysis\nFor a systematic study and comparison\
    \ of approaches taken in the reviewed projects,\nwe used an idealized workﬂow\
    \ of a general data science project as presented in Figure 9. It\ndepicts a functional\
    \ action chain from data acquisition to decision-making and information\ndelivery.\
    \ It shows how data are produced, processed and presented (PPP) to stakeholders\n\
    at different operational levels.\n•\nData acquisition This entails the process\
    \ of what and how data are being collected.\nIn IoT and WSN set-ups, the data\
    \ acquisition layer focuses on parameter identiﬁcation,\ndevice selection and\
    \ set-up, communication network selection and establishment,\nand the data collection\
    \ phase itself. The sensing and control layers discussed in\nSection 5 are mapped\
    \ to this stage of data science.\n•\nData curation In this phase, data cleaning\
    \ and pre-processing of acquired sensor\ndata are conducted to improve its reliability.\
    \ Important tasks are ﬁltering, adding,\ndropping and transferring. It also handles\
    \ integration of data from different sensors,\nthrough well-deﬁned data mapping\
    \ algorithms. The heterogeneity of devices, oper-\nating platforms and absence\
    \ of de facto communication standards in IoT and WSN\ncommunication often obstruct\
    \ direct and full utilization of the technology. The syn-\ntactic and semantic\
    \ variations at hardware and software levels of the system pose\ninteroperability\
    \ and integration challenges [93]. Variation in data collection and rep-\nresentation,\
    \ different communication speciﬁcations such as transmission rate and\nbandwidth,\
    \ and data processing and presentation are issues to be addressed in this\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 3273\n16 of 31\ncontext. One of the critical functionality of a data\
    \ curation is, thus, facilitation of such\ndata integration. This phase is crucial\
    \ as the remaining action chains are dependent\non its outcome.\n•\nData processing\
    \ and analysis The data processing and analysis phase is where compu-\ntations\
    \ are executed on the raw, sensor data acquired from farms. These computations\n\
    can be classiﬁed into three general groups: (a) Simple, which is a threshold-based\n\
    if-then analysis that determines incidents as deviations from pre-deﬁned values;\n\
    (b) Statistical, that determines standard statistics such as regressions and ANOVA;\n\
    and (c) AI, which brings forecasting and prediction capabilities through advanced\n\
    mathematical and machine learning computations, using artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN), deep learning (DL) and other techniques. Operations executed in this phase\n\
    are based on speciﬁc application needs and shall assist the decision-making of\
    \ small-\nholder farms. It is responsible to produce usable knowledge from the\
    \ pre-processed\ndata passed to it.\n•\nInformation presentation and visualization\
    \ The presentation and visualization phase\nhandles the human–computer interaction\
    \ (HCI) and deﬁnes appropriate information\ndelivery mechanisms. It also handles\
    \ the information presentation format prescribed\nas suitable by the end user.\
    \ Three broad categories for presentation and data visual-\nization are: web-based,\
    \ application-based, and SMS- or alert-based. Web-based data\npresentation can\
    \ reach users through a stand-alone web page or as social media feeds,\nsuch as\
    \ tweets. The application-based information presentation uses a dedicated\nmobile\
    \ application developed and installed on the user’s smartphone. Both web-\nand\
    \ application-based mechanisms support graphical and textual data visualization\n\
    options and provide multi-language access. They do require regular internet access\n\
    and smart devices. The SMS information presentation is a text-based data delivery\n\
    that runs on regular phones and can present short alert information to users on\
    \ the\nfarm status and actions advised.\n•\nComputing environment This environment\
    \ determines the computing capabilities\nused in all stages of data processing.\
    \ Edge computing, cloud computing or private\ncomputing environments can be used\
    \ in agriculture data processing. The choice\nof platform depends on the application\
    \ needs and resource availability. In an IoT\nand WSN set-up for agriculture data\
    \ processing, edge computing can be ideal to\nprocess and disseminate information\
    \ to farmers in real-time. This is also advanta-\ngeous especially when network\
    \ communications are fragile, as can be the case in\nsmallholder farming. Edge\
    \ computing, however, may present challenges in deploy-\nment in resource-constrained\
    \ devices such as sensor nodes and may set limits to data\nprocessing implementations.\
    \ AI algorithms speciﬁcally need substantial computation,\nmemory and power resources,\
    \ which are usually scarce in a WSN. Edge comput-\ning also sets higher quality\
    \ requirements to the software as it is harder to upgrade\nonce deployed.\nCloud\
    \ computing offers rich resources to implement sophisticated and large data\n\
    processing algorithms and persistent storage. It also facilitates the re-usability\
    \ of open\ncloud solutions provided as software as a service (SaaS) or infrastructure\
    \ as a service\n(IaaS). However, accessibility and network bandwidth demand is\
    \ a concern in small-\nholder communities. A private server can be set up with\
    \ equivalent resource provision\nto a cloud computing with self-built data analysis\
    \ and presentation mechanisms.\n•\nQuality assurance These are associated tasks\
    \ that ensure overall data processing\nand information generation are of some\
    \ expected quality standard and ﬁt with user\nexpectations. It is a rigorous task\
    \ that needs to be present in every stage of data\nprocessing. During data acquisition,\
    \ some QA measures can be device testing and\ncalibration, and communication network\
    \ reliability and efﬁciency validation. QA\nduring the data curation and data\
    \ processing phases can be validation of data by\npre-processing algorithms in\
    \ terms of reliability, efﬁciency and optimality. A dearth\nof accurate baseline\
    \ data regarding different agriculture parameters challenges these\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n17 of 31\ntasks. Regardless, some quality assurance have to be in\
    \ place to ensure sensor data\nare reliable before further investigation and decision\
    \ support information generation.\nThe computing environment also needs to meet\
    \ required quality standards such as\nsecurity, reliability and accessibility.\n\

    The calibration of sensors is a critical step before actual deployment in agricultural\n\
    applications.Laboratory analysis, manual investigation and existing repositories\
    \ can serve\nas calibration value sources [76,87,94]. Often, up-to-date ground\
    \ truth data for most\nsmallholder agriculture is not available, thus requiring\
    \ alternatives. One alternative can be\nto compare redundant readings of a sensor\
    \ and formulation of a calibration value. In these\ncases, appropriate testing\
    \ and validation measures must be taken [76,79,82,83]. Outdoor\nIoT-WSN applications\
    \ to smallholder agriculture also need to address environmental effects\ncaused\
    \ by topography, climate and vegetation cover on data quality.\nAnother critical\
    \ point related to quality assurance is security and anomaly control. Se-\ncurity\
    \ is a challenge in IoT and WSN deployment in agriculture as it is distributed\
    \ through\nthe ecosystem and could happen at different levels. The fact that smallholder\
    \ farms are\nfound in uncontrolled and often inaccessible areas and the limited\
    \ literacy rates exacerbate\nthis problem. Security can be perceived from two\
    \ broad perspectives: external and internal.\nThe external security threats are\
    \ posed by outside factors such as physical device damage or\nvandalism, denial\
    \ of service (DoS) attacks, signal jamming and data fabrications. Internal\nsecurity\
    \ threats are anomalies that happen due to wrong data and processing step which\n\
    compromise the reliability and quality of information generated. Faults in data\
    \ acquiring\nand processing anomalies can be mentioned as internal security challenges.\
    \ Security breach\ncould also happen at device, communication or transaction level.\
    \ Physical and logical\nfailures of nodes, calibration problem, device’s lifetime\
    \ and deployment environment could\ncause anomaly in the sensed data. Communication\
    \ anomaly could happen due to weak\nsecurity enforcement, resource or bandwidth\
    \ competitions among nodes and noise attenu-\nation on the signal transported.\
    \ The inability to withstand harsh and resource-deprived\nenvironment could also\
    \ challenge the communication standard and result in anomalous\ndata. Ambient\
    \ temperature and rain pose physical damage risks to sensing nodes and may\naffect\
    \ data and signal quality; tree and crop canopy may compromise the communication\n\
    between sensors and gateway. Lack of proper data curation, and appropriate processing\n\
    model and algorithm could potentially lead to transaction anomaly and generate\
    \ unreliable\ninformation. All these security problems pose quality concerns to\
    \ the IoT and WSN gener-\nated data which inhibit its utilization to decision\
    \ supports. Careful consideration of such\nfactors is required before the IoT\
    \ and WSN deployment for agricultural applications. Water-\nproof and heat-resistant\
    \ cases for nodes, integration of external, omnidirectional antennas\nand/or placement\
    \ of nodes at appropriate height, utilization of appropriate software tools\n\
    are relevant design and implementation considerations.\nProper monitoring and\
    \ analysis schemes may determine the efﬁciency and reliability\nof the installed\
    \ technology. Moreover, appropriate anomaly detection and prevention\nalgorithms\
    \ need to be deployed at the different layers of the IoT WSN communication to\n\
    act accordingly and avoid wrong input to a decision making. Some WSN communication\n\
    standards such as Zigbee and LoRaWAN has added security layer to the protocol\
    \ to\nwithstand the communication security challenge [27]. Transactions can also\
    \ be validated at\napplication layer as presented in [62]. These authors have\
    \ used the block chain technology\nto enforce security measures on sensor generated\
    \ data at the application layer. Recent\ndevelopments in computation platforms\
    \ such as cloud, edge and fog computing can also\nbe utilized to add security\
    \ layers to an IoT system. Hardware, software and data protection\nschemes can\
    \ be realized at these platforms. Susceptibility of data to interference and\n\
    other security threats are likely to be reduced if data are processed near the\
    \ device as in\nedge or fog computing. These innovations can also enhance energy\
    \ efﬁciency of nodes\nand reduce bandwidth competition between signals and more.\
    \ These anomaly detection\ncan be executed either at an end node or gateway level.\
    \ Each end node can be set to\nmonitor all sensors connected to it and detect\
    \ anomalous properties, in real-time. However,\nthe limited processing and storage\
    \ capacity of these nodes might inhibit executing resource-\nintensive and precise\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms. End node anomaly detection are also\nunable to\
    \ identify communication anomalies that could possibly happen at the network\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n19 of 31\nlayer. A rather optimal anomaly identiﬁcation\
    \ can be executed at the gateway node level.\nAs discussed in Section 5, gateway\
    \ nodes have more storage and computational power\nand can serve as a more reliable\
    \ and robust security enforcement platform. In addition\nto its resource abundance,\
    \ the gateway node can also be set as a centralized anomaly\ndetection point for\
    \ both device and communication level anomalies. Such computation\ncapability\
    \ is well-suited to most smallholder agriculture applications as it eliminates\
    \ the\ncloud communication and computation needed for further decisions. The fact\
    \ that measures\ncan be taken in (near) real-time and using the already established\
    \ wireless communication\nmakes fog computing at the gateway level more promising.\
    \ For a bigger WSN setup with\nseveral and heterogeneous sub-networks and multiple\
    \ gateways, a more comprehensive\ncentralized anomaly detection can be carried\
    \ at higher level such as in cloud computing.\nAdvanced analytical and problem\
    \ identiﬁcation algorithms can also run efﬁciently on\nsuch platforms. A hybrid\
    \ edge and cloud computing based anomaly detection in WSN is\npresented in [140].\n\
    6. Discussion\nIn our analysis, we found a signiﬁcant growth in research effort\
    \ in IoT and WSN\napplications for smallholder agriculture over the last decade,\
    \ with speed-up in the years\n2017–2019. Not much of this work has been deployed\
    \ in farm plots. Figure 10 shows\ndistribution of works in smallholder agricultural\
    \ application domains on different WSN de-\nployment environment over the last\
    \ decade. Most work was conducted only experimentally\nand much remains to be\
    \ done in actual deployment setting.\nAdvances in hardware, software and communication\
    \ technology as well as increased\nequipment availability are reasons for the\
    \ increased research interest. In real and outdoor\ndeployment, the gateway and\
    \ sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially when a wider\nspatial coverage\
    \ is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the farm without risk of loosing\n\
    of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement should consider stable power\
    \ provision\nand a trustworthy communication channel. In doing so, range and network\
    \ lifetime\nmaximization shall be given utmost considerations. We found no projects\
    \ that addressed\nthese requirements over a wide time span. Moreover, data and\
    \ system validation appear\nnot to receive much attention. Long-term behavior\
    \ of deployed systems and sensed data\nquality must be evaluated repeatedly to\
    \ demonstrate system reliability and usefulness. This\nwill establish conﬁdence\
    \ in any decision-making that utilizes the generated information.\nOnly a few\
    \ of the projects were found to have longer implementation and validation\nperiods\
    \ [26,73,79,82,83,88,93]. The remainder were pilot studies or proofs of concept\
    \ with a\nshort experimentation period of maximally a month.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\

    \ and utilization, also in rural areas. This implies that ac-\ntive research is\
    \ less challenged and equipment may be more readily available. Nonetheless,\n\
    research in Africa also shows promise. An interesting factor is the heterogeneity\
    \ of research\non the African continent. There seems to be an equivalent effort\
    \ in all types of smallholder\napplication, possibly due to equivalent importance\
    \ and impact on farm productivity. We\nalso observed, only 29% of the total projects\
    \ in Africa are deployed in real-ﬁeld while 50%\nand 21% are experimental and\
    \ simulation executed, respectively. This is also similar in\nAsia but Latin America\
    \ has better real-ﬁeld execution.\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, PA is researched\
    \ most widely and usually for the purpose\nof irrigation management. Smallholder\
    \ farms apply, however, mostly rain-fed practices\nwith limited or minimal irrigation\
    \ and so there is potential mismatch between farmer infor-\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n21 of 31\nmation needs and produced information. The ubiquity of PA and\
    \ irrigation management\nmay imply two things. First, WSN and IoT implementation\
    \ and management is easy in\na conﬁned area, as in plot-level deployment. It can\
    \ provide precise data readings with a\nsmall number of sensors and few controlling\
    \ nodes. Secondly, the application will not fully\nutilize the data provided by\
    \ the technology. Further research on advanced data analysis is\nneeded as all\
    \ four domains may have signiﬁcant effects towards sustainable agriculture.\n\
    Even though irrigation is important for sustainable and productive farming, it\
    \ is not\nalways a solution to the poor productivity of these farmers. Instead,\
    \ research must focus\nmore on other key parameters such as soil nutrient monitoring\
    \ or early draught prediction.\nSuch can address the urgently needed data by smallholder\
    \ farms and assist sustained and\nefﬁcient utilization of those. Soil moisture\
    \ data, for instance, can be used beyond irrigation\ndecisions such as in pest\
    \ management, decisions in appropriate sowing time and crop\ntype to plant [98,120,121].\
    \ Information from weather sensors may help farmers to take\nappropriate measures\
    \ in situations like drought.\nExisting projects utilize off-the-shelf equipment.\
    \ Furthermore, in smallholder farmer\ncommunity, technical maintenance and operation\
    \ skills may not sufﬁce. In dense de-\nployment schemes, the equipment costs may\
    \ also become a sustenance bottleneck. Such\nconditions could affect farmer interest\
    \ to use the technology. Hence, it is important to\nconsider alternatives like\
    \ producing custom-made devices by integrating components that\nare open source,\
    \ simple, affordable and easily accessible. Non-proprietary Arduino or\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi (RPi) based node micro-controllers can ﬁt to this purpose. In addition to\
    \ being\nopen source, these hardware allows researchers to experiment with and\
    \ program for a ﬁt\nto the speciﬁc needs. A serious online community support also\
    \ adds to the advantage of\nusing open source devices. Table 4 shows micro-controllers\
    \ used among reviewed projects.\nAs can be seen in the table, most of the works\
    \ used Arduino and RPi while in rare cases\nothers like Atmega, MICA and Waspmote\
    \ are mentioned. Proprietary hardware comes\nwith pre-installed ﬁrmware that avoids\
    \ programming and other technical skills at the\nexpense of ﬂexibility and ease\
    \ of customization.\nTable 4. Major micro-controllers used in smallholder agriculture\

    \ following partic-\nipatory research where community members are included from\
    \ conception to execution\nand working with active projects in the area could\
    \ also be possible alternatives.\nOur review brings to light that Zigbee (35%)\
    \ and WiFi (31%) WSN communication\nstandards are common in smallholder agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Figure 10, most work\nis in indoor or experimental simulations,\
    \ and this explains the preference for these stan-\ndards. The signiﬁcant set-up\
    \ complexity and cost, limited area coverage and network\ninstability in Zigbee\
    \ and WiFi makes them less-ﬁtting to smallholder agriculture deploy-\nments. In\
    \ Figure 6, we show that recent experiments work with other WSN communication\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n22 of 31\ntechnologies, such as the Long range (LoRa)\
    \ LPWAN standard. This indicates future\npossibilities and rooms for emerging\
    \ WSN standards to be of use in the agriculture domain.\nFor gateway–server communication,\
    \ about 80% of the reviewed work used cellular\ncommunication while wired approach\
    \ is used in rest. They are legitimate choices for the\nsmallholder environment\
    \ though cellular communication is often unreliable. An alternative\nis to use\
    \ a micro-SD in the gateway for storage and later reading, to eliminate data loss\
    \ as\nwell as transmission mismatches. Edge computing (data processing at the\
    \ control layer) is\na recent technology that shall also be considered when communication\
    \ between gateway\nand server is challenged [142]. Communication standards used\
    \ for node–gateway and\ngateway–server among the reviewed works is presented in\
    \ Table 5.\nMost reviewed papers focused on establishing the WSN and on data acquisition.\n\
    The other computing actions deﬁned in Section 5.5 were discussed sparsely, as\
    \ shown in\nTable 3. Speciﬁcally, the data curation and quality assurance phases,\
    \ which are crucial for\nreliable information generation, were not specially described\
    \ in these works. Neither was\nmuch reported on usability of the collected data\
    \ or how such was used in real application\nanalysis. In the few papers that reported\
    \ on data analysis, approximately half used simple\ndata analysis, and a quarter\
    \ statistical and AI analysis. The typical analysis method\nreported was the determination\
    \ of a threshold value. For instance, to set an irrigation\ntrigger, a pre-deﬁned\
    \ soil water content level is checked against the sensor-derived soil\nmoisture\
    \ level. Or such could trigger an alert message regarding possible crop disease\
    \ that\nreaches farmers when the pre-set alert condition is met [60]. Although\
    \ these approaches\nare simple and require few computing resources, more precise\
    \ and robust applications\nrequire soft-coded implementations based on holistic\
    \ and exhaustive scenarios that are\nhard to handle with pre-sets. Proactive applications\
    \ of such type can also support reliable\nprediction and forecasting, which is\
    \ needed in many agriculture applications [23]. These\nmechanisms allow farmers\
    \ to acquire information ahead of time and be aware of what to\nanticipate on.\
    \ We postulate they may even come with a learning effect. This in turn will\n\
    prepare farmers for risks and spur them to explore alternative coping mechanisms.\n\

    \ also needs to reﬂect the spatio-temporal dynamics that\nexist on the farm and\
    \ that can only be met with advanced computational algorithms,\nsuch as using\
    \ AI. The work by [100] is a good example in this context. The authors\ndeveloped\
    \ an agricultural prediction system, capable of generating future complications\n\
    based on sensor-derived time-series data processed with the auto-regressive integrated\n\
    moving average (ARIMA) model. This model deploys probabilistic analysis of time-series\n\
    properties of parameters of interest. The forecasted information is veriﬁed against\
    \ pre-\nloaded information to generate decision support information. Threshold\
    \ values change\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n23 of 31\non the basis of forecasts,\
    \ and when the farmer makes adjustments such lead to periodical\nupdates of thresholds.\
    \ New computing paradigms such as integration of AI and IoT (AIoT)\nare expected\
    \ to revolutionize the data acquisition and processing in IoT applications. Future\n\
    research shall assess how such innovations can be effectively utilized in agriculture\
    \ domain.\nAmong the reviewed works, 31 papers reported on their computing environment\
    \ with\n70%, 21% and 9% in cloud, private and edge computing, respectively. Mostly\
    \ some cloud\nenvironment is used as a persistent data repository and/or data\
    \ visualization platform.\nAbout 30% of the 70% projects involving cloud computing\
    \ utilized SaaS and IaaS such\nas The Things Network or Things Speak. Web-based\
    \ data presentation is the preferred\nmode in these works (57%), while 26% and\
    \ 17% utilized mobile applications and SMS data\npresentation, respectively.\n\
    The use of low-cost sensors creates a need to calibrate sensor readings, following\n\
    speciﬁc implementation requirements. Only some projects were found to report on\
    \ calibra-\ntion issues [87,94]. Since most projects were experimental, sensors\
    \ were used as provided\nby vendors, in off-the-shelf mode. Implementations that\
    \ use sensor readings for actual\ndecision-making, however, shall take appropriate\
    \ test and calibration measures before\ndeployment and production. Humans are\
    \ indispensable in the process of sensor parameter\ninterpretation but none of\
    \ the projects that we reviewed appeared to have considered the\nhuman skills\
    \ component. We recommend that any platform should integrate humans with\nsensors\
    \ for inclusive perception and validation.\nWe also observed that soil chemical\
    \ composition and nutrient sensing is almost nonex-\nistent in reviewed work.\
    \ Research and industry communities need to collaborate to ﬁll\nsuch gaps and\
    \ produce sensors for the unaddressed essential farming factors.\n7. Challenges\n\
    Any innovation or technological intervention comes with challenges and opportuni-\n\
    ties. Especially when the application is in a remote or resource-constrained location\
    \ where\nliteracy and awareness are minimal, various limitations may prevent successful\
    \ implemen-\ntation. This requires a thorough study and analysis of these factors.\
    \ The following are some\nof these challenges that our analysis reveals.\n•\n\
    High investment costs: The investments needed to produce and deploy a WSN and\n\
    IoT system are signiﬁcant, which may not be affordable by most projects. Hardware\n\
    costs are those for gateway and sensor nodes, recurring IoT connection, and power\n\
    provision, while open source tools exist, realistic deployments may need commercial\n\
    cloud applications such as SAAS, which are a substantial cost factor.\n•\nLittle\
    \ awareness: Stakeholders in the agri-chain typically have limited knowledge of\n\
    recent technological innovations. This is a cause of resistance against acceptance\
    \ of\nIoT and sensor technology.\n•\nLow availability of tools and skilled personnel:\
    \ Most IoT and WSN equipment are\nnot produced in the developing countries. Operation\
    \ and maintenance of devices may\nrequire considerable knowledge, language and\
    \ professional skills. Such are often thin\non the ground and this hinders full\
    \ deployment and utilization.\n•\nRegulatory and policy gaps: Telecommunications\
    \ of many developing world coun-\ntries have no clear regulatory arrangement of\
    \ WSN and IoT implementations. The al-\nlowed Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\
    \ (ISM) radio frequency range for WSN com-\nmunication is not set yet and no other\
    \ rules exist governing the use of frequency\nbandwidth. As a result, investments\
    \ are risky because node communication may\nbecome blocked or interrupted.\n•\n\
    Poor interoperability: IoT and WSN have evolved rapidly over the past ﬁve years.\n\
    A number of tools and platforms exist that can be used for the realization of\
    \ the\ntechnology. There is however no standard yet that guarantees their interoperability.\n\
    •\nLow data quality: WSN deployment often comes with exposure to extreme physical\n\
    conditions. This may cause reading faults and poor data quality. Sensor data reliability\n\
    may also be compromised by deployment errors. Incorrect calibration, inconsistent\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n24 of 31\npower supply and unreliable communications can\
    \ result in data errors such as outliers,\ndrifts and missing values.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    Most smallholder farms are known to be resource-constrained and remotely located\n\
    which causes sincere challenges in in situ data collection. Consequently, farm-related\n\
    data are unavailable or is only found in small quantity, often fragmented or outdated.\n\
    This leads to uninformed farming practices, and consequently poor production and\
    \ low\nyields. IoT and WSN may prove to be an assisting tool in addressing information\
    \ needs.\nMonitoring crops and soil at farm-scale and in (near) real-time with\
    \ reasonable cost may\nhelp to determine the investments needed to upscale productivity.\n\
    The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for actual use of\
    \ IoT and WSN\nin more data-intensive approaches to smallholder farm practices.\
    \ We focus on how the\ntechnology can acquire farm-speciﬁc and (near) real-time\
    \ data. The kinds of collected data,\nthe different application domains and the\
    \ alignment of research needs are also assessed.\nDesign and implementation considerations\
    \ in smallholder applications are explored as well.\nIoT and WSN have been put\
    \ in practice in large-scale commercial farms but seldomly\nin smallholder farming,\
    \ in spite of general agreement on its adaptability with reasonable\ncost [130,143,144].\
    \ Some promising demonstrations of this have been published. Existing\nworks are\
    \ mostly experimental and may still lack robustness for actual implementation.\n\
    Actual implementation requires trust in and robustness given that failure may\
    \ come with\nunacceptable economic consequences. As a result, investments should\
    \ be kept in check,\nand the usability of free and existing communication platforms\
    \ shall be explored with more\ncase studies and real applications.\nMoreover,\
    \ as most smallholder farms are nestled in poor infrastructural conditions,\n\
    ﬁt-for-all solutions do not typically work. Future work shall consider the poor\
    \ infrastruc-\nture and limited solution space that needs to be contextualized.\
    \ The limited or speciﬁc\nparameters being monitored in most existing projects\
    \ also imply that there is considerable\nroom to integrate additional physical\
    \ and chemical sensors. They may monitor weather,\nsoil, crop, pests, or provide\
    \ other data on farm inputs, their integration is essential. WSNs\nand related\
    \ technological interventions shall be implemented to set an acceptable stan-\n\
    dard of smart smallholder agriculture. Diverse and affordable sensors relevant\
    \ to farm\nproductivity, and applied in mass, may become essential.\nSecurity\
    \ is a topic mostly overlooked and in its early stage of research in IoT and WSN\n\
    application to agriculture [145,146]. Particularly, no work is found that addresses\
    \ this issue\namong the reviewed projects. The need to integrate various communication\
    \ standards,\ndevices and data as well as data accuracy and availability need\
    \ in smart agriculture makes\nsecurity a challenge. Some of the security issues\
    \ speciﬁc to agriculture and discussed in\nSection 5.6 exacerbate the severity\
    \ of the security challenge in this domain. Security threats\nexist at different\
    \ levels of the IoT ecosystem and encompass both physical and logical\nissues.\
    \ Data integrity, reliability, accuracy and availability are qualities expected\
    \ of a smart\nagriculture system. All these create extra demands and opportunities\
    \ for a rigorous and\nin-depth researches addressing the matter. The constrained\
    \ nature of IoT and WSN devices\nis a setback to practice complex and promising\
    \ security solutions and this needs to be\naddressed while proposing security\
    \ measures.\nAs most of the reviewed projects are rooted in the prototype stage,\
    \ no discussion on\nhow such security concerns are addressed is found. Most anomaly\
    \ detection algorithms\nrely on some well-deﬁned data and compare current situation\
    \ against this to detect any\ndeviation or changes. This requires a spatially\
    \ and temporally detailed and reliable data.\nHowever, the absence or sparsity\
    \ of farm-level information to use as a reference is a concern\nwhen it comes\
    \ to smallholder farms. The fact that anomalies and other security problems\n\
    potentially inculcate to unreliable decision support system urges for more attention\
    \ to the\ndomain. Hence, it is necessary to know the existing security vulnerabilities\
    \ and create\nmechanisms to mitigate the effects of incidents. Equal emphasis\
    \ shall be given to security\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n25 of 31\nmeasures as to\
    \ the deployment of the agriculture system. Selection of appropriate commu-\n\
    nication standards, layer/s of security measures implementation, level of security\
    \ need\nand appropriate security measures identiﬁcation shall be executed parallel\
    \ to the system’s\nfunctionality development. The usability of existing security\
    \ and anomaly management\ntechniques for IoT and WSN in agriculture is an open\
    \ challenge yet to be investigated.\nInteroperability and data abstraction are\
    \ two functionalities a data curation operation\nin agriculture application needs\
    \ to offer. Seamless integration of all data coming from\nvarious sources and\
    \ data conversion shall be handled on this phase. Open standards such\nas the\
    \ ones by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide common languages known\nas\
    \ sensor model language (SML) to deﬁne sensors and their processes, semantically\
    \ and\nreduce the syntactic heterogeneity of data representations [147]. Such\
    \ open standards\nsupport efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and provide\
    \ seamless integration of\nheterogeneous devices. It also allows users to interact\
    \ or access both raw and processed\ndata and reduce latency time. We believe relying\
    \ on such standard for any WSN setup\nhelps in avoiding and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of data anomalies. Such tools shall be explored\nmore and adopted to incorporate\
    \ these functionality to the data curation phase which is\nmissing in all the\
    \ reviewed works. The work by [93] is an exception which reports on\nutilizing\
    \ the OGC sensor web enablement (SWE) platform for their WSN setup.\nCost and\
    \ quality are important factors that inﬂuence such implementations and\nprojects\
    \ must focus on affordability and efﬁciency of technological innovations. The\
    \ in-\ntegration of human and electronic sensors can be one way to achieve these\
    \ requirements.\nA data acquisition platform that utilizes the most abundantly\
    \ found and precise sensors\nwithin the smallholder community, humans, along with\
    \ artiﬁcial sensors is effective for\na whole-sided and inclusive perception.\
    \ Humans’ read data can also be used to validate\nthe accuracy of sensors’ read\
    \ data. Geo-referencing sensing nodes is important to obtain\nlocation-speciﬁc\
    \ data and monitor farm-level spatial variability which is relevant in most\n\
    agricultural applications such as PA. Most applications reviewed, however, lack\
    \ such\ncapability and this remains a research gap to be ﬁlled.\nOne must note\
    \ the inherent limitations of IoT and WSN, which include limited spatial\ncoverage\
    \ and data quality. These need to be recognized and addressed. Consequently,\n\
    there is a need to augment with other data acquisition approaches [63,66,84,148].\
    \ Such a\ndata infrastructure must address required spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ This can be done\nwith complimentary approaches. The use of RS and participatory\
    \ tools alongside IoT and\nWSNs is of particular importance [66,149,150].\nCitizens’\
    \ abundance and capacity to generate as well as validate sensors’ acquired\ndata\
    \ could play a critical role at all stages of the farm data generation: from collection\
    \ to\nlogical decision making and interpretations. Human observations can be integrated\
    \ with\nWSNs to elevate the limited spatial coverage and enrich the data basket.\
    \ Some community\nmembers can also be used to communicate a rather complex ﬁndings\
    \ to farmers in a simple\nand usable forms [151]. These open doors to incorporate\
    \ citizens in any technological\ninterventions to bring about fully-ﬂedged, reliable,\
    \ sustainable and consumable product.\nSoil characteristics speciﬁcally are important\
    \ factors for improved farm yields and\nare must-have determinants for any intervention.\
    \ The spatial and temporal variability of\nsoil attributes needs to be understood,\
    \ both before and during the crop season, to help\nfarmers take appropriate measures.\
    \ Based on the ﬁndings of this paper, the authors are\nundertaking soil physical\
    \ and chemical properties monitoring and data collection research\nthrough sensors\
    \ deployment in two districts located in northern Ethiopia. An experimental\n\
    investigation result of the work is to be communicated soon.\nFunding: This study\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    \ date\nAbstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a thriving technol-\nogy in almost\
    \ all ﬁelds of human life to make their lives easy.\nSmart Agriculture is one\
    \ of the IoT applications on which\nfarmers are widely switching to improve productivity\
    \ and re-\nduce labor costs. As IoT involves the Internet, data transmis-\nsion\
    \ technology creates the possibility of privacy/security\nbreaches concerning\
    \ users’ data. The cybercrime rate may\nalso increase in IoT-based agriculture\
    \ (IoTA). Thus there\nmust be ready concerning digital forensics in IoTA. Various\n\
    review articles are available regarding the emerging cyber\nattack, cybercrime,\
    \ and forensics challenges in IoT appli-\ncations like smart home, smart city,\
    \ smart healthcare, smart\ngrid, smart retail, smart supply chain management,\
    \ and smart\nagriculture, while a few review articles on IoTA security and\nforensic\
    \ challenges. This review paper is focused on IoTA\nsolutions and their security\
    \ and forensics challenges. The\nsystematic literature review method has been\
    \ used for this\nstudy which includes articles published from 2011 - 2021.\nThis\
    \ article has brought the limelight on IoT architecture\nand its application in\
    \ agricluture (IoTA) to emphasize on\nits introduction, architecture, challenges\
    \ and issues related\nemerging cybercrimes and digital forensics. At the end,\
    \ this\nreview paper discusses various challenges in securing IoTA\nsystems and\
    \ presents future directions for research.\n1 Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) refers to interconnected things. Karl\nSteinbuch, a German computer science\
    \ pioneer, said, \"In a\nfew decades, computers will be interwoven into almost\
    \ ev-\nery industrial product .\" IoT is frequently used in the do-\nmains like\
    \ healthcare, food and restaurant industry, travel\nand tourism industry and library\
    \ services, smart home, smart\nae-mail: santoshi.phdcs21@nfsu.ac.in\nbe-mail:\
    \ parag.rughani@nfsu.ac.in\ngrid, smart retail and smart agriculture [1] [2].\
    \ The IoT mar-\nket value projected to reach from 157 billion USD in 2016\nto\
    \ 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco predicted that by 2030,\n500 billion objects\
    \ would be connected and linked up to the\nInternet [3].\nFood Requirement will\
    \ increase by 70% more to supply\nfor an estimated population of 10.1 billion\
    \ by 2050, says the\nUN Food & Agriculture Report [4]. The volatility of food\n\
    prices, climate change and timely harvest forecasts are cru-\ncial to counteract,\
    \ which has a major impact on the economy\nand is closely linked to issues such\
    \ as malnutrition, and un-\ndernourishment, [5] [6] [7]. By 2050 the global population\n\
    of 9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding [8].\nTo deal with these\
    \ challenges and meet the need of future\nfood requirements. Agriculture 5.0 implies\
    \ that farms are\nfollowing Precision Agriculture principles and using equip-\n\
    ment that involves crewless operations and autonomous de-\ncision support systems\
    \ using the IoTA, robotics and AI [9].\nMany developed and developing counties\
    \ are widely using\nIoT based Agriculture (IoTA). It is observed that the 26.7%\n\
    global population and approximately 58% of the Indian pop-\nulation rely on agriculture\
    \ and farming to meet their liveli-\nhood. The Economic Survey of India 2020-21\
    \ report stated\nthat in FY20, the total food grain production was recorded at\n\
    296.65 million tonnes by India [10]. This high dependency\nmakes agriculture a\
    \ signiﬁcant factor in improving higher-\nyielding and better quality agriculture\
    \ and farming produc-\ntion. These higher-yielding and better quality requirements\n\
    are being taken with the help of technology. Many of the\ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries are transforming into\nIoTA.\nIoTA is a smart technique where the\
    \ researchers have\nbeen working on inventing tools and techniques for improv-\n\
    ing the production and quality in agriculture and farming.\nIn general, technologies\
    \ like GPS (Global Positioning Sys-\ntem), sensor networks and remote sensing\
    \ are used in IoTA\n2\n[11][12]. IoTA is helpful for various farm activities like\
    \ crop\nmonitoring, automated irrigation system, insect/pest moni-\ntoring, warehousing\
    \ of food, supply chain and smart farming\nsuch as livestock management, livestock\
    \ disease monitoring,\ndairy management [13]. Many IT organizations like Google,\n\
    Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel, Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE,\nHello Tractors, Farm\
    \ 2050 and Qualcomm are continuously\ndeveloping IoTA solutions that would have\
    \ a huge economic\nimpact [14]. The authors also estimate 2.7−6.2 trillion each\n\
    year, which will bring evolution in agriculture [15]. At present,\nmore than 26\
    \ billion smart devices are in circulation, while\na forecast says that this number\
    \ will triple within the coming\n5-6 years [16].\nThis paper presents a review\
    \ of different papers on IoT\ndevices supporting agricultural use, focusing on\
    \ the applica-\ntions, the emerging cyber attack and cyber crime (CACC)\nand Digital\
    \ Forensics (DF) challenges. With many farms\n(plant and livestock, small and\
    \ large) using automation and\nremote, networked sensors to monitor and manage\
    \ the op-\nerations, from watering and feeding, to growth and health\nmonitoring,\
    \ this is a sector that has not traditionally been as-\nsociated with high risks\
    \ of computer and network security\nproblems impacting their operation. And when\
    \ security is,\nat best, an afterthought, the enterprise can be at risk. Since\n\
    the number of IoTA solutions will rise, the number of crimes\non smart agriculture\
    \ may also increase soon. Sensitive data\nprocessed through IoTA could be a luring\
    \ means for hacking\ntargets by cyber criminals targeting the agricultural sector\n\
    for ﬁnancial gain, cyber warfare, activist/political purposes,\nor to obtain intellectual\
    \ property and technological advance-\nments. This study aims to review the work\
    \ done in the ﬁelds\nof IoTA based CACC and DF challenges as listed below.\n–\
    \ Introduction to IoTA\n– IoTA architecture\n– IoTA applications and IoTA solutions\n\
    – Existing vulnerabilities in IoTA\n– Existing and novel cyber crimes on IoTA\n\
    – DF challenges in IoTA.\nThe review article is organized in following way: Sec-\n\
    tion 2 includes the review selection methodology. Section 3\ncontains a literature\
    \ review has been taken through the IoTA\narchitecture. IoTA application and available\
    \ IoTA solutions\nto existing vulnerabilities in IoTA. Existing and novel cyber\n\
    crimes were pertaining to IoTA and DF challenges in IoTA.\nOur views on DF challenges\
    \ are discussed in Section 4. This\nreview paper has discussed directions for\
    \ future research and\nchallenges in IoTA tools and techniques. This article is\
    \ con-\ncluded in Section 5.\n2 Review Selection Method\nIn this article, we have\
    \ followed the article selection method-\nology using the method Systematic Literature\
    \ Review (SLR)\nshows a representation in Fig 1. The ﬁrst step was to choose\n\
    reputed journals for selecting articles from there. The second\nphase of SLR was\
    \ the article published between 2011-2022.\nThe third step was to include articles\
    \ related to IoT/IOTA\nonly. The fourth phase was to check articles related to\
    \ IoTA\nor IoT architecture, security, CACC and DF challenges. All\nthe articles\
    \ fall in these categories that have been included\nin the systematic review.\
    \ The search focused on the scientiﬁc\nresearch publishers like Elsevier, IEEE\
    \ Xplore, Springer, Wi-\nley, MDPI, Inderscience, Taylor, Francis and UGC care-listed\n\
    journals. We considered the articles which were published\nbetween 2011 and 2021.\
    \ We have also considered a few\nwhitepapers, statistical survey papers and websites\
    \ to refer\nIoTA based tools. We have considered various IoTA relevant\nkeyword\
    \ search to ﬁnd relevant articles. The keywords were\n(\"Internet of Things\"\
    \ OR \"IoTA\" OR \"AIoT\" OR \"IoT based\nAgriculture Tools OR Appliance\" OR\
    \ \"Unmanned Ground\nVehicle (UGV)\" OR \"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\")\nAND\
    \ (\"Internet of things based Agriculture\" OR \"Precision\nFarming\" OR \"Smart\
    \ Agriculture\" OR \"e – Agriculture\" OR\n\"Smart Farming\" OR \"Smart Livestock\
    \ Management\" OR\n\"Livestock Disease Monitoring\" OR \"Smart Cattle Manage-\n\
    ment\" OR \"Food Monitoring\" OR \"Crop Monitoring\" OR\n\"Plant Monitoring\"\
    \ OR \"Smart Irrigation\" OR \"Automatic\nIrrigation\" OR \"Disease Monitoring-Detection\"\
    ) AND (\"Dig-\nital Forensic in IoT\" OR \"Challenges OR Issue in IoT\").\nIn\
    \ this SLR method, we could identiﬁed 111 articles\nfor the study. In these articles\
    \ 91 were journal papers, 12\nconference papers and 8 book chapters. We have referred\
    \ 3\nwhite papers and 10 websites additionally. The selected pa-\npers were analyzed,\
    \ considered and classiﬁed for IoTA and\nfarming applications of the method used\
    \ in this review for\narticle selection.\n3 IoT Based Agriculture (IoTA)\nIoTA\
    \ is an automated functioning system in which devices\ncommunicate over the Internet\
    \ and function according to the\nrequirements of the resources. The IoTA refers\
    \ to the usage\nof the Internet to connect sensors, Single Board Computer\n(SBC)\
    \ and servers. The Sensors sense the agriculture envi-\nronment status (plants,\
    \ crops, animals and their relative pa-\nrameters such as soil moisture, soil\
    \ nutrient ingredients, pest\nimages, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,\
    \ crop\nstatus, animal health and reproductive system). The sensed\ndata is to\
    \ be sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Ar-\nduino, Raspberry pi and others\
    \ decide according to set con-\nditioned values and update the agriculture status\
    \ using the\n3\nFig. 1: Review Article Selection Method\nInternet. IoTA is used\
    \ for increasing the quality and quan-\ntity of agriculture production so that\
    \ the agriculture can be\nmonitored or operated from remote places and the action\
    \ be\ntaken by IoTA as per the requirement of the plants and an-\nimals. It reduces\
    \ the monitoring and labor costs [17]. IoTA\nallows devices to operate automatically\
    \ so that the chores in\nagriculture can be monitored and controlled remotely.\
    \ IoTA\nis being adopted widely to reduce labor costs and improve\nproductivity.\
    \ IoTA applications can manage land, animals,\ncrops and farms without human intervention.\
    \ IoTA is also re-\nferred to as smart agriculture[18], precision agriculture\
    \ [19]\n[20], digital farming [21], smart farming[22] [23], digital\nagriculture\
    \ [24].\n4 IoTA Architecture\nIn general, there are ﬁve layers in IoTA architecture\
    \ i.e. ap-\nplication layer, middleware layer, network layer, edge layer,\nphysical\
    \ layer. The illustrated with the diagram as shown\nin Fig 2 IoTA architecture\
    \ with its basic components such\nas sensors, SBC, gateway, cloud and the Internet\
    \ [25] [26]\n[27].\nIn [28] by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\n\
    Telecommunication Standard Sector) had been supposed four\nlayered architecture\
    \ for holistic IoT. The ﬁrst is device layer\nwhich interacts with hardwares like\
    \ sensors, actuators, RFID\ntags and GPS in IoT. The second is network layer which\n\
    performs functions such as networking, communication and\ntransport. The third\
    \ layer is service and application support\nlayer and the topmost layer IoT application\
    \ layer, which\nmanages IoT applications.\nIn IoT World Forum 2014, [29] has presented\
    \ 7 layer\nbased IoT achitecture reference model by the combination\nof three\
    \ layered and ﬁve layered IoT architectures. The lay-\ners included are physical,\
    \ connectivity, edge computing, data\naccumulation, data absraction, application\
    \ and collaboration\nand processes. The physical layer manages things in IoT,\n\
    connectivity layer is resposible for communication and pro-\ncessing units. The\
    \ edge computing layer analyze data ele-\nment and transforms it. The data accumulation\
    \ layer works\nas a storage of data to be recived or sent. The abstraction\nlayer\
    \ performs aggregation and access of the data. The ap-\nplication layer controls,\
    \ performs analytics and presents re-\nport of the functionality of IoT regarding\
    \ present environ-\nment. The collaboration and process layer includes people\n\
    and business processes.\n[30] proposed a three layerd based IoTA architecture.\n\
    The authors adopted the concept of fog coputing and cloud\ncomputing in this architecture.\
    \ In which, the ﬁrst layer named\nas IoT layer includes IoTA devices such as sensors,\
    \ drones,\nSBC and actuators. The sensor measures the environmental\nvariables\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\nactivates the actuator to\
    \ perform respective function in the\nagriculture. Second is the fog layer where\
    \ IoTA devices are\nconnected with gateways by LoRaWAN or other network.\nThe\
    \ third layer is cloud layer which deals with API’s to man-\nage the data received\
    \ from the agricultral environment.\n[31] proposed four layer based IoTA architecture.\
    \ In this\nIoTA architecture, the perception layer is consists of phys-\nical\
    \ devices like sensor, actuators and microcontroller. The\nsensors fetch the data\
    \ of sensed agriculture environment and\nstored into the local server; Subsequently\
    \ after error anal-\nysis precised data is uploaded to the cloud. The network\n\
    layer performs abstraction of raw data recieved from the per-\nception layer and\
    \ trasnsmit on to the upper layers. The sen-\nsors are connected distinct communication\
    \ newtwork com-\nmunication technologies such as wireless networks like 4G,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee. The middleware layer provides\ninter-communication between\
    \ network layer and application\n4\nlayer. It also manages resourses and services\
    \ and performs\noperation the remote database. The application layer is re-\n\
    ceives data from middleware layer. It consists of interface\nmethods and communication\
    \ protocols such as MQTT, AMQL\nand CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts\
    \ it using soft-\nware internally and stores data on the local machine for fu-\n\
    ture use.\n[26], presented IoTA architecture where the 3 main layer\nare discussed.\
    \ Those layer are platform layer, edge layer and\ncommunication layer. The plateform\
    \ layer perform raw data\ncollection IoTA hardwares sensing by the agricultural\
    \ envi-\nronment. The edge layer performs decision making based on\ndata merging\
    \ and processing the sensors data. The commu-\nnication layer comunicates between\
    \ gateway and cloud.\n[32], discussed three layer based IoTA architecture. The\n\
    authors considered device layer, network layer and applica-\ntion layer. They\
    \ did not include middleware layer in their\narticle.\n[33] discussed two categories\
    \ of architecture based on\nholistic IoT applications. That IoT architectures\
    \ were three\nlayered and ﬁve layer according to different vendors of IoT.\nAuthor\
    \ raised the challenge of standarization issue of the\nIoTA architectures.\n[34]\
    \ discussed a common IoTA architecture. The archi-\ntecture consists of three\
    \ layers namely IoTA hardwares, com-\nmunication technologies and data processing\
    \ and storage.\nIoTA hardwares included sensors, actuators, embedded sys-\ntem\
    \ with processor, communication modules, memory, I/O\ninterfaces and battery power.\
    \ The authours have discussed\nvarious communication technoloies such as ZigBee,\
    \ Z-Wave,\n6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various parameters as li-\ncensed, transmission\
    \ distance, frequncy and data rate.\n[35] discussed drawbacks of tradional cloud\
    \ based archi-\ntecture and to overcome the drawbacks they proposed edge\nand\
    \ fog computing architecture for IoTA. The shortcom-\nings of existing system\
    \ were as high energy consumption\nduring agricultural data transfer from and\
    \ to the cloud and\nhigh network traﬁc. The proposed architecture reduces the\n\
    load over cloud layer which minimize the energy consump-\ntion, network traﬁc\
    \ and latency for IoTA applications and\nservices. The proposed architecture consists\
    \ of four layer\nsuch as IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer and cloud\nlayer.\
    \ The IoT sensor layer responsible for all IoTA har-\nwares deployment.The edge\
    \ layer performs computation of\nsensors/actuators data at the edge of the network.\
    \ The fog\nlayer is responsible for process and analyze complex data\nreceived\
    \ from IoTA sensors through edge layer. The cloud\nlayer provides higher scalibility\
    \ and on demand computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing.\n\
    [36] proposed user centrinc IoTA architecture which con-\nsists of three main\
    \ layers perception layer, communication\nlayer and control layer. The perception\

    IoTA architecture. This proposed architecture contains six\nlayers namely device\
    \ layer, network layer, session layer, ap-\nplication layer, cloud layer, business\
    \ layer. The business layer\nconsists of several business modules where the information\n\
    can be accessed as per the business nature.\nThe comparision in various IoTA architectures\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Table 1. This table includes total number of layers\nused\
    \ in IoTA, layers name and function of each layer.\nAfter the reviewing the previous\
    \ work there is given lay-\nered architecture based on 5 layers as physical layer,\
    \ edge\nlayer, fog layer, application layer and cloud layer. Each lay-\ners described\
    \ in the cronological way are as follows:\nPhysical Layer: The Physical Layer\
    \ consists of physi-\ncal devices like sensors, actuators, SBC (Single Board Com-\n\
    puter) and a gateway in the farm [38]. This layer senses and\ncollects agricultural\
    \ environment based speciﬁc data through\nsensor devices. Based on the speciﬁc\
    \ type of sensor, the col-\nlected data is about location, temperature, orientation,\
    \ mo-\ntion, vibration, acceleration, humidity and chemical changes\nin the air.\
    \ The information is then passed to the Network\nlayer for its secure transmission\

    \ Layer [40].\nEdge Layer: The edge layer collects raw data from the\nphysical\
    \ layer and proceeds to the network layer based. It\nmerges sensor data and processes\
    \ it [26]. It enables the ac-\ntuators to what the conditioned value has been\
    \ set in the\nﬁrmware of IoTA. For instance, in a smart irrigation sys-\ntem,\
    \ the conditioned unit value for the soil moisture sensor\nis 1000; thus, if the\
    \ sensor provides less than 1000 soil mois-\nture values, the actuation will start.\
    \ Some of the commu-\nnication technologies namely 802.11*, Sigfox, LoRaWAN,\n\
    NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\nZ-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC used\
    \ in IoTA are categorised\nbased on distinct parameters like licenced spectrum,\
    \ trans-\nmission distance, type of network used, frequency, and data\nrate [41]\
    \ [38] [32] [42] [34]. The communication technol-\nogy allows the hardware (in\
    \ the physical layer such as sen-\nsors, actuators and the controller) to communicate\
    \ by wired\nor wireless medium [43]. According to[44], Low-Frequency\nCommunication\
    \ (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to a\nlack of infrastructure. However,\
    \ some prominent high com-\nmunication technology used in IoTA is IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Zensy\nWave, Long Term Evolution (LTE), LongRange (LoRa), Near\nField Communication\
    \ (NFC), Ultra-wideband (UWB) and\nothers. These communication technologies help\
    \ to commu-\nnicate hardwares like sensors, actuators in IoTA devices present\n\
    in the farm for are also commonly used in smart villages\nfor different applications\
    \ like postharvest management, cat-\ntle health monitoring and others.\nFog Layer:\
    \ Fog layer is a virtual cloud which recieves\ndata from edge layer and transmits\
    \ it to the upper layers. It\nprocess and analyze complex data received from IoTA\
    \ sen-\nsors through edge layer. It includes fog nodes like gateways,\nrouters,\
    \ entry points, distinct fog servers. The fog nodes sit-\nuates between end devices\
    \ and cloud data centers. This layer\nworks as a local cloud server.It provides\
    \ intra-networked\ncommunication for the IoTA system. By this means the IoTA\n\
    devices communcates through low frequencies and activates\nthe actuators. The\
    \ raw data collected from the sensors do not\nneed to travel frquently over the\
    \ Internet. Hence, the concept\nof fog layer overcomes the drawback like high\
    \ latency be-\ncause of real time control and mitigates security risk about\n\
    data transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone.\nThus, the compromisation\
    \ of the Internet will lead to com-\nplete obstruction IoTA system [30].\nApplication\
    \ Layer: Application layer consists of vari-\nous communication protocols such\
    \ as HTTP, MQTT, CoAP,\nAMQP and XMPP [45] [46]. This layer provides a graphical\n\
    user interface of the agricultural environment information\nprocessed by the Middleware\
    \ layer in encrypted form and in-\nternally decrypts this information using software,\
    \ thus stores\ndata for further use. The application layer monitors the agri-\n\
    cultural environment and suggests actions to be performed\nto get better throughput\
    \ using IoTA. The applications im-\nplemented by IoTA like smart crop monitoring,\
    \ smart irriga-\ntion, smart fertilizer/pesticides sprinkling, smart greenhouse\n\
    and livestock monitoring. The data is uploaded to the Cloud\nfor data warehousing\
    \ through these applications. Some of\nthe Cloud-based IoTA platforms are AgroCloud,\
    \ AT&T M2X\ncloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox,\nERMES, FIWARE,\
    \ freeboard, Google, GroveStream MACQU,\nMobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed,\
    \ SmartFarm-\nNET, ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx, Phytech\n[45][46].\n\
    Cloud Layer: The cloud layer works as a centerlised data\nstorage for the IoTA\
    \ system. It receives data through appli-\ncation layer from the fog layer and\
    \ stores it for long time us-\nage. It provides greater scalibility and on demand\
    \ computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing [35].\n5 IoTA\
    \ Applications\nThe IoTA applications have become very popular among\nfarmers\
    \ due to their efﬁciency and productivity. The IoTA\nsolutions are designed to\
    \ help farmers with time efﬁciency,\nimproved productivity and better monitoring\
    \ of daily agri-\ncultural tasks. Some of the sensors are soil moisture sen-\n\
    sor, temperature sensor, distance sensor, direction sensor,\nlivestock’s temperature\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, ultrasonic\nsensor, acoustic sensors, leaf sensors,\
    \ stem sensors and fruit\nsize sensor. These sensors have speciﬁc functionality\
    \ in IoT\napplications like identifying environment temperature, crop\nstatus,\
    \ soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and de-\ntection [14]. The IoTA\
    \ applications are classiﬁed into two\ncategories crop and livestock based applications.\
    \ Crop based\nIoTA applications are smart irrigation, frost protection, com-\n\
    post management, pest monitoring, pest controlling, weed\ndetection, chemical\
    \ control, seedbed preparation to reseed-\ning, yield analysis and mapping, arable\
    \ farming, spraying,\nvehicle and machinery control, crop assistant, weather con-\n\
    dition, soil quality, agricultural drones UAV, smart green-\nhouse. The applications\
    \ based on livestock management based\nare livestock monitoring, livestock identiﬁcation,\
    \ milking au-\ntomation technology, early disease detection, offspring man-\n\
    agement and care, smart poultry farming.\n[47] discussed the Niger research project\
    \ to highlight\nthe development of IoT-based smart city and smart village\nfor\
    \ the fulﬁllment of sustainable development goals (SDG-\n2030) 11 and 9 for revolution\
    \ through smart cities and smart\nvillages in Niger.\n[23] mainly focused on holistic\
    \ deﬁnitions of IoTA and\nits applications such as crop health, weeding and spraying,\n\
    planting sowing, seedbed preparation to reseeding, planting\nfrom the air, harvesting\
    \ from the ﬁeld, drones for a ﬁeld,\nyielding analysis and mapping.\n7\n[48] described\
    \ the types of agricultural UAV (Harvesting\nUAV, Spraying UAV, Mapping UAV, Sensing\
    \ UAV), includ-\ning their area of application in terms of seeding, planting\n\
    seed, monitoring, detecting weed, mapping, infestation and\nspraying pesticides/fertilizers,\
    \ forecasting and controlling.\n[49] have discussed IoTA applications that have\
    \ utilized\nmodern technologies like WSN, RFID, Cloud Computing\nand end-user\
    \ applications. These IoTA devices are found\nto be automotive, cost and time-efﬁcient\
    \ for the farmers.\nThe authors have also presented IoTA technologies and the\n\
    classiﬁcation of IoTA applications of monitoring activities.\nThe applications\
    \ are irrigation and water quality monitor-\ning, soil monitoring, weather monitoring,\
    \ farm monitoring),\ndisease and pest control, greenhouse production, automa-\n\
    tion and precision, agricultural machinery and crop manage-\nment with other applications\
    \ in smart farming as smart cat-\ntle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery,\
    \ smart aquaponics\nand smart beehive monitoring.\n[50] did a comprehensive study\
    \ about crop data man-\nagement in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular\n\
    analysis of various crop data management applications and\ntheir main features\
    \ based on parameters, namely software,\ncompany, headquarters and relevant features\
    \ .\n[13] discussed various solutions used in IoTA. Few of\nIoTA solutions are\
    \ water quality monitoring, farm land mon-\nitoring system, greenhouse envioronment\
    \ monitoring sys-\ntem, automated hydroponic system, smart mashrrom farm,\nsmart\
    \ vegitable storage, smart vineyard monitoring system\nand others. They compared\
    \ IoTA monitoring and control\nsystems based on parameters like a gateway, sensor\
    \ and ac-\ntuator, communication system, storage, user interface, ex-\nperiment\
    \ nature (outdoor/indoor), plant name/type, advan-\ntages of the existing system\
    \ and weaknesses in the current\nsystem.\n[46] did a thorough review of IoTA applications.\
    \ Based\non the usage, they classiﬁed IoTA applications into two types,\nIndoor\
    \ (i.e., crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic) and out-\ndoor (arable land, orchard).\
    \ Some other works include IoT\nbased smart greenhouse and precision farming applications\n\
    [51]. In Europe, there is ongoing work on IoTA based re-\nsearch projects [52].\
    \ The classiﬁcation of holistic IoTA ap-\nplications and various IoTA solutions\
    \ are tabulated Table 2\nrespectively.\nIn the few states of India like Orisa,\
    \ Madhya Pradesh\nfaced the problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this\n\
    situation, IoTA based alarming system has been designed.\nWhenever trespassing\
    \ of the elephants is observed, the smart\ncamera detects the suspected activity\
    \ and an alarming sys-\ntem is activated [53].\nIn the next section, we have specialized\
    \ in CACC and\nDF challenges and issues in the IoTA realms.\n6 Existing Emerging\
    \ Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crime\n(CACC) in IoTA\nCyber attack (CA) is a attack\
    \ based on pertaining to digi-\ntal devices and its nework to disturb distrupt\
    \ or destroy the\nservices of the system. The other aim be perform data theft\n\
    or malicious intension of the attackers. As the CA gets re-\nported into the police\
    \ is called as Cyber Crime (CC). CC is\nan unlawfull activity againsts making\
    \ subotage, disruption\nor harm pertaining to any digital device, network, data,\
    \ or\nany living being.\nA senior vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admit-\n\
    ted that cybercriminals have been looking for farming infor-\nmation.\nDue to\
    \ the interconnectivity of IoTA devices with the\ninternet, there are the possibility\
    \ of various CACC. The at-\ntackers could drive Sprout into a ditch or a hedge\
    \ or prevent\nit from working. In [2] [74], cyber-attack taxonomy included\nvectors,\
    \ viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, ad-\nware, zero-day vulnerability,\
    \ Stuxnet, exploit toolkit, Bot-\nnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing and\
    \ spooﬁng,\nside channel, DoS, DDoS, RFID based attacks. These cyber-\nattacks\
    \ have included case studies for IoT smart devices.\n[45] the authors covered\
    \ the simulation tools for the vulnera-\nbility assessment of holistic IoT devices,\
    \ i.e., Bevywise IoT\nSimulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon U-One, Simple IoT Simula-\n\
    tor, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. The authors suggested se-\ncurity measures and\
    \ precautions for the user only. They had\nemphasized cyber-attacks and security\
    \ measures as well.\nIoT has been emphasized greatly since the 90s, when it\n\
    was proposed as an idea of interconnecting different elec-\ntronic devices through\
    \ various technologies. However, dur-\ning the past decade, IoT has rapidly developed\
    \ without con-\nsidering the profound security goals and challenges involved.\n\
    Consequently, the IoTA will face various emerging CACC.\nAccording to Statista,\
    \ by 2025 there will be 75 billion IoT-\nconnected devices [75]. Due to the rapid\
    \ development, it im-\nplies that checking for the security and vulnerability\
    \ assess-\nment is impossible. The absence of a complete trust zone can\nbe detected\
    \ in the microcontrollers used for IoTA devices.\n[76], ForeScout IoT Enterprise\
    \ Risk Report clearly sug-\ngests that by 2018, two-thirds of enterprises will\
    \ experience\nIoT security breaches. It has captured a broader spectrum of\nthe\
    \ security vulnerabilities and attacks in IoT systems. Their\nclassiﬁcation is\
    \ unique compared to the other classiﬁcations\nas it divides the different attacks\
    \ into four distinct classes;\nPhysical, Network, Software, and Encryption attacks.\
    \ The\nsame statement is true for an IoTA system, where the IoTA\ndevices can\
    \ be attacked physically or at its network or to the\napplications. Similarly,\
    \ the attacks can be tried on encryp-\ntion schemes, as IoTA is implemented using\
    \ various existing\nnetwork technologies.\n8\nTable 2: IoTA Solutions and Techniques\n\

    \ emerging Cyber Attacks (CA) in\nIoTA based on each IoTA layer. The CA on the\
    \ physical\nlayer was autonomous system hijacking/disruption, irregular\nmeasurement,\
    \ node capturing and sleep deprivation. Edge\nlayer based attacks were forged\
    \ for control actuator, boot-\ning, ﬂooding and signature wrapping attack. The\
    \ network\nlayer attacks were DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing\nattacks,\
    \ signal disruption, Radiofrequency (RF) Jamming at-\ntacks, side-channel attacks,\
    \ malware injection, and Botnet\nattacks. An application layer based CA were phishing,\
    \ ma-\nlicious scripts, DoS, or DDoS. Cloud computing attacks and\ncyber terrorism\
    \ are other types of attacks have been dis-\ncussed.\n[78], covered network layer\
    \ based CA in IoTA. These\nattacks are replay attacks on Zigbee protocol that\
    \ can create\ndiﬁculties to implemnting other protocols. The smart farm,\nwhich\
    \ uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks like pass-\nword cracking and evil\
    \ twin access point, which allows at-\ntackers to get credentials by creating\
    \ a rogue access point.\nKey reinstallation attack, which exploits 4-way handshake\n\
    in WPA2, which was responsible for securing modern wiﬁ.\nARP spooﬁng attack where\
    \ an attacker fakes the MAC ad-\ndress of the gateway and convinces the victims\
    \ to send frames\nto the fake address except the destination address. DNS spoof-\n\
    ing attacks where the trafﬁc is directed to the fake website\ncause altered DNS\
    \ records.\n[79],discussed UAV oriented CA and its consequences.\nUAV is an automated\
    \ aerial vehicle IoTA system used for\ncrop monitoring, pesticides or chemical\
    \ sprinkling, etc. The\nCA is integrity exploitation of UAV or IoTA devices. The\n\
    consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole stand-\ning crop in the ﬁeld,\
    \ ﬂood the crop, and sprinkle the pesti-\ncides in excess quantity. If such attacks\
    \ are widely coordi-\nnated, they can take the place of agro-terrorism. The authors\n\
    discussed other UAV based CA, such as radio frequency\njamming, malicious code\
    \ injection, MITM, DoS/DDOS, ran-\nsomware attacks, etc. These attacks can tamper/modify\
    \ the\ncommunication devices.\n[80], [81], [82] [49] discussed emerging CA aspects\
    \ in\nIoTA system on the different levels such as physical secu-\nrity of devices\
    \ due to the harsh nature of climate and nat-\nural disaster in IoTA, emerging\
    \ cyber threats like endpoint\nattacks, phishing, third party attack, supply chain\
    \ attacks,\nransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart\ndevices.\
    \ They speciﬁed risks or dangers in terms of data\nbreaches, data integrity, privacy\
    \ breaches in business secrets,\nrisk of crypto-jacking, cyber-physical attacks,\
    \ state-sponsored\nattacks, highjacking, or threats to autonomous drones or trac-\n\
    tors.\n[83] described the several issues in IoTA caused by the\nInternet connectivity\
    \ for data processing and covered param-\neters based on CA in IoTA. In the IoTA\
    \ system, at the phys-\nical layer, the emerging CA such as unintentional physical\n\
    modiﬁcation in hardwired, temporary or permanent damage,\nautonomous system hijacking,\
    \ autonomous system disrup-\ntion, optical deformation, rough treatment, power\
    \ depletion\nof battery, sensor weakening as per the sensor aging, node\ncapturing,\
    \ adding a malicious node and sleep deprivation.\nIn sleep deprivation attack\
    \ there is draining the battery of\nthe smart devices. Network layer-based emerging\
    \ CA dis-\ncussed as DoS/DDoS, data transit attack, and routing attack.\nThe emerging\
    \ CA at the edge layer can be forged controls\nfor actuators, gateway-cloud request\
    \ forgery, forged mea-\nsure injection, booting, unauthorized access, MITM, signa-\n\
    ture wrapping, and ﬂooding. In the sequence, the concern-\ning CA in the application\
    \ layer is phishing, malicious script,\nDoS, and DDoS attacks. The author emphasized\
    \ the current\nstate of security in smart agriculture as the researcher and\n\
    developer leave default security features for the MQTT and\nCoAP since the researchers’\
    \ probability keeps it disabled.\nMoreover, IoT device manufacturers use IoTs\
    \ to keep them\ninvisible to the security feature, validation processes, col-\n\
    lecting, transferring, or storing phases or failure checks. This\npaper further\
    \ illustrates these invisible parameters for the in-\nvisible security features.\
    \ The authors also suggested a future\nenhancement in the perspective of better\
    \ security in smart\nagriculture and farming applications.\n[84] presented a literature\
    \ survey on CA pertaining to\ndistinct components of IoTA. They have discussed\
    \ attacks\nbased on hardwares like sensors, controllers, RFID tags. Few\nattacks\
    \ based on protocol such as RFID, NFC,bluetooth, wiﬁ,\nZigbee, 6loWPAN, and protocols\
    \ on application layer.\n[85], authors classiﬁed CA in IoTA based on the phys-\n\
    ical layer, network layer, middleware layer, and application\nlayer. The CA on\
    \ the physical layer is such a RF jamming,\nside-channel attack, which aims to\
    \ gather unauthorized in-\nformation regarding the implementation description\
    \ of the\nIoTA system using monitoring parameters of hardware like\nan electric\
    \ current or voltage [86]. Attacks on the network\nlayer are DoS, MITM, and cloud\
    \ computing attacks. At-\ntacks regarding data are data leakage, ransomware, cloud\n\
    data leakage, and misconﬁguration. Application layer based\nattacks are software\
    \ update based attacks such as malware\ninjection, buffer overﬂow and SQL injection.\
    \ Other attacks\nthey have covered are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which\n\
    refers to false data fabrication.\n[87], authors are concerned that exposure of\
    \ personnel’s\nprivate information, social engineering, cyber espionage, and\n\
    agroterrorism to any CA is a potentially severe threat that\nshould be seriously\
    \ and carefully considered.The possibil-\nity of cyber terrorism in the agriculture\
    \ sector is known as\nagroterrorism.\n[88], authors warn the cyber threat risk\
    \ in IoTA, for internet-\nbased automatic functional devices, like smart crop\
    \ sprayers,\ndrones, UAV in agriculture can be hacked.\n10\nCybercriminals are\
    \ looking to ruin the particular revenue\nbusiness, where agriculture plays a\
    \ very important role in\nrevenue generation for the individual and the country.\n\
    [89] homeland security of U.S. department mention the\nconcern potential cyber\
    \ threats and vulnerabilities in IoTA.\nTheir released report disscussed different\
    \ technologies in\nIoTA sucha as on farm device, location or remote sensing\n\
    technologies and machine learning. This report highlights\nhypothetical scenarios\
    \ pertaining to CACC. Likewise IoTA\nbased sensors could be the signaﬁcant cause\
    \ for CACC is-\nsues. A warning from the UK government and FBI states\nthat Cyber\
    \ criminals could exploit ﬂaws present in the IoTA\nhardware which were used to\
    \ plant and harvest crops, such\nas automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic\
    \ harvesters\nto disrupt the GDP growth, food production of the country\n[90].\
    \ According to an FBI report, CA in IoTA has slowed\ndown the agriculture processing\
    \ system and also interrupted\nthe email communication and website-based administration.\n\
    A cyber crime by disrupting process dairy facilities can quickly\nspoil the result.\
    \ FBI has released a list of cybercrime in agri-\nculture. Where the means of\
    \ cybercrime was a ransomware\nattack, where data was stolen and encrypted, and\
    \ criminals\ndemanded ransom, cyber actors may perceive cooperatives\nas lucrative\
    \ targets with a willingness to pay due to the time-\nsensitive role in agricultural\
    \ production. The goal could be\nto disrupt the seed and fertilizer supplies.\n\
    Various IoT based CACC has been already observed and\nsevere consequences had\
    \ faced by users. [91], the Mirai bot-\nnet in 2016 is an example of DDoS attack\
    \ which was launched\non IoT devices in smart home on a large scale. Similar CA\n\
    are possible in the context of IOTA. The consequences of\nsuch attack can disrupt\
    \ normal functionality of distinct mod-\nules of an individual IoTA farm and leverage\
    \ for interrupt-\ning legitimate cyber services in other areas. [92], the IoTA\n\
    system can be compromised and controlled by utilising cen-\ntral malicious system\
    \ know as Botnet of Things. [93], a CA\nnamed as Night Dragon could steal big\
    \ amount of informa-\ntion from various petrochemical companies. [94], an another\n\
    incidence of devastation using phishing attack attemped on\nGerman steel mill\
    \ for gaining access on network plant pro-\nduction system of the mill ofﬁce.\n\
    The increase in CACC in IoT based devices has become\nthe concern in smart agriculture\
    \ where these CACC can bring\ndevastation to IoTA, crop demage, animal production\
    \ loss\nand vast ecconomical loss.\nIn 2020, JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat\
    \ processing\ncompanies, paid $11 million as a ransome to resolve a CA;\nmalware\
    \ attack that shut down Australian and New Zealand\nwool sales [95]. The US agriculture\
    \ ﬁrm AGCO was af-\nfected production by a ransomware attack. President Greg\n\
    Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc observed losses be-\ntween $40,000 to $200,000\
    \ caused by cyber-criminals [96].\nIn the US, Jan 2021, faced the business lost\
    \ $9 million as cy-\nber criminals inﬁltrated a farm’s internal network via com-\n\
    promised administrative credentials. The total loss derives\nfrom the temporary\
    \ shutdown of operations.\nCo-founder of agricultural ﬁrm Muddy Machines, Chris\n\
    Chavasse, states that the IoTA based devices can be attacked\nand hacked. Their\
    \ study says that IoTA sector is at risk.\nIn industrial espionage, revenge-minded\
    \ employees can\ndamage farmers having a treaty in contract farming with that\n\
    particular company. In the case of IoTA, the farmer/contractor\nmay face severe\
    \ loss due to linked cyber security breaches or\nattacks on the contract provider\
    \ company. Subsequently, se-\nvere data loss/breaches or sabotage might be found\
    \ in IoTA.\nVarious emerging CACC, its consequences on IoTA and un-\nfavourable\
    \ affects on the farming are summarised in Table\n3.\nAgribusiness is suspected\
    \ of attacking and disturbing,\ndisrupting, or destroying its existing functional\
    \ system due\nto its fragility in nature, as IoTA is a hackable and crack-\nable\
    \ system. Consequently, various unsolved cases could be\nfound in the court of\
    \ law. Thus various challenges are being\nfaced in evidence collection and DF\
    \ investigation regarding\nIoTA. The various challenges are discussed in the next\
    \ sec-\ntion.\n7 Digital Forensics Challenges in IoTA\nDF is a superset of cyber\
    \ forensics, which includes forensics\nof all digital devices like computers,\
    \ mobile phones, PDAs,\npalmtops, storage devices, obscure devices like gaming\
    \ de-\nvices, recording devices, digital cameras, IoTs and many\nmore. DF consists\
    \ of the systematic propelled and scientif-\nically proven approach for preservation,\
    \ collection, valida-\ntion, identiﬁcation, analysis, interpretation, documentation\n\
    and presentation of digital evidence [100]. DF is a conven-\ntional technique\
    \ as the law enforcement acknowledges that\nmodern day life includes a distinct\
    \ of devices where IoT is at\nthe top of the list of digital devices. The IoT\
    \ can be exploited\nby criminal activity [101].\nThe IoTA is a subset of IoT.\
    \ It includes a sensor, gate-\nway, network, Internet and the cloud. Thus IoTA\
    \ also in-\nherits properties of DF challenges belong IoT. We have in-\ncluded\
    \ a few articles to discuss various DF challenges and\nissues in IoTA. According\
    \ to the principle of exchange given\nin 1934 by Dr. Edmond Locard (1877-1966),\
    \ \"Every action\nleaves a trace.\" Any action of a crime commiter cannot occur\n\
    without leaving a trace. The Locard’s principle was also de-\nﬁned in the perspective\
    \ of conventional crime that is proved\nin the digital world. The same rule is\
    \ equally applicable in\nthe IoTA.\n11\nTable 3: Emerging CACC and Its Consequences\

    \ into six categories: identiﬁcation, collection, preserva-\ntion, analysis, correlation,\
    \ attack attribution and presenta-\ntion. These challenges are further divided\
    \ into its subclasses.\nThe authors discussed DF challenges for various IoT appli-\n\
    cations except for IoTA.\nThe following section discusses the work done in the\n\
    area of IoT/IoTA forensics. In this article We have classi-\nﬁed related articles\
    \ into different categories, some of which\nare discussed below.\n7.1 Jurisdictions\n\
    [103] identiﬁed the challenge presented as the devices cross\nthe borderline of\
    \ jurisdictions. Likely, data in transit between\nIoTA devices and globally distributed\
    \ cloud computing plat-\nforms cross these borderlines more frequently. It is\
    \ unclear\nunder which law the case should be prosecuted i.e., the de-\nvice jurisdiction,\
    \ the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage\njurisdiction. For this reason,\
    \ it is necessary to create an in-\nternational commission that updates the current\
    \ legislation\nand can deﬁne uniform procedures in IoT DF [102] [104].\nThe same\
    \ jurisdiction challenge stands for IoTA too.\nAccording to [105], DF is an interdisciplinary\
    \ process of\ninvestigation where cooperation and coordination between\nnations\
    \ is indeed required for transnational law enforcement.\nThe Council of Europe’s\
    \ Convention on Cybercrime formed\na committee, \"Council of Europe, 2001,\" for\
    \ harmonizing\nprocedural and substantive laws related to digital crime and\n\
    evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states\nto create standard\
    \ systems of substantive and procedural laws\nprohibiting cyber-criminal conduct\
    \ and investigating crimi-\nnal conduct with computer devices with respective\
    \ to each\ncountry. This treaty includes the number of signatories coun-\ntries\
    \ was 63; the few of 63 counties are USA, Canada, Ger-\nmany, France, Great Britain,\
    \ Italy, Hungary, Israel, Japan.\nThe other high technology nations have not signed\
    \ the treaty\nat the convention. That countries are like the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation, Peoples Republic of China, India, the Islamic Repub-\nlic of Iran, Mexico,\
    \ Pakistan and South Africa) [103].\n7.2 Search and Seizure\nSearch and seizure\
    \ is an essential step in any DF examina-\ntion. However, detecting the presence\
    \ of IoT evidences is\nquite challenging as the IoT devices are designed to work\n\
    passively and autonomously. In most cases, when an IoT de-\nvice is identiﬁed,\
    \ there is no documented method or reliable\ntool to collect residual pieces of\
    \ evidence from the device in\na forensically sound manner [106].\n[107] concerned\
    \ that the standards by which the evi-\ndence is in DF investigations could have\
    \ been altered to ac-\ncommodate the changing nature of the cloud computing en-\n\
    vironment. We believe that the alalogical statement holds for\nIoTA DF investigations\
    \ too. Beyond technical challenges,\nprivacy is a signiﬁcant issue to consider\
    \ when analyzing and\ncorrelating collected data, primarily as most IoT sensors\
    \ col-\nlect innate personal information [106].\n[108] authors reviewed various\
    \ DF limitations and chal-\nlenges in IoT. Those limitations include impracticability\
    \ of\ncloning of all data by a service provider, requirement of ex-\ncess time\
    \ in data acquisition and other challenges.\n7.3 Identiﬁcation\nIn the term of\
    \ IoT based DF investigation, the question arises\nof whether to investigate devices\
    \ or data in the case of cloud\nor else the devices may be viewed as a metadata\
    \ aspect of\nthe data or if the reverse is true, the cloud computing ar-\nchitectures\
    \ (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and\ndistribution among different\
    \ countries and continents [109].\nAs IoTA is one of the applications, IoT may\
    \ face the same\nchallenge in the identiﬁcation phase of the investigation.\n\
    7.4 Preservation\nIn evidence, the acquisition is to maintain the integrity of\n\
    the evidence collected. The most frequently used technique\nfor computers and\
    \ phones is calculating a hash to assure\nintegrity. The question arises about\
    \ calculating hash at the\ntime of creating an image. The problem here is the\
    \ lack of\navailable tools that can prevent accidental changes in the IoT\nbased\
    \ evidence [103].\n7.5 Challenge in imaging\nThe challenge of the acquisition\
    \ is to decide whether to cre-\nate an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.\
    \ In the\ncase of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a\nworking\
    \ copy/image of the storage media and seal the actual\nmedia to avoid accidental\
    \ alteration in the actual evidence.\nSince the endpoints in IoT crime scenes,\
    \ excluding comput-\ners and smartphones, may store minimal or sometimes no\n\
    information, creating an image of those IoT nodes is com-\nplicated. If a component\
    \ stores some information, then it\nshould be technically possible to create an\
    \ image of that de-\nvice. The suggested way is to create images from available\n\
    sources [106].\n7.6 Analysis and correlation\nThe huge amount of data collected\
    \ in diverse type of IoT\ndevices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end\
    \ to end\n15\nanalysis of residual evidence. IoTA is a frequently evolv-\ning\
    \ technologies. Hence different Operating Systems (OS),\nvarious ﬁle formats and\
    \ distinct cryptographic methods. The\nExisting digital forensics tools or methodologies\
    \ do not sup-\nport for data extraction from emerging IoTA devices [102].\n7.7\
    \ Absence of Standard IoTA Architecture\nThe different standards for IoTA architecture\
    \ are followed\nby manufacturers, the lack of cooperation, and the many pe-\n\
    culiarities are the terrible thing about the IoT working within\nthe same area\
    \ of application. Due to the lack of standardiza-\ntion of IoTA architecture,\
    \ the smart irrigation system facil-\nitated by one manufacturer and the smart\
    \ crop monitoring\nsystem by another manufacturer can have problems in coor-\n\
    dination. The absence of a standard IoTA architecture chal-\nlenges the design\
    \ of the standard DF framework.\n7.8 Malware\nIn [97], the authors discussed various\
    \ research challenges in\nIoT forensics. The challenges are the complexity and\
    \ versa-\ntility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture, ev-\nidence\
    \ contamination due to overwriting data, and use of\nconventional tools forensics\
    \ tools.\n8 Discussion\nIoTA is the highest trending technology in human life\
    \ to\nmake life much easier, faster and more comfortable. Accord-\ning to Cisco\
    \ Internet Business Solution Group (IBSG), IoT\nwas born between 2008 - 2009,\
    \ with an average of 1.84 IoTs\nper person; the propositional logic can be derived\
    \ from this\nIBSG statistics that people will possess 10 IoTs per person\non an\
    \ average, in the coming age. Thus this ﬁeld requires\nthe most potential to research\
    \ in the IoTA domain to better\nits characteristics and work on its challenges.\n\
    This literature review is focused on IoTA. The rationale\nof this study is helpful\
    \ to understand IoTA architecture and\nits working environment from the physical\
    \ layer to the ap-\nplication layer from different authors’ perspectives. We have\n\
    included IoTA architecture, emerging CA, cyber crimes and\nDF investigation challenges\
    \ about IoT based Agriculture (IoTA).\nWe have done a comprehensive study about\
    \ the DF chal-\nlenges and issues that can have obstacles in this growing era\n\
    of IoTA and possible crime and related that scenario pre-\ncisely with IoTA. Many\
    \ challenges are discussed in previous\npapers. Those challenges include Jurisdiction\
    \ at IoT crime\nscenes, lack of available tools and documentation methods,\npreservation,\
    \ imaging, evidence analysis and correlation. There\ncan be future work on these\
    \ challenges, so the data must\nbe presentable in a court of law. In this review\
    \ work, we\nleft out elaborative discussion about all the IoTA based ap-\nplications,\
    \ deﬁnitions for IoT sensors, protocols, communi-\ncation technology, vulnerabilities,\
    \ cyber-attack, cybercrime,\ncybersecurity and DF, which can be added in the subsequent\n\
    study.\nThe concerning point of a literature review is that the\nauthors’ statement\
    \ was based on assumptions. The articles\nwere not found assured about CACC issues\
    \ in IoTA solu-\ntions. These weaknesses of the IoT system could be tested\nfor\
    \ being assured CACC. Consequently, the manufacturer\nand security experts would\
    \ have saved their time in ﬁnding\ncyber threats for each IoTA device with all\
    \ aspects through\nproactive measures.\nAs a part of the study, there has been\
    \ found a scarcity of\narticles on IoTA based cyber crime and DF discussion. Thus\n\
    the researchers can further explore emerging CACC and DF\ninvestigation based\
    \ on IoTA in this article to have survey\nbased insights. There must be readiness\
    \ for IoTA based CC\nand DF investigation process for running an agriculture busi-\n\
    ness (agribusiness) and to justice for the victim. The fail-\nure to prove the\
    \ suspect will cause the encourage CACC\nin IoTA. Those CACC will be responsible\
    \ for disturbing,\ndisrupting, or even destroying the IoTA system in agribusi-\n\
    ness. It will directly demotivate agribusiness persons to con-\ntribute to crop\
    \ and food production. Subsequently, individ-\nual agribusiness people, consumers,\
    \ laymen, countries and\nthe nation’s GDP could be affected. Thus there is an\
    \ urgent\nneed to have readiness towards CACC and DF in IoTA. It is\nalso observed\
    \ that most experiments were not conducted in\na practice environment and seemed\
    \ just an assumption. To\nsolve more real-time problems, researchers should also\
    \ ex-\nperiment with these techniques on real-world solutions for\nIoTA.\n9 Conclusion\n\
    It is a concerning point in SDG 2030; goal 2 is to promote\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ to achieve zero hunger. To smart agri-\nculture and farming the practice effectively,\
    \ IoTA is applied\nin almost all ﬁelds of agriculture, such as farm monitor-\n\
    ing, irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, smart\
    \ poultry farm and so on. Existing smart\nfarming techniques are classiﬁed and\
    \ reviewed; from this\nstudy, it is understood that researchers should concentrate\n\
    more on readiness for emerging CACC for IoTA applica-\ntions or tools. The readiness\
    \ will provide non-interruptable\nservices. There is a need to be readiness for\
    \ DF investiga-\ntion for IoTA speciﬁcally which will make a robust judicial\n\
    system and strengthen the judicial system by catching the\nnatural suspected person.\n\

    using predicted soil moisture and rain forecast. Abstract The scarcity of clean
    water resources around the globe has generated a need for their optimum utilization.
    Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based on the application specific sensors’
    data acquisition and intelligent processing, are bridging the gaps between the
    cyber and physical worlds. IoT based smart irrigation management systems can help
    in achieving optimum water-resource utilization in the precision farming landscape.
    This paper presents an open-source technology based smart system to predict the
    irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like
    soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather
    forecast data from the Internet. The sensing nodes, involved in the ground and
    environmental sensing, consider soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The
    intelligence of the proposed system is based on a smart algorithm, which considers
    sensed data along with the weather forecast parameters like precipitation, air
    temperature, humidity, and UV for the near future. The complete system has been
    developed and deployed on a pilot scale, where the sensor node data is wirelessly
    collected over the cloud using web-services and a web-based information visualization
    and decision support system provides the real-time information insights based
    on the analysis of sensors data and weather forecast data. The system has a provision
    for a closed-loop control of the water supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation
    scheme. The paper describes the system and discusses in detail the information
    processing results of three weeks data based on the proposed algorithm. The system
    is fully functional and the prediction results are very encouraging. Previous

    Water scarcity is already affecting a part of the world and the situation is getting
    worse over time due to the increasing world population and fresh water demands.
    The current world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to be more
    than 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2013). The agriculture sector, particularly
    irrigation, consumes a major portion of the freshwater. Due to lack of cost-effective
    intelligent irrigation systems, developing countries are consuming more water
    in contrast to the developed countries for achieving the same yield. For example,
    India has approximately 4% of world’s freshwater resources to serve 17% of the
    world population; however, it takes 2–4 times more water for some of its major
    agri-produce in comparison to the other countries like China, USA (G. o. I. NITI
    Aayog, 2015). Therefore, there is a dire need to come up with advanced technologies
    based smart strategies and systems for effective utilization of fresh water. Gubbi
    et al. (2013) discussed an IoT framework with cloud centric storage, processing
    and analysis of the data received from ubiquitous sensors along with a decision
    support interface. Cruz et al. (2018) suggested a reference model for an IoT middleware
    platform that would support intelligent IoT applications. IoT based solutions
    are proving very helpful in many dimensions of the agricultural landscape (Sharma
    et al., 2016), and these intelligent solutions could also be fruitful in smart
    irrigation with optimum utilization of water. Soil moisture, precipitation, and
    evaporation are the essential parameters for designing a smart irrigation system.
    The precipitation and evaporation are important key factors, which influence the
    soil moisture. In geography and climatology, the wetness of soil is estimated
    by the proportion of annual (or monthly) precipitation and evaporation (Shang
    et al., 2007). Daily soil moisture can also be evaluated by the ratio of daily
    precipitation and evaporation in the above perspective. Precipitation is directly
    accessible in the routine weather reports; nonetheless, evaporation can be calculated
    using other metrological essentials. For evaporation, we use an empirical model
    given by Penman (Chen and Chen, 1993) (1) The entire evaporation depends on the
    thermodynamic evaporation and the dynamic evaporation , where depends upon the
    velocity of the land storm, air temperature, relative humidity of the air and
    UV radiation. To achieve water saving, irrigation system frameworks have been
    proposed based on various techniques, e.g., thermal imaging, Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI), direct soil water measurements, etc. Thermal imaging is a prominent
    technique for irrigation management and it is based on the shade temperature distribution
    of the plant. In this framework, the status of the water in the plant is checked
    over continuous intervals and irrigation is planned in view of the shade temperature
    distribution of the plant (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, CWSI based framework
    has been proposed for irrigation scheduling of the crops for efficient use of
    water. The observation of CWSI was first characterized more than 30 years ago
    (Idso et al., 1981). O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) proposed an automatic irrigation
    scheduling based on direct soil water measurement that utilizes water proficiently
    over manual irrigation system. Allen et al. (1998) suggested evapotranspiration
    (ET) based approach, which is an important parameter to decide crop irrigation
    needs influenced by climate parameters, e.g., solar radiation, relative humidity,
    temperature, wind velocity, and crop features such as phase of the crop growth,
    assortment and plant density, properties of soil, nuisance, and disease control.
    ET-based frameworks can save water up to 42% over time-based water irrigation
    scheduling (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Davis et al. (2009) conducted the investigations
    in Florida and verified that ET‐based watering scheduling controllers are more
    beneficial in term of cost, size and labor requirement for irrigation. ET-based
    irrigation system uses much less water as compared to scheduled practices. Viani
    et al. (2017) proposed a fuzzy logic-based decision support system based on farmer’s
    experience with the understanding of crop condition. This system provides more
    water saving over single-threshold and multi-threshold based irrigation scheduling.
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed an automated irrigation system using a wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module to save water in irrigation. In this system, a
    network of soil moisture sensors with controller has been installed in a crop
    field for real-time monitoring and irrigation control. Gill et al. (2006) suggested
    a method for soil moisture prediction using support vector machines based on air
    temperature, relative air humidity and soil temperature. Jaguey et al. (2015)
    developed irrigation sensor based on smart phone. For sensing soil moisture, the
    digital camera of smart phone is used to process RGB to gray for estimation of
    ratio between wet and dry area of soil. The ratio of wetness and dryness is transmitted
    via gateway to water motor controller. A Mobile Application (APP) is developed
    to control sensor activity (like wakeup) and to set sensor in sleep mode. Goldstein
    et al. (2017) proposed irrigation recommendations based on machine learning algorithm
    with support of agronomist’s encysted knowledge. It was found that the best regression
    model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) with 93% accuracy in prediction
    of irrigation plan/recommendation. The developed model is helpful to the agronomist’s
    irrigation management. Roopaei et al. (2017) proposed an intelligent irrigation
    monitoring system based on thermal imaging. The proposed technique uses thermal
    imaging camera mounted on Drone. An algorithm is developed using images processing
    techniques for identification of water requirement, Leaf water potential, and
    non-uniform irrigation, which are used for irrigation monitoring. Majority of
    the earlier irrigation systems do not consider the weather forecasting information
    (e.g., precipitation) while making irrigation decisions. It leads to a wastage
    of fresh water, energy and loss of crop growth (due to excess water) when a rain
    is followed immediately by the watering of the crop. To handle such cases, IoT
    based solutions can provide a better decision support for irrigation by utilizing
    weather forecasting information (e.g., precipitation) from the Internet. Further,
    the accuracy of weather forecasting is improving due to the advancement of satellite
    imagery technology. For effective and optimum utilization of fresh water in irrigation,
    it becomes essential to develop the smart irrigation systems based on dynamic
    prediction of soil moisture pattern of the field and precipitation information
    of upcoming days. This paper presents an intelligent system that predicts soil
    moisture based on the information collected from the sensors deployed at the field
    and the weather forecast information available on the Internet. The field data
    has been collected through a self-designed sensor node. The server-side software
    has been developed with node side connectivity along with information visualization
    and decision support features. A novel algorithm has been developed for soil-moisture
    prediction, which is based on Machine Learning techniques applied on the sensor
    node data and the weather forecast data. The algorithm shows improved accuracy
    and less error. The proposed approach could help in making effective irrigation
    decisions with optimum water usage. 2. Methods/Techniques used Prediction of soil
    moisture is vital for effective irrigation management system. The estimation of
    soil moisture depends upon evapotranspiration Hargreaves and Samani (1985) developed
    a method based on temperature and extra-terrestrial radiation to estimate ET0.
    It is expressed as (2) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax
    and Tmin = maximum temperature and minimum temperature (°C) and Ra = extra-terrestrial
    radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). Ritchie developed another method for estimation of ET0
    (Jones and Ritchie, 1990) based on temperature and solar radiation. It is expressed
    as (3) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum
    and minimum temperature (°C) and Rs = solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). When (4)
    Cobaner (2011) developed evapotranspiration estimation method based on Neuro-Fuzzy
    (NF) inference and found that the NF model (based on solar radiation, air temperature,
    and relative humidity) exhibits better accuracy than the combination of solar
    radiation, air temperature and wind speed. From state of art, it has been analyzed
    that prediction of soil moisture is possible using sensors placement at the field
    and weather forecasted data. So, we have considered evaporation of soil moisture
    based on air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and radiation.
    The parameters are considered for analyzing the soil moisture drain (change/difference)
    pattern based on the recorded data of soil moisture. An IoT based architecture
    (Fig. 1) has been proposed to collect, transmit and process the physical parameters
    (soil moisture, air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and
    radiation) of farming land along with the weather forecast information to manage
    the irrigation efficiently. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    based on a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
    (block diagram shown in Fig. 3 and pseudocode is discussed in Section 3.2.1) has
    been developed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-means clustering for
    estimation of difference/change in soil moisture due to weather conditions. It
    gives good accuracy and less Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Theobald, 1974; “Mean Squared
    Error, 2018’’) in the prediction of the soil moisture of upcoming days with the
    help of sensors data and the weather forecasting data. SVR model has been trained
    using data (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, radiation,
    and soil moisture difference) collected from field device shown in Fig. 2. The
    Soil Moisture Differences (SMD) of upcoming days have been predicted using trained
    SVR model and the predicted value of SMD is given as input for k-means clustering
    for improving the accuracy of soil moisture difference (centroid value of k-means),
    which is more accurate (Table 2) with less MSE (Table 3). The final predicted
    soil moisture (Table 4) has been used in the development of smart irrigation scheduling
    algorithm (Section 3.2.2) to efficiently utilize the natural rain (precipitation)
    information for effective irrigation. To visualize the predicted soil moisture
    of upcoming days along with precipitation information and to control (start and
    stop) the irrigation, a responsive web portal has also been developed (Fig. 4,
    Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download : Download full-size

    Planning Module. Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1997) is the
    modified version of Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Hearst et al., 1998), where
    the dependent variable is numerical in lieu of categorical. SVR is a non-parametric
    technique and allows the creation of nonlinear models. The SVR method utilizes
    kernel functions to generate the model. Some of the frequently used kernel functions
    are Polynomial, Linear, Radial Basis and Sigmodal. k-means clustering (Kanungo
    et al., 2002) takes a straightforward and simple methodology to group a given
    information set into a definite number of clusters. The objective is to find k
    centroids, one for each bunch. First, it divides n number of the objects into
    k non-empty subgroups/cluster, and then finds the cluster centroids (mean point)
    of every subgroup/cluster. Then it calculates the distances from every point to
    the centroids and allocate each object to a specific cluster where the distance
    is minimum from the centroid. The process iterates to re-assign the points and
    identify the centroid of the new clusters. 3. The proposed system 3.1. System
    architecture The architecture of proposed IoT based smart irrigation system is
    shown in Fig. 1. It has seven main components, viz., Field data collection device
    with relay switch (Standalone and WSN Scenario); Web service for collecting field
    sensor data; Web service for collecting weather information available online (Internet);
    Web service to control water motor; Soil moisture prediction algorithm; Responsive
    web based interface for real-time monitoring; IoT enabled motor pump. These components
    are grouped into three different layers, i.e. Data collection and transmission
    layer, Data processing & intelligence layer and application layer of IoT (Fig.
    1). These components are discussed in the following sections. 3.1.1. Field data
    collection device Depending on the field requirements, a standalone sensor node
    or a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes may be deployed. In standalone
    scenario field data collection device consists of four sensors, viz., VH-400 Soil
    Moisture sensor, Soil temperature sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor,
    and Ultraviolet (UV) Light Radiation sensor based on GUVA-S12SD and SGM8521 Op
    Amp. The output of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno, which is connected
    to Raspberry Pi (R-Pi). In R-Pi a program is written in Python language to hourly
    fetch the data from sensors and to store the data in SQLite database, which is
    synched with the server database using developed web service. For large farming
    area, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) scenario with ZigBee
    (Pandey et al., 2017, Gutiérrez et al., 2014) technology can be implemented in
    which multiple sensor nodes can be planted in the specified area. Each sensor
    node will consist of the sensors similar to the standalone device. The output
    of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno connected to ZigBee for sending data
    to Gateway Node (similar to the standalone device with ZigBee connectivity) that
    will aggregate the received data and store it locally in SQLite and also send
    the data to the server using web service. The current analysis (statistical analysis
    of predicted soil moisture and its accuracy is exhibited in Fig. 6, Table 3, Table
    5) has been done with the standalone device. The standalone device is shown in
    Fig. 2. Table 5. Comparison of correlation, R squared and MSE between soil moisture
    values based on the sensor data and the proposed algorithm. Parameter Predicted

    Fig. 6. Graphical representation of the results shown in Table 2. 3.1.2. Web service
    for field sensor data collection The Web service is written in PHP with a light
    weighted REST API to communicate the data between the field device and the server.
    The service is hosted on Apache (Web server) at server machine. The R-Pi sends
    the field data to the server using this web service. This web service can handle
    the network fluctuation/outage during synchronizing the data from the filed device
    to the server with the help of flag settings at the database level. 3.1.3. Web
    service for online weather data collection A web service has been developed in
    Python to collect the weather forecasting data. This web service also aggregates
    the weather forecasting data like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, UV Index
    and precipitation of different web forecasting portal like OpenWeather and AccuWeather
    using API of these portal (Weather API, 2012, API Reference, 2017). These portals
    provide the forecasted information in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The developed
    web service read the forecasted data (JSON format) of the specified location using
    API and store it in MySQL database at the server, which is considered in the prediction
    algorithm. 3.1.4. Soil moisture prediction algorithm An algorithm has been developed
    (Fig. 3) to predict the soil moisture based on field sensors data and weather
    forecasting data using support vector regression model and k-means clustering
    algorithm. The algorithm shows information regarding soil moisture of the upcoming
    days. It also provides irrigation suggestions, based on the defined level of soil
    moisture and predicted precipitation, to save water and energy. The generated
    information by algorithm and device is stored in MySQL Database at the server.
    The algorithm is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. 3.1.5. Responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring A responsive web based user interface is developed
    using PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap API for real-time monitoring and scheduling of
    irrigation activities (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The interface visualizes real-time sensors
    data, predicted soil moisture of upcoming days, and precipitation information.
    Further, it also provides a facility for irrigation scheduling. The user can schedule
    the irrigation at a specified threshold value of soil moisture. The system guides
    to maintain the threshold value based on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The system can automatically start the irrigation,
    which stops after achieving the specified threshold value of soil moisture. 3.1.6.
    Web service to control water motor A web service has been developed on top of
    HTTP protocol to start and stop the water motor. This web service has been accessed
    by Python code in R-Pi to start and stop the water motor. The Python code (running
    on R-Pi) send signal to Arduino-Uno that controls the relay switch to start/stop
    the water motor. 3.1.7. IoT enabled water pump In this module, a water pump is
    connected to a relay switch that is controlled by a Wi-Fi enabled node. The node
    is controlled by the web service through a trigger from the responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring. Using this web based interface the water pump
    can be managed remotely in manual and auto modes. 3.1.8. Communication technologies
    used in proposed architecture In the proposed architecture, the WiFi module/Mobile
    data communication module can be used as communication media between the field
    device and the server. In this experiment (Standalone device scenario), a WiFi
    module has been used to send the data to the server. In WSN scenario, ZigBee network
    can be used between sensor node to Gateway Node and then a WiFi module or Mobile
    data communication module can be used to send the data from the gateway node to
    the server. 3.2. Prediction algorithm and data visualization Flow diagram of the
    proposed soil moisture prediction algorithm and the irrigation planning algorithm
    for data visualization and decision support is shown in Fig. 3. 3.2.1. Algorithm
    for soil moisture prediction Algorithm Steps (Variables as in Table 1.) • Initialize

    scheduling Algorithm Steps Step 1. Initialize minimum threshold (THmin) of soil
    moisture to start irrigation and maximum threshold (THmax) of soil moisture to
    stop irrigation Step2. Set mode (manual/auto) for irrigation Step 3. If (mode = auto)  {   Read
    and check current soil moisture (Csm)   If (Csm <= THmin) // condition check of
    current soil moisture from its set threshold value by user   {    Ndate = Read

    required soil moisture (Rsm) = sum (predicted SMD from current date to nearest
    date of precipitation (Ndate)) //Total change in soil moisture till nearest precipitation

    moisture required to maintain crop growth    while (THmax > Csm) // condition

    relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor  } Else   {    Send
    0 to relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor   }  } Else  {   Enter/Set
    date to start irrigation    If (current_date >= irrigation_date) // condition

    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to start the water motor     }    }    Else    {     Send
    0 to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor    }  } 3.2.3. Experimental
    setup The main objective of this experiment is to collect the physical parameters
    of a farming land using sensors and to utilize these sensors’ data along with
    weather forecast information for developing an algorithm for prediction of soil
    moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm uses a hybrid machine learning approach,
    as discussed in Section 3.2, to achieve higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction.
    It provides a probable estimate of soil moisture to plan and provision the optimum
    irrigation. Statistical measures, R squared (Table 5) and Mean Squared Error (Table
    3, Table 5), are used for estimation of accuracy and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. The experiment shows that a good estimation (close to the actual value)
    of the soil moisture (Table 4), with the help of field data and forecasted information,
    can be utilized for optimum irrigation with an effective utilization of natural
    rain. As described in Section 3.1, one field data collection device (node) has
    been deployed in the garden of our organization to collect the field data (Fig.
    2). The data is collected at the server using the web services. Then, the data
    is analyzed using the proposed machine learning approach (Section 3.2.1). Further,
    a responsive web based interface has been developed for real-time monitoring,
    data visualization and decision support system, and for the scheduling of irrigation.
    Fig. 4 shows the GUI of responsive web based interface for real-time monitoring
    and decision support system, which shows the current soil moisture recorded by
    the sensor, and the predicted soil moisture generated by the algorithm. This information,
    predicted soil moisture and precipitation information, will help user/farmer in
    planning/scheduling of optimum irrigation. Fig. 5 shows the GUI of irrigation
    planning module to schedule the irrigation by setting Irrigation Date, and Threshold
    Levels for Soil Moisture. It works in two modes, viz., auto, and manual, as discussed
    in Section 3.2.2. In manual mode, the user takes the scheduling decision based
    on predicted soil moisture and precipitation information. In auto mode, user sets
    the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the system automatically schedules the
    irrigation date based on the predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation)
    information. For example, if rain is expected on the scheduled irrigation date
    or near to scheduled date, then the system will wait for the rain and it will
    suspend the artificial/manual irrigation or it will start watering (if needed,
    based on the algorithm) the field to maintain minimum soil moisture till the arrival
    of rain. Further, the system can handle the changes in forecasted precipitation
    values. 4. Results and discussion The smartness of the proposed system is dependent
    on the accuracy of the predicted soil moisture (Table 4, Table 5). To verify the
    accuracy of soil moisture prediction algorithm, the hourly field data for air
    temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and UV is collected
    for three weeks. The three weeks’ hourly data has been averaged out on per day
    basis and the 21 days’ data is divided into a training set (70% of the data) and
    testing set (30% of the data) for applying the proposed algorithm. Initially,
    we have predicted SMD of upcoming days using the proposed algorithm (Fig. 3) and
    the predicted values of SMD has been used in prediction of soil moisture of upcoming
    days. The results are summarized in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The SVR + k-means
    approach has higher accuracy with lower mean squared error over SVR approach while
    calculating SMD (Table 2 and Table 3). The graph (Fig. 6) shows that predicted
    SMD using proposed algorithm (SVR + k-means) is nearer to actual SMD as compared
    to predicted SMD using SVR only. The SVR + k-means approach has the same accuracy
    with the lower mean squared error over SVR approach in soil moisture prediction
    (Tables 4 and 5). The predicted soil moisture shown in Table 4 has been calculated
    based on soil moisture and SMD of previous day, e.g. soil moisture on 14-11-2017
    is 26.8982 then the soil moisture of the next day (15-11-2017) will be equal to
    the difference of soil moisture on the previous day (i.e., 14–11-2017) and SMD
    difference predicted for 15-11-2017 (Table 2). From the Tables 2 and 3, we have
    observed that the prediction of SMD using SVR + k-means approach gives higher
    accuracy with less MSE as compared to SVR approach, and we have also observed
    the same accuracy (R squared = 96%) with lesser MSE in prediction of soil moisture
    using combined approach (SVR + k-means) (Table 5). It shows that the proposed
    algorithm (based on SVR + k-means) is better as compared to SVR based approach.
    Due to higher accuracy and minimum MSE, SVR + k-means based hybrid machine learning
    algorithm has been used in irrigation planning module. 5. Conclusion The soil
    moisture is a critical parameter for developing a smart irrigation system. The
    soil moisture is affected by a number of environmental variables, e.g., air temperature,
    air humidity, UV, soil temperature, etc. With advancement in technologies, the
    weather forecasting accuracy has improved significantly and the weather forecasted
    data can be used for prediction of changes in the soil moisture. This paper proposes
    an IoT based smart irrigation architecture along with a hybrid machine learning
    based approach to predict the soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensors’
    data of recent past and the weather forecasted data for prediction of soil moisture
    of upcoming days. The predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms
    of their accuracy and error rate. Further, the prediction approach is integrated
    into a standalone system prototype. The system prototype is cost effective, as
    it is based on the open standard technologies. The auto mode makes it a smart
    system and it can be further customized for application specific scenarios. In
    future, we are planning to conduct a water saving analysis based on proposed algorithm
    with multiple nodes along with minimizing the system cost. Acknowledgements Authors

    growth places greater demands on dwindling water supplies. This is especially
    the case in arid and semi-arid areas like Australia, which is known as the driest
    inhabited continent on earth. Sustainable irrigation management necessitates better
    understanding of water requirements in order to decrease environmental risks and
    increase water use efficiency. Although the water requirements of agricultural
    crops are well established in field and laboratory studies, little research has
    been conducted to investigate the water requirements of urban green spaces. In
    addition, most previous research investigations have focused on the water requirements
    of turf grasses and not on other landscape plant species. Landscape plants can
    include various species of trees, shrubs and turf grasses with different planting
    densities and microclimates. Such complicated environments make measuring the
    water requirements of urban landscapes difficult. This paper reviews previous
    studies and techniques for measuring the water requirements of urban landscapes
    and describes how optimum irrigation management strategies for urban landscape
    vegetation can assist in better water conservation, improved landscape quality
    and reduced water costs. The authors conclude that WUCOLS is a practical approach
    that can provide an initial estimate of urban landscape water demand but ideally
    this should be further refined based on the health and aesthetic condition of
    the urban vegetation. The authors recommend calibration of the WUCOLS estimates
    with an in-situ method such as a soil water balance. Keywords: evapotranspirationurban
    vegetationremote sensingWUCOLSnormalized difference vegetation index 1. Introduction
    A plant''s water requirement is very complex to predict in practice. For agricultural
    crops, in order to achieve optimum yield, irrigation and rainfall should replace
    the total water lost through evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the
    sum of evaporation and plant transpiration. Evaporation is the movement of water
    to the air from sources such as soil, vegetation interception and water bodies.
    Plant transpiration is the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent
    loss of water as vapour through stomata in its leaves (Rothfuss et al. 2010).
    In many agricultural systems, there is a uniformity of plant density, height,
    vigour and water availability which provide a straightforward approach for evapotranspiration
    measurement, although estimating the water requirements of such environments is
    not without challenge. Various methods of ET measurement, their applications,
    device requirements, advantages, disadvantages and sources of errors have been
    discussed by Rana and Katerji ( 2000) and Allen et al. ( 2011). Rana and Katerji
    ( 2000) categorised three main methods for ET measurement: hydrological approaches,
    micrometeorological approaches and plant physiology approaches. Hydrological methods
    include soil water balances and lysimeter measurements. Micrometeorological techniques
    include eddy covariance and Bowen ratio energy balances. Plant physiological techniques
    usually consist of chamber systems and sap flow measurements. It should be noted
    that all of the above mentioned techniques have been mainly applied in agricultural
    fields or forests with little emphasis on or data collection from urban landscapes.
    In the case of non-agricultural systems and particularly urban landscape vegetation
    systems, the heterogeneous nature of vegetation is the rule rather than the exception.
    A wide variation in vegetation type including trees, shrubs and turfs with different
    densities and leaf area has significant effect on evapotranspiration and water
    loss. This introduces more complexity and uncertainty because of different vegetation
    heights, microclimates, spatial and temporal variability of soil and water characteristics
    and water accessibility. It should be noted that in landscape irrigation, the
    aim is to achieve sustainable health, appearance and growth of plants. In some
    species, irrigation also improves plant defence systems, density, colour of canopy
    and flowers and fruit production. If the landscape is not producing a harvestable
    crop, irrigation volume or frequency can be adjusted to lower levels than those
    otherwise needed for agricultural production (Costello et al. 2000). Also when
    water conservation is an objective, lower level irrigation may also be desirable.
    This review briefly describes the most common methods of evapotranspiration measurement
    and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each method for estimating plant
    water requirements. The review shows that many of the methods have been developed
    for agricultural crops with a focus on adaption of methods for urban ET assessment.
    With the growing interest in and need for urban green space development, there
    is a need to estimate more accurately ET from urban vegetation to better understand
    water balances in urban systems. In particular, ET estimations for green infrastructure
    (GI) including green roofs, rain gardens and bioretention systems are rare. The
    feasibility and appropriateness of the available methods for urban vegetation
    conditions are therefore discussed and practical methods are recommended. 2 Water
    consumption challenges for urban green spaces The assumption of fully replacing
    water lost to ET has underpinned traditional agricultural irrigation management
    philosophies and practices. A key problem therefore arises for urban vegetation
    because there is essentially no irrigation reference point. At one end of the
    spectrum communities may decide that urban vegetation should only be rain-fed
    and not irrigated and that during dry periods the plants may be allowed to wilt
    or even die. At the other end of the spectrum, it may be desirable to irrigate
    for zero plant stress in much the same way as for agricultural crops. Between
    these two extremes, there is a wide range of possibilities that will be influenced
    by the role of the urban vegetation and its location. For example, obvious signs
    of plant stress may be more tolerable further away from the home or from culturally
    important locations. In the future, sustainable irrigation management in urban
    areas may have to focus on moisture stress management. An insight into this future
    has been experienced across Australia in recent years through mandated water restrictions
    in response to the longest and severest drought on record (Fam et al. 2008). Urban
    green spaces consist of public parks, private gardens, sporting ovals, golf courses,
    residential gardens, street trees, green roofs and other vegetated open areas
    (Barnett et al. 2005). The environmental, social and economic benefits of urban
    green spaces have been widely discussed (van Kamp et al. 2003, Jim and Chen 2006,
    Barbosa et al. 2007, Fam et al. 2008, Millward and Sabir 2011). Urban green spaces
    enhance the environment by modifying air temperature, air quality, building energy
    consumption, micro-climate, biodiversity and soil stabilisation. The social benefits
    of urban green spaces include enhancement of mental and physical health, childhood
    development, social equality, social cohesion and general reduction of crime,
    including juvenile delinquency (Fam et al. 2008). Increasing population density
    and climate-dependent water sources have recently led to water restrictions in
    several countries. This, together with rapid urbanisation increases the necessity
    for water savings in urban green spaces. An efficient water conservation program
    certainly needs a better understanding of urban landscape irrigation requirements.
    In the USA, garden watering is the largest single water consumption accounting
    for between 40% and 70% of total household use (Hilaire et al. 2008) with the
    higher requirement generally being in summertime. The Water Corporation of Perth,
    Australia has surveyed residential water use in 2008–2009 (Murphy 2009). Garden
    irrigation, measured by irrigation controllers, has the highest rank of consumption,
    accounting for 39% of total urban water use. Accordingly, the efficient and precise
    irrigation of urban landscape plants needs to focus on water conservation. Australia
    is highly urbanised, with almost 90% of the population living in cities and towns.
    It consequently has relatively large areas of urban vegetation. However there
    is surprisingly little information on the irrigation requirements of urban green
    spaces and a practical method of measuring the water demand of urban green spaces
    is still lacking. Deficit irrigation is an agricultural water management system
    in which less than 100% of the potential ET can be provided by a combination of
    stored soil water, rainfall and irrigation during the growing season. The successful
    practice of deficit irrigation in agriculture inspired Sachs et al. ( 1975) to
    employ it for urban vegetation as well. They found that the aesthetic quality
    of urban vegetation was not affected by reduced irrigation level although canopy
    size was affected. With water shortages experienced by many countries in recent
    years, the sustainability of urban vegetation has become a priority for urban
    green space management. Optimum irrigation efficiency for urban landscape vegetation
    can be achieved through water stress management of the plants, which considers
    in an integrated way the variability in the soils, microclimates, rooting systems,
    hydraulic conditions, diversity in the plant species and their different water
    requirements. Increasing the efficiency of urban irrigation could also be achieved
    using deficit irrigation, installing “smart” controllers, alternative water resources
    (e.g. recycled waste water or storm water), subsurface irrigation, or efficient
    pressurised systems. But in order to employ any of these approaches, the first
    step is to estimate the water requirements of the plants. From this, combinations
    of the above water conservation techniques can be employed to manage water stress
    and evaluate the sustainability and health of the vegetation (Beeson 2006, Scheiber
    and Beeson 2007). In order to select the appropriate techniques for measuring
    urban landscape water requirements, available methods from agriculture and forestry
    are briefly reviewed. Their advantages and disadvantages for implementation in
    urban conditions are discussed and the practical techniques of ET evaluation in
    urban green space are recommended. 3 Techniques for measuring plant water requirements
    in urban landscapes Measurement of plant water requirements based on plant evapotranspiration
    (ET) principles is categorised here into field measurements, hydrological models
    and remote sensing-based techniques. A variety of methods including soil water
    balances, lysimeter measurements, sap flow measurements, eddy covariance, Bowen
    ratio energy balance method, remotely-sensed energy balances, satellite-based
    ET using Vegetation Indices (VI), chamber systems and scintillometer systems are
    all employed to assess plant evapotranspiration. The advantages and disadvantages
    of the most common methods relating to urban landscape water requirements are
    discussed. The methods have been ordered based on the history and origin of their
    application from the oldest to the most recent ones. 3.1 Soil Water balance Natural
    water circulation, which is quantified by a water balance equation, is the fundamental
    principle for water management (Thornthwaite 1948). A temporal change in soil
    moisture is an indirect approach to determine evapotranspiration as the residual
    term of the soil water balance equation. Measuring changes in soil moisture content
    over periods of time was the main source of evapotranspiration measurement before
    the 1950s (Jensen 2010) but there are few reliable peer-reviewed articles describing
    this early work. Soil sampling and gravimetric analyses are primary techniques
    which have been improved gradually by application of electromagnetic devices or
    modern soil water sensors (Charlesworth 2000). Plant water requirement is supplied
    through soil water storage (ΔS) which is the residual of precipitation (P), irrigation
    (I), upward contribution from the water table or capillary rise (W), surface runoff
    (R) and drainage (D), as shown in Equation 1 (Rana and Katerji 2000, Testi et
    al. 2004, Kizito et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2008, Scott 2010, Allen et al. 2011).
    This method involves some sources of inaccuracy such as lack of irrigation uniformity,
    spatial variability of soil properties and soil moisture conditions, neglect of
    deep percolation or capillary rise, inaccuracy in sensor calibration and challenges
    in the selection of appropriate sample points. In particular a systematic selection
    of representative sample positions is required. To increase the reliability of
    this technique, care is required for installing monitoring system, and for example,
    the lysimeter for drainage measurement, establishing a local weather station for
    accurate meteorological data collection (particularly for precipitation, solar
    energy and wind function) and ensuring soil moisture measurements are undertaken
    in the active root zones of plant communities. 3.2 Lysimeter A lysimeter is a
    container with a soil volume and a given depth that is either filled with undisturbed
    or disturbed soil (Bhantana and Lazarovitch 2010). It is fully visible, easy for
    inspection and can be automated. The first practical lysimeter was developed in
    1688 in France by De la Hire (Kohnke et al. 1940). Nevertheless it is exceedingly
    sensitive to environmental factors and particularly to different vegetation heights
    inside and outside of the effective drainage area of the lysimeter (López-Urrea
    et al. 2006, Vaughan et al. 2007, Allen et al. 2011), which is characteristically
    high in urban landscapes. An important drawback of lysimeters is that they are
    generally unsuitable for mixed vegetation conditions (García-Navarro et al. 2004).
    The characteristics of local fetch (the distance surrounding a measurement site
    for which response is relatively uniform) are another disadvantage of lysimeters
    (Ben-Gal and Shani 2002, Bhantana and Lazarovitch 2010). Also, the effect of a
    lysimeter on plant root development is quite important. A shallower soil profile
    inside a lysimeter (if the lysimeter is not deep enough) compared to the surrounding
    area results in different volumes of available water inside and outside and subsequently
    different impacts on root development (Allen et al. 2011). Moreover, lysimeters
    are not practical for trees and plants at large spacing due to the difficulty
    in representative sampling. In addition, lysimeters are a point-based measurement
    system and should not be extrapolated. Extrapolating a small sample to be representative
    for the whole area further reduces the accuracy especially for heterogeneous vegetation.
    Moreover, it is complicated to allow for a significant edge-flow effect (Allen
    et al. 2011, Castellví and Snyder 2010). Cameron et al. ( 1990) stated that the
    edge-flow of water in a lysimeter can lead to a significant error in the calculation
    of hydraulic conductivity and leaching rates. However, if the lysimeter is large
    enough, the edge-effect could be negligible. Due to the presence of heterogeneous
    plant communities, geometries, maintenance requirements and other factors, this
    technique is not very practical. 3.3 Sap flow Almost 60 years ago Huber proposed
    using heat as a tracer. In 1937, Huber and Schmidt developed a version of the
    compensation heat-pulse method (Green 1998). The sap flow method is based on a
    source of low grade heat to the plant''s trunk or branch. It determines the water
    flow in the xylem as a result of heat pulse movement or heat energy convection
    in stems (Williams et al. 2004, Allen et al. 2011). This in situ method is inexpensive,
    is easily automated to monitor water stress and is a precise technique to study
    plant eco-physiology and water scheduling. The most important weakness of sap
    flow measurement as applied to landscape vegetation is that it is a point-based
    measurement of evapotranspiration and is rarely representative of mixed vegetation
    conditions. Moreover, the space between probes, the geometry of stems, the variation
    of heat ratio and uncertainty in measuring soil and understory evaporation are
    other sources of errors in sap flow measurements. Although it is a suitable approach
    to determine plant coefficients for individual plants it is generally unsuitable
    for mixed plantings (Rana and Katerji 2000, Wilson et al. 2001, Sellami and Sifaoui
    2003, Kumagai et al. 2005, González-Altozano et al. 2008, Madurapperuma et al.
    2009, Cameron and Mills 2010, Kume et al. 2010, Allen et al. 2011). 3.4 Eddy covariance
    Eddy covariance is a micrometeorological technique to measure high speed fluxes
    of water, heat, gas and momentum in the atmospheric boundary layer. Emission and
    exchange of fluxes is characterised from a fixed in-situ measurement point like
    a tower, or a movable point like an airplane. Field et al. ( 1982) employed traditional
    tools to assess net carbon exchange and this was developed further by Denmead
    et al. ( 1993) for chamber and forest. It is a suitable direct method to study
    mixed vegetation due to the opportunity that a tower (or airplane) provides to
    measure the exchanged fluxes of water, gas, heat and etc between the surface of
    the Earth and the atmosphere in a large area up to 100 hectares. Also it appears
    feasible to predict ET by eddy covariance because it is integrative and does not
    require a species-specific equation so ET can be estimated across the species.
    One disadvantage is that technicians generally need to be well-trained in electronics,
    turbulence theory and biophysics to operate the instruments and to produce quality
    data. Also, a monitoring tower with adequate elevation above the canopy and a
    known uniform fetch are needed. This makes eddy covariance systems expensive,
    particularly since covariance requires accurate measurement of vapour pressure,
    and air temperature or wind speed at different levels above the surface. Also
    they often require corrections including closure errors in the energy balance
    equation (Kosugi et al. 2007, Scott 2010). The high heterogeneity and temporal
    variability of vegetation canopy characteristics in urban areas results in variability
    of emission sources. Anthropogenic heat release (e.g. from buildings and cars)
    is a distinct urban addition to the surface energy balance, which enhances the
    available energy for turbulent fluxes particularly in the transport of heat and
    moisture in urban vegetation. Including consideration of anthropogenic emissions
    when estimating ET of urban landscapes is very challenging (Kotthaussue and Grimmond
    2012). Due to a number of assumptions, instrument problems and physical phenomena,
    measurements are affected by frequency response, sensor time delays, noise, band
    broadening and density fluctuations are other drawbacks of the eddy covariance
    technique (Allen et al. 2011, Burba and Anderson 2007). Instrument calibration
    (Billesbach 2011) and temporal variability in energy fluxes for a planted area
    (Nagler et al. 2005) can be other sources or error. 3.5 Bowen ratio energy balance
    The Bowen ratio energy balance is an automated indirect method of ET determination.
    The concept of the Bowen ratio was developed by Bowen several decades ago but
    practical application of this technique was only common by the 1990s (Malek et
    al. 1990, Fritschen 1993). The method measures the latent heat flux energy budget
    of a surface covered with an actively growing crop. The method is based on Equation
    (2): where λE represents ET in terms of the available energy due to the radiation
    balance, Rn is net radiation, G is soil heat flux and H is sensible heat flux.
    However, it is a simple and inexpensive approach that requires uniform fetch for
    accurate measurement of net radiation and soil heat flux. It also requires an
    adequate elevation above the canopy to collect the required meteorological data
    (Perez et al. 2008, Villa Nova et al. 2007, Yunusa et al. 2004). Sensitivity of
    the instrument bias for gradient and energy balance measurements is another source
    of uncertainty (Todd et al. 2000). The accuracy of ET determination depends considerably
    on the accurate measurement of net radiation and soil heat flux (Allen et al.
    2011, Angus and Watts 1984, Perez et al. 1999). The Bowen ratio energy balance
    method has served as one of the most important methods for forest studies because
    of the ability to measure ET even from non-watered plantation surfaces. Also there
    are fewer problems with energy balance closure, fetch and some other mechanical
    and technical issues compared with more advanced diagnostic procedures and technologies
    (Silberstein et al. 2001, Tanaka et al. 2008). In the urban context, differences
    in vegetation height lead to inaccuracy in gradient measurements above the canopy.
    Another source of error for this method in urban environments is uncertainty in
    measuring net radiation and soil heat flux in heterogeneous conditions. 3.6 Water
    Use Classification of Landscape Plants (WUCOLS) Measuring the total amount of
    water lost through evapotranspiration provides an estimation of the amount of
    water that should be partially or fully replaced by irrigation. Given the formula
    ET crop = Kcrop × ET0, the evapotranspiration rate for any crop can be readily
    calculated from the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient (Kcrop),
    which is a coefficient corresponding to the effect of crop characteristics on
    water demand of the crop. These two parameters are readily available from in-situ
    measurements or modelling for most agricultural crops. For agricultural crops
    these values are well established from field and laboratory studies. In contrast,
    it is very difficult to determine evapotranspiration values for mixed landscape
    vegetation. Unlike agricultural crops, landscape plants can include various species
    of trees, shrubs and turf grasses with different planting densities and microclimates.
    Establishing a crop coefficient for landscape vegetation in such complicated and
    heterogeneous environments is very challenging. This makes estimation of water
    demands equally difficult. Because of this difficulty, Costello and Jones ( 1994)
    developed the WUCOLS (Water Use Classification of Landscape Plants) method for
    estimating the water requirements of landscape plants. This method assigns numerical
    values to three major factors influencing evapotranspiration from mixed vegetation
    in urban landscapes, namely crop factors, environmental aspects and management
    practices. The resulting calculation produces an estimate of the landscape vegetation
    coefficient, KL. WUCOLS was described in detail by Costello et al. ( 2000). This
    method has been applied in several research studies (Bitar 2004, Pittenger and
    Henry 2006, Mitchell et al. 2009, Spano et al. 2009, Pittenger and Shaw 2010,
    Salvador et al. 2011). According to WUCOLS principles, landscape evapotranspiration
    (ETL) is a function of a landscape coefficient (KL) and reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0), as shown in Equation (3): Unlike crop fields or turf grasses, landscape
    plants are generally a combination of different species of trees, shrubs and turfs
    that are inter-spread with each other. This mixed vegetation with has different
    water requirements but is most often irrigated uniformly or site-specifically.
    To produce a reliable estimation of plant evapotranspiration, a dimensionless
    coefficient for landscape plants as shown in Equation (4) is required to account
    for such variations in species (Ks), density (Kd) and microclimate (Kmc). Certain
    species require significantly more watering than others to maintain their health
    and aesthetic appeal. The species factor explains the differences in water demands
    of various species. Costello and Jones ( 1999) categorised the most common landscaped
    plants in terms of water requirement into four groups, namely high, moderate,
    low and very low water demand and then assigned a numeric value from less than
    0.1 to 0.9 to each of them. The species factor is based only on water use studies
    for landscape species regardless of vegetation type (e.g. tree, shrub, herbaceous
    and mixed plantings). The density factor refers to vegetation density that can
    be measured from the collective leaf area and its specific water losses. Differences
    in vegetation density or canopy cover have a significant effect on the evapotranspiration
    rate and water loss. To account for the differences in canopy cover, three categories
    of low, average and high density were introduced and assigned numeric values of
    0.5 to 1.3 (Costello and Jones 1999). Immature plants with less leaf area and
    canopy cover lose less water in the process of evapotranspiration and are categorised
    as low density while a mixed vegetation of trees, shrubs and turf have more leaf
    area and canopy cover and lose more water so this is assigned a high category
    value. Landscape microclimate is an important factor that may cause different
    environmental conditions. Buildings and paving are typical urban landscapes that
    strongly affect the temperature, wind speed and direction, and humidity. These
    different environmental factors in a specific area with the particular climate
    conditions combine to create a specific microclimate (Bitar 2004). The effect
    of microclimate in plant water loss is estimated through factors that affect the
    energy balance. Kmc is usually attributed a value in the range 0.5 to 1.4. Although
    this approach mostly fulfils the requirements of measuring urban landscape water
    requirements, it is quite subjective particularly in specification of the density
    factor. In order to diminish the subjectivity of density factor determination,
    it is essential to use a reliable technique for considering the size, shape and
    orientation of a vegetation canopy. As a main variable of evapotranspiration estimation,
    due to its key role in energy exchange between the atmosphere and the vegetation,
    several research studies have examined both direct and indirect approaches for
    measuring leaf area index (LAI) (MacFarlane et al. 2000, Kato et al. 2004, MacFarlane
    et al. 2007a, MacFarlane et al. 2007c). Direct methods include destructive sampling,
    the model tree method and litter traps. These three techniques of leaf collection
    combined with planimetric or gravimetric techniques, are more accurate and involve
    stripping and measuring the foliage of plant canopy samples, which on the other
    hand is destructive (especially to smaller plantings) and time consuming. Indirect
    methods include inclined point quadrat, allometric techniques, Multiband Vegetation
    Imagery (MVI), digital photography (hemispherical/fisheye or cover photos), LAI
    2000 canopy analyser, ceptometer, DEMON and Tracing Radiation and Architecture
    of Canopies (TRAC). In contrast, indirect methods are quicker, can be more easily
    automated, and are generally applicable for large areas (MacFarlane et al. 2000,
    Jonckheere et al. 2004). To select appropriate techniques which suit urban landscape
    conditions, several research papers were reviewed. Most recent researchers recommend
    cover digital photography as an uncomplicated, inexpensive, fast, handy and accurate
    technique for measuring crown porosity, crown cover, foliage cover, foliage clumping
    index and leaf area index (López-Serrano et al. 2000, Peper and McPherson 2003,
    Weiss et al. 2004, MacFarlane et al. 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, Fuentes et al. 2008,
    López-Lozano et al. 2009, Osmond 2009, Pekin and MacFarlane 2009, Behera et al.
    2010, Heiskanen et al. 2011, Sprintsin et al. 2011). Digital photography combines
    photography, modelling and image processing techniques to improve canopy modelling
    and vegetation architecture measurement and accordingly vegetation density estimations.
    Fuentes et al. ( 2008) introduced an automated procedure using script written
    in MATLAB (LAIM) to analyse the images. 3.7 Remote sensing It is important to
    estimate vegetation factors accurately since foliage density accounts for almost
    80% of ET (Dalmago et al. 2004). Moreover, the spatial variation of foliage coefficient
    in different sampling positions results from the available species, their maturity
    levels and canopy covers and also the availability of urban landscape features
    such as buildings or paving. These all make the task of measuring vegetation factors
    from the ground surface difficult. Temporal variation of different conditions
    of landscape vegetation also occurs in different seasons e.g. dormancy in winter
    or decreasing chlorophyll pigment production in autumn present some challenges
    in measuring the landscape vegetation factor. However, a satellite image can handle
    this issue by providing the ability to look at the vegetation from above the ground.
    Methods using satellite imagery and energy balance concepts to estimate ET were
    developed around 1990 (Allen et al. 2011). Simpler relationships between ET and
    vegetation indices (VIs) were used from 2005 by Tasumi et al. ( 2005). They asserted
    that the recent development of remote sensing energy balance-based ET models facilitated
    estimation of evapotranspiration and crop coefficient for large areas. They declared
    a strong relationship between crop coefficient factor and Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the mid-season. Remote Sensing (RS) can be used to
    estimate the geographical distribution of evapo-transpiration and water demand
    in large and mixed vegetation areas. The spatio-temporal distribution of surface
    heat flux, evaporation fraction, vegetation index (VI) and diurnal changes in
    land surface temperature are some of the parameters that can be estimated using
    remote sensing techniques (Wang et al. 2007). RS techniques estimate ET through
    satellite imagery of mixed vegetation over large areas. RS can be more economical
    compared with point source measurements with higher spatial resolutions and applicability
    in variable environments (Allen et al. 2011). Tsouni et al. ( 2008) reviewed three
    different RS approaches for ET measurement, namely empirical direct methods, residual
    methods and indirect methods. The stress degree day approach is an empirical direct
    method based on applying RS data into semi-empirical models to characterise vegetation
    water demand from ground measurements for micro-scale areas, while satellite measurements
    are used for macro-scale areas. Residual methods combine empirical models and
    physical components such as METRIC, SEBAL, Sebi, etc. These estimate input parameters
    and evapotranspiration (Courault et al. 2005, Tsouni et al. 2008). Indirect methods
    generally rely on complex modelling of energy budgets. Contreras et al. ( 2011)
    provided another category to estimate evapotranspiration from RS images using
    a physically-based algorithm, surface temperature/vegetation indices and a numerical
    process model of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere relationshipThe surface temperature/vegetation
    index method, which is known as the triangle-trapezoidal method, focuses on the
    spatial distribution of evapotranspiration coefficients. The numerical process
    model of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere relationship (SVAT) involves weather and
    radiation parameters. Allen et al. ( 2011) divided RS approaches for estimating
    ET into two main groups of energy balances and satellite-based ET estimation using
    vegetation indices. The former evaluates energy balances via sensible heat flux
    through different models such as METRIC and SEBAL, mostly coupled with ground
    measurements for calibration. The latter technique simply employs vegetation indices
    to estimate crop coefficients due to the close relationship of vegetation (NDVI,
    VI or LAI) and transpiration. They claimed that the basal coefficient (evaporation
    from soil surface) has a more consistent relationship with NDVI. Allen et al.
    ( 2011) asserted that RS-based or in-situ measurement of energy balance techniques
    is time consuming and requires extensive skills. Torut et al. (2008) used a multi-spectral
    camera to measure canopy cover directly from crops in horticultural sites and
    then compared the results with remotely-sensed NDVI. They asserted that there
    was a high correlation and linear relationship between crop canopy and NDVI and
    they recommended application of remotely-sensed NDVI to predict vegetation water
    demand. Later, O''Connell et al. ( 2010) determined the irrigation demand of citrus,
    grape and almond irrigation sites in Australia by evapotranspiration measurement
    using the SEBAL model. Then the relationship of ET and NDVI was investigated and
    the results showed a strong relationship in all three crops. Trout et al. ( 2010)
    compared two RS techniques of energy balance (SEBAL) and an indirect method using
    vegetation indices in order to predict ET. They recommended that vegetation cover
    can be estimated from satellite-based NDVI for a large variety of crops (Trout
    et al. 2010, Trout 2011). For those areas where in-situ measurements are difficult,
    Sobrino et al. ( 2007) suggested a methodology to estimate evapotranspiration
    from low spatial resolution RS data using an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
    (AVHRR). This method involves retrieving ET from low spatial resolution remote
    sensing data and is based on the evaporative fraction concept (Zhou et al. 2006).
    Disadvantages of RS-based methods include the time lapse between satellite captures,
    the high expense to get high resolution images, the uncertainty in estimating
    aerodynamic components and some errors in narrow vegetation areas such as riparian
    corridors (Rana and Katerji 2000, Chen et al. 2005, Courault et al. 2005, McCabe
    and Wood 2006, Min and Lin 2006, Stisen et al. 2008, Boegh et al. 2009, Jiang
    et al. 2009, Mutiga et al. 2010, Wu et al. 2010, Allen et al. 2011). Combining
    satellite image ET estimation methods and ground ET measurement techniques have
    generally enhanced the accuracy of ET measurements (Kustas and Norman 1994, Courault
    et al. 2003, Tsouni et al. 2008). 4 Water requirements of urban systems Sustainable
    urban development necessitates employing an integrated and systematic approach
    to water management for urban vegetation. The social, economic and environmental
    benefits of urban green spaces are undeniable. However, the management of urban
    landscapes should also involve conservation of natural resources, and particularly
    greater efficiency in the use of water. Quantitative estimation of the water requirements
    of landscape plants is very limited but is improving rapidly (Testi et al. 2004,
    AZMET 2005, Pittenger and Henry 2006, Pittenger and Shaw 2007, Dukes 2009, Al-Kofahi
    et al. 2010, Pittenger and Shaw 2010, Schuch et al. 2010, Sun and Kopp 2010).
    However, in urban landscape studies, most attention has focused on turf grasses
    rather than other landscape species (Davis and Dukes 2010, Kilgren et al. 2010,
    AQiser et al. 2011). Available research studies of water requirements of non-turf
    landscape plants are limited to applying the WUCOLS method, focusing on a mixture
    of plant species in California (Costello et al. 2000). Such studies have mainly
    focused on a limited number of species (typically 5–6 species) and were mostly
    conducted in greenhouses, containers or lysimeters. They often considered factors
    such as soil moisture status, plant appearance, gardeners’ judgement and modelling
    but have often not examined other parameters like vegetation canopy cover and
    meteorological effects. These latter parameters will now be considered in more
    detail. Mitchell et al. ( 2001) modelled the urban water cycle using the Aquacycle
    software, substituting stormwater and wastewater for irrigation water resources
    in urban areas including private gardens and public open spaces. In order to quantify
    urban vegetation water requirements, they relied on plant appearance and water
    costs. The decision to irrigate was based on modelled minimum soil wetness. The
    model values that were used to trigger irrigation were 0 for an empty pervious
    store, and 1 for a full pervious store. White et al. ( 2004) stated that using
    potential evapotranspiration modified by landscape coefficient and landscape size
    results in a realistic water budget and this consequently provides a good opportunity
    for water conservation. In another approach for estimation of urban landscape
    water demand, Haley et al. ( 2007) employed an automatic in-ground irrigation
    system. They found that using irrigation controllers, either on a timer-based
    irrigation schedule or triggered by soil moisture sensors, resulted in significant
    water savings. Rosenberg et al. ( 2011) presented a model for estimating the water
    usage of residential and commercial landscapes to encourage property owners to
    save water. The water requirements of non-turf plants were estimated by multiplying
    the average crown diameter of a single plant (or uniform plantation) by evapotranspiration
    (20–80% of ET0). Lowry Jr. et al. (2011) estimated outdoor residential urban water
    requirements using meteorological data to measure the reference evapotranspiration
    and using a plant coefficient of 0.6. Salvador et al. ( 2011) studied the irrigation
    performance of household landscapes involving a mixture of trees, shrubs and turf
    grasses. They employed the WUCOLS method involving species, density and microclimate
    factors multiplied by reference evapotranspiration. They recommended applying
    night sprinkler irrigation and designing different irrigation schedules for different
    landscape areas to be able to save water. 5 Results A number of techniques and
    methods for measuring ET and the water requirements of urban landscape plants
    have been reviewed. These are summarised in Table 1. Some of these are more accurate,
    cost effective or particularly appropriate for certain scales of space and time.
    Mixed plantings of trees, shrubs and turfs, because of their different microclimates,
    species, densities, maturity and size, often have greatly different water requirements.
    Based on effectiveness, accuracy, cost and time limitations and safety, the recommended
    methods are remote sensing and the WUCOLS method with some modification to decrease
    subjectivity. These two approaches provide area-based estimations of ET considering
    mixed vegetation types with different species and densities. Using a local weather
    station will increase the accuracy of the meteorological data and this will improve
    the estimation of water demand. For remote sensing, a simple, quick and easy method
    of soil water balance can be used to validate the satellite image data. Table

    CSVDisplay Table 6 Conclusion Landscape vegetation is an important aspect of the
    urban environment that has many environmental, social and economic benefits (Barbosa
    et al. 2007). In environmental terms, urban landscape vegetation provides biodiversity
    enhancement, as well as habitat and food sources for a broad range of urban fauna.
    Urban vegetation also prevents soil erosion and improves drainage (Barnett et
    al. 2005). It is an air purifier and an air temperature adjuster that can reduce
    the urban heat island effect and can also reduce noise pollution (Millward and
    Sabir 2011). In terms of social advantages, urban landscape vegetation provides
    enhanced recreational amenities. It fosters a connection between residents and
    the natural environment that surrounds them and contributes significantly to sustainable
    and liveable cities. Economic benefits can include increased property prices and,
    in properly designed systems, reduced urban flash flooding (Bitar 2004, Jim and
    Chen 2006, Fam et al. 2008). To achieve these benefits, it is important that more
    attention is focused on sustainable water management of urban landscape vegetation.
    This is particularly the case in situations of water scarcity, where irrigation
    requirements for urban vegetation compete with other water demands. Reviewing
    the available literature on non-agricultural water requirements has revealed a
    limited understanding of irrigation requirements for urban green spaces. This
    could present a significant limitation to the emerging interest in green infrastructure,
    including green walls, green roofs, rainwater gardens and bioretention systems.
    This is beginning to be realised and recent designs of bioretention systems have
    incorporated underlying storage to provide plant roots with access to water between
    irrigation and rainfall events. The authors conclude that WUCOLS is a practical
    approach that can provide an initial estimate of urban landscape water demand
    but ideally this should be further refined based on the health and aesthetic condition
    of the urban vegetation. The authors recommend calibration of the WUCOLS estimates
    with an in-situ method such as a soil water balance. Acknowledgement The authors

    and content Highlights • Development of a small, compact and autonomous unit for
    convenient use in agricultural facilities. • Testing and installation of several
    soil and water moisture sensors in conjunction with the developed device to manage
    the irrigation. • Sample and sending rates estimation to accomplish optimal agronomic
    information with a battery powered device. Abstract Water is an essential resource
    for the development of agriculture. In several locations like the south-east of
    Spain water is scarce and its cost is high, so optimal management of this important
    resource is essential. Therefore, the application of irrigation strategies to
    improve the watering process, affects the profitability of crops quite significantly.
    It is necessary to carry out the instrumentation of the variables that affect
    the growing process of the crop (soil, water and plant) and use the techniques
    associated with this instrumentation to take actions to optimize the production.
    The system proposed in this paper uses information and communication technologies,
    allowing the user to consult and analyze the information obtained by different
    sensors from any device (computer, mobile phone or tablet) in an easy and comfortable
    way. The proposed architecture is based on different wireless nodes equipped with
    GPRS connectivity. Each wireless node is completely autonomous and makes use of
    solar energy, giving it virtually unlimited autonomy. Different commercial sensors
    for measuring the wide range of parameters of the soil, plant and atmosphere can
    be connected to the nodes. The data is sent and processed on a remote server,
    which stores the information of the sensors in a database, allowing further consultation
    and analysis of data in a simple and versatile way. Previous article in issue

    optimizationIrrigation management 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is the
    biggest consumer of freshwater in arid and semi-arid zones, with a share of around
    70–80% of the total volume of used water. However, increased demand for water
    by other sectors and weather-associated limitations (increasing aridity as a result
    of climate change), suggests that the water resources available for agriculture
    in forthcoming decades will be lower in both quantity and quality. At the same
    time, new growers with lower production costs than the traditional ones in these
    areas are forcing them to reduce costs by lowering their main inputs. It is in
    this area of costs reduction where the efficient use of the water is becoming
    an increasingly important consideration, sometimes at the expense of crop quality.
    However such issues must be addressed if such crops are to remain competitive.
    It is a proven reality that in semiarid zones the limited availability of water
    has contributed to creating increasing interest in water conservation, particularly
    among practitioners of irrigated agriculture. For these and other reasons, the
    scientific- and technical-based irrigation scheduling of water to maintain and
    even improve yield and quality has been and will remain a major challenge for
    irrigated agriculture (Puerto et al., 2013). In recent years, the incorporation
    of sensors in the context of agricultural production for water management and
    conservation has received an increasing interest for establishing irrigation management
    strategies, such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or partial root drying
    (PRD). Both strategies allow very significant increases in irrigation water productivity
    (yield produced per unit of irrigation water applied), especially in woody crops
    (Egea et al., 2009, Jones, 2004, Puerto et al., 2013). However, these strategies
    need several sensors to estimate the plat water status. Most common sensors to
    estimate plant water status are soil sensors, since they provide important information
    that is familiar to the user. These sensors provide data of the matric potential
    (Ψm, soil water status) or volumetric soil water content (θv, soil moisture).
    Over the years, these sensors have evolved significantly since the first manual
    gauges that measured the pressure of the soil water to become ever more effective
    and precise in measuring the soil''s water status and moisture content, integrating
    communication with dataloggers (Fereres and Goldhamer, 1990, Hanson and Edwards,
    2000). In addition to these sensors, measures to control the volume or concentration
    of soluble salts in the irrigation water have often been used in irrigated agriculture,
    especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Water electrical conductivity (EC) is
    important, and irrigation water can be classified as running from excellent (EC
    ≤250 μS cm−1) to unsuitable (EC ≥ 3000 μS cm−1) (James et al., 1982). Moreover,
    it has been demonstrated that the crop production decreases as the EC of the irrigation
    water increases (Maas and Hoffman, 1977). The overall EC (or quality) of the used
    water can be adjusted by using water from different sources, which explains the
    use of sensors that provide measurements of the volume and quality of water held
    in reservoirs. This type of sensor provides useful data for regulating the conditions
    required by each of these irrigation strategies. These sensors have been used
    in conjunction with instrumentation systems to control the irrigation process,
    traditionally with wired dataloggers. In recent years, the quick development of
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has led to the use of sensor equipment with very
    little wiring, and great improvements in their installation and maintenance (Hussain,
    2012, Khan et al., 2014, Nolz et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009, Yu et al.,
    2013). Wireless sensor networks are composed of different measuring points, called
    nodes, able to communicate wirelessly. The data obtained from each one of them,
    is stored in a sink node and processed for managing irrigation. The ultimate aim
    is to use the data from field sensors towards a fully automatic irrigation system.
    Although a fully automatic system has not yet been achieved, remote irrigation
    management is possible by means of routers and Internet connections that access
    the data collected by dataloggers (wired) or by the sink nodes (WSNs) (Puerto
    et al., 2013). The common point of these systems is that they have a centralized
    communication structure, that is, they depend on a device (gateway) to communicate
    with the user, which can lead to connection problems for the whole system if such
    a device has limited connectivity. Advances in mobile networks and cheaper Internet
    communications (GSM/GPRS, 3G) has led in recent years to the incorporation of
    modules that provide WSNs with access to mobile networks by using machine-to-machine
    (M2M) modules. This feature provides more flexibility in the installation, as
    it is not limited by the connectivity of the sink node or datalogger. Each node
    contains a mobile communication module (GSM/GPRS, 3G) changing the topology of
    the network from centralized to distributed. One of the important advantage of
    this approach is that a connection failure at a node does not affect the normal
    operation of the network. However, the higher energy requirements of the mobile
    communications network represent a complex challenge for the design and dimensioning
    of the instrumentation of the nodes (Sinduja and Sowmya, 2013). This article describes
    the design and dimensioning of a wireless node to fulfill the specified requirements
    of autonomy and reliability, allowing an easy installation and the ability to
    use the wide range of electrical interfaces in agronomic sensors. The results
    obtained in different agricultural scenarios are then used to verify the operation
    of the equipment and the goodness of the agronomic data. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Hardware description One of the most important aspects to consider when designing
    a device for monitoring any kind of variable is the ability to cover a wide range
    of significant parameters for the monitored activity that will provide the device
    with the versatility necessary for use in a broad variety of real situations.
    Such measurements are provided by specific sensors that are connected to the device
    by means of a wide range of possible connection interfaces. In the present article,
    a completely autonomous device for estimating the plant water status in several
    scenarios is presented. The device, which must be compatible with a wide variety
    of sensors that provide plant-related data, is based on a modular structure that
    consists of several electronic interconnected boards: 1. An electronic board,
    the Main-Board, which has already been used in other applications, including oceanographic
    monitoring by means of a ZigBee network (Albaladejo et al., 2012). This board
    is responsible for sensors’ data. It is also in charge of communication with the
    rest of the boards and ensures that the whole system is working properly. 2. The
    Sensor-Board provides the interface with the connected sensors. The design of
    the board is optimized for agricultural monitoring, allowing the simultaneous
    connection of a common precision agriculture sensors. 3. The GPRS-Board is in
    charge of establishing the communication with the mobile network by means of a
    GSM/GPRS protocol, sending the data to the remote storage server for further consultation.
    2.2. Control, management and data collection subsystem Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram
    of the Main-board. When it is powered up, the microcontroller obtains the configuration
    information from the SD-Card. This card contains information about the sensors
    connected to the Sensor-Board, the sample period and transmission rate, the GPRS
    and remote server configurations, etc. By simply modifying a few files, the user
    is able to completely change the behaviour of the system, providing great flexibility.
    As soon as the configuration is initialized, the system enters in a sleep mode
    in which the power consumption kept below 600 μA. When the sample rate time has
    expired, the microcontroller is “woken up” by an interrupt signal and the process
    of retrieving the information from the sensors starts. This process is carried
    out by the interface board. Then, the microcontroller obtains the time from the
    RTC and stores all the information in the SD-Card. Next, the system enters the
    sleep mode again and waits for another interrupt. When the sending rate time has
    expired, the Main-Board establishes communication with the GPRS-Board to send
    the information obtained from the sensors to the remote server. This board also
    performs a charging algorithm to optimize battery life, activating and deactivating
    a circuit in the Sensor-Board with the purpose of connecting the solar panel only
    when the battery is outside a specified voltage range. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the Main-Board. 2.3. Sensor interface subsystem
    The Sensor-Board is one of the most important parts of the whole system since
    it provides the interfaces that will determine compatibility with external sensors.
    Given that the SDI-12 interface is one of the most important and standardized
    interfaces in the field of precision agriculture (López et al., 2009), it provides
    great flexibility because a wide range of commercial sensors used in agriculture
    are compatible with it. According to the technical characteristics of the SDI-12
    protocol (SDI-12, 2005). The sensors that use SDI-12 are powered at 12 V. As the
    battery operates in the range of 3.7–4.2 V, a 12 V DC/DC converter was included
    to power every sensor connected to the Sensor-Board, while a 5 V DC/DC was used
    to power the tri-state buffer needed for the SDI-12 interface. This power source
    could also be used to power up sensors. The rest of the sensor interfaces included
    in this board were: • One 4–20 mA interface. • Three voltage interface. • One
    digital pulse interface. Fig. 2 presents the flow diagram of the Sensor-Board.
    In the initial state, the power supplies of the sensors are inactive. As soon
    as the Main-Board enters the reading state, the Sensor-Board warms the sensors
    for 2 s, then starts reading all the SDI-12 sensors, after which it begins reading
    the analogue sensors. Finally the Main-Board stores the data in the SD-Card and
    the Sensor-Board enters the Initial State again. Download : Download full-size

    communication module is based on the SIM900 GSM/GPRS chip from Simcom Ltd. The
    SIM900 module communicates with the Main-Board by mean of AT-Commands through
    a serial interface. The decision to use GSM/GPRS technology rather than the more
    modern 3G or even 4G is based on two important points: 1. GSM/GPRS is more established
    than any other mobile technology, so its coverage is greater than that of its
    counterparts. Also, the vast majority of the areas that need to be monitored for
    precision agriculture will be located in the countryside, where 3G/4G is not always
    available. 2. Although GPRS/GSM technology is much slower than 3G/4G, the amount
    of data collected at each sampling is so small that speed is not an issue. Moreover
    the power consumption of devices compatible with 3G/4G is much greater than in
    the case of GPRS/GSM – an aspect that is much more important than speed in scenarios
    where the autonomy of the device is of key importance. This module is one of the
    most important parts of the device and allows a change in the topology commonly
    used in WSN, from centralized to distributed. A sink or a gateway node is not
    needed as every device in the network has its own capacity to transmit data by
    Internet. Fig. 3 shows the flow diagram of the communication subsystem. As the
    Main-Board enters the Sending state, the GPRS module is powered up and tries to
    establish connection with the remote server through the mobile network. If the
    communication with the remote server is established successfully, the GPRS-Board
    enters the Sending state, in which the data is processed and sent to the server
    separately in bursts of 1 kB. If any problem occurs during this process, the GPRS
    will enter the inactive mode to save the battery. In this case, the GPRS-Board
    will try to transmit all the data at the next sending time. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Flow diagram of the communication subsystem. Fig. 4a shows
    the completely assembled device. In order to guarantee the stability of the network,
    an installation protocol must be followed. Firstly, an analysis of the signal
    power at the point of installation is performed for each mobile operator by means
    of an Anritsu MS2713E spectrum analyzer. The operator with the strongest signal
    will be the most suitable. Using the most suitable GPRS antenna is very important,
    since the sensitivity of the Sim900 module is around −109 dBm (SIM 900 Hardware
    Design Guide, 2010). If the threshold cannot be reached with an internal antenna
    of 2 dB, a 5 dB external antenna should be used instead. This protocol ensures
    high quality GSM/GPRS communications under normal working conditions. Download

    The electronics are located inside an IP-67, a box of reduced dimensions (120
    mm × 122 mm × 75 mm), whose cover is transparent so that the solar panel inside
    is protected from exposure to the weather (Fig. 4b). 2.5. Experimental sites Four
    experimental tests were carried out to analyze the behaviour of the device in
    real scenarios. The data was collected from January 2014 onwards in four commercial
    plantations located in the south-east of Spain. In order to manage the irrigation,
    soil moisture sensors rather than plant based sensors were used because soil moisture
    information is generally more familiar to the farmers. The control variables were
    matric potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content (θv) which are common
    in the irrigation management. The criteria for scheduling irrigation used in the
    scenarios 1, 2 and 3 (see below) were decided by the farmer. In scenarios 1 and
    2 the aim was maintain soil moisture conditions equivalent or close to field capacity
    to satisfy the maximum crop water requirements. In the third scenario soil moisture
    conditions depended on the crop phenological stage. In general, Ψm was used to
    decide the irrigation frequency and θv to adjust the gross irrigation doses. In
    scenario 3 it was decided to use a GS3 sensor instead of the 10HS because of its
    robustness, accuracy and easier installation for it to be in close contact with
    the substrate. Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the sensors used.
    The different scenarios are described below. Table 1. Summary of the sensors used

    Scenario 1 (woody crop). Fino lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm. fil cv. 49.)
    on C. macrophylla Wester, growing in a soil with a low water retention capacity,
    were irrigated in order to optimize the use of the irrigation water based on the
    information provided by the sensors. The soil had a sandy clay loam texture and
    the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2200 μS cm−1. The
    orchard consisted of 10 year old lemon trees. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m,
    with an average ground coverage of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m
    apart) were used for each tree row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides
    of each tree. Two sensor nodes were installed in the 5.5 ha orchard, each one
    with a soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA
    99163, USA) at a depth of 30 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of
    20, 40 and 80 cm (10-HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) located
    25 cm from a representative dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. The device automatically
    took readings of the soil matric potential and volumetric water content every
    15 min. Scenario 2 (vegetable crop). Endive plants were planted in beds with 1.0
    m centres. There were two rows per bed, and plants were spaced 35 cm apart within
    the row (triangular planting). A single lateral tube with 0.2 m between emitters
    and a discharge rate of 5 L h−1 was used to meet their water requirements. The
    irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 800 μS cm−1. One sensor
    node was installed in the 2.5 ha plot with two soil matric potential sensors (MPS-2,
    Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) at depths of 17 and 35 cm, and
    one FDR sensor at a depth of 20 cm (Hydra Probe II, Stevens Water Monitoring Systems,
    Inc., Portland, OR, USA) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and 20 cm
    from the plant. Scenario 3 (greenhouse soilless culture). The test was carried
    out in a plastic greenhouse (800 gauge) using hydrangeas growing in 12 L plastic
    pots containing a substrate mixture (2 parts peat, 1 part coconut fibre and 1
    part perlite by volume). The pots were spaced 50 cm apart within the row and with
    60 cm between two contiguous rows. The irrigation was supplied using a single
    lateral line that had two compensating drippers (2 L h−1) per pot. The irrigation
    water had an EC of 800 μS cm−1. One sensor node with three GS3 sensors (Decagon
    devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) was installed in the greenhouse with one
    GS3 sensor located mid-height in each pot. Scenario 4 (water reservoir). The water
    reservoir monitored, with a 500 m perimeter and a total capacity of 52,000 m3,
    is used to irrigate different fields located nearby. The reservoir receives water
    from a desalination plant and several wells. To keep track of the water level
    and conductivity, a pressure sensor (LMK 807, Sensotec Incorporated, Columbus,
    OH) and a conductivity sensor (ES-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163,
    USA) were used. The pressure sensor was located at the bottom of the reservoir
    and the conductivity sensor 1 m below the water surface. Table 2 summarizes the
    number and type of sensors connected to each node. Table 2. Summary of the sensors
    used on each node. Node type Sensors Empty Cell 10HS HP-2 MPS-2 GS3 LMK807 ES-2

    The information from the sensors connected to the device is periodically sent
    to a data server, where it is processed and stored in a relational database. The
    software architecture of the data server is based around three main components:
    (1) an application developed in Java, which is in charge of communication with
    the nodes, (2) a relational database that stores the data, and (3) a Web application
    to check the information of the sensors. Fig. 5 shows the architecture of the
    system from a functional point of view. The node, after sampling the connected
    sensors, establishes a TCP communication through the GSM/GPRS module with the
    Java application that is being executed in the server. Once the socket of the
    communication is established, the node sends the data in a specific format. The
    Java application manages each connection and even in cases of simultaneity, it
    receives and sends the information of each sensor to a MySQL database. The Web
    application is used to query the database to show selected data to the user. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Architecture of the system. The flow of the
    Java application is as follows: first, the header of the message, which contains
    information about the identification of the node, its sample rate, the location,
    the sensors connected, etc., is analyzed. Then, the sensor data is checked and
    processed and, if the information is below or above the threshold established
    by the user, an email is sent to warn of a possible incident. The data and the
    exact timestamp sent by the node are stored in the database, while the information
    gathered by the sensors is made available on the Internet through a website. This
    Web application is developed in HTML5, Javascript and PHP, as shown in Fig. 6.
    The top of the figure shows the geographic location of the devices and the connected
    sensors. The bottom of the figure shows, in graphic form, the information obtained
    from the sensors connected to the device. This allows the desired data to be visualized

    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Agronomic results Fig. 7a–c presents the data concerning
    the soil water content and water status of the crops recorded in the three commercial
    plantations and a water reservoir respectively. The first three figures clearly
    represent the evolution of θv and Ψm, while Fig. 7d plots the evolution of the
    water conductivity and volume of the irrigation reservoir. Download : Download

    crop, (b) vegetable crop and (c) greenhouse soilless culture. Evolution of volume
    and electrical conductivity of irrigation water during the indicated period (76–102
    DOY). Scenery (c) water reservoir. Fig. 7a shows how, as the season progresses,
    the moisture in the root zone of the lemon tree (top 50 cm) increases, while at
    80 cm it decreases slightly. The moisture content from 20 to 40 cm depth reflects
    the high availability of water for the crops, based on Ψm values at 30 cm (Domingo
    et al., 1996). The irrigation strategy is based on maintaining a high level of
    available water in the zone of highest root activity during the critical periods
    of flowering and fruit-setting, while optimizing the use of the irrigation water
    by minimizing deep percolation losses. The high frequency of strong winds (>5
    m s−1) in the area were taken into consideration during the flowering periods.
    To ensure the availability of water in the top 50 cm of soil, two daily irrigations
    (instead of one) were applied after day 95 (Fig. 7a). The total amount of water
    applied in a growing season was 5775 m3 ha−1 in contrast to the 6000 m3 ha−1 applied
    by Domingo et al. (1996). These authors managed the irrigation according to the
    FAO methodology using a Class A evaporation pan. The climatic conditions, irrigation
    system and total yields were similar (≈50 t ha−1). The difference represents a
    water saving of 225 m3 ha−1 with the irrigation controlled by sensors. However,
    the irrigation water quality and annual rainfall presented in the scenario 1 were
    lower than the ones presented by the previous authors (2200 μS cm−1 vs 1250 μS
    cm−1 and 100 mm vs 315 mm for the EC and rainfall, respectively). Considering
    that citrus fruits are salt sensitive (Storey and Walker, 1998) and bearing in
    mind the contribution from rain water, the savings could have been higher. Nevertheless,
    in order to choose one irrigation methods or the other, it would be necessary
    to keep registering the information during at least two more seasons. Endive plant
    requires consistent levels of water (near reference demand levels) throughout
    its rapid growth and final development periods. Reductions in the available water
    during these growth periods can result in reduced leaf development (Maynard et
    al., 1999), so that it is important to maintain the moisture content of the soil
    near field capacity at depths where the root system is located practically throughout
    the growth cycle. Fig. 7b plots the last days of the crop cycle (DOY 76–103),
    illustrating the high Ψm values and the evolution dynamics of the θv. Soil moisture
    (Hydra Probe II) and soil matric potential sensors (MPS-2) show the high irrigation
    frequency and the little variation in the minimum humidity values reached, with
    a slight increasing trend close to harvesting. The information provided by these
    sensors was of great help for maintaining the moisture content of the soil at
    field capacity values at the depths explored by the root system of the crops.
    Fig. 7c shows the evolution of the volumetric water content of the substrate measured
    in three different pots using a GS3 sensor inserted at mid-depth. As can be seen,
    there is no clearly defined pattern as the water content changes constantly. In
    the period 76–103 DOY, θv gradually fell over 8 consecutive days before sharply
    increasing. This was followed by another reduction and then a permanent recovery.
    Regardless of the grower''s irrigation procedure, Fig. 7c shows: (i) similar patterns
    in the water content evolution in the three pots located in different rows, (ii)
    rapid drainage during the final period and (iii) noise-free representation in
    a substrate where others sensors might have contact problems. It must be taken
    into account that good soil drainage in this kind of cultivation practice is essential
    to avoid root rotting. Fig. 7d plots the water conductivity and volume of the
    irrigation reservoir used to irrigate several nearby fields. The ES-2 sensor used
    to measure the conductivity of the water is of key importance to maintain the
    water quality in the desired range. As shown in Fig. 7d, the value of the conductivity
    during the measurement period was below 2200 μS cm−1. The LMK 807 measured the
    volume during the same period. The variation in the EC was evident when taking
    water for irrigation or adding water from the wells and the desalination plant.
    The information shown in Fig. 7d is of great help for mixing the water from the
    different sources to attain the conductivity required levels. 3.2. Power and energy
    consumption results In order to analyze the power consumption of the device, an
    exhaustive energetic analysis of each scenario was carried out to determine the
    most suitable battery and solar panel needed to make the device energetically
    autonomous. A detailed explanation about the power consumption of the woody crop
    node in the worst-case scenario, that is, a sample rate of 10 min and a sending
    rate of 1 h, is given below. The node has eight functional states, numbered as
    follows: (1) initialization and configuration, (2) standby, (3) interface warm-up,
    (4) digital sensor data acquisition, (5) analogue sensor data acquisition, (6)
    SD-Card data storage, (7) GPRS standby and (8) GPRS module transmission. The measurements
    of the current reported in this paper were taken with a YOKOGAWA WT210 digital
    wattmeter and WTVIEWER software. Fig. 8 shows an example sequence of the power
    consumption of the node when the system is functioning. After initialization and
    configuration, the data are collected from the sensors, first from the digital
    sensors and finally from the analogue sensors. After that, the data is stored
    in the SD-Card. The sequence of states (3), (4), (5) and (6), is repeated every
    10 min (sample rate). After 1 h (sending rate), all the sensor data collected
    before and available in the card are sent to the server. After that, the system
    returns to standby mode, until the next scheduled reading process. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 8. Woody crop node power consumption. The ultimate
    aim of this study was to determine how much current the device consumes on average,
    so as to relate the resulting figure directly with the capacity of the batteries
    and hence determine the device''s autonomy. The average current consumption of
    the GPRS node may be determined thus: (1) Each of the current components is explained
    in Table 3. To calculate the autonomy of the node, worst-case scenarios were assumed
    for each measurement. Thus, expression (2) shows sensor system consumption in
    standby mode. Eq. (3) expresses the estimated average current consumed by the
    device in the process of initialization. Expressions (4), (5), (6), (7) are calculated
    in the same way. The interval between samplings considered in this study was 10
    min, which is the worst-case scenario regarding energy consumption, although the
    average sampling period in real deployments is 15 min. Expressions (8), (9) are
    calculated in the same way. Table 3. Current components and their description.
    Type of current Description Current consumed in standby mode Current consumed
    in the process of initialization the GPRS node Current consumed with the current
    converters in active mode Current consumed by digital sensors. One MSP-2 for woody
    crop Current consumed by analogue sensors. Three HS10 for woody crop Current consumed
    in the process of storing data in the flash memory Current consumed in the process
    of establishing the connection with the phone cell Current consumed in sending
    of data to the server Considering an average current consumption of 5.93 mA (1),
    the next step is to choose a battery and a solar panel that enables the node to
    be completely autonomous. In order to achieve this, several tests were carried
    out with a wide spectrum of commercial batteries before the decision was made
    to use a LI103450A battery, a 1900 mAh Li-ion rechargeable battery with a nominal
    voltage of 3.7 V, equipped with a protection circuit that prevents overcharging
    as well as deep discharging. With this battery and considering the scenario presented,
    expression (10) estimates autonomy of the woody crop node without solar panels,
    which is around 13.35 days. The Sensor-Board has a circuit that manages the load
    based on the switching of an external solar panel. Using this battery in conjunction
    with a solar panel of 0.8 W (with a rated voltage of 5 V and a rated current of
    160 mA) will allow the node to be completely autonomous even under prolonged poor
    light condition. (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) To test the selected battery
    and solar panel, a validation test was conducted over a period of four months
    (from January to April 2014). A woody crop node was set up in Miranda (Cartagena)
    in a 4 ha mandarin orchard. Fig. 9 shows in detail the voltage recorded over a
    period of 28 days in which the battery voltage was kept between the desired values
    thanks to the solar panel and the charging algorithm. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Woody crop node battery voltage. The consumption of all the nodes
    was also analyzed in Table 4. This Table 4 shows the mean power consumption of
    the device for the different scenarios, considering sampling rate values of between
    10 and 60 min and sending rates from 1 to 12 h. Logically, the higher the sampling
    rate, the more power the device needs to operate and so the power consumption
    is increased. Increasing the sample rate provides more information in less time.
    If the sending rate is reduced, the information will be available sooner but the
    device will be less efficient energetically as very few samples will be sent during
    each GSM/GPRS connection. After analyzing the table, it was concluded that the
    sending rate has a greater effect in scenarios where the power consumption of
    the sensors is low (Irrigation reservoir node, vegetable node); however, in scenarios
    where the sensors have a higher power consumption (woody crop node), the sending
    rate is of little importance for the overall power consumption of the device.

    4, the device sent multiple samples during each connection in order to optimize
    the battery in scenarios where real time is not necessary. Fig. 10 shows the current
    consumption of all the nodes for a sampling rate of 15 min and above, and in case
    that real time information is needed; that is, as soon as the sensor information
    is read, the data is sent to the server, so the information for the user is available
    in real time. In these scenarios, the power consumption increased in every case
    but was still acceptable given the specifications of the device. Download : Download

    paper describes the design, optimization and development of a practical application
    to optimize water resources in irrigated agriculture by monitoring soil water
    status and the irrigation water. The article shows the technical challenges addressed
    in terms of WSNs and GSM/GPRS network communications, the sensors used and their
    configuration and energy optimization in a system based on a distributed architecture.
    To highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed system, several case
    studies have been presented with the aim of analyzing the behaviour of the device
    in real scenarios. It is concluded that the sensor nodes are of great help to
    reach the desired moisture conditions at the different depths and to maintain
    water electrical conductivity level of the irrigation reservoir at the desired
    value, thus contributing to the ability to adapt the irrigation strategy according
    to each situation. The development of a small, compact and autonomous unit is
    of key importance for convenient use in agricultural facilities, so as not to
    interfere with field operations, avoid the theft of material and allow installation.
    To make the system compatible with commercial sensors, it has been necessary to
    adapt the device to the different interfaces adopted by sensors’ vendors. The
    sampling rate of the sensors and sending rate using a GPRS connection is important
    considerations when estimating the power consumption of the device. In the performed
    tests, the sampling rate was adjusted to 15 min and the sending rate to 30 min.
    These rates are considered a good choice for correct agronomic decisions and for
    maintaining the complete autonomy of the device with an adequate battery and solar

    113 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Soil moisture plays a critical role in improving
    the weather and climate forecast and understanding terrestrial ecosystem processes.
    It is a key hydrologic variable in agricultural drought monitoring, flood forecasting,
    and irrigation management as well. Satellite retrievals can provide unprecedented
    soil moisture information at the global scale; however, the products are generally
    provided at coarse resolutions (25–50 km2). This often hampers their use in regional
    or local studies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture
    Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was launched in January 2015 aiming to
    acquire soil moisture and freeze-thaw states over the globe with 2 to 3 days revisit
    frequency. This work presents a new framework based on an ensemble learning method
    while using atmospheric and geophysical information derived from remote-sensing
    and ground-based observations to downscale the level 3 daily composite version
    (L3_SM_P) of SMAP radiometer soil moisture over the Continental United States
    at 1-km spatial resolution. In the proposed method, a suite of remotely sensed
    and in situ data sets are used, including soil texture and topography data among
    other information. The downscaled product was validated against in situ soil moisture
    measurements collected from two high density validation sites and 300 sparse soil
    moisture networks throughout the Continental United States. On average, the unbiased
    Root Mean Square Error between the downscaled SMAP soil moisture data and in-situ
    soil moisture observations adequately met the SMAP soil moisture retrieval accuracy
    requirement of 0.04 m3/m3. In addition, other statistical measures, that is, Pearson
    correlation coefficient and bias, showed satisfactory results. Key Points Downscaled
    SMAP soil moisture at 1 km provides opportunities for fine resolution hydrologic
    modeling with operational implications The method uses a suite of atmospheric
    and geophysical information The downscaled SMAP is validated against measurements
    collected from core validation sites and 300 sparse soil moisture networks 1 Introduction
    Soil moisture has an important role in the global water and energy balance, affecting
    hydrological and atmospheric cycles, drought conditions, irrigation management,
    and so many other processes. Over the last decade, the development of remote sensing
    technologies has provided the possibility that this environmental variable is
    more accessible than before. Nowadays, remotely sensed satellite products have
    become the only feasible way to reach an unprecedented amount of soil moisture
    data on both spatial and temporal scales, which is practically unachievable from
    in situ observation networks (Kerr, 2007; Njoku & Entekhabi, 1996; Peng et al.,
    2016). In the last couple of decades, although prodigious efforts have gone to
    retrieving soil moisture through various active and passive microwave remote sensing
    satellites, inevitably, they have some limitations. For example, active sensors
    like the European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS) provide observations that are
    significantly affected by the scattering produced by surface roughness (Verhoest
    et al., 2008) and vegetation structure (Wagner et al., 2013). Unlike the active
    sensors, passive microwave radiometers are much less sensitive to scattering,
    but their products are at coarse resolutions or their sensing depths are shallow
    (Molero et al., 2016). For instance, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth
    Observing System with C-band of 6.9 GHz has footprint of 74 × 43 km2 that provides
    soil moisture from the 0–1- or 0–2-cm topsoil layer, while with smaller footprints,
    its X-band penetration depth is less than 5 mm (Su et al., 2013). In contrast,
    through L-band radiometer, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) can estimate
    soil moisture at around 5-cm depth with a repeat cycle of ~3 days. This satellite
    has a coarse spatial resolution (35–55 km2), which makes it inappropriate for
    local and regional scale applications (Djamai et al., 2016). Recent studies have
    shown that both the passive and active sensors have to come into play in order
    to access reliable remotely sensed soil moisture data (Owe et al., 2008; Petropoulos
    et al., 2015). Launched in 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite provides high-resolution
    soil moisture on a global scale by combining L-band (passive) brightness temperatures
    and high resolution L-band (active) radar backscatter data (Entekhabi, Njoku,
    et al., 2010). Unfortunately, due to a malfunction of the SMAP radar instrument
    on July 2015, since then the radiometer instrument has been the only operational
    instrument of SMAP satellite and been providing the level 2 soil moisture product
    (L2_SM_P; Chan et al., 2016). The assessment of SMAP radiometer observations corroborates
    the effectiveness of this procedure against Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
    signals. Over densely vegetated areas where SMOS is more prone to RFI contamination,
    SMAP is more capable of retrieving soil moisture (Chan et al., 2016). Using brightness
    temperature, SMAP satellite provides soil moisture on the 36-km grid cell from
    both ascending (6:00 pm) and descending (6:00 am) passes. Although the SMAP soil
    moisture observation has a decent spatial resolution for global and continental
    scale applications, it cannot be used directly for regional or local studies,
    such as agriculture and drought monitoring, unless a fine resolution of this product
    is available (from 1 to 10 km2; Entekhabi, Njoku, et al., 2010). To circumvent
    this problem, on January 2017, NASA released a new product named the enhanced
    SMAP radiometer. In this data set, the standard SMAP data gridded at 36 km are
    interpolated into 9-km grid spacing using the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation
    algorithm. Despite such progress, some land surface applications such as water
    resources management, agricultural, and crop production still require soil moisture
    at finer resolutions, from a kilometer to subkilometer scale. Over the last few
    years, a large number of approaches have been developed to downscale the coarse
    resolution of different satellite soil moisture products, such as SMOS (Djamai
    et al., 2015, 2016; Lievens et al., 2016; Merlin et al., 2008; Molero et al.,
    2016; Panciera et al., 2008; Piles et al., 2011, 2014, 2016) and Advanced Microwave
    Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (Choi & Hur, 2012; Sahoo et al., 2013;
    Song et al., 2014; Zhao & Li, 2013). Among these attempts, Machine Learning (ML)
    techniques have recently received remarkable attention owing to their superb intelligence
    capability in downscaling satellite products (Alemohammad et al., 2018; Coulibaly
    et al., 2005; Goyal et al., 2012; Hashmi et al., 2011; Im et al., 2016; Kaheil
    et al., 2008; Kolassa et al., 2018; Raje & Mujumdar, 2011; Rodriguez-Fernandez
    et al., 2015; Srivastava et al., 2013; Valverde et al., 2014; Zerenner et al.,
    2016). ML is a class of data analysis methods that allows computers to find the
    hidden pattern of a phenomenon through learning from data in an intelligent way.
    More investigations have shown that Random Forest (RF) algorithm in comparison
    with other ML approaches is more suitable for downscaling the satellite products
    (He et al., 2016; Hutengs & Vohland, 2016; Im et al., 2016; Jing et al., 2016;
    Ke et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017; Pelletier et al., 2016). This is due to the
    fact that RF model is much more flexible through randomization and adopts an ensemble
    approach. In this paper, we use the RF model in order to downscale the standard
    SMAP soil moisture radiometer product gridded at 36- to 1-km resolution over the
    Continental United States (CONUS) for the year 2015 (April to December). In this
    study, we develop multiple RF models based on soil properties of topsoil (0–5
    cm) and use them collectively to better estimate the soil moisture not only at
    a finer spatial resolution but also over a very large region with different climate
    and land surface characteristics. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 summarizes both satellite and ground-based observations used in this
    research and describes concisely the study area. Section 9 elaborates on the developed
    soil moisture downscaling approach. The results and discussions are included in
    section 12. The conclusions of this paper and recommendations for future works
    are in the final section of the paper. 2 Remotely Sensed and Ground-Based Observations
    2.1 SMAP Radiometer Soil Moisture Data SMAP satellite with a sensing depth of
    5 cm provides soil moisture on a global scale. Over the CONUS, SMAP was calibrated
    and validated against in situ measurements collected from several Core Validation
    Sites (CVSs) with the aim of reducing the unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE)
    below 0.04 m3/m3 (Colliander, Jackson, et al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2016). In
    this study, we propose a soil moisture downscaling framework to downscale the
    SMAP descending overpass (L3_SM_P) over the CONUS. The L3_SM_P is a daily composite
    of L2_SM_P product. This soil moisture data can be assessed from the NASA Distributed
    Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. We use the soil
    moisture product entitled “SMAP L3 Radiometer Global Daily 36 km EASE-Grid Soil
    Moisture, Version 3 (SPL3SMP)”, which is available at https://nsidc.org/data/smap/smap-data.html.
    2.2 MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) Over the past few years, vegetation index and surface temperature
    have been widely used for downscaling satellite soil moisture data (Fang & Lakshmi,
    2014; Im et al., 2016; Merlin et al., 2008, 2015; Peng et al., 2015; Piles et
    al., 2011; Song et al., 2014; Srivastava et al., 2013). These land surface parameters
    are available from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument.
    The common use of this geostationary satellite is due to its high temporal resolution
    that provides more cloud-free observations. The MODIS is a key instrument of the
    NASA Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua platforms for monitoring the seasonality
    of global terrestrial vegetation. MODIS is a multispectral sensor. Its spectral
    bands range from visible, near infrared, to thermal infrared, making it ubiquitous
    in many land, ocean, and atmospheric research studies. The equatorial crossing
    time for Terra and Aqua satellites are 10:30 am (descending) and 1:30 pm (ascending),
    respectively. In this study, in order to be consistent with the SMAP data, the
    daytime overpass for Terra in the descending node is used to collect MODIS Land
    Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI data. The MODIS products are the version-5
    MODIS-Terra 1-km resolution daily LST data and the version-5 MODIS-Terra 1-km
    resolution 16-day NDVI data (data sets MOD11A1 and MOD13A2, respectively). MOD11A1
    is composed of daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures. MOD13A2 is atmospherically
    corrected data set. The MODIS products are retrieved from the NASA Land Processes
    Distributed Active Archive Center at the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
    Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLT/).
    2.3 NWS Precipitation Data The most obvious way the atmosphere affects soil moisture
    is through precipitation (Crow et al., 2012). The soil moisture spatial and temporal
    variations are strongly correlated with the precipitation patterns. The teleconnection
    of precipitation regimes on the soil moisture variability has been corroborated
    by many studies at regional and global scales (Jones & Brunsell, 2009; Seneviratne
    et al., 2010). In this study, National Weather Service (NWS) precipitation data
    along with other atmospheric and geophysical information are used to investigate
    the usefulness of these climate variables in estimating soil moisture at finer
    resolution. The NWS operations at the River Forecast Centers provide quality controlled
    and multisensor precipitation data with a spatial resolution of roughly 4 km2
    over the CONUS, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. The data are presented at 24-hourly accumulation
    that is the end of the “hydrologic day,” a standard for river modeling. This product
    is primarily used to simulate streamflow across the CONUS (http://water.weather.gov/precip/).
    2.4 CONUS-SOIL Data Soil texture is defined as the proportion of small (clay),
    medium (silt), and large (sand) particles in a specific soil mass. This property
    of soil significantly affects the soil moisture profile, since it influences water
    infiltration rate, permeability, and water storage. Soil texture heterogeneity
    dominates the soil moisture spatial structure (Mattikalli et al., 1998). Many
    studies corroborated the utilization of soil texture data as an important source
    of information for downscaling soil moisture maps (Chakrabarti, Bongiovanni, et
    al., 2016; Mascaro et al., 2011; Ranney et al., 2015; Reichle et al., 2001; Shin
    & Mohanty, 2013). In this study, we use soil texture information from the CONUS-SOIL
    data set. CONUS-SOIL data set is specifically used for regional climate and hydrologic
    modeling over the CONUS (Miller & White, 1998). This product is available at 1
    km, which generates a spatial representation of soil texture and other properties
    of soil surface for a wide range of land surface models. CONUS-SOIL discretizes
    each soil property in 11 depth layers (up to 250 cm) where each layer is classified
    by 12 standard soil texture classes. Since SMAP provides soil moisture at the
    top 5 cm of the soil column, we only use the first layer of soil with depth of
    5 cm to extract the soil texture information. Supporting information Figure S1
    illustrates the soil texture of top 5-cm soil layer over the CONUS. CONUS-SOIL
    is available in both gridded and vector formats and can be retrieved via http://www.soilinfo.psu.edu/.
    2.5 GTOPO30 Topography Data Topographic data such as slope, aspect, curvature,
    and elevation significantly affect the distribution of soil moisture, specifically
    in the topsoil layer, at different scales (Crow et al., 2012). Elevation is known
    as one of the most effective topographic features in many studies to downscale
    coarse-scale soil moisture maps (Busch et al., 2012; Coleman & Niemann, 2013;
    Mascaro et al., 2011; Pellenq et al., 2003; Ranney et al., 2015; Wilson et al.,
    2005). Hence, we use this variable in our proposed approach to downscale the SMAP
    soil moisture data. GTOPO30 is a global Digital Elevation Model developed by USGS
    Earth Resources Observation and Science Data Center in late 1996. This data set
    has an approximately 1-km spatial resolution. Figure S2 shows the Digital Elevation
    Model with colors representing the variation of elevation from 0 to 4,587 m above
    sea level. More information along with the data set can be found at https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/GTOPO30.
    In this study, we used this data set, although there are other topography data
    products available, such as Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and National Elevation
    Dataset, which alternatively could be used. 2.6 In Situ Soil Moisture Observations
    The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) sensors provide the soil information,
    such as soil moisture and soil temperature, at five different depths (5, 10, 20,
    50, and 100 cm). Figure S2 demonstrates the USCRN stations located at 114 sites
    across the CONUS. The grid spacing of these sensors was determined so as to competently
    represent the U.S. annual temperature and precipitation variance. The soil moisture
    and soil temperature for each station are obtained from three independent samples
    of soil located in a 5-m radius around the main instrument tower. This leads not
    only to an accurate measurement of such quantities but also yields a more realistic
    representation of soil properties in a specified location. The USCRN records the
    soil moisture profile at 5-min intervals and transmits them as hourly data for
    satellite calibration/validation purposes. The Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN)
    sensors monitor soil moisture content at five different depths (5, 10, 20, 50,
    and 100 cm approximately), air temperature, relative humidity, and some other
    climate variables mainly over the agricultural areas. In this study, we use 186
    SCAN sensors that have been in operation for the period of the study. The SCAN
    sensors measure the soil moisture values hourly to aid different applications
    such as drought assessment/monitoring and satellite soil moisture validation.
    Both USCRN and SCAN sensors report the soil moisture in the volumetric unit (m3/m3).
    Figure S2 shows a map of SCAN soil moisture sensors located at 186 sites throughout
    the CONUS. USCRN instruments are scattered uniformly across the United States,
    while SCAN stations are installed in certain areas to accommodate specific research
    needs (Coopersmith et al., 2015). These two soil moisture networks have also been
    used for the validation of SMAP product (Jackson et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2016;
    Velpuri et al., 2015). 3 The Proposed Satellite Soil Moisture Downscaling Approach
    This section elaborates the developed methodology in two separate subsections.
    In section 9, we present the theoretical basis of the proposed downscaling framework.
    Section 10 explains the ensemble learning algorithm used in section 9. 3.1 Soil
    Moisture Downscaling Framework To downscale SMAP radiometer soil moisture, we
    use those high-resolution data sets that are known to be strongly associated with
    the soil moisture spatial and dynamical heterogeneities. As discussed in the previous
    section, the covariates including NDVI, surface temperature, precipitation, elevation,
    and soil texture are available at the appropriate resolutions and expected to
    have reasonable explanatory power on the soil moisture profile at different scales.
    Atmospheric covariates (i.e., precipitation and surface temperature) are used
    to maintain the temporal dynamics of the downscaled soil moisture. Geophysical
    covariates (i.e., soil texture and elevation) are included to capture the spatial
    patterns and variability of the downscaled soil moisture. Auxiliary covariates,
    such as NDVI (as a measure of greenness), are also included to account for the
    influence of vegetation dynamics on the downscaled soil moisture spatial and temporal
    patterns. In this study, we use RF as an ensemble learning approach to formulate
    the downscaling framework. The basis of this technique and its implementation
    will be explained in detail later in section 10. The main contribution of this
    research is to introduce a new way to incorporate the aforementioned atmospheric
    and geophysical variables into the RF model, leading to improved estimates of
    soil moisture at finer resolutions. The following steps summarize the structure
    of the proposed soil moisture downscaling scheme. Classify the in situ soil moisture
    stations (i.e., SCAN and USCRN) according to their soil texture properties. The
    results are shown in Table 1. As mentioned in section 5, only the soil texture
    of the top 5-cm soil layer is used in this study in order to be consistent with
    the SMAP''s sensing depth. Further investigation indicates that SCAN and USCRN
    in situ stations are distributed proportionally to be representative of different
    climate conditions and soil texture classes over CONUS. The study area is mostly
    dominated by loamy (24.5%), silty loam (24.3%), and sandy loam (22.6%) surface
    soil layers. These land surfaces encompass more than 200 stations for the soil
    moisture monitoring. Sandy clay loam, silty, and sandy clay soil types altogether
    cover less than 0.5% of the CONUS area. Only one station was found from the entire
    installed instruments throughout the CONUS that monitors the soil moisture for
    these rare land surfaces. As shown in Table 1, sandy loam with 22.6% surface soil
    coverage comprises 72 stations across CONUS, while clay loam with 4.2% encompasses
    12 instruments. The same analogy can be applied to those regions characterized
    by sandy and loamy sand soil textures. This implies a relatively fair distribution
    of soil moisture instruments over the CONUS. It should be noted that some of the
    land surface layers are not considered in the proposed downscaling model since
    they either do not incorporate soil moisture stations (e.g., silty and sandy clay)
    or they include nonsoil layers (e.g., bedrock and water). Overall, these land
    surfaces cover a negligible (less than 0.5%) portion of the CONUS area. Table

    CONUS = Continental United States. As shown in Table 1, there are nine stations
    installed throughout the CONUS whose prevailing soil type is clay. It is important
    to know that these stations are not necessarily located on clay soil layer. Indeed,
    these stations are situated in the regions whose dominant soil type within a 1-km
    grid cell is clay. Using those classified in-situ stations in the first step,
    we develop 12 distinct RF models. Each of these will downscale the SMAP radiometer
    soil moisture over a specific land surface layer. For example, for the clay soil
    type, nine stations provide a data collection with 2,448 rows and 6 columns. The
    2,448 is calculated by 9 × 272, where 272 refers to the period of study (1 April
    2015 until 31 December 2015). Six columns indicate five input covariates (including
    NDVI, surface temperature, precipitation, elevation, and SMAP soil moisture data)
    and one output variable (in situ soil moisture data). The dimension of this data
    set may decrease if it contains missing values. It is important to note that the
    input data are extracted from those points (latitudes and longitudes) where the
    in situ stations are located. In this study, we randomly separate 80% of the data
    collection to train the model, and the rest of the data (20%) is used to verify
    the model. By trial and error, we found that this set of model calibration and
    verification data set (80/20), although not significant, results in better model
    performance as compared to other combinations. The random splitting of the data
    set ensures that the developed model is able to generalize well to unseen data
    and to avoid overtraining. Thus, the developed RF model can be well suited for
    the soil moisture prediction at different geographical locations with different
    land-atmosphere characteristics. The CONUS area is divided into different subregions
    based on the soil texture of the top 5-cm soil layer. The results in percentage
    of CONUS was reported in Table 1. The SMAP soil moisture over each of these regions
    is downscaled to 1-km spatial resolution using the corresponding calibrated RF
    model in step 2. 3.2 RF The principle of the proposed downscaling approach is
    to build a function that maps the input covariates to the output variable using
    the following equations: (1) (2) where SMd is the downscaled soil moisture data
    (response), C is an input vector, ci represents the input covariates (i.e., precipitation,
    surface temperature, elevation, original SMAP, and NDVI), and N is the input vector
    dimension (in this study N is equal to 5). In this formulation, depending on the
    relationship between response variables and input covariates, f can be a nonlinear
    or a linear function. Although implementation of such regression-based model is
    easy, one drawback of this model is that it generally provides a single estimate
    and does not represent the uncertainty associated with the estimates. The approach
    taken in this study to characterize the uncertainty in our downscaling is the
    ensemble learning approach, such as RF. The idea of searching over random subset
    of decision rules while splitting nodes was first initiated by Amit and Geman
    (1997); later on, Breiman (2001) developed this idea and introduced the RF. RF
    is a ML technique, which is most appropriate for regression and classification
    problems. The adaptive, randomized, and decorrelated features of decision rules
    involved in RF make it more suitable approach when the relationship between the
    predictors and the response variable is complex and highly nonlinear. For a regression
    problem, first, a number of decision trees are built during the training phase,
    and then the mean prediction of these trees is calculated as the output of this
    approach. RF divides the input feature space into many regression trees, known
    as forest, where each tree is generated using a bootstrap sample. A bootstrap
    sample contains about two thirds of the training input data, and the left samples
    (one third) are used for the validation of each tree. This is one of the key features
    of RF algorithm (also known as out-of-bag samples) to estimate the model generalization
    error. This approach is based on the bagging (bootstrap aggregation) method that
    combines the results of many decision trees to reduce the chance of overfitting
    and improve the generalization. RF can be easily implemented in a parallel computing
    platform, which makes it more advantageous for large-scale problems (Breiman,
    2001). As previously mentioned, we randomly split the data set into two groups
    (using the 80% of data) to train and (using the 20% of data) to verify the RF
    model. The random splitting of the data set for model calibration and verification
    ensures the generalizability of the developed downscaling approach. In step 1,
    a bootstrap method is used to sample M subsets from the training data sets. In
    step 2, M independent regression trees are built to train the model using the
    bootstrapped samples. In step 3, the predicted value is obtained over M replications.
    In step 4, the final result is taken as the average of the individual tree outputs.
    This model selects a random subset of predictors in each decision tree to inject
    randomness in the RF model, which in turn alleviates the redundancy of predictors
    and diversifies the forecast decision trees (He et al., 2016). The ensemble posterior
    is calculated by averaging M posteriors as follows: pt(SMd| C) specifies the conditional
    distribution of the downscaled soil moisture (SMd) given the bootstrapped samples
    from the training input covariate vector (C). (3) In this study, we used MATLAB
    TreeBagger built-in function to implement the RF algorithm. In the developed downscaling
    framework, each of the 12 RF models has been set to have 100 decision trees. This
    value was obtained using trial and error method, such that any value more than
    this does not improve the downscaling accuracy. This issue will be further discussed
    in the next section. Up to this point, we developed multiple RF models to map
    input covariates to a target variable. The next step is to implement the calibrated
    models on the test data sets to evaluate the model robustness and generalizability.

    and Discussions In this study, we discuss the results in three parts. Section
    12 reports the performance of the developed RF models. Section 13 presents the
    comparison of the downscaled SMAP soil moisture products versus 300 sparse soil
    moisture networks throughout the CONUS. In section 16, the downscaled SMAP soil
    moisture data are validated against in situ soil moisture measurements collected
    from two CVSs. 4.1 Performance of the Proposed Downscaling Algorithm In this study,
    we used the Pearson correlation coefficient “R” (Gan et al., 2014), “ubRMSE” (Entekhabi,
    Reichle, et al., 2010), and bias to measure the performance of the proposed downscaling
    algorithm. R is a common index to measure the strength of a linear association
    between two quantitative variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated
    at a 95% confidence level and ranges between −1 and 1. The bias measures the average
    tendency of overestimation (positive value) or underestimation (negative value)
    of the simulated data. The ideal value of bias is 0, showing a more accurate model
    simulation. The standard “RMSE” is very sensitive to biases in either the mean
    or the amplitude of variations. This bias can easily be removed by using the ubRMSE.
    The ubRMSE is a metric that SMAP uses to report the product accuracy. For soil
    moisture retrievals, the aforementioned metrics provide a more comprehensive description
    of product quality compared to other measures (Jackson et al., 2012). The SMAP
    mission requirement for soil moisture product accuracy is ubRMSE = 0.040 m3/m3
    (Chan et al., 2016). As mentioned earlier, the first step in developing the proposed
    downscaling scheme in this study is to calibrate and verify the RF models using
    the atmospheric and geophysical data sampled from locations where in situ observations
    are available. The distribution pattern of in situ soil moisture sensors over
    CONUS according to their soil texture properties makes it possible to develop
    12 RF models to downscale soil moisture over more than 98% of the CONUS area.
    Figure 2 illustrates the performance of the developed soil moisture downscaling
    algorithm. Here we reported only the results of the verification step, which implies
    the ability of the calibrated models to generalize to unseen data. The statistical
    performance measures shown in this figure indicate that there is a very good agreement
    between the simulated and observed soil moisture values over different soil texture
    classes with different land-atmosphere couplings. In this study, we noticed that
    using only a single RF model would have generated a significant bias in model
    prediction and led to a worse model fit; however, as results indicate, multiple
    RF models classified based on the stations'' soil texture properties simultaneously
    minimize the bias throughout the simulation process and enhance the model performance.
    The developed models based on those regions with abundant soil moisture stations
    (i.e., loamy, silty loam, and sandy loam) would be more reliable to predict the
    soil moisture and less prone to uncertainty than those areas with limited soil
    moisture sensors (i.e., silty clay and sandy clay loam). We also realized that
    although increasing the number of decision trees from 10 to 100 in random forest
    algorithm does not show significant improvement in model calibration and validation
    steps, it does so in downscaling step and generating the downscaled soil moisture
    data with higher accuracy. Also, it should be mentioned that using more than 100
    decision trees does not enhance the downscaling accuracy and instead only makes
    the proposed approach computationally more intensive. Figure 2 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Verification results of the developed Random Forest models for
    each group of soil texture over Continental United States. ubRMSE = unbiased Root
    Mean Square Error. In the next step, these calibrated and verified models will
    be used to downscale the SMAP radiometer soil moisture from 36- to 1-km spatial
    resolution over CONUS for the period of 1 April 2015 to 31 December 2015. 4.2
    Downscaled SMAP Soil Moistures Versus In Situ Observations In this section, we
    compare the downscaled SMAP soil moistures at 1-km spatial resolution with those
    SCAN and USCRN in situ soil moisture observations scattered throughout the CONUS.
    Figure 3 reports the results indicating a consistently high correlation between
    the downscaled SMAP and in situ soil moistures almost everywhere across the CONUS
    except for a few isolated points with slightly low correlation in the Rocky Mountains.
    The same analogy and pattern is discernible for ubRMSE. The CONUS average correlation
    and ubRMSE values are highlighted in each subplot in Figure 3. The average correlations
    between downscaled SMAP and in situ data are 0.65 (SCAN) and 0.70 (CRN). The average
    ubRMSE is reported as 0.047 and 0.040 m3/m3, respectively, for SCAN and USCRN
    networks. More investigation also reveals a negligible amount of bias between
    the downscaled SMAP product and in situ observations. Such that the average bias
    is reported at 0.004 and 0.002 m3/m3, respectively, for SCAN and USCRN networks
    (not illustrated in Figure 3). These results are encouraging compared with those
    obtained from original SMAP soil moisture products as they show overestimation
    over arid regions with bare soils and underestimation over cold vegetated areas
    (Ma et al., 2017). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Correlation and ubRMSE
    calculated between in situ observations (SCAN and USCRN) and downscaled SMAP.
    ubRMSE = unbiased Root Mean Square Error; SCAN = Soil Climate Analysis Network;
    USCRN = U.S. Climate Reference Network; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive. For
    a few instruments on the East and West coasts, the model failed to meet the SMAP
    accuracy requirement (8 stations out of 300, not shown in Figure 3). The reason
    behind this may be attributed either to RFI signals that would contaminate the
    soil moisture retrievals over the stations located in densely vegetated areas
    or to the spatial mismatch of the SMAP footprint. Each of these cases may create
    an obstacle to retrieving the SMAP soil moisture data. For example, “CA Bodega
    6 WSW” is one of those eight stations, which is located on the Pacific West Coast
    at Bodega Bay, California. This station is occupied by sandy soil. The SMAP pixel
    over this region may have been more susceptible either to the attenuation of microwave
    signal by the vegetation or to flooding due to heavy rainfall throughout the year.
    Hence, the SMAP pixel for this region is most often missing or discarded by the
    SMAP data quality flag, which leads to a worse downscaling result over corresponding
    in situ stations. Despite such limitation, the downscaled SMAP soil moistures
    correlate well with in situ observation networks over almost entire CONUS, including
    those mountainous and forested areas in the Eastern and Southeastern United States.
    These areas are generally challenging for retrieving soil moisture due to the
    attenuation of microwave signal by the vegetation. Figure 3 also implies the better
    performance of downscaled SMAP soil moisture over bare soils in comparison with
    vegetated soils. Although the reported results are promising, they may not be
    fully indicative of the effectiveness of the proposed downscaling algorithm; therefore,
    we compare the results from the proposed approach with those obtained from a uniform
    disaggregation approach, where the value of fine-resolution grid cell is set to
    be the same value as its correspondent coarse-resolution grid cell. Figure 4 illustrates
    this comparison and shows that the proposed downscaling approach significantly
    outperforms the uniform disaggregation approach. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Comparison of downscaling accuracy between the proposed approach and
    the uniform disaggregation approach. Both Soil Climate Analysis Network and U.S.
    Climate Reference Network in situ observations were used in this analysis. ubRMSE
    = unbiased Root Mean Square Error; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive. To analyze
    the importance of each input variable, that is, NDVI, surface temperature, precipitation,
    and topography, on the downscaling accuracy, we performed a leave-one-out approach
    where one input variable was removed and the downscaling was implemented. Therefore,
    the proposed downscaling algorithm is run under four different input schemes as
    follows: Scheme 1. {NDVI, surface temperature, precipitation} + SMAP. Scheme 2.
    {NDVI, surface temperature, topography} + SMAP. Scheme 3. {surface temperature,
    precipitation, topography} + SMAP. Scheme 4. {NDVI, precipitation, topography}
    + SMAP. Figure 5 reports the results in four subplots. All three performance measures
    are also shown in this figure. The results confirmed that NDVI, surface temperature,
    and precipitation have almost similar influence on the downscaling accuracy; however,
    topography shows to be less influential than other variables on the results. By
    comparing the results in Figure 4 (where all input variables were taken into account)
    with those in this figure, it is seen that the inclusion of all input variables
    in the downscaling framework is essential for achieving the best downscaling accuracy.
    It is important to note that since the objective of this study is to downscale
    SMAP product, SMAP data must be included in all four input schemes. Figure 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint The performance of the proposed downscaling approach
    under four different input schemes. Both Soil Climate Analysis Network and U.S.
    Climate Reference Network in situ observations were used in this analysis. ubRMSE
    = unbiased Root Mean Square Error; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive. In Figure
    6, we use the Taylor (2001) diagram to provide a conclusive comparison between
    the performance of the downscaled SMAP by the proposed approach and the in situ
    soil moisture measurements at daily time scale collected from 186 SCAN and 114
    USCRN stations scattered across the CONUS. The Taylor diagram graphically summarizes
    several important statistical indices to compare the similarity/dissimilarity
    between two patterns. This figure can be generated using three statistical metrics.
    Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) is extensively used to assess the performance
    of satellite soil moisture products versus in situ measurements (Merlin et al.,
    2015). This metric integrates the three main components, namely, time series correlation,
    mean bias, and bias in the variance to evaluate the quality of data. The standard
    deviation ratio between the downscaled and in situ soil moisture is on the radial
    distance, and their correlation is on the angle of the polar plot. The black point
    shown in Figure 6 is named as the reference point, where all the metrics are considered
    optimal. The distance to this point indicates the centered normalized RMSD between
    the downscaled soil moisture and in situ soil moisture patterns. Figure 6 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint The accuracy of downscaled Soil Moisture Active Passive
    soil moisture versus in situ soil moisture observations collected from 186 SCAN
    and 114 USCRN stations for study period 01 April 2015 to 31 December 2015. RMSD
    is represented by green dashed line, while correlation coefficient is displayed
    by blue dotted line. SCAN = Soil Climate Analysis Network; USCRN = U.S. Climate
    Reference Network. The Taylor diagrams are showing most of the correlations above
    0.7 for both SCAN and USCRN networks. It is also evident that most of the standard
    deviation ratios are less than 1 (black-dashed line in Figure 6), indicating the
    higher variability of in situ data compared to the downscaled data across almost
    all the stations in CONUS. It is, however, noted that a few stations end up inflating
    the standard deviation ratio. Further investigation revealed that the SMAP satellite
    has had poor performance over those sites due to the severe spatial heterogeneity
    (e.g., climate, topography, soil texture, vegetation, and land cover) that dominates
    the corresponding satellite''s footprint. 4.2.1 Downscaled Soil Moisture Temporal
    Dynamic The most reliable soil moisture downscaling technique should be able to
    satisfy two important criteria: first, the downscaled soil moisture estimates
    must capture the temporal dynamics of in situ soil moisture observations (Mishra
    et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2015; Piles et al., 2014), and second, the spatial
    pattern of the downscaled soil moisture data must follow that of the original
    soil moisture map (Kaheil et al., 2008; Kim & Barros, 2002; Piles et al., 2011;
    Sanchez et al., 2012). To investigate whether the downscaled soil moisture product
    would meet the temporal variability criterion, in this section, we evaluate the
    performance of the downscaled SMAP soil moisture by the proposed approach at three
    different SCAN in situ soil moisture stations located in different climate regimes.
    Figure S3 depicts these stations and their adjacent environment. The vegetation
    condition and climate regime of these three locations are summarized here to explain
    the downscaled soil moisture performance analysis. As mentioned earlier and is
    seen from Figure S3, although these in situ measurements do not represent the
    soil moisture heterogeneity within the SMAP footprint, they do represent the surrounding
    vegetation and land cover types. Station 2027 (Figure S3a) is instrumented in
    the Little River Experimental Watershed in Tift County, Georgia, where the prevailing
    climate is humid subtropical providing abundant rainfall throughout the year.
    The land use is a mixture of forest, crops, and pasture. Station 2198 (Figure
    S3b) is located in Whitman County, Washington. This region is mostly dominated
    by grassland and pasture and experiences a mild and temperate climate. October
    through April are the wettest months (often in the form of snow), while August
    is the driest month. Station 2217 (Figure S3c) is located in the semiarid Monocline
    Ridge area in Fresno County, California, where the climate is mostly characterized
    by hot and dry summers and mild and moist winters. In this area, the majority
    of precipitation falls during winter. Monocline Ridge is an uninhabited and unvegetated
    region. Temporal variations of soil moisture from the downscaled SMAP (at 1 km),
    original SMAP (at 36 km), and in situ observations are illustrated along with
    precipitation (daily mean) in Figure 7, and their performance is evaluated using
    three statistical metrics, that is, R, ubRMSE (m3/m3), and bias (m3/m3). The detail
    information of each instrument including the station ID, soil texture type, and
    the location name are displayed in this figure. The black-dotted line and purple
    and blue points are indicating, respectively, the in situ soil moisture at 5 cm,
    the original SMAP soil moisture at top 5 cm, and the downscaled SMAP soil moisture
    time series. Although both SMAP products closely follow the precipitation patterns,
    their consistency against the in situ soil moisture observation differs based
    on the land-atmosphere characteristics. For example, in Tift County, Georgia,
    both original and downscaled SMAP data could well track the dynamics of the drying
    and wetting of soil moisture caused by precipitation. The original SMAP soil moisture
    noticed a significant amount of bias (Bias = 0.077 m3/m3) compared to the downscaled
    one (Bias = −0.008 m3/m3). This may be due to the station''s location where the
    dominant soil type is relatively well-drained loamy sand causing rapid soil drying
    after the precipitation event. The downscaled SMAP could capture this pattern
    properly, while the original SMAP failed to do so. The same analogy can be seen
    in Whitman County, Washington. In this station, the original SMAP underestimated
    the soil moisture almost throughout the whole period of study. This problem was
    mitigated by the downscaled SMAP soil moisture. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Time series, scatter plot, and CDF of original and downscaled SMAP
    soil moisture data versus in situ observations at top 5-cm depth. SCAN = Soil
    Climate Analysis Network; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive; ubRMSE = unbiased
    Root Mean Square Error; CDF = Cumulative Distribution Function. As mentioned above,
    although both SMAP products are reasonably able to reproduce the in situ soil
    moisture temporal dynamics, the original SMAP product may severely bias the soil
    moisture estimates. This issue was more clearly observed in the station 2217,
    which is located in Fresno County, California, where the original SMAP overestimated
    the soil moisture almost all days over the study period. This is mainly because
    fine- and coarser-resolution soil moisture observations often ignore the role
    of spatial scale differences in explaining differences between in situ and satellite
    soil moisture. In particular, the soil moisture dynamic range decreases by moving
    from small to large scale. The proposed downscaling algorithm is able to remove
    the systematic bias from the SMAP soil moisture when rescaling it to a finer resolution.
    For all three stations investigated here, the Cumulative Distribution Function
    in Figure 7 shows that the Cumulative Distribution Function of the downscaled
    SMAP perfectly matches with that of the in situ measurements. This further supports
    the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in rescaling the coarse-resolution
    SMAP soil moisture, while reducing the mismatch between that and in situ observations.
    The statistical measures that are reported in this figure indicate that great
    improvement was made by the downscaled soil moisture data. It is worth mentioning
    that although the original SMAP soil moisture retrievals are validated using those
    stations that are not within the USCRN and SCAN soil moisture networks (at the
    time of study), they are in good agreement with these sparse in situ stations
    (Zhang et al., 2017). In Figure 7, the correlation coefficient and ubRMSE calculated
    between the original SMAP and in situ observations imply this link between the
    two. 4.2.2 Downscaled Soil Moisture Spatial Heterogeneity Up to this point, we
    discussed how the downscaled soil moistures could capture the mean and amplitude
    of variations of in situ observations over different geographical locations with
    different land-atmosphere regimes. The ensuing task is to investigate the spatial
    consistency between the coarse- and fine-resolution soil moisture maps. The soil
    moisture spatial pattern is dependent on the heterogeneity of soil parameters
    (e.g., soil texture, vegetation, and topography) that are generally not distributed
    homogenously in the area. This results in an uncertainty in the soil moisture
    retrievals, which consequently affects the downscaled soil moisture accuracy (Piles
    et al., 2011). Here we try to assess the extent to which the downscaled soil moisture
    map could fill this gap and contribute to decreasing the discrepancy between the
    spatial variability of soil parameters and soil moistures. Figure 8 demonstrates
    an example of the original SMAP soil moisture data and the downscaled soil moisture
    on 27 April 2015, over the western CONUS. This figure also illustrates the land
    cover distribution. Figure 8 indicates that the spatial pattern of downscaled
    SMAP soil moisture (Figure 8c) closely follows the spatial heterogeneity of soil
    parameters such as vegetation cover (Figure 8a) and topography (previously shown
    in Figure S2). Likewise, the downscaled soil moisture data (Figure 8) closely
    matches the spatial pattern of the original soil moisture data (Figure 8b) across
    almost the entire western CONUS. Discrepancies between the original and downscaled
    data mostly occur in densely vegetated areas (i.e., evergreen and deciduous forests)
    where the SMAP soil moisture is prone to underestimation due to the attenuation
    of microwave signal by vegetation. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a)
    Land cover distribution over the western Continental United States, (b) original
    SMAP soil moisture at 36-km spatial resolution, and (c) downscaled SMAP soil moisture
    at 1-km spatial resolution on 27 April 2015. SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive.
    According to Figure 8, the downscaled SMAP soil moisture shows comparatively more
    water content in the topsoil layer than original SMAP. This is because the downscaled
    soil moisture at 1 km is obtained based on the soil moisture at point scale. Therefore,
    the fine-resolution SMAP product will lead to a lower soil moisture, similar to
    the one observed by SMAP satellite, if it is averaged to a coarser spatial scale.
    Another plausible reason behind this, is the fact that SMAP is measuring a large-scale
    average, and the averaging process dissipates anomalies more rapidly compared
    to the point (in situ) scale, leading to a faster drydown time scale (Shellito
    & Small, 2017; Shellito et al., 2016). Here the downscaled SMAP soil moistures
    are obtained using the model that is calibrated by in situ observations. It was
    found that the downscaled soil moistures are slightly wetter than the original
    SMAP product following rainfall events while correlating well with the in situ
    observations. Chen et al. (2017) showed that although SMAP retrievals underestimate
    soil moisture, they capture its dynamics well. Therefore, our conclusion is consistent
    with that of Chen et al. (2017). The downscaled SMAP soil moistures generated
    in this study are shown to track the dynamics of in situ observations well and
    clearly capture the spatial heterogeneity of soil parameters with high spatial
    correspondence to the original SMAP soil moisture data. The accuracy of downscaled
    soil moisture product in this study appears to be very good as compared to, for
    example, Mishra et al. (2018), who reported the CONUS average correlation between
    the thermal-infrared downscaled SMAP (passive) and SCAN is around 0.54, while
    in this study, the correlation between the downscaled SMAP product and SCAN networks
    is 0.65. However, it is noted that the successful use of a downscaling approach
    may be restricted to its certain characteristics and needs of a user, knowing
    that each method may have certain strengths and weaknesses (Chakrabarti et al.,
    2015, 2018; Chakrabarti, Judge, et al., 2016; Colliander, Fisher, et al., 2017).
    For example, in the work by Colliander, Fisher, et al. (2017), the authors proposed
    a disaggregation approach to downscale the SMAP soil moisture over a small domain
    (including three 36-km SMAP pixels), where the surface temperature is controlled
    by soil evaporation, the topographical variation is relatively moderate, and the
    vegetation density is relatively low. 4.3 Validation of Downscaled SMAP Soil Moisture
    Product In these subsections, we evaluate the accuracy of downscaled SMAP soil
    moisture against two densely instrumented watersheds located in two different
    geographical zones in CONUS. In addition, in order to fully assess the performance
    of the proposed downscaling algorithm, similar to section 13, the results are
    also compared with those obtained from the uniform disaggregation approach. 4.3.1
    Study Area (1): Little Washita River Watershed The Little Washita River Watershed
    is located in southwest Oklahoma in the Great Plains region of the United States
    and comprises an area of 610 km2. A wide range of textures covers the watershed''s
    surface layer, of which, sandy clay loam is the most dominant. There is a network
    of 20 in situ soil moisture stations distributed evenly over the entire watershed.
    This is called the Agricultural Research Service''s Micronet. These stations are
    equipped with capacitance probes that record the soil moisture at a depth of approximately
    3 to 7 cm with an hourly measurement interval. Many of these sensors also provide
    surface temperature measurements. In this study, the data set was collected daily
    for the period of 01 April 2015 to 31 December 2015 in order to be consistent
    with the period of available SMAP satellite data. 4.3.1.1 Validation Results Based
    on Little Washita River Watershed The results reported in Table 2 indicate that
    the downscaled SMAP soil moisture product matches well with the in situ observations
    for the majority of stations, except for a few stations (121 and 136) that are
    located along the mainstream of the watershed at low altitudes, hence more prone
    to accumulation of soil moisture storage. Despite this concern, the majority of
    stations located within the watershed are showing satisfactory results (Table
    2) which further validate the effectiveness of the RF approach. For the proposed
    downscaling method, the average values of ubRMSE, bias, and R across all stations
    are reported 0.035 m3/m3, −0.009 m3/m3, and 0.824, respectively, which are better
    than those from the uniform disaggregation approach. As seen in Table 2, the ubRMSE
    value for all soil types are less than the SMAP mission accuracy target of 0.04
    m3/m3 (Jackson et al., 2016). However, for the uniform disaggregation approach,
    this value slightly exceeds the SMAP accuracy requirement. Table 2. Comparison

    not only captures the spatial distribution of soil moisture (as shown in Table
    2) but also adequately monitors its temporal dynamics. The time series of downscaled
    SMAP soil moistures versus in situ observations at 20 Micronet stations were examined.
    The results showed that the downscaled soil moistures across all 20 stations closely
    follow the dynamics of in situ observations and precipitation pattern, such as
    dry-down and wet-up periods. For example, Figure 9 illustrates time-series comparisons
    between the downscaled SMAP soil moistures and in situ observations from a few
    selected stations (i.e., station 148, 124, 131, and 149) between 01 April 2015
    and 31 December 2015. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Daily in situ

    4.3.2 Study Area (2): WGEW The Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) is one
    of two Agricultural Research Service experimental watersheds on western rangelands
    located in the southeastern Arizona with an area of 149 km2. The predominant soil
    surface over this watershed is loamy. There are 19 soil moisture stations (identified
    as RG##) uniformly situated inside the watershed monitoring soil moisture every
    30 min at a depth of approximately 3 to 7 cm. These sensors also measure soil
    temperature and precipitation. In this paper, the data sets are collected daily
    (hourly averaged) from 01 April 2015 to 31 December 2015, so as to be consistent
    with the time period of the current study. 4.3.2.1 Validation Results Based on
    WGEW The results reported in Table 3 imply a satisfactory performance of the downscaled
    SMAP soil moisture product versus in situ observations for the majority of stations,
    except for a couple of stations (e.g., stations RG076 and RG092) situated close
    to the outlet of the watershed. The reason behind this may be attributed to the
    locations of these stations which were determined to accommodate the hydrologic
    research objectives of the watershed, not to validate the satellite soil moisture
    data products (Colliander, Cosh, et al., 2017). In the proposed downscaling method,
    the average values of ubRMSE, bias, and R across all stations (0.029 m3/m3, 0.008
    m3/m3, and 0.637) are found to be more accurate than those from the uniform disaggregation
    approach (0.039 m3/m3, −0.002 m3/m3, and 0.517). More importantly, on average,
    the ubRMSE value for this watershed (0.029 m3/m3) is much lower than the SMAP
    mission accuracy target of 0.04 m3/m3. This indicates a successful application
    of the proposed algorithm for downscaling satellite soil moisture data. We examined
    the temporal variation of downscaled soil moisture data set and found that they
    are able to capture the dynamics of in situ observations well. Further investigation
    also revealed that discrepancies between downscaled and in-situ soil moistures
    mostly occur during the North American Monsoon season when the spatial distribution
    of soil moisture over WGEW is more heterogeneous. Table 3. Comparison Between

    Square Error. Using two CVSs, we summarize the accuracy of both downscaling approaches
    in Figure 10. It is observed that the proposed downscaling approach outperforms
    the uniform disaggregation approach for all performance measures used. It is also
    noted that when the downscaled SMAP soil moisture (or the original SMAP) is compared
    with in situ observation for validation purposes, an unavoidable significant discrepancy
    between these two sets of data exacerbates the analysis. This is due to inherent
    properties of each observation. SMAP measures a large-scale average of soil moisture,
    while in situ station measures soil moisture at specific point. Even if all CVS
    in situ observations within the downscaled or original SMAP grid cells are averaged
    to represent the soil moisture, significant differences are still to be expected.

    a new framework based on an ensemble learning algorithm to downscale SMAP radiometer
    soil moisture from its native resolution of 36 km to a finer resolution of 1 km
    while using atmospheric and geophysical information acquired from high-resolution
    remote-sensing data and ground-based observations. The data sets used in the proposed
    model have been widely utilized in many studies for rescaling satellite soil moisture
    data and are similar to those ancillary data used in SMAP level 2 Enhanced Passive
    Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P_E) and standard L2_SM_P (Chan et al., 2017). This
    study was performed for the period of 9 months (01 April 2015 to 31 December 2015)
    over the CONUS. The validation results based on in situ soil moisture measurements
    collected from two CVSs and 300 sparse soil moisture networks confirmed that the
    downscaled SMAP soil moistures would adequately meet the SMAP soil moisture retrieval
    accuracy requirement (ubRMSE = 0.040 m3/m3) and capture the spatial heterogeneity
    of soil parameters and dynamics of in situ soil moisture observations. The downscaled
    soil moisture data obtained from the proposed downscaling approach is also compared
    with those from the uniform disaggregation approach over both CVSs and 300 soil
    moisture networks, and in all cases, the proposed approach outperformed the uniform
    disaggregation approach. The results of this study also revealed that the inclusion
    of all input variables would result in best downscaling accuracy; however, the
    topography data were found to affect the results less than other input variables.
    The other merit of the proposed methodology is that it is not restricted to boundary
    conditions such as semiarid or humid regions, and it can be applied over a large
    area with different climatological patterns and soil characteristics. The proposed
    rescaling model was calibrated using 300 sparse in situ soil moisture sensors
    evenly distributed over the CONUS. Future works may consider using other in situ
    observations from different operational networks, such as COSMOS (Zreda et al.,
    2012) and GPS (Larson et al., 2010), and some others available from the International
    Soil Moisture Network (Kim et al., 2017) for model calibration and validation
    purposes. Acknowledgments Partial financial support for this project was provided

    are eager to apply recent technological advancements, such as sensors and actuators,
    in different application areas, including environmental monitoring, creation of
    intelligent buildings, and precision agriculture. Technology-assisted irrigation
    for agriculture is a major research innovation which eases the work of farmers
    and prevents water wastage. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used as sensor
    nodes that directly interact with the physical environment and provide real-time
    data that are useful in identifying regions in need, particularly in agricultural
    fields. This paper presents an efficient methodology that employs WSN as a data
    collection tool and a decision support system (DSS). The proposed DSS can assist
    farmers in their manual irrigation procedures or automate irrigation activities.
    Water-deficient sites in both scenarios are identified by using soil moisture
    and environmental data sensors. However, the proposed system''s accuracy is directly
    proportional to the accuracy of dynamic data generated by the deployed WSN. A
    simplified outlier-detection algorithm is thus presented and integrated with the
    proposed DSS to fine-tune the collected data prior to processing. The complexity
    of the algorithm is O(1) for dynamic datasets generated by sensor nodes and O(n)

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Water is an important
    resource and must be used efficiently. The agriculture sector is the main water
    consumer; it uses approximately 70% of all available water resources worldwide
    [1]. This sector’s consumption will be controlled if modern technology is adopted
    with traditional irrigation procedures, particularly flooding. However, in this
    sector, modern technologies are accepted only if they exhibit a sufficient potential
    to increase crop yield while preserving as many resources as possible [2]. At
    present, different activities, particularly irrigation, in agriculture are performed
    with traditional procedures that are time consuming, labor intensive, and wasteful
    [3]. The traditional agricultural paradigm was geared toward modern technology
    utilization in the last decade, and its acceptance ratio at the commercial level
    increased. Technology adaptation has led to the automation of different agriculture-related
    activities, and this automation is known as precision farming or precision agriculture
    in literature [4]. The main motivation is that crop quality and production rates
    will improve if the right resources are applied at the right time under suitable
    environmental conditions. Such mechanisms improve crop yield and conserve considerable
    resources, such as water, pesticide spray, and potassium. Different mechanisms
    are utilized to collect environmental parameters and soil features, such as moisture,
    salinity, pH, temperature, air humidity, and wind direction [5], [6]. Scientific
    and research organizations are eager to apply the potential of micro-electro-mechanical
    system (MEMS) technology and the overwhelming characteristics of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) in different application areas, including the military, intelligent
    buildings and bridges, medical field, industries, and precision agriculture [7]–[9].
    In precision agriculture, WSNs are deployed in fields to sense and report various
    parameters that are vital to plant growth. Initial experiments with WSNs in the
    agriculture sector have been conducted in controlled environments, such as greenhouses,
    in which sensors/actuators are deployed to control the indoor environment automatically
    [10], [11]. WSNs have also been utilized in different projects, such as automating
    greenhouses, efficient water utilization, and identification of crop diseases.
    Most of these studies used WSNs as data collection tools, and decision support
    systems (DSS) were responsible for actual decisions. After the successful deployment
    of WSNs in controlled environments, researchers and scientists explored their
    applications in open field environments, but such an exploration was challenging.
    As part of a LOFAR project, Baggio [12] deployed a small network of wireless nodes
    in potato fields to detect a fungal disease known as Phytophthora. A similar experimental
    study was performed as a joint project of Switzerland and India in [13]. Mancuso
    and Bustaffa [14] explored the potential of WSNs to control various tomato diseases
    and described how this technology helps in controlling such diseases. Burrell
    et al. [15] deployed sensor nodes in a vineyard to assist managers in handling
    different scenarios, frost risk, and specific location by providing valuable information
    continuously. The FLOW-AID project used WSN to identify water deficit situations,
    scenarios where plants are in desperate need of water [16]. In 2011, Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Information and Communication
    Technology utilized WSNs to help recover the ecological integrity of Queensland’s
    Spring Brook National Park and regenerate the rain forest from agricultural grassland
    [17]. Other experimental studies have been conducted recently, but their description
    is beyond the scope of this work. The literature on WSNs in the agriculture sector
    is robust, but most of the studies neglected an important issue associated with
    data generated by sensor nodes, namely, outliers. Outliers are noisy data generated
    by sensor nodes when a sensor is malfunctioning or generated because of interference
    or colliding packets. These data must be detected and corrected prior to examination
    by DSS. Existing noise detection algorithms are highly complex, and their implementation
    in real-time DSS, a system that operates 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, is
    difficult. Therefore, a simple mechanism that does not degrade the overall performance
    of real-time DSS is needed to detect outliers. Most existing studies are designed
    for sprinkler systems and are inapplicable to real agriculture environments where
    flooding mechanisms are generally used to irrigate crops; such a practice is particularly
    common in Asia. In this work, a WSN-based outlier detection and irrigation management
    system is developed to assist farmers in handling crop irrigation schedules. The
    proposed system collects environmental and soil-related data through sensor nodes
    that are examined by the outlier detection module. The proposed noise detection
    algorithm is implemented to improve the system’s accuracy. Afterward, DSS further
    examines it to identify water deficient sites in agricultural fields. After identification,
    the alarming unit is activated, and text messages are sent over a local area network
    (LAN) to inform farmers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
    Section II, a brief overview of WSNs, particularly in the agriculture sector,
    is presented, followed by the proposed system architecture in Section III. Section
    IV describes the proposed outlier detection algorithm and its working mechanism.
    The different issues identified and solved during this study are presented in
    Section V. In Section VI, the achievements of the proposed approach are described,
    and a comparison of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms is performed
    based on real-time and benchmark datasets. The last section provides the concluding
    remarks. SECTION II. WSN in Agriculture Sector The distinguishing characteristics
    of WSNs make this technology an ideal solution to various real-world problems.
    These problems arise in different domains, such as the military, medicine, telemetric,
    intelligent building, hazard environments, and agriculture [18]. In the agriculture
    sector, WSNs are used to assist farmers in different activities, such as irrigation
    (whether sprinkled or flooding), detection and prevention of crop diseases in
    early stages or preventing favorable occurrence conditions, water-deficient location
    identification, and duration of field monitoring and pesticide spraying [19].
    Various experimental studies on WSNs in the agriculture sector have addressed
    particular problems. The studies that are relevant to our work are presented in
    this part. WSNs have been deployed in greenhouses to control the dew condensation
    problem that arises due to temperature, air humidity, pressure, and other environmental
    factors [20]. Park et al used different sensor nodes to collect data and adjust
    greenhouse environments accordingly. To compute for dew condensation, they utilized
    a well-known Bahrenburg formula. In a joint project to determine the ratio of
    arsenic in underground water, a WSN was deployed in [21] to collect various soil
    parameters of a rice field, such as arsenic, soil moisture, temperature, calcium,
    carbonate, chloride, nitrate, and pH. The collected data were thoroughly examined
    in sophisticated laboratories to determine the required ratio. Similarly, sensor
    nodes were deployed in Malawi to collect pH, reduction/oxidation (redox), and
    turbidity values to determine the quality of water [22]. In Spain, WSN was deployed
    to monitor soil contents, such as moisture, salinity, pH, and temperature [23].
    This system was successfully implemented in a real agriculture environment, but
    the decisions were not automated. To describe how few sensor nodes covered a particular
    area, the authors wrote an expression that describes the relationship between
    shower nozzle capacity and sensor node radius [24]. Konstantinos et al. presented
    a WSN-based architecture to control environmental conditions in a commercial greenhouse.
    The collected data were thoroughly examined to find their correlation with crop
    conditions [25]. Proper seedling of watermelon relies on environmental parameters,
    such as temperature, air humidity, and light values. Sensor nodes were deployed
    in greenhouses to collect and examine desired information and assist farmers in
    proper seedling of watermelon. A process control strategy management system was
    also designed in previous studies to determine proper and automatic seedling of
    watermelon; its various components were WSN, DSS, RFID-based method, and queuing
    theory-based algorithm [26], [27]. Phytophthora is a potato fungal disease that
    occurs due to certain environmental conditions, and if these conditions are prevented/avoided,
    then the possibility of the disease’s existence will become negligible. Baggio
    [12] utilized a WSN to collect desired data and attempted to avoid conditions
    that are favorable for the disease. Similarly, WSNs were deployed in potato fields
    by Shinghal et al. [3] to improve productivity. Favorable conditions for tomato
    diseases were avoided by using WSNs inside greenhouses [14]. In vineyards, sensor
    nodes were deployed in different locations to collect valuable data that were
    used for predicting various diseases, pest control, and facilitating the handling
    of different activities [15]. Kotamäki et al. [28] deployed a WSN near a river
    basin to determine the quality of water and described its effects on soil content
    and crop yield. The Common Sense Net Project was designed for marginal farming
    in India, in which different sensor nodes were used to identify areas whose water,
    rain, reservation capacities were high. Additionally, the project can identify
    various crop diseases [13]. The Flow AID Project was designed to utilize the WSN’s
    potentials in determining water-deficient sites in agriculture fields [16]. Dursun
    and Ozden [29] presented an automatic drip irrigation management system for cherry
    trees. Pardossi et al. [30] described a mechanism to integrate rote zone sensors
    with WSN and used it in the identification of water deficit situations. Various
    investigations on automatic control of greenhouses were reported in [4], [31],
    and [32]. Different site-specific automatic irrigation management systems were
    presented in [33]–[36]. SECTION III. Proposed System Architecture and Deployment
    A. Architecture Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of the proposed DSS. In the proposed
    architecture, an application layer is designed to provide services to farmers
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). These services include
    interaction with the real-time system, identification of water-deficient locations,
    vulnerable situation alarms, and environmental monitoring. The middle layer describes
    how various components of the proposed system interact with one another, physically
    or logically, to provide the desired services precisely. The sensor manager unit
    collects data from sensors and forwards these to a microprocessor that conducts
    aggregation for further processing. The gateway module receives packets from sensor
    nodes, and is attached to a computer that runs the proposed DSS. DSS collects
    the newly arrived packets from the gateway module, checks their accuracy through
    a noise detection module, decides the current situation, and stores it. The physical
    layer directly interacts with the environment. Sensor nodes that use various sensing
    capabilities collect soil moisture, air humidity, temperature, and leaf wetness
    data and send the data to the sensor manager. These parameters are vital in the
    development of a precise DSS for irrigation. FIGURE 1. Architecture of the proposed
    DSS. Show All Real-time systems need to be continuously operational to assist
    farmers, but at the same time, the sensor node sampling rate must be adjusted
    accordingly to prolong the WSN’s lifetime. In our testbed, wasp-mote agriculture
    sensor boards with desired functionality were programmed and deployed in a real
    agriculture environment, namely, an orange orchard. During the first phase of
    the experimental setup, the boards were placed in close proximity to reduce packet
    losses, thereby improving communication reliability. In the second phase, the
    boards were placed to cover as much area as possible, and each node can communicate
    with the gateway either directly or through multi-hop communication. Their transceivers
    use the Xbee protocol and can communicate within a 500 m range. Nod e 3 was deployed
    within the direct communication range of the gateway (460 m), and Nod e 1 and
    Nod e 2 were placed at a distance of 460 m from Node3. The distance between the
    nodes and gateway was kept small to maximize their throughput. The proposed DSS
    performance is not affected by increasing or decreasing scalability of sensor
    nodes because these nodes act as data collection points. Dense deployment increases
    data packets, but this situation is not an issue, particularly in the agriculture
    sector, in which the sampling rate of the deployed sensor nodes must be very low,
    namely, two or three packets per 24 hours. B. Wasp-Mote Boards Deployment The
    implementation of a precise real-time DSS in any application depends on the selection
    of appropriate technology, sensors, and parameters to be monitored. Sensor board
    selection is based on coverage area, battery lifetime, processing capability,
    transceiver, and integration of sensors. Parameter selection is application-specific.
    In our study, we considered soil and environmental parameters. Soil moisture is
    vital in the development of a precise irrigation schedule; that is, if the sensed
    value is below a threshold value, then this area needs water and must be irrigated.
    For this purpose, soil moisture sensors were deployed at three different levels
    in the agricultural field, as shown in Figs. 2 and Fig. 3. In addition to the
    soil moisture parameter, an atmospheric moister exerts drastic effects on the
    watering schedules of various crops and must be monitored regularly. These sensors
    are deployed in close proximity to plant leaves, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally,
    temperature and humidity parameters are significant in the design of a precise
    DSS because the soil moisture threshold value is directly proportional to the
    environmental temperature. Therefore, these sensors are integrated with wasp-mote
    boards to collect their full potential, as shown in Fig. 5. The gateway module
    is connected to a computer to receive data and process them. FIGURE 2. Deployment
    of soil moisture sensors in orange orchard. Show All FIGURE 3. Deployment soil
    moisture sensor in real agricultural environment. Show All FIGURE 4. Leaf wetness
    sensor deployment near plant leaves. Show All FIGURE 5. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors deployment. Show All SECTION IV. Proposed Decision Support System The
    proposed system collects soil and environmental parameters through its deployed
    WSN in the orange orchard. Initially, the collected data are examined by the concerned
    board to minimize redundant packets via aggregation, and the data are transferred
    to the destination via a gateway. The data sensed by four different sensors are
    merged into one packet to increase the efficiency of the proposed system in terms
    of energy consumption. These packets are forwarded to the outlier detection module
    where their accuracy is checked and sent to DSS for onward processing if found
    correct. DSS thoroughly examines these packets by comparing different parameters
    with their defined threshold values, particularly soil moisture (250 Hz).The threshold
    values such as soil moisture (250Hz), are determined through deploying the sensors
    (3) in dry soil; and collecting their readings over a period of three days. If
    the data are in the defined range, then they are stored in a database; otherwise,
    the alarm unit is activated, and alert messages are forwarded to the LAN or mobile
    phone. The GUI of the proposed system shows collected data in graphical and textual
    formats. The operation of the proposed system is summarized in Fig. 6. FIGURE
    6. Working of the proposed system. Show All A. Proposed Outliers Detection Algorithm
    Outliers are data packets generated by a malfunctioning sensor or via interference
    and collision. WSNs are highly susceptible to outliers due to various restrictions
    on their size, processing, and transceivers. The literature on outlier/noise detection
    is bulky, but most of the approaches were presented and validated based on static
    datasets, and their implementation in a real-time system is difficult or impractical.
    These algorithms improve dataset accuracy but equally degrade the overall performance
    of a real-time system because for every packet, the mechanism repeatedly searches
    the entire dataset [37], [38]. Moreover, the accuracy of these algorithms is directly
    proportional to dataset size and computation time. Their accuracy for large datasets
    is extremely high, but the computation time is also high and results in low performance
    of DSS, particularly in a real-time system. Therefore, a simplified outlier detection
    algorithm was developed to overcome these issues and improve the performance of
    real-time DSS and dataset accuracy. The performance of a real-time system based
    on the proposed outlier detection algorithm is unaffected by dataset size because
    the algorithm does not scan the overall dataset and considers the most recent
    packets only. Its computation time and performance are exceptionally good in real-time
    datasets, and it is equally applicable to static datasets. Algorithm 1 starts
    by matching the currently received packet with the previously stored one, which
    is the last accurate packet, that is, the packet received at time T i and T i−1
    . If their difference is less than the defined threshold value (10 Hz for the
    soil moisture sensor), then it is forwarded to the DSS for further analysis. However,
    if their difference crosses the defined limit, then it is either an outlier or
    an abrupt change scenario that occurs because of direct connection of water with
    soil moisture sensors. In this case, data are stored temporarily, and further
    processing is delayed until the next packet from that particular node arrives.
    Then, the recently received packet is compared with two packets, namely, the one
    that is temporarily stored and the last packet stored in the database. For example,
    data collected at time T 3 are matched with data received at time T 2 and stored
    temporarily, and data gathered at time T 1 is successfully stored. If the difference
    between packets received at T 3 and T 1 is less than the defined threshold value,
    then the data packet received at T 2 is an outlier and replaced with the average
    value of data packets T 1 and T 3 . However, if the difference between data packets
    T 2 and T 3 is less than the threshold value, then it is an abrupt change scenario,
    and both values are stored in the database. Algorithm 1 Proposed Outliers Detection

    21: else 22: Temp−Locatio n i ← Cur-Pkt 23: Outliers-ID ← 1 24: end if We consider
    Fig. 7 in which the soil moisture value received at time 13:00 is 0 Hz, representing
    the most recent packet. The packet collected at time 12:30, 850 Hz, is the last
    accurate value stored in the database. These two values are matched, and their
    difference is much larger than the threshold value, which is 10 Hz in our case.
    Therefore, this packet is temporarily stored, and the decision is delayed until
    the next packet from the same node, Nod e 1 , arrives. When the next packet at
    time 13:30 is received, it is matched with the packet collected at time 12:30
    or with most recently stored packet. The difference between these packets is below
    the threshold value, 1 Hz, indicating that the temporarily stored packet is an
    outlier and must be replaced with the average value of data packets that arrived
    at times 12:30 and 13:30 (840 Hz). Then, both values are stored in the database,
    and the data are as shown in Fig. 8. In this scenario, a real-time DSS that does
    not use the outlier detection mechanism activates the alarm unit for the water
    deficit condition and sends a text message over LAN because the soil moisture
    value is less than the threshold value. However, smart DSS, which possesses outlier
    detection facility, easily handles this situation. Another debatable scenario
    for real-time DSS in the agricultural environment is the separation of the abrupt
    change that occurs because of the direct connection of water with a soil moisture
    sensor, as shown in Fig. 8 at time 15:30. The proposed algorithm handles this
    situation through a similar mechanism described for the detection of outliers.
    However, in this case, the temporarily stored value and the currently received
    value are identical or approximate each other. Both values are stored in the database
    without modification. FIGURE 7. A scenario of both outliers and abrupt change.
    Show All FIGURE 8. Outliers free scenario. Show All SECTION V. Issues Resolved
    During Proposed Experimental Setup During the deployment phase of the proposed
    testbed, various issues were identified and resolved. A. Packets Collision and
    Nodes Overhearing A sensor node uses a broadcasting mechanism to communicate with
    the gateway and other nodes in the network, thereby resulting in the collision
    of packets or reduction of throughput. Collision usually occurs due to the concurrent
    communication of sensor nodes deployed in close proximity or within the communication
    range of one another. In the proposed testbed, a simplified mechanism, namely,
    delay timers in wasp-mote boards, is used to avoid concurrent communication of
    sensor nodes and collision. Every experimental setup uses a sampling rate or a
    sensor node rate of transmission, which is 30 minutes in our case. The criteria
    for packet transmission of every node are adjusted according to the neighbor node
    communication schedules. For example, if nod e 1 begins communication with other
    nodes or the gateway at time 10:00:00, then its neighbor nodes must wait for the
    maximum propagation delay; that is, the time required for successful communication
    between the most widely separated nodes (approximately 5 seconds in the proposed
    experimental setup). Therefore, nod e 2 , a neighboring node of nod e 1 , must
    delay its communication for 3 seconds and start around 10:00:04 if its neighbors
    are not interested in transmission. However, this mechanism works only for a testbed
    in which a limited number of sensor nodes are used. For dense WSNs, other mechanisms,
    such as channelization, are utilized. Overhearing of a sensor node in WSNs exerts
    drastic effects on node lifetime and needs to be handled efficiently, particularly
    in highly dense networks. To avoid this problem, sensor nodes are placed in such
    a manner that each node has at most one path for communication with the gateway
    and does not hear other neighboring nodes where feasible. In our case, the problem
    was successfully solved through manual adjustment of the distance between sensor
    nodes. However, this method is useful only in the engineered setup of WSN only
    and is not feasible for random deployment. This technique introduces the path
    loss problem in large networks, but it is efficient for small networks. B. Crops
    Canopy Crop canopy is another important problem associated with the deployment
    of WSNs in agricultural fields, particularly orchards. Crop canopy affects the
    communication range of sensor nodes in a network and environmental parameters.
    During the initial phase of our project, the problem was not considered, and nodes
    were deployed randomly at different locations but within the direct communication
    range of the gateway module. However, only nod e 3 packets were received successfully,
    and the remaining node packets were lost due to crop canopy. Further analysis
    of the experimental setup and field was performed, and different alternatives
    were applied to resolve this issue. This thorough investigation led us to the
    problem of crop canopy and its effects on the communication range of sensor nodes
    because nod e 1 was in the direct line of sight with the sink node, whereas the
    other nodes were not. Obstacles or orange trees were also present. Therefore,
    nodes were deployed in the orange orchard in such a manner that each node was
    in the direct line of sight with its intended receiver node. Node deployment in
    direct line of sight does not necessarily mean that nodes are unable to communicate
    when obstacles exist between transmitting and receiving nodes. Nodes placed in
    the crop canopy can communicate, but their coverage area and transmission range
    are much smaller than those in the direct line of sight communication. Another
    issue caused by crop canopy was the effects on sensor node readings, particularly
    sensors that collect environmental data (e.g., temperature and humidity). In summer,
    nodes deployed in a shady region generate temperature readings of 40 °C– 44 °C,
    whereas sensors exposed to sunlight sense temperatures in a range of 44 °C– 49
    °C. To overcome this problem, 50% of the sensor nodes were deployed in direct
    sunlight, and the remaining nodes were placed in shady areas. C. Effects of Heavy
    Rain Heavy rain is vital to plant growth rate, particularly in summer when watering
    requirements are high. In traditional approaches, flooding/watering schedules
    are postponed due to heavy rain and particularly based on farmers’ experience.
    Therefore, the proposed DSS must handle this scenario in a manner similar to traditional
    approaches but without requiring an experienced farmer to monitor the system and
    judge its decisions. In the proposed DSS, the decision whether to irrigate or
    not is primarily based on soil moisture content and other supplementary parameters.
    In the case of heavy rain, soil moisture sensor readings exceed the threshold
    value, clearly indicating that the irrigation schedule must be deferred. Similarly,
    conducting specific case studies for every season is not needed because if soil
    moisture content values are above the threshold value, then irrigation is unnecessary.
    Additionally, the proposed system possesses the flexibility to adjust threshold
    values whenever required and can be used in different agricultural scenarios.
    D. WSNs Lifetime An important aspect of the applicability of WSNs in different
    application areas is their lifetime, which mostly relies on the onboard batteries
    of sensor nodes. Efficient utilization of available power resources increases
    WSN lifetime. In the proposed testbed, sensor nodes actively probe the environment
    for the shortest duration of 1 minute and then switch to sleep mode for approximately
    29 minutes. Every board conducts aggregation of the data collected by its sensors
    and merges the data into a single packet. The aggregation approach combines the
    data gathered through temperature, air humidity, soil moisture and leaf wetness
    sensors into a single data packet. The aggregation mechanism reduces the number
    of transmitted packets from 4 to 1, and individual packets for every sensor are
    attached to a wasp-mote board, thereby improving the lifetime of WSNs. Additionally,
    in the agriculture sector, particularly in the watering schedules of open field
    crops, collection of data once or even twice a day is appropriate or needed. Therefore,
    the sampling rate of deployed nodes must be decreased to 12 hours or more to further
    increase WSN lifetime. SECTION VI. Results and Discussion In the case of real-time
    data, the worst case complexity of the proposed outlier detection algorithm is
    O(1), whereas pattern anomaly value (PAV), MPAV, and rare pattern drift detector
    (RPDD) algorithms [37], [38] have complexities of O( n 2 ) , O(n) and O( n 2 +n)
    respectively. Hence, the proposed algorithm is the best solution among these algorithms
    for real-time DSS because it does not affect the functionality of DSS. Similarly,
    the proposed algorithm’s worst case complexity for a static dataset is O(n) ,
    where n represents size of the dataset. These algorithms were tested on real-time
    data obtained via our testbed deployed in an orange orchard. The performance of
    the algorithms in terms of computational time is presented in Fig. 9, which shows
    that the proposed algorithm outperformed contemporary schemes. Moreover, the performance
    of these algorithms was examined thoroughly by continuously increasing the dataset
    size. Unlike the proposed algorithm, the other schemes were inconsistent with
    the dynamically changing dataset. In the case of the real-time dataset, the computational
    time of the other algorithms was directly proportional to the size of the dataset,
    whereas the proposed algorithm was not affected. Moreover, the proposed algorithm’s
    memory requirements were fewer than those of the other algorithms. The implementation
    of these complex algorithms in real-time DSS required highly sophisticated and
    demanding technology, which is expensive, whereas the proposed algorithm worked
    well with existing technology. The algorithms were also tested on a static dataset,
    and their computation time is depicted in Fig. 10. Our algorithm’s performance
    was better than that of the other algorithms, particularly in terms of execution
    time. FIGURE 9. Computational time comparison on real time data set. Show All
    FIGURE 10. Computational time comparison on static data set. Show All The complexity
    of an algorithm is vital to its development, implementation, and execution in
    real-time systems. Complexity is directly proportional to algorithm accuracy and
    computation time. In real-time DSS specifically for the agriculture sector, an
    algorithm must be as accurate and simple as possible so the overall performance
    of DSS is unaffected. If the algorithm is accurate and precise but degrades the
    overall performance of the system, then it is useless. An accuracy comparison
    is presented in Fig. 11. Although the proposed algorithm’s accuracy is lower than
    that of the other algorithms, its effect on the overall performance of real-time
    DSS was smaller, and the algorithm works on a personal computer. Improving the
    accuracy and precision of an algorithm results in increased complexity, degradation
    of the overall performance of the real-time system, and inability to run efficiently
    on personal computers. FIGURE 11. DSS’s accuracy. Show All In addition to the
    real-time dataset, the algorithms were examined thoroughly by using benchmark
    datasets, as shown in Table 1. The execution time of the proposed algorithm was
    less than that of the other algorithms specifically for dynamic datasets. The
    proposed algorithm is an ideal candidate for an efficient real-time DSS. The precision
    and accuracy of these algorithms on the benchmark datasets are presented in Table
    2. Accuracy is described in terms of accurate decisions taken by DSS when these
    algorithms were implemented as a separate module to fine tune data before processing.
    The proposed algorithm is not precise for datasets that possess multi-valued noise,
    such as the FacesUCR dataset. However, when datasets have single-valued outliers
    only, the proposed algorithm is ideal. TABLE 1 Comparative Computation Time of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets TABLE 2 Comparative Accuracy of

    was designed in this study to facilitate farmers in various agriculture-related
    activities. Farmers will adopt a technology-assisted system if it has a simplified
    interaction paradigm, possesses a simple GUI, and provides the desired services.
    The proposed DSS possesses a user-friendly interface that is can be easily understood
    by inexperienced users and provides different services simultaneously, as shown
    in Fig. 12. FIGURE 12. A sample screen shot of the proposed system showing data
    of soil moisture sensor. Show All SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work The
    demand for efficient utilization of available water resources, specifically in
    the agriculture sector, is increasing daily due to water scarcity and global climate
    change. Therefore, technology-assisted irrigation mechanisms, sensors, and actuators
    must be realized in real agriculture environments. These approaches provide water
    upon demand and control water wastage. They are helpful in controlling water resources
    but exert drastic effects on plant growth rate and yield. In this work, we developed
    a technology-assisted outlier detection and decision support system (DSS) to facilitate
    irrigation, particularly flooding. The proposed system is highly precise because
    it uses an embedded outlier detection module that thoroughly examines the correctness
    of the collected data and forwards the data to DSS for further processing. DSS
    analyzes different parameters to identify water-deficient sites and reports them
    to farmers or generates an alarm. This system possesses a user-friendly interaction
    environment that makes it easy to use. In the future, we will further improve
    the accuracy of the proposed DSS by examining additional parameters and will enhance
    it to assist farmers in other agriculture-related activities, such as pesticide
    and fertilizer use and determination of soil properties. Furthermore, due to nodes
    un-availability and their security issues, the proposed scheme was evaluated only
    on three sensor nodes. As a future work, we will investigate the proposed algorithm
    on a large-scale. ACKNOWLEDGMENT All authors declare that they have no conflict

    287 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract [1] A nondestructive and spatially integrated
    multielectrode method for measuring soil electrical resistivity was tested in
    the Beauce region of France during a period of corn crop irrigation to monitor
    soil water flow over time and in two-dimensional (2-D) with simultaneous measurements
    of soil moisture and thermal profiles. The results suggested the potential of
    surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) for improving soil science and
    agronomy studies. The method was able to produce a 2-D delimitation of soil horizons
    as well as to monitor soil water movement. Soil drainage through water uptake
    by the roots, the progression of the infiltration front with preferential flow
    zones, and the drainage of the plowed horizon were well identified. At the studied
    stage of corn development (3 months) the soil zones where infiltration and drainage
    occurred were mainly located under the corn rows. The structural soil characteristics
    resulting from agricultural practices or the passage of agricultural equipment
    were also shown. Two-dimensional sections of soil moisture content were calculated
    using ERT. The estimates were made by using independently established “in situ”
    calibration relationships between the moisture and electrical resistivity of typical
    soil horizons. The thermal soil profile was also considered in the modeling. The
    results showed a reliable linear relationship between the calculated and measured
    water contents in the crop horizon. The precision of the calculation of the specific
    soil water content, quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE), was 3.63%
    with a bias corresponding to an overestimation of 1.45%. The analysis and monitoring
    of the spatial variability of the soil moisture content with ERT represent two
    components of a significant tool for better management of soil water reserves
    and rational irrigation practices. 1. Introduction [2] To provide an adequate
    water supply for growing corn, one must obtain precise knowledge of the soil moisture
    state. It is necessary to monitor water content changes in the field to measure
    water losses through infiltration and evapotranspiration. Better knowledge of
    soil water flow also gives a better understanding of the behavior and transport
    of agricultural pollutants. In consequence, a rational sampling strategy can be
    established to study the active time of the molecules residence. [3] As soil electrical
    resistivity is related to its water content, the general aim of this study is
    to determine soil moisture with electrical resistivity, or more specifically to
    relate soil electrical resistivity changes with water content changes in an unsaturated
    soil. [4] The first step of this study is to verify the capacity of the multielectrode
    method to monitor over time the soil water dynamics under an irrigated corn crop
    (Zea mays L.), particularly water infiltration and soil drainage by root uptake.
    The second step is to obtain 2-D soil water content sections after calibration
    of the electrical resistivity of typical soil horizons according to their moisture.
    The third step is to test the calculated water content with regard to soil water
    content measured simultaneously with electrical resistivity. 2. Review of Soil
    Water Content Measurements 2.1. Standard Measurements [5] In addition to direct
    weighing method, soil water and moisture profiles can be obtained with numerous
    indirect methods where sensors are placed in the soil at different depths. The
    neutron probe [Gardner and Kirkam, 1952; Bavel et al., 1956] is a reliable water
    content measurement method [Chanasyk and Naeth, 1996], but its use is limited
    because radioactive source produces numerous constraints. Measurements of dielectric
    soil properties by TDR (time domain reflectometry) probes [Topp et al., 1980]
    or capacitance sensors [Bell et al., 1987; Dean et al., 1987] avoid the use of
    radioactive sources. Time domain reflectometry is a technique to estimate the
    volumetric soil water content. It is based on the determination of the apparent
    dielectric constant K of soil. This quantity is calculated from the velocity of
    propagation of an electromagnetic signal in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 1
    GHz along a transmission line in the soil, neglecting losses along the line as
    reviewed by Topp and Davis [1985]. Soil volumetric water content θ is calculated
    using an empirical relationship, which is independent of soil type, soil density,
    soil temperature and soluble salt content [Topp et al., 1980]: The precision of
    volumetric water content measurement is about ±2%. The water potential, which
    must be known to understand water flow in an unsaturated soil, is measured with
    a tensiometer. Water infiltration into the soil is not uniform. The vertical and
    horizontal soil water content is highly variable and depends on preferential flow
    directions [Kung., 1990a, 1990b; Herkelrath et al., 1991; Ritsema et al., 1993;
    Ritsema and Dekker, 1994; Flury et al., 1994]. Soil moisture sensors yield only
    restricted information and are often not representative of the spatial soil water
    distribution. Now, improved measurement techniques and automated methods, such
    as multiTDR systems have made possible soil moisture changes monitoring over time
    at different locations and detection of preferential water flow directions [Heimovaara
    and Boulten, 1990; Herkelrath et al., 1991]. Still, these systems offer information
    at only a series of point locations rather than continuously at the field scale.
    Moreover, inserting moisture sensors disturbs the soil structure and the water
    flow [Rothe et al., 1997]. [6] Many alternative methods have been tested in order
    to monitor water flow within the soil over time. Soluble dye tracers added to
    soil water have been used [Kung, 1990a, 1990b; Flury et al., 1994; Scanlon and
    Goldsmith, 1997]. With this method, the spatial distribution of the dye tracer
    in the soil can be observed and therefore the infiltration zone can be determined.
    As a soil pit must be dug at the experimental site to monitor tracer infiltration,
    the soil structure is disturbed and the obtained information may not be representative
    of the actual processes under investigation. For example, the water flow may be
    perturbed by the changed soil drainage induced when a soil pit is dug. [7] Nevertheless,
    it is difficult to obtain a 2-D or 3-D representation of the water flow in the
    soil by exploiting sparse local data. Geophysical surface methods are not intrusive
    and consequently do not disturb the soil structure. Also, each measurement integrates
    a greater volume of soil. These methods represent alternative ways of monitoring
    unsaturated soil water fluxes. The following discussion focuses on the use of
    ERT to monitor moisture changes in soil over time. 2.2. Use of Surface Geophysical
    Methods for Estimating Water Content and Infiltration [8] Various surface geophysical
    methods have been used by hydrogeologists and soil scientists to identify soil
    water infiltration and water flow. In the past, much research has been performed
    using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to detect buried objects, to delineate geological
    structures and to measure the soil water content [Davis and Annan, 1989; Hubbard
    et al., 1997; Eppstein and Dougherty, 1998; Weiler et al., 1998; Parkin et al.,
    2000]. The majority of the studies have produced positive results. Daily and Ramirez
    [1989] tested dielectric permittivity using borehole electromagnetic tomography
    to map water content changes in a heated volcanic ignimbrite. Weiler et al. [1998]
    concluded that in comparison with TDR measurements, GPR gave promising results
    for nondestructive water content measurements. Hubbard et al. [1997] showed that
    the joint use of GPR and conventional borehole data improves water saturation
    estimates for geological formations. By comparing radar wave velocity before and
    after a controlled release of salt water in the vadose zone, Eppstein and Dougherty
    [1998] detected and visualized soil moisture patterns in three dimensions. Recently,
    Parkin et al. [2000] showed the advantage of GPR in monitoring soil water content
    distribution in a horizontal plane located below a wastewater trench. Hubbard
    et al. [2002] and Huisman et al. [2001] showed how GPR ground wave data could
    be used effectively to map near surface changes in water content. GPR performance
    is optimal in a soil with a coarse texture, but the performance decreases in electrically
    conductive media such as clayey soils. [9] The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
    method uses the nuclear properties of hydrogen to assess water content. In the
    ground, most hydrogen atoms are found in the water molecules. The NMR method can
    detect water directly, whereas conventional geophysical methods provide only indirect
    knowledge of soil moisture. Using NMR, the water content distribution and ground
    porosity versus depth have been estimated [Amin et al., 1993; Goldman et al.,
    1994; Beauce et al., 1996]. However, NMR measurements are not suitable for superficial
    soil studies, as the first few meters below the land surface constitute a blind
    zone for that method. [10] Soil electrical resistivity is a function of the textural
    and structural characteristics and is particularly sensitive to its water content
    [Sheets and Hendrickx, 1995]. Soils are a porous medium, made of nonconductive
    solid particles and containing electrolytes solution that can conduct electric
    current by the movement of the free ions in the bulk solution and ions adsorbed
    at the matrix surface. Precipitation and seasonal variations in soil temperature
    and soil water content cause significant changes in the electrical resistivity
    of the soil [Aaltonen, 1997; Benderitter and Schott, 1999]. Water infiltration
    and aquifer recharge can be detected by studies of variations in electrical sounding
    curves [Barraud et al., 1979; Cosentino et al., 1979]. Groundwater flow direction
    and velocity can be determined through observation of the electrical resistivity
    decrease in alluvial deposits following salt water tracer injections [White, 1994].
    Recent development of a surface multielectrode method, known as electrical resistivity
    tomography (ERT), offers some interesting perspectives. This method is particularly
    well suited to the 2-D description of geological structures perpendicular to the
    measurement electrode line [Griffiths and Turnbull, 1985; Griffiths et al., 1990;
    Shima, 1990; Griffiths and Barker, 1993]. ERT presents great advantages for monitoring
    and is used in hydrological and environmental studies to monitor solutes and fluid
    flow in porous media. Monitoring of vadose zone water flow such as water infiltration,
    root water uptake, borehole pumping test effects has been reported by many authors
    [Barker and Moore, 1998; Benderitter and Schott, 1999; Binley et al., 2001]. Hagrey
    and Michaelsen [1999], and Michot et al. [2001] adapted the electrode set up to
    reach a finer resolution in order to monitor soil water infiltration in 2-D. Recent
    progress in modeling and geophysical 3-D inversion methods greatly reduced calculation
    errors and processing time [Zhang et al., 1995]. Three-dimensional monitoring
    of small fresh water plume movements through the vadose zone has become possible
    [Park, 1998]. Zhou et al. [2001] also proposed a noninvasive method to monitor,
    in the field, soil water content changes over time by means of 3-D electrical
    tomography. The cited works revealed the capability of ERT data in monitoring
    water infiltration in unsaturated soil or through the vadose zone, as is our focus.
    However, these works did not consider the possibility of obtaining a water content
    cross section from ERT data using a field-scale calibration method and taking
    into account the soil thermal profile. This current study, unlike the previous
    ones, investigates water flow dynamics in relation to the soil management (agricultural
    practices, tillage operations) with a corn crop cover irrigated by sprinkling.
    3. Presentation of the Study Site [11] The study area is located southwest of
    Paris, in the Beauce region, at Villamblain (Figure 1). The topography is weakly
    undulating with slopes rarely exceeding 2%. The altitude ranges between 121 m
    and 125 m. The loamy clay soil has a thickness of 0.3 to 1.2 m over the Beauce
    limestone bedrock, containing a large aquifer about between 15 and 70 m depth.
    The water is pumped for crop irrigation and regional drinking water supply. Figure
    1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Location of the study area. [12] The studied
    site has a corn crop cover (Zea mays L) and is irrigated by sprinklers. The experimental
    plot soil can be classified as a loamy clay Calcisol developed in a beige cryoturbated
    limestone deposit according to the French soil reference system [Baize and Girard,
    1995]. Because of numerous studies about the regional spatial soil distribution
    and the experimental plot [Isambert and Duval, 1992; Nicoullaud et al., 1997],
    this Calcisol was chosen as representative of the soil in the region. A soil pit
    was dug near the experimental device to identify the characteristic soil horizons
    (Figure 2). Three reference horizons include the following: (1) First is the top
    horizon, LAci, an organomineral 30 cm thick plow layer. It has a loamy clay texture,
    a fine polyhedral structure and a very high porosity. A plowed pan lies beneath
    its lower boundary. (2) Second is a light brown structural S horizon with slight
    weathering, observed at a depth from 30 cm to 75 cm. It is a loamy clay layer
    without coarse fragments and with a medium polyhedral structure and high porosity.
    This horizon is subdivided into three parts: Sci1, Sci2 and Sca3. This division
    is justified by a decrease in clay content, a gradual weakening of soil structure
    and an increase of carbonate inflorescences inside earthworm burrows with depth.
    (3) Third is the Ck horizon at a 75 cm depth. It is formed of beige cryoturbated
    and highly weathered soft limestone rocks. It has a massive structure and a high
    porosity. This horizon is subdivided into two layers, Ck(m)1 (75–100 cm) and Ck2
    (100–170 cm). On the basis of simultaneous decrease of clay and silt content and
    increase of carbonate content (CaCO3 > 75%) with depth. Figure 2 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Water flow monitoring; experimental setup by 2-D electrical
    resistivity tomography in its pedological and agricultural context. [13] An auger
    drilling into the bottom of the soil pit provides additional information at depth.
    The Ck2 horizon goes down to a depth of 170 cm. A soft powdery gray limestone
    mineral horizon Ck3 exists between 170 and 250 cm depth. Beyond this, the auger
    was blocked by a slab of sublithographic hard gray Beauce Limestone. Table 1 shows
    particle size distribution of the fine earth fraction after carbonate removal
    and chemical analysis. The soil is alkaline (pH > 8.2). There is slight recarbonatation
    of the LAci surface horizon with regard to horizon Sci1, no doubt related to the
    working of the soil and the use of irrigation water rich in calcium carbonate.
    The exchange complex is saturated with calcium throughout the soil profile. Table

    of 90,000 pl/ha and a distance of 0.80 m between rows. The soil was plowed to
    a depth of 30 cm and reworked on the surface by a harrow to reduce the size of
    the superficial clumps. The corn root profile (on the left of Figure 2) shows
    that the corn root density is higher in the plowed horizon between a depth of
    0.1 and 0.3 m. The corn root density decreases rapidly with depth [Nicoullaud
    et al., 1995]. This is a representative and typical soil of the Beauce region,
    which covers 85000 ha. Major soil differences are associated with only the thickness
    of the loamy-clay horizon and the CaCO3 content. 4. Field Calibration [15] A considerable
    effort has gone toward investigating the relationship between the apparent electrical
    resistivity (or its reciprocal, the apparent electrical conductivity), water conductivity
    and water content in saturated and unsaturated porous media. Numerous reviews
    of these petrophysical models have been published [Bussian, 1983; Worthington,
    1985; Mualem and Friedman, 1991; Benderitter and Schott, 1999] and their respective
    advantages and drawbacks have been discussed. The first model was established
    for clean sand, i.e. without any clay, in saturated or unsaturated conditions
    [Archie, 1942]. This model can not be used for the soil at our study site, which
    is a much more heterogeneous soil that contains clays. Wyllie and Southwick [1954]
    suggested that an aggregate of conductive particles saturated with a conductive
    electrolyte could be modeled with a three resistor network. Waxman and Smits [1968]
    proposed the first extensive model of shaly sand formations. They proposed that
    clay particles contribute exchange cations to the electrolyte thereby increasing
    the conductivity of the formation. The dual water model suggested by Clavier et
    al. [1977] is based on the assumption that the exchange cations contribute to
    the conductivity of a clay water which is spatially separated from the bulk water
    located in the pore space. More complex theoretical relationship were proposed
    relying upon properties of a solid phase dispersed in a continuous electrolyte
    [Bussian, 1983] or accounting for the different behavior of ions in the spore
    space [Revil et al., 1998]. Mualem and Friedman [1991] proposed a model more adapted
    for soil at any water saturation but it does not take into account the surface
    conductivity. So, in unsaturated condition this model seems more adapted for soil
    with a coarse texture. The quality of the prediction decreases for fine texture
    as clayed soil. Most published models are either theoretical and present some
    physical limits, or are obtained in laboratory on small soil cores with controlled
    conditions. [16] We considered the use of both laboratory-derived and field-derived
    petrophysical relationships for application to our field-scale ERT data. We attempted
    to use a laboratory calibration because it was easier and faster to measure the
    soil core electrical resistivity on a vast range of soil moisture. During a drying
    period, electrical resistivity and water content were measured on a cylindrical
    soil core from LAci and Sci1 loamy-clay horizons. As expected, a high soil electrical
    resistivity decrease was observed as soil volumetric water content increased up
    to 15%, and when the soil volumetric moisture increased from 15% to 45%, a regular
    and weaker soil resistivity decrease was remarked. However, these relationships
    obtained in laboratory were not representative because the saturation water conductivity
    of the soil cores was different from the natural soil solution electrical conductivity
    in the field. Moreover, we observed a high variability of the soil core electrical
    resistivity measurement with the soil sample volume. For the same moisture, an
    increase in the soil core volume was always associated with a higher electrical
    resistivity value, which suggests that the measurement elementary volume of the
    soil core must be defined before using a laboratory relationship. Because of this
    major limitation, we decided instead in this study to develop a field-scale site
    specific petrophysical model, which we judged to be more representative of natural
    conditions. [17] The aims of this field study were (1) to verify that soil moisture
    changes generate measurable electrical resistivity changes, (2) to set up a simple
    field-scale calibration relationship for each soil horizon enabling the calculation
    of soil water content as a function of its temperature and electrical resistivity,
    and (3) to use these relationships with time-lapse ERT data to estimate moisture
    content variations over time at the field scale. [18] This calibration was performed
    with a monitoring device implanted in a calibration pit (Figure 3) dug into the
    Calcisol very near of the experimental plot. The electrical resistivity of the
    soil horizons was measured by a Wenner electrode array with an electrode spacing
    of 0.15 m. The electrodes were driven horizontally into the wall of the pit over
    a length of 0.35 m at 0.18 m, 0.50 m, and 1 m depths as illustrated in Figure
    3. Only the extremities of the electrodes were in electrical contact with the
    soil enabling a point measurement of electrical potential and point injection
    of electrical current in an infinite medium. The geometry of the quadripoles allowed
    most of the current lines to remain in each studied soil layer. The water content
    and temperature of the three soil horizons were measured with TDR probes and platinum-wire
    thermal probes respectively. After installation of the different sensors, the
    soil pit was carefully refilled, horizon by horizon. To limit the disruptive effects
    of the soil structure deterioration caused by the excavation, the monitoring began
    more than 6 months after the installation of the sensors and lasted one year.
    The various synchronized measurements were made on average every two weeks (Table
    2). Thirty measurements were made on dates likely to show the various soil moisture
    states. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Experimental setup for geophysical
    characterization of soil horizons in the calibration pit. Table 2. Physical Parameters

    and ΔV is the potential difference measured between electrodes M and N (Figure
    3). The electrical resistivity was measured not only at different water contents
    but also at different soil temperatures. To eliminate the effect of the temperature
    and determine only the electrical resistivity and horizon moisture relationship,
    all the electrical resistivity measurements were corrected and related to a reference
    temperature of 25°C. The correction rule, adopted for a range of temperatures
    from 5°C to 25°C, corresponding to the maximal amplitude of the variation of the
    soil thermal profile, is a 2% per °C linear increase of the electrical conductivity
    of the soil with temperature [Campbell et al., 1948; Iliceto, 1969] as the following
    relationship : with ρT electrical resistivity at the temperature T (in Celsius
    degree), σT electrical conductivity at the temperature T, σ25°C electrical conductivity
    at 25°C. [20] Linear regression was used to determine the specific relationships
    between water content and electrical resistivity of the three typical Calcisol
    horizons measured in the calibration pit (Figures 3 and 4). The literature and
    laboratory measurements showed that polynomial function (power 2) or power function
    were must commonly used for a large range of moisture changes ranging between
    full saturation and dry soil states. However, for low volumetric water content
    changes ranging from 20% to 35% between the permanent wilting point and the field
    capacity, which corresponds to natural soil moisture changes in the region, our
    laboratory measurements confirmed that the most simple linear relationship was
    overall sufficient for the all three soil horizons. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer

    water flow by electrical resistivity tomography and to produce a 2-D soil water
    content tomography. [21] The relationships between electrical resistivity and
    moisture of the three typical horizons of the Calcisol showed and verified that
    in the explored domain, electrical resistivity increased linearly with decreasing
    water content. Nevertheless, the slope and the sensitivity of the relationship
    varied depending on the soil horizon under consideration (Figure 5). The linear
    relation between moisture and electrical resistivity of the horizons was quantified
    by their correlation coefficient R (Table 3). A quality index ∣ΔR/R∣ representing
    the ratio between the confidence interval of the correlation coefficient ΔR for
    a 5% error margin and the correlation coefficient R enabled the relationships
    to be classified. When the ΔR was high and ∣R∣ was low, a high index value showed
    an inferior quality of the relationship. Inversely, if ΔR was restricted to a
    high value of R close to 1, a low value of the index indicated a high quality
    relationship. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Calibration relationships

    The loamy clay horizon Sci1 displayed the best linear relationship. The coefficient
    R, for a confidence level of 95%, ranged between the values of −0.98 and −0.92.
    The quality index, with a value close to zero, was the lowest of the studied soil
    profiles, which indicated the highest quality calibration relationship. The sensitivity,
    corresponding to the inverse of the slope absolute value, was 2.8 Ωm by percent
    of soil volumetric water content. Nevertheless, the electrical resistivity measured
    was lower than those measured in the laboratory on cylindrical soil cores with
    the same moisture range [Michot et al., 2001] and furthermore, the sensitivity
    of 2.8 Ωm was clearly higher than that observed in the laboratory which was 1.7
    Ωm by percent of soil volumetric water content. This could be explained either
    by a difference between the volume measured in the field and that of the samples,
    by the disturbance due to the transport of the sample in laboratory, or by variability
    in the samples. [23] The plowed surface horizon, LAci, displayed a linear relationship
    characterized by a coefficient R = −0.80, taken between −0.64 and −0.90 for an
    accepted confidence level of 95%. The sensitivity of the relationship was 3.9
    Ωm by percent of soil water content. Considering the data, a power 2 polynomial
    function seemed appropriate too. However, a residual analysis showed that was
    not significant improvement of this curve fitting in comparison with a linear
    relationship. Both small range of resistivity and moisture changes explained that
    a good fit of such a curve could not be obtained. On the field, we have not access
    to soil water content extreme values as in laboratory. So, we do not have any
    reason to choose a power 2 polynomial function. A linear relationship was sufficient.
    [24] The linear relationship observed in the cryoturbated calcareous horizon of
    Ck(m)1 presented the lowest correlation coefficient and the highest quality index
    of the three Calcisol horizons. For a small water content change, the apparent
    resistivity data were relatively dispersed. Because of this major limitation we
    used only a linear relationship. The heterogeneity of the cryoturbated limestone
    horizon and the lower moisture variation in this horizon situated at a 1 m depth
    could explain the lower quality of the relationship. For a decrease in soil moisture
    of 5%, the resistivity of the horizon increased by 90 Ωm, i.e. a sensitivity close
    to 19.9 Ωm by percent of soil volumetric water content. 5. Monitoring [25] The
    aim of this field study was to first acquire the resistivity data for later transformation
    in water content and secondly, to acquire point water content measurements for
    validation of the estimated water content (Figure 4). For this second purpose
    a second pit was dug near the monitoring study area (Figure 2). [26] This data
    acquisition was carried out during an irrigation cycle, on a corn crop characterized
    by a regular implantation of corn plants in rows justifying a 2-D study. Two-dimensional
    soil electrical resistivity tomography data were acquired over time using a multielectrode
    method at the surface of the study area. Two-dimensional soil moisture profiles
    were then estimated from the 2-D ERT profiles using the calibration relationships
    previously established from stationary measures in the pit, as described in 6.
    [27] Temporal monitoring of the electrical resistivity, water content and temperature
    of a vertical soil section was carried out over a period of 10 days (Figure 6
    and Table 2), before, during and after irrigation of the experimental plot by
    means of a rotating ramp fitted with sprinklers. Irrigation supplied 25 mm of
    water by sprinkling on the experimental device between 18h and 20h. On 1 September
    2000, 5 mm of additional water is supplied by one hour of rainfall. The electrical
    conductivity of the irrigation water measured in 5 samples taken from 4 rain gauges
    and in the rainfall recorder ranged between 17.5 10−3 S m−1 and 19 10−3 S m−1
    (Table 4). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Electrical tomography, natural
    rainfall, and irrigation water depth records over time. Table 4. Electrical Conductivity

    Interpretation 5.1.1. Electrical Device and Data Acquisition [28] Resistivity
    measurements were carried out with the resistivity meter Syscal R1 (Iris Instruments,
    Orléans, France) equipped with 32 electrodes. The intensity and voltage accuracy
    is 0.3%, which is consistent with the measurements carried out under constant
    surface conditions. Repeated measurements in stable hydrogeologic conditions for
    about ten hours were persistent within a tenth of an ohm-meter, i.e., one thousandth
    of the measured resistivity. During sprinkling, variations of the measured resistivity
    could reach several ohm-meters between two sets of measurements 1 hour apart.
    The electrodes remained on the soil surface during all the experiment time to
    avoid any electrode polarization changes and to ensure a best quality of measurements.
    [29] The experimental setup included a row of 32 electrodes, lined up on the soil
    surface (Figure 2), in a direction perpendicularly to 8 corn rows, which were
    separated by 0.8 m. This device had a total length of 6.2 m with an electrode
    spacing (a) of 0.2 m. The dipole-dipole arrangement was chosen because it allowed
    the greatest number of measurements for a given number of electrodes, which was
    advantageous for data inversion. Moreover, the dipole-dipole array was very sensitive
    to horizontal changes in resistivity, but relatively insensitive to vertical changes
    in resistivity. That means that it was convenient in mapping vertical structures,
    such as water preferential flow direction induced by soil cracks. For each resistivity
    measurement, electrical current was injected between two adjacent electrodes (dipole
    A B) and the difference potential was measured between two others neighboring
    electrodes (dipole MN). A preprogrammed measurement sequence (Figure 7) was implemented
    in the resistivity meter and the multiplexer provided electrode commutation. To
    obtain the best resolution, especially down to 0.50 m depth, 345 measurements,
    located at 15 levels of investigation, were made during each sequence. The first
    6 levels (n) were characterized by a spacing (s = a) between electrodes of each
    dipole. For each of these 6 levels (n), the spacing between dipoles was (n × s
    = n × a). One possible disadvantage of this array was the very small signal strength
    for large values of the (n) factor, the voltage being inversely proportional to
    the cube of the (n) factor. This means that for the same current, the voltage
    measured by the resistivity meter dropped by about 200 times, when (n) was increased
    from 1 to 6. One method to overcome this problem, was to increase the (a) spacing
    between both electrodes of each dipole to reduce the drop in the potential when
    the overall length of the array was increased to increase the depth of investigation.
    So, to insure the measurement quality at depth with a high signal/noise ratio,
    6 new levels (n) were investigated with a spacing (s = 2a) between electrodes
    of each dipole. For the same reason, the measurements at the last 3 levels were
    made with a spacing (s = 3a). By convention, each apparent electrical resistivity
    measurements were located at the quadripole center and at a depth proportional
    to both dipole spacing. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Measurement
    sequence to construct a pseudosection using a dipole-dipole multielectrode setup.
    Measurements are shown on a vertical plane. [30] Each ERT sequence took just under
    one hour to acquire. During the first 36 hours of space-time monitoring of the
    water flow, the resistivity was monitored at regular intervals of 1 hour, then
    at increasing intervals (Table 2). 5.1.2. ERT Processing [31] Inversion of the
    measured resistivities is an essential step before interpretation because the
    raw resistivity measurements rarely give the true structure of the soil. Panissod
    et al. [2001] showed that the 2-D inversion was appropriate in this case according
    to a 3-D inversion. Indeed, a 3-D modeling using both finite difference and moment-method
    confirmed the reality of 2-D artifacts, showed that 3-D effects were not significant
    and allowed us to exclude numerical artifacts. So inverted resistivity sections
    were achieved with the RES2DINV software [Loke and Barker, 1996]. This technique
    was based on the smoothness-constrained least squares method and it produced 2-D
    subsurface model from the resistivity section. In the first iteration, a homogeneous
    earth model was used as starting model for which the resistivity partial derivative
    values could be calculated analytically. For subsequent iterations, a quasi-Newton
    method was used to estimate the partial derivatives which reduced the computer
    time. In this method, the Jacobian matrices for a homogeneous earth model was
    used for the first iteration, and the Jacobian matrices for subsequent iterations
    were estimated by an updating technique. The model consisted of a rectangular
    grid. The software determined the resistivity of each mesh which gave a calculated
    electrical resistivity section according to field measurements. The iterative
    optimization method attempted to reduce the differences between measured resistivity
    values and those calculated with the inversion model. The difference was estimated
    by the root mean square error (RMS error). Topographic correction was not taken
    into account for this inversion process, and each ERT was inverted independently.
    The model obtained from the inversion of the initial data set was not used as
    a reference model to constrain the inversion of the later time-lapse data sets,
    as it was possible with the recent version of RES2DINV software. A minimum of
    5 successive iterations were made. However, for ERT inversions, the same number
    of data and mesh of the model were conserved, so the inversion of each ERT data
    was not totally independent. [32] Each measured resistivity section was inverted.
    Water infiltration was indicated by variations in electrical resistivity of the
    soils, as expected [Ward, 1990], i.e. electrical resistivity in the soils decreases
    when the soil water content increases, and vice versa. To enhance the representation
    of that occurrence, sections of resistivity changes were calculated in relation
    to some sections measured at typical moments representative of particular hydric
    soil states. In this manner of calculating “difference images”, water infiltration
    was studied in relation to the first ERT (P1, Figure 6) measured at the initial
    soil moisture state at the beginning of the experimental monitoring. Soil desiccation
    by evapotranspiration was observed by comparison to an ERT (P37, Figure 6) made
    after irrigation of a wet soil, near field capacity, whose moisture profile was
    therefore considered stabilized. 5.1.3. Procedure for Soil Moisture Estimation
    Using ERT Data [33] The water content section was shaped from the rectangular
    grid network of the 2-D ERT data established during geophysical inversion. The
    vertical rectangular grid (Figure 5) was composed of 175 rectangular meshes localized
    by their central coordinates (X, Z). X represents the horizontal distance along
    the electrode line and Z is the vertical depth of rectangular mesh center. The
    grid was divided into 7 layers, which depths were 0.03 m, 0.11 m, 0.19 m, 0.30
    m, 0.43 m, 0.59 m and 0.80 m respectively. [34] The calibration relationships
    obtained for the three typical Calcisol horizons were respectively attributed
    to the corresponding rectangular meshes. The relationship obtained between resistivity
    and water content of the plowed LAci horizon was used for the first four layers
    of meshes. The observed relationship on the median structural horizon Sci1 was
    used for the next two layers of meshes. Finally, the typical relationship of the
    mineral horizon Ck(m)1 was used for the last layer of meshes. As the soil thermal
    profile was known at the moment of each electrical tomography measurement, the
    soil temperature at the center of each mesh was calculated by linear interpolation.
    For each one, the calibration relationship for the calculation of water content
    values was selected at the temperature nearest to the real soil temperature at
    this depth. The 2-D water content sections were then mapped by means of a triangulation
    method. [35] To evaluate the quality of the soil moisture prediction, 349 water
    content values measured in the plowed LAci horizon by TDR probes were compared
    with those modeled from the electrical tomographies measured at the same time
    and with the same coordinates (X,Z) (Figure 4). The soil water contents modeled
    and compared with the TDR measurements were located either under the corn rows
    (X = 2.7 m and X =3.5 m), or between them (X = 3.1 m and X = 3.9 m). As only the
    rectangular meshes situated at depths of Z = 0.1 m, 0.19 m and 0.3 m corresponded
    to the TDR implanted at respectively 0.10 m, 0.20 m and 0.30 m depths (Figure
    2), the modeled and observed moistures were only compared in the plowed LAci horizon.
    Thus 96, 126, 127 moistures content measurements and estimates were compared at
    the respective depths of 0.10 m, 0.20 m and 0.30 m. 5.2. Measurements of Soil
    Water Content and Soil Temperature Using Conventional Approaches [36] Soil volumetric
    water content and soil temperature were estimated and measured, simultaneously
    during ERT acquisition using point measuring devices. Four moisture profiles were
    monitored over time using 18 TDR probes. [37] Two moisture profiles were studied
    directly beneath a corn row (rows R4 and R5), and two others were located between
    two rows (row spacings R4–R5 and R5–R6). The TDR probes were set at 0.1 m, 0.2
    m, 0.3 m, 0.5 m and 0.7 m depths in loamy clay horizons. Moisture profiles were
    measured at 20 min intervals. Thermal soil profile changes were monitored by 5
    platinum-wire thermal probes (PT100). Soil temperature was measured at 0.1 m,
    0.2 m, 0.5 m, 0.7 m and 1 m depths (Figure 2). Thermal profiles were measured
    every hour (Table 2). At the soil surface, a rainfall recorder registered the
    times and rates of sprinkler irrigation. Five rain gauges measured the amounts
    of irrigation water. Two rain gauges were situated underneath corn rows and three
    others between corn rows. [38] The distribution on the soil surface of water droplets
    from rainfall or sprinkler irrigation depended both on the aerial parts of the
    corn plants and on the local topography. This topography was the result of farming
    practices, mainly tractor wheel ruts. Water accumulated on the soil surface during
    irrigation, formed puddles and water flows along the ruts on the slope as streamlets.
    The rate of water infiltration into the soil was therefore lower than the sprinkling
    rate. In order to study the role of topography in the location of preferential
    infiltration sites, a detailed topographical survey was carried out. The experimental
    plot selected in the corn field was an 8 m by 2 m rectangle. The slope was less
    than 2% and the corn row orientation followed the slope (NW/SE). A detailed digital
    elevation model (DEM) (Figure 8) of the experimental plot was built with the help
    of a high-performance global positioning system (GPS): Aquarius, from Thalès Navigation.
    The altitude survey was made in real time by a GPS working in a differential mode.
    The quality of the system allowed very fast measurements: in a few seconds a point
    was located with a precision of less than 1 cm. Measurements were taken atop a
    2.50 m pole in contact with the ground surface to avoid any interference from
    the corn foliage. A grid marked on the ground insured a regular 20 cm spacing
    of the sampling points. During the topographical survey, 603 altitude measurements
    were recorded over a 16 m2 surface. The positions of every corn plant and each
    electrode of the geophysical measuring device were precisely recorded. The DEM
    (Figure 8) was computed with Arc-Info software and its Grid module (ESRI). A network
    of points, with a 5 cm spacing, was built by a triangulation interpolation method.
    Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Elevation sampling points and digital
    elevation model (DEM) of the experimental plot. 6. Results 6.1. Evolution of the
    Thermal and Hydric Profiles [39] The moisture profiles measured using TDR probes
    during the monitoring under the corn rows or between them showed varying infiltration
    as a function of depth and location (Figure 9). Under the corn rows, the volumetric
    moisture profiles showed the effect of irrigation with a moisture increase of
    more than 10% in the plowed horizon. After irrigation, superficial drainage occurred
    in the horizon with a progressive decrease in surface moisture and an increase
    by infiltration of the water content in the Sci1 horizon at 0.5 m depth. The infiltration
    was clearly noticeable and instantaneous under corn row R4 with a moisture increase
    of nearly 5%. It was less significant under row R5 where the water content remained
    constant at a 0.5 m depth. Later, the moisture profiles under the corn rows progressively
    returned to their initial state. Finally, at the depth of 0.7 m, there was no
    change in soil moisture. When irrigation began, the usable water reserves were
    by no means exhausted in the LAci horizon but also in the median Sci1 horizon
    where plant roots decreased (Table 5). Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    10.9 31.2 a The term pF can be obtained from the soil matric potential ΨM according
    to the formula pF = log(−ΨM). Water content is in percent. [40] The situation
    was different between the rows. Before irrigation, the moisture content was high,
    mainly between corn rows R4 and R5, nearly at field capacity. In the cultivated
    upper horizon, the moisture increased by about 5% as did the irrigation but this
    increase was lower than that observed under the corn rows. During the drainage
    and after irrigation, the moisture profiles measured between rows remained relatively
    constant over time. The water did not appear to infiltrate further down than the
    plowed horizon between rows R5–R6 and infiltrated only slightly between rows R4–R5
    (Figure 9). [41] The temperature variation did not seem to be directly related
    to variations in water content, apart from a decrease in temperature of 1°C at
    a 0.1 m depth just after the beginning of irrigation (curve 3). The thermal profiles
    were difficult to interpret. The daily cycle probably influenced the soil temperature
    at the time of the electrical data acquisition. Moreover, the platinum-wired thermal
    probes were not located in the same vertical plane (Figure 2). 6.2. Soil Hydric
    Fluxes Characterization From ERT [42] Two-dimensional soil water content sections
    were then estimated using the ERT data, the calibration relationships between
    the electrical resistivity, the water content of the three horizons typical of
    the Calcisol (Figures 4 and 5), and the soil thermal profile. The last stage of
    processing consisted of testing the quality of the model soil moisture prediction
    by comparing measured and calculated water contents along the 2-D profiles. [43]
    Sixty ERT profiles were acquired. In the context of this work, only eight ERT
    profiles (P1, P4, P16, P28, P37, P51, P55, and P60; Figure 6), which were particularly
    representative of moisture stages, were presented (Figure 10). For each ERT section,
    two moisture profiles were indicated. The first moisture profile was obtained
    just under the corn row 4, while the second one was measured between rows 4 and
    5. The section P1, measured at the beginning of the experiment, just before irrigation
    at 12:16 P.M. on August 30th, characterized the initial soil moisture state defined
    as reference. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Characteristic true soil
    sections resistivity and volumetric moisture profiles measured over time during
    water infiltration after sprinkling and subsequent soil drying phase. 6.2.1. Initial
    Soil Moisture State [44] In the section P1 (first row of Figure 10), the main
    typical soil horizons were identified by their electrical resistivity. The first
    layer between the soil surface and the 0.3 m depth corresponded to the plowed
    LAci loamy-clay layer. It appeared to have a moderate resistivity (20 Ω m < ρ
    < 70 Ω m), with resistive structures (ρ > 100 Ω m) under each corn plant. According
    to the profiles of corn roots density (Figure 2) [Nicoullaud et al., 1995], the
    major resistivity anomalies in the plowed layer indicated that the soil volume
    had dried as a result of corn root water uptake [Michot et al., 2001]. The drying
    process in the plowed layer was not uniform. This effect was less intense between
    rows due to compaction by tractor wheels (X-coordinates 1.5 and 3.1 m). Soil compaction
    between the corn rows by agricultural machines was also visible on the DEM (Figure
    8). Wheel tracks had modeled the soil microtopography. The fact that the zones
    between the corn rows were lower was evidence of their compaction, which was also
    shown by a higher apparent density of the plowed horizon between the surface and
    a depth of 0.1 m (Table 6). These compacted zones had a smaller root density [Tardieu
    and Manichon, 1987]. The systematically oblique variations in the electrical resistivity
    of the soil and the oblique orientation of the pockets of resistant soil within
    the plowed horizon seemed linked to the orientation of the plowing clods. However,
    the obliqueness of these structures could also be an artifact linked to the nonsymmetrical
    positioning of the electrodes in relation to the corn plants or to the meshing
    of the electrical resistivity section during inversion. Table 6. Bulk Density

    1.40 0.14 a Soil core volume is 500 cm3. [45] The median soil layer corresponding
    to the Sci1 horizon had the lowest resistivity. The high clay content (32%) of
    the horizon explained its high conductivity (Table 1). The gradual increase of
    electrical resistivity with depth was related to clay content decrease and to
    smaller water uptake by corn roots. [46] At a depth of 0.7 to 0.75 m, a resistive
    layer appeared, corresponding to the Ck(m)1 horizon composed of beige cryoturbated
    limestone. 6.2.2. Water Infiltration Phase [47] After irrigation, monitoring of
    the water flows was performed using the relative variations of ERT sections (Figure
    11). Before irrigation, the electrical tomographies P1 and P4 measured at a two-hour
    interval in the same moisture conditions produced closely comparable resistivities.
    In the absence of change in the moisture state of the soil, in particular at the
    greatest depths, the electrical resistivity measurements were reproduced. Figure
    11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil sections of relative resistivity changes
    measured over time respectively during the soil wetting phase and subsequent drying
    phase. [48] During the moistening phase after the application of 25 mm of sprinkled
    water, the progressive saturation of the plowed LAci horizon by infiltration explained
    the general decrease in soil resistivity. [49] Selective infiltration occurred
    under the corn plants and not in the low zones, between the corn rows, where surface
    water had a tendency to accumulate due to the effect of the soil microtopography
    (Figures 8 and 11). The vertical anomalies of negative electrical resistivity
    changes observed under the corn rows corresponded to the preferential directions
    of water flow. The aerial parts of the corn plants played an important role in
    the catching of water droplets. The water ran down the length of the stem, causing
    first an increase in soil moisture, and then infiltration under the corn plants.
    The role of topography would therefore appear to be less important in water infiltration
    as the water hardly infiltrated in the low zones between the rows. [50] Three
    resistive pockets in the LAci horizon between corn rows R3 and R4 persisted over
    time. This was explained by the local soil microtopography. The irrigation water
    did not infiltrate here but ran rapidly in the direction of the slope toward the
    low zones in the soil surface created by tractor-wheel tracks (Figure 8). [51]
    Locally, the upper parts of the median Sci1 horizon showed resistivities of less
    than 20 Ω m, with a 20 to 70% resistivity decrease compared to the initial soil
    conditions. The percolating water could reach the upper part of the horizon and
    accumulated in the pores of the horizon. [52] Two vertical structures located
    between two corn rows were characterized by an electrical resistivity that was
    constant or slightly increased over time. These domains were separated by a distance
    of 1.6 m to 1.8 m, corresponding to wheel span of an agricultural machine. The
    base of the LAci horizon was probably compacted by the passage of an agricultural
    machine before the corn was sown as the wheel tracks corresponding to the compacted
    zones did not appear in the soil topography. Soil compaction was shown between
    corn rows R5 and R6 by a higher bulk density of the LAci horizon, which could
    reach a value of 1.56 (Table 6). Compaction of the plowed horizon by the wheels
    of agricultural machines significantly reduced the infiltration capacity of the
    soil. Ankeny et al. [1990] showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the soil
    was greatly reduced by the passage of the wheels and they attributed this to the
    destruction of the macropores by compaction. The compacting of the horizon could
    create a shadow zone preventing the vertical infiltration of the water. Similarly,
    water was collected between the rows and was evacuated down the slope as runoff.
    There were two possible explanations of soil electrical resistivity increase either
    a soil temperature decrease or a soil moisture decrease. However, a numerical
    simulation showed that a realistic soil temperature decrease of 1°C provoked by
    cold water infiltration nearby could not explain an electrical resistivity increase
    higher than 5%. At the same depth, the soil moisture changes under a corn plant
    could be very different and even inverse from those observed under the both compacted
    area because the water infiltrated to this depth with different velocities. Moreover,
    the soil moisture history could involve different hydric behaviors. The experiment
    performed a sudden soil moistening after a slow drying phase between two water
    sprinklings. Under the compacted horizon characterized by a low hydraulic conductivity
    the local wetting kinetic was asynchronous in comparison with the rest of the
    soil profile. Both these domains were always in a slow drying phase. So, the electrical
    resistivity increase could be explained by a local water content decrease. 6.2.3.
    Soil Desiccation Phase [53] During the drying phase, after the drainage period,
    the soil pockets characterized by a high electrical resistivity reappeared under
    the corn plants in the LAci horizon (Figure 11). The size of the structures associated
    with the positive variations in electrical resistivity in relation to the electrical
    tomography P37 increased with time. The increase in electrical resistivity was
    first seen in the LAci horizon, then spread progressively downward. Soil pockets,
    drained by the corn root water uptake, were detected by an increase in the electrical
    resistivity of the soil. At the end of the monitoring period, the shape of the
    positive resistivity anomalies under the corn plants and the amplitude of the
    increase in electrical resistivity, evolved in the same way as the corn root frequency
    profiles : higher in the plowed horizon and lower at depth [Nicoullaud et al.,
    1995]. To strengthen these observations and to retrieve information about root
    water uptake and soil water reserve from the time variations of resistivity, Tabbagh
    et al. [2002] have developed a model that solves simultaneously Richard''s and
    heat conduction equations, and delivers for each time intervals the soil water
    distribution after sprinkling and the corresponding resistivity variations. 6.3.
    Soil Moisture Sections and Validation [54] Five 2-D sections of moisture content
    of the selected soil, estimated using the ERT data obtained at various dates of
    the monitoring, are presented in Figure 12. The use of a linear relationship between
    moisture and electrical resistivity for the three soil horizons suggests that
    the spatial structure of the moisture sections and of the electrical resistivity
    sections are similar. The moisture sections reproduce the water flow previously
    revealed by variations in electrical resistivity during the phases of water infiltration
    and soil drainage. Figure 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Characteristic soil
    moisture content sections computed over time during the experimental monitoring
    period. [55] For the whole of the plowed LAci horizon, the water contents estimated
    using ERT data are effectively correlated with the measured values (R = 0.68)
    using TDR data (Figure 13 and Table 7). The slope of the linear regression between
    the modeled and measured water contents is close to the ideal value of 1. The
    estimate precision was quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE), while
    the estimation bias was quantified by the mean error (ME). The estimation bias
    is small and corresponds to an overestimation of 1.45% of the volumetric moisture.
    The precision of the water content estimation is 3.63%. The residual histogram,
    corresponding to the difference between the measured and calculated moistures,
    shows a Gaussian distribution of the residues (Figure 14). The histogram also
    shows that 26.5% of the residues range between −1% and +1% of volumetric moisture
    and that 67% of the residues are between −3% and +3% of volumetric moisture. The
    quality of the estimate of soil moisture is therefore satisfying. Figure 13 Open

    0.76 −0.38 3.26 0.3 127 0.45 −2.40 3.80 [56] In Table 7, the highest correlation
    coefficient, the smallest bias and the greatest precision, reveal the best moisture
    estimation at a depth of 0.2 m. [57] Conversely, at a depth of 0.3 m the correlation
    coefficient between the calculated and measured moistures is the lowest, the estimation
    bias the highest and the estimation precision the worst. At this depth, the moisture
    seems slightly overestimated as the majority of the estimation residues (33%)
    is between −3% and −1% of volumetric water content. The presence of the plowed
    pan at a depth of 0.3 m may explain this low correlation. The plowed pan constitutes
    the limit between the plowed surface horizon and the structural horizon Sci1.
    At this level, the structure of the LAci horizon compacted by tillage is modified.
    The plowed pan is characterized by a major decrease in porosity and a modification
    of the hydrodynamic behavior of the horizon with a reduced infiltration. These
    changes explain why the calibration relationship of the LAci horizon is less adapted
    at this level and therefore why the correlation is lower. [58] Several factors
    may explain the deviation between the soil water content estimation using ERT
    and measured by the TDR probes. (1) One is the distance of about 1 m separating
    the multielectrode device from the TDR profiles while soil moisture varies on
    a decimeter scale. (2) Another is the effect of the sides of the trench on the
    water flow. (3) The difference between the soil resistivity during the monitoring
    and the resistivity calculated by the 2-D ERT inversion procedure is another factor.
    The precision of the inversion and therefore of the estimation of the soil resistivity
    depends, among other sources of uncertainties, on the configuration of the electrodes,
    the interval between the electrodes and the number of measurements of the apparent
    resistivity of the soil. (4) Although small electrodes were used to reduce the
    contact resistance between the soil and the electrode, it is difficult to consider
    them as points which would be necessary for surveys requiring high resolution
    and shallow investigation depths. (5) The resistivity of soils may be subject
    to hysteretic phenomena. (6) As the conduction of current in soils is mainly electrolytic,
    soil resistivity depends not only on moisture and temperature but also on the
    ionic concentration of the studied soil solutions. During the experiment, the
    soil solution may be diluted by irrigation water pumped into a stratified aquifer
    with a significant TDS loading [Schnebelen et al., 1999] leading to nonnegligible
    variations in the electrical resistivities. (7) The time (1 hour) needed to acquire
    a resistivity section is relatively long compared with the infiltration rate of
    water during irrigation. A device permitting more rapid data collection must be
    considered in the future. 7. Conclusions [59] Acquiring ERT data along a vertical
    soil section with a multielectrode surface method, which is nondestructive and
    spatially integrating, the boundaries of some soil horizons were delineated. Soil
    moisture changes over time were revealed by electrical resistivity changes in
    the soil. Two-dimensional soil water content sections were calculated from the
    ERT using field-scale calibration relationships between the electrical resistivity
    of each soil horizon and its water content. As the temperature variations in the
    soil affect the electrical resistivity of the water and therefore that of the
    soil, the thermal profile of the soil during the electrical resistivity measurements
    were taken into account in the calculation. A comparison of the modeled water
    contents with those measured by TDR probes confirmed that the reliability of a
    site-specific linear relationship between the calculated and measured moistures
    in the plowed LAci surface horizon. Overall, in the plowed surface horizon, the
    moisture estimates showed a precision of 3.6% for an estimation bias corresponding
    to a water content overestimation of 1.4%. The best estimation was obtained at
    20 cm depth where the effects of both large surface moisture fluctuations and
    compaction of the plowed pan were attenuated. [60] The hydraulic functioning of
    the soil was then monitored during a moistening/drying cycle. The drying out of
    the soil by corn root water uptake, the progression of the infiltration front
    after irrigation, the delimitation of preferential-flow zones and the surface
    drainage of the soil were identified and localized. At this stage of corn development
    (3 months), the parts of the soil involved in soil infiltration and drainage were
    mainly located directly under the corn rows. The corn plants played a major role
    in the redistribution of surface water before it infiltrated, while the role of
    the topography in water infiltration appeared to be limited. The particular structural
    characteristics of the soil horizons resulting from agricultural practices, and
    the notable effect of soil compaction due to the passage of agricultural machines
    were observed. In zones where the soil was compacted, moisture variations were
    negligible, which demonstrated the negative effects of compaction on water flow
    as well as on the possibilities of water storage. [61] Measurements of soil water
    content using conventional tools typically sampling over small volumes, at wide
    intervals, and in an intrusive manner, are generally less representative than
    the actual and very complex situation of the soil moisture state. They do not
    allow a good monitoring of the evolution of soil moisture. Estimation of water
    content using ERT as a first approximation of the spatial distribution of soil
    water content in a cultivated soil is shown to be significant. Nevertheless, the
    validity of the proposed model could be limited to specific regional conditions
    such as loamy clay soils of the Beauce region. [62] In the future, this method
    may allow verification of sprinkling irrigation efficiency and better estimation
    of the useful available water in the soil. Water spatial distribution is influenced
    by crop root distribution with depth, which is dependent on soil type and soil
    management as tillage operations. This method is a high-resolution investigation
    tool to study soil moisture and to perform soil water flow temporal monitoring.
    [63] The development and adoption of precision farming and rational irrigation
    require a detailed knowledge of soils and crops [Robert, 1999]. This method is
    useful in research to describe the soil spatial variability and its hydric behavior
    with a high resolution. However, the precision is higher than the investigation
    level required in precision farming, and the requirement of an additional field
    calibration may render the method impractical for routine field use. The use of
    a general petrophysical relationship between the soil electrical resistivity and
    its moisture, if appropriate, could reduce the effort needed to make this a practical
    field tool for the purpose of improving irrigation management. Acknowledgments

    efficiency of turfgrass, promoting water conservation and reducing environmental
    impacts. The objectives of this research were to quantify irrigation water use
    and to evaluate turf quality differences between (1) time-based scheduling with
    and without a rain sensor (RS); (2) a time-based schedule compared to a soil moisture
    sensor (SMS)-based irrigation system; and (3) different commercially available
    SMS systems. The experimental area consisted of common bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon
    (L.) Pers.] plots ( 3.7 m × 3.7 m ) , located in Gainesville, Fla. The monitoring
    period took place from July 20 to December 14, 2004, and from March 25 to August
    31, 2005. SMS-based treatments consisted of irrigating one, two, or seven days
    a week, each with four different commercial SMS brands. Time-based treatments
    with or without RS and a nonirrigated treatment were also implemented. Significant
    differences in turfgrass quality among treatments were not detected due to the
    sustained wet weather conditions during the testing periods. The treatment with
    the rain sensor resulted in 34% less water applied than that without the rain
    sensor (2-WORS) treatment. Most SMS brands recorded irrigation water savings compared
    to 2-WORS, ranging from 69 to 92% for three of four SMSs tested, depending on
    the irrigation frequency. Therefore, SMS systems represent a promising technology
    because of the water savings that they can achieve during wet weather conditions
    while maintaining acceptable turfgrass quality. Introduction Turfgrass is the
    main cultivated crop in Florida with nearly four times the acreage as the next
    largest crop, citrus (Hodges et al. 1994; USDA 2005). Irrigation of residential,
    commercial, industrial, and recreational turf areas is commonly employed to ensure
    acceptable turf quality. As a consequence of problems related to droughts, coupled
    with the steadily increasing demand for water, the state of Florida has imposed
    restrictions on irrigation water use. The development of best management practices
    (BMPs) for irrigation water use in turf has become an undeniable strategic, economic,
    and environmental issue for the state. New landscape irrigation technologies could
    improve irrigation efficiency by promoting water conservation and reducing environmental
    impacts. Florida receives an average of approximately 1,400 mm of rainfall a year,
    which varies depending on location in the state. Although rainfall, typically,
    exceeds evapotranspiration (ET), irrigation is required because total annual rainfall,
    typically, varies both geographically and temporally (USDA 1981; Carriker 2000;
    NOAA 2003), and lack of rainfall for even a few days causes depletion of moisture
    in the predominately sandy soils found in Florida (Carriker 2000; NRC 1996). Florida
    has the second largest withdrawal of groundwater for public supply in the United
    States. In 1995, nearly 93% of the population in Florida used groundwater as a
    drinking water source (Solley et al. 1998). Moreover, Florida has a fast-growing
    population with a net inflow of more than 1,100 people a day, and is projected
    to be the third most populous state in the nation by 2025 (OEDR 2006; USCB 2004a).
    The USCB estimated that Florida accounted for approximately 11% of all new homes
    constructed in the United States in 2003, the largest amount in any single state
    (USCB 2004b); the majority of them with an in-ground irrigation system (TBW 2005;
    Whitcomb 2005). As urban populations swell, pressures on limited supplies of clean
    water are increasing. Saltwater intrusion in the Floridan aquifer has been found
    in coastal Hillsborough, Manatee, and Sarasota counties (SWFWMD 2006). The primary
    use of residential outdoor water is irrigation. A study in the U.S. indicated
    that households that use automatic timers to control their irrigation systems
    use 47% more water outdoors than those without timers, homes with in-ground sprinkler
    systems use 35% more water outdoors than those without in-ground systems, and
    on average, 58% of household water is used outdoors (Mayer et al. 1999). In the
    Central Florida Ridge, the potable water used for landscape irrigation has been
    found to be as high as 74%, with an average of 64% (Haley et al. 2007), and even
    when irrigation is restricted to two days a week (SJRWMD 2006), typically, homeowners
    tended to overirrigate (Haley et al. 2007). Overirrigation or underirrigation
    negatively can affect turfgrass quality. It has been reported that deeper and
    less-frequent irrigation improves turfgrass quality. Augustin and Snyder (1984)
    concluded that this practice tended to reduce N leaching in sandy soils, increasing
    N utilization, resulting in a better color rating (better quality). Bonos and
    Murphy (1999) reported an increase in a Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.)
    cultivar root growth as drought stress was imposed. Jordan et al. (2003) found
    that bentgrass irrigated every 4 days produced a significantly larger and deeper
    root system, a higher shoot density, and higher overall plant health—resulting
    in greater turf quality—than that watered every 1 or 2 days (even under golf putting
    green management conditions). McCarty (2005) summarizes that drier soil conditions
    slow shoot growth, and increase root growth and leaf water content. Moreover,
    limitations to the establishment and survival of some turfgrass weeds (Colbaugh
    and Elmore 1985; Youngner et al. 1981), and reduction of some pathogen severity
    (Davis and Dernoeden 1991; Kackley et al. 1990) have been associated with deep,
    infrequent irrigation. Hence, better irrigation scheduling by homeowners may lead
    to improved turfgrass quality coupled with potential savings in irrigation water
    use. Over the last decade, the soil moisture sensor (SMS) industry has advanced
    dramatically. Two basic reasons can explain this advancement. The first has been
    the major development of computer technology, with more powerful, smaller, and
    more economical integrated circuits. The second phenomenon has been the significant
    advances in the application of electromagnetic methods to the measurement of soil
    water content. These methods make use of the high relative permittivity (dielectric
    constant) of water in soil to estimate water content. The relative permittivity
    of water is about 80, whereas the other components in soil, including air, have
    relative permittivities in the range of 1–7. Hence, methods that measure the relative
    permittivity are effective for the measurement of the soil water content (Topp
    2003). Combining computer technology and the soil dielectric concept has allowed
    manufacturers to design and produce a number of different types of inexpensive
    SMSs for soil moisture measurement. Automation of irrigation systems, based on
    SMS technology, has the potential to provide maximum water use efficiency, by
    maintaining soil moisture between a desired range that is optimal or adequate
    for plant growth and/or quality; allowing irrigation only when necessary (Muñoz-Carpena
    and Dukes 2005). A wide range of applications to automatically control irrigation
    events has been investigated in coarse textured soils. In Florida, switching tensiometers
    have been studied for agricultural production (Smajstrla and Koo 1986; Clark et
    al. 1994; Smajstrla and Locascio 1994; Muñoz-Carpena et al. 2003; Muñoz-Carpena
    et al. 2005), and for maintaining bermudagrass turf (Augustin and Snyder 1984).
    Although water savings were found, these investigations suggest that tensiometers
    require calibration and frequent maintenance, up to twice per week. Consequently,
    this technology has not been adopted to automate irrigation in Florida. Other
    types of sensors have been adapted to automate irrigation based on soil moisture
    status in Florida. Nogueira et al. (2002) used time-domain reflectometer (TDR)
    sensors to maintain soil moisture within two preset limits (upper and lower soil
    moisture thresholds). Dukes and Scholberg (2005) and Dukes et al. (2003) reported
    11 and 50% water savings—without diminishing yields—using TDR probes on sweet
    corn, and a commercially available dielectric sensor on green bell pepper, respectively.
    Granular matrix sensors (GMSs) have also been used to automatically irrigate agricultural
    crops (Muñoz-Carpena et al. 2003; Shock et al. 2002), and as with other solid-state
    sensors, do not require as much maintenance as tensiometers. Although SMSs have
    been successfully demonstrated in agriculture, they have found limited use in
    residential landscape irrigation. A study using GMSs to control urban landscape
    irrigation in Colorado, applied 533 mm of water for irrigation compared to the
    theoretical requirement of 726 mm ; a reduction of 27% (Qualls et al. 2001). Since
    1991 Florida law has required a rain sensor (RS) device or switch hooked up to
    all automatic lawn sprinkler systems (Florida Statutes, Chap. 373.62; http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=View%20Statutes&Submenu=1&Tab=statutes&CFID=8781381&CFTOKEN=75889146).
    A rain sensor is a piece of equipment designed to interrupt a scheduled cycle
    of an automatic irrigation timer when a specific amount of rainfall has occurred
    (Dukes and Haman 2002a). Benefits and advantages of its use are similar to those
    of SMSs, and have been summarized by Dukes and Haman (2002a). Even though RSs
    have been mandated on all automatic irrigation systems installed after 1991, and
    have been commercially available for many years, little evidence related to their
    usefulness and/or to quantify their water savings exists. The goal of this research
    was to find out if different SMS systems (sensor with a proprietary controller)
    could reduce irrigation water application—while maintaining acceptable turf quality—compared
    to various time-based irrigation schedules to simulate common homeowner practices.
    The objectives of this experiment were to quantify irrigation water use and to
    evaluate turf quality differences between: (1) time-based scheduling with and
    without an RS; (2) a time-based schedule compared to an SMS-based irrigation system;
    and (3) different commercially available irrigation SMS systems. Materials and
    Methods The experimental area was located at the Agricultural and Biological Engineering
    Department research facilities, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fla.; on an
    Arredondo fine sand (loamy, siliceous, semiactive, hyperthermic Grossarenic Paleudult)
    (Thomas et al. 1985; USDA 2007). This soil has a field capacity of 7% (volumetric
    moisture content), as determined from dry-down experiments on repacked soil columns
    (Cardenas-Lailhacar 2006) and according to testing on intact cores as reported
    by Carlisle et al. (1981). The site consists of 72 ( 3.7 m × 3.7 m ) plots on
    a field covered with well-established common bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.)
    Pers.]. Each plot was sprinkler irrigated by four quarter-circle, pop-up spray
    heads, with an average application rate of 38 mm ∕ h at 172 kPa (Hunter 12A, Hunter
    Industries, Inc., San Marcos, Calif.). Plots were mowed twice weekly at a height
    of 5.5 cm . Agrochemicals were applied as needed to control weeds and pests, with
    no visual toxicity signs on the bermudagrass after the applications. Nutrient
    applications were made using ammonium sulfate (21–0–0), at an N rate of 50 kg
    ∕ ha , in April and May of 2004, before the beginning of the experiment. Then,
    a granulated 16–4–8 controlled-release fertilizer (Professional Turf Fertilizer,
    TurfGro, Phoenix, Ariz.) was applied at an N–P–K rate of 180 – 45 – 90 kg ∕ ha
    , in July 2004 and April 2005. Four commercially available SMS systems were selected
    for evaluation: Acclima Digital TDT RS-500 (Acclima Inc., Meridian, Id.), Watermark
    200SS-5 (Irrometer Company, Inc., Riverside, Calif.), Rain Bird MS-100 (Rain Bird
    International, Inc., Glendora, Calif.), and Water Watcher DPS-100 (Water Watcher,
    Inc., Logan, Utah), codified as AC, IM, RB, and WW, respectively. Each SMS system
    included a sensor to be buried in the soil and a controller, which could be adjusted
    to different soil water thresholds. All controllers were connected in series with
    typical residential irrigation timers. Cardenas-Lailhacar (2006) presented photographs
    of each SMS system and of the experimental site. The IM controllers were set at
    Number 1 (equivalent to 10 kPa of soil tension according to the manufacturer),
    whereas the AC controllers were set on their display at a volumetric moisture
    content (VMC) of 7%, where a soil tension of 10 kPa and a VMC of 7% were taken
    as approximately field capacity (Cardenas-Lailhacar 2006). Following manufacturer
    recommendations to find a set point close to field capacity, the RB and WW controllers
    were set at their thresholds 24 h after a significant rainfall event (which happened
    on July 20, 2004, after four days of rain, with a total of 107 mm that filled
    the soil profile with water). The RB controllers have a scale from a dry (#1)
    to a wet (#9) condition, and their thresholds were found by moving and setting
    the knob at the driest point (#2.5, in this case) where it would bypass irrigation,
    as indicated by a light-emitting diode (LED). On the WWs, initially the threshold
    could not be set, since the soil moisture was below the measurement range of the
    controller. After discussion with the manufacturer, a 1,000 Ω resistor was added
    between the solenoid valve port and the valve common port, which allowed the controller
    to read the low VMC at field capacity of this sandy soil. The calibration procedure
    consisted of setting the knob in the middle of the scale (dimensionless), and
    pushing the calibration button, which allowed its autoset point. It is important
    to note that following these methods the thresholds on the RB and WW controllers
    could not be associated with a specific soil VMC prior to the experiment. However,
    in order to find similar outcomes to those that homeowners would encounter, SMS
    systems were planned to be used directly “out of the box,” following manufacturer
    recommendations for installation and set points; a circumstance that could not
    be immediately accomplished in the aforementioned WW case. Treatments Two basic
    types of treatments were defined: SMS-based treatments, and time-based treatments
    (Table 1). All four SMS brands were tested at three irrigation frequencies: one,
    two, and seven days per week (1, 2, and 7 day ∕ week , respectively), resulting
    in 12 SMS/frequency combinations. The 1 and 2 day ∕ week watering frequencies
    represent typical day of the week irrigation restrictions imposed in Florida (FDEP
    2006; SJRWMD 2006). Within the time-based treatments, a frequency of 2 day ∕ week
    was defined (the most common in Florida, and current watering restriction in the
    study area). To simulate requirements imposed on homeowners by Florida Statutes
    (Chap. 373.62), two time-based treatments were connected to a rain sensor: with-rain
    sensor (2-WRS) and deficit-with-rain sensor (2-DWRS). The rain sensor (Mini-click
    II, Hunter Industries, Inc., San Marcos, Calif.) was set at a 6 mm rainfall threshold.
    A without-rain-sensor treatment (2-WORS) was also included, in order to simulate
    homeowner irrigation systems with an absent or nonfunctional rain sensor. Finally,
    a nonirrigated treatment (0-NI) was implemented as a control for turfgrass quality.
    Experimental treatments were replicated four times, in a completely randomized
    design. Table 1. Irrigation Treatment Codes and Descriptions Treatmentcodes Irrigation

    depth was programmed to replace 100% of the monthly historical net irrigation
    requirement, based on recommendations by Dukes and Haman (2002b) for the area
    where this experiment was carried out (Table 2). All treatments were programmed
    to apply the same amount of irrigation per week, except for treatments 2-DWRS
    (60% of this amount), and 0-NI. Therefore, differences in water application among
    treatments would be the result of sensors bypassing scheduled irrigation cycles.

    on two ESP-6, and three ESP-4Si model timers (Rain Bird International, Inc., Glendora,
    Calif.) set to start between 1 and 5 a.m., with the purpose of diminishing wind
    drift and decreasing evaporation, and to mimic water use restrictions where this
    study was carried out, that prohibit irrigation between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. (SJRWMD
    2006). Uniformity Testing A uniformity test was conducted for each plot with 16
    catch-cans on a 0.9 m × 0.9 m grid spacing. To minimize edge effects, this grid
    was positioned 0.4 m inside the plot boundaries. The cans had an opening diameter
    of 15.9 cm and a depth of 20.3 cm . Pressure at the two farthest plots was measured
    to ensure adequate sprinkler operation. The system was set to run for 35 min ,
    to ensure that the average water application depth was at least 13 mm . Wind velocity
    during the test period was measured with a hand held anemometer. The American
    Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE) standards (ASAE 2000) allow uniformity
    testing with wind speeds up to 5 m ∕ s . However, if wind was over 2.5 m ∕ s or
    the distribution was affected by wind gusts, the test was discontinued. The low-quarter
    irrigation distribution uniformity ( DU lq ) was calculated with the following
    equation (Merriam and Keller 1978): DU lq = D ¯ lq D ¯ tot (1) where D ¯ lq =
    mean of the lowest 25% of a group of catch-can measurements; and D ¯ tot = overall
    mean of a group of catch-can measurements. The irrigation uniformity tests resulted
    in a wide range of DU lq values across the plots (0.15–0.79), with an average
    of 0.52 that, according to the Irrigation Association (IA 2005) overall system
    quality ratings, is considered “fair.” The very low values denoted some performance
    problems (partially or completely clogged nozzles, spray heads below the mowing
    height, spray heads misaligned, etc.) that were fixed after the test was run.
    Even when a new DU lq test was not performed after the repairs, observations denoted
    a substantial improvement on the plots with low DU lq values. As a comparison,
    Baum et al. (2005) performed uniformity tests on irrigation systems of homes in
    central Florida having spray heads, and found an average DU lq of 0.41, with a
    range of 0.12–0.67. Thus, the irrigation uniformity of the experimental plots
    was representative of actual homes. In addition, Dukes et al. (2006) reported
    that catch-can DU lq as low as 0.40 did not result in reduced soil water DU lq
    of approximately 0.75. The writers concluded that the soil system and plant canopy
    can buffer low catch-can DU lq values resulting in a higher effective irrigation
    uniformity. Soil Moisture Sensor Installation According to manufacturer recommendations,
    the SMSs should be buried in the driest zone of a multiple-zone system. Accordingly,
    to identify the driest and wettest plots in the experimental area, a volumetric
    soil moisture survey assessment was carried out on each plot. In addition, because
    64 plots were required, this analysis was used to discard eight plots from a pool
    of 72 plots available. On March 12, 2004, after 14 days without rainfall, a relatively
    “dry” soil moisture condition was evident. The volumetric moisture content was
    measured in each plot by means of a hand held TDR device, which measured the moisture
    in the top 20 cm (Field Scout 300, Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield, Ill.).
    Measurements were taken at five locations in the center 1 m × 1 m of each plot
    and averaged. On March 17, 2004, 24 h after a 23 mm rainfall filled the soil profile,
    the volumetric moisture content in a “wet” condition was measured as well. Two
    plots had significantly higher VMC, under both the wet and the dry condition,
    so they were discarded. Six plots were also discarded because they had the absolute
    lowest VMC values of all plots, even when they were not statistically different
    ( P > 0.95 ) , coupled with a comparatively lower turfgrass quality before the
    beginning of the experiment. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the remaining
    64 plots, indicated that only two plots were significantly wetter than the rest
    ( P > 0.95 ) in the wet condition, so they were discarded as locations for SMS
    placement. In the dry condition, there were not statistical differences ( P >
    0.95 ) in the soil moisture levels. Thus, the plots selected to bury the SMSs
    were the absolute driest ones and/or the most convenient for sensor installation.
    Moreover, in the dry condition, the soil moisture content (5.2–6.8%) was not significantly
    different ( P > 0.999 ) across sensor control plots. In all cases, SMSs were installed
    in the center of the plots, in the top 7 – 10 cm of the soil, where most of the
    roots were observed. The plots with the sensors were used to control irrigation
    in three other plots for a total of four replications for each treatment. Irrigation
    Management and Data Collection Data were obtained from July 20 to December 14
    of 2004 and from March 25 to August 31 of 2005. Water application data were collected
    independently for each plot. Pulse-type positive displacement flowmeters (PSMT
    20 mm × 190 mm , Amco Water Metering Systems, Inc., Ocala, Fla.) were connected
    to nine AM16/32 multiplexers (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah), which were hooked
    up to a CR 10 × model datalogger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah), to continually
    record the irrigation date and volume applied to each plot. In addition, flowmeters
    were read manually each week to verify automatically acquired data. Weather data
    were collected by an automated weather station (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah),
    located beside the experimental site. Measurements, made every 15 min , included
    air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation,
    barometric pressure, and soil heat flux. Rainfall was recorded continuously by
    a manual rain gauge during 2004 and 2005, and also by a tipping bucket rain gauge
    in 2005. Both methods agreed well ( R 2 = 0.99 ) when measured over a period of
    212 days , encompassing 73 rain events that ranged from 0.3 to 50.3 mm . Turfgrass
    quality was visually assessed and rated using a scale of 1–9, where “1” represents
    brown, dormant, or dead turf, and “9” represents the best quality (Skogley and
    Sawyer 1992). A rating of 5 was considered the minimum acceptable turf quality
    for a lawn turfgrass. Ratings were carried out by the same person in July, October,
    and December of 2004, and in April, May, and July of 2005. Statistical data analyses
    were performed using the general linear model (GLM) procedure of the Statistical
    Analysis System software (SAS 2003). Analysis of variance was used to determine
    treatment differences for a completely randomized design and Duncan’s multiple
    range test was used to identify mean differences. Results and Discussion Environmental
    Conditions Table 3 summarizes the monthly mean average air temperature, relative
    humidity, wind speed, total rainfall, and crop evapotrans-piration during the
    experiment period. In general, favorable conditions prevailed for the growth and
    development of the bermudagrass. However, in December of 2004 the average air
    temperature began to gradually decline and, on December 15, 2004, the bermudagrass
    went dormant. The irrigation treatments were discontinued until the bermudagrass
    greened up again, on March 24, 2005. Table 3. Weather Conditions and Estimated

    ( ET c ) calculated from reference evapotranspiration ( ET o ) and specific crop
    coefficient ( K c ) values ( ET c = ET o * K c ) . ET o was calculated from the
    Penman–Monteith equation, with a crop coefficient K c = 0.85 for established bermudagrass,
    as described in FAO-56 by Allen et al. (1998). Both 2004 and 2005 were rainy years
    (Figs. 1 and 2), with high frequent rainfall and a large amount of cumulative
    precipitation, which is not uncommon in this region. During 2004, a tropical storm
    and two hurricanes—Frances and Jeanne—passed over the research area during the
    experiment. Even while 2005 broke all records for the number of hurricanes and
    named tropical storms in the United States, none of them directly hit the experiment
    site. Nonetheless, during the 2005 data collection period, 40% of the days had
    rainfall events, totaling 732 mm (13% more than historical rainfall for this time
    period), and averaging 135 mm ∕ month . In 2004, even though it rained less frequently
    (31% of the days), the cumulative rainfall for the experimental period was even
    larger, with 944 mm (88% more than historical rainfall), and more than 190 mm
    ∕ month on average. However, most of this rainfall (56%) occurred during the tropical
    storm and the two hurricanes. If these events were not considered, a total of
    414 mm with an average of 84 mm ∕ month fell during 2004. Fig. 1. Daily and cumulative
    rainfall in 2004. Note: rainfall for September 5 ( 188 mm ) and September 6 (
    81 mm ) are shown as a cumulative total ( 269 mm ) . Fig. 2. Daily and cumulative
    rainfall in 2005 Time-Based Treatments In Table 4, Comparison A shows that the
    three time-based treatments (2-WORS, 2-WRS, and 2-DWRS) were significantly different
    ( P < 0.0001 ) from each other during this study. Treatment 2-WRS ( 2 day ∕ week
    , with a rain sensor) was established to mimic a homeowner complying with irrigation
    regulations and setting the timer according to recommended practices. This treatment
    accounted for 995 mm of water, or an equivalent of 98 mm ∕ month . A recent study,
    carried out by Haley et al. (2007) in Central Florida, within the St. Johns River
    Water Management District, found that homeowners with automatic irrigation systems
    applied 149 mm ∕ month on average. Therefore, the comparisons made here may be
    considered conservative and differences in the results for actual homeowners could
    be larger. Table 4. Total Cumulative Irrigation Depth Applied to Treatments, Statistical

    Different letters within a column indicate statistical difference at P < 0.05
    (Duncan’s multiple range test). The well-managed or water conservative homeowner
    profile, imitated by treatment 2-DWRS ( 2 day ∕ week , with a rain sensor, and
    60% of 2-WRS), applied 63% of the water applied by 2-WRS, close to the target
    of 60%. The total depth was 623 mm , or an equivalent of 61 mm ∕ month . The treatment
    simulating an irrigation system with an absent or nonfunctional rain sensor (2-WORS)
    accounted for 1514 mm , or 148 mm ∕ month . Thus, this treatment applied 52% more
    water than the treatment with a functional rain sensor (2-WRS), whereas 2-WRS
    saved 34% of the water applied by 2-WORS. These results demonstrate the importance
    of a functional and well-maintained rain shut-off device on all automated irrigation
    systems in Florida; where rainy weather is common (NOAA 2003). Moreover, as the
    study prepared by Whitcomb (2005) recently found, just 25% of the surveyed homeowners
    in Florida with automatic irrigation systems reported having a rain sensor, and
    the author speculated that they are often incorrectly installed. Therefore, appropriately
    installed and properly working rain sensors could signify not only substantial
    water savings to homeowners, but could also lead to sound environmental and economic
    benefits to the state. Moreover, Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes (2008) found that
    rain sensors under the climate conditions of this study have a payback period
    of less than a year when set at thresholds of 13 mm or less. Time-Based Treatments
    versusSMS-BasedTreatments. Table 4 (Comparison B) shows that there was a significant
    ( P < 0.0001 ) difference between the averages of time-based and SMS-based treatments;
    with 1,044 and 420 mm of cumulative irrigation depth, respectively. Thus, the
    SMS-based treatments, on average, significantly reduced the amount of irrigation
    water applied compared to the time-based treatments, even when an operative rain
    sensor was an important component on two of the three time-based treatments. Moreover,
    72% of the water applied by 2-WORS was saved on average by the SMS-based treatments.
    Comparisons between SMS-Irrigation Frequencies When the averages of the three
    different SMS irrigation frequencies were analyzed (Table 4, Comparison C), the
    2 day ∕ week frequency applied significantly ( P < 0.0001 ) more water, followed
    by the 1 day ∕ week frequency, with 478 and 420 mm of total cumulative water depth,
    respectively. Although a wide range of variation was apparent across the sensor
    brands, the 7 day ∕ week frequency resulted in a significantly lower depth applied
    of all three frequencies, with an average of 362 mm , because two of four 7 day
    ∕ week treatments (7-AC and 7-RB) bypassed more scheduled irrigation events due
    to frequent rainfall (Figs. 1 and 2). Water Savings Table 4 shows the water savings
    (%) of each treatment compared to the time-based treatments 2-DWRS, 2-WRS, and
    2-WORS. Treatments 7-AC and 7-RB achieved the highest amounts of water savings
    throughout this experiment and, as expected, 2-WORS applied more water than all
    the other treatments. On the other hand, the IMs always allowed more water to
    be applied compared to the other brands in every frequency tested. This could
    be due to their reported limitations to timely sense differences in soil water
    content, their hysteretic behavior, the high variability of readings, and their
    limitations in sandy soils, where low tension values are necessary to prevent
    plant stress (Irmak and Haman 2001; Taber et al. 2002: Intrigliolo and Castel
    2004; McCann et al. 1992). When compared to the water conservative 2-DWRS treatment,
    brands AC, RB, and WW showed water savings that ranged from 44 to 80%, 55 to 76%,
    and 26 to 57%, respectively. On the other hand, all IM frequencies applied more
    irrigation than 2-DWRS, with values that ranged from 15 to 77% more water. Treatment
    2-IM was the only SMS-based treatment that applied more water than the time-based
    2-WRS (11%). Conversely, 1-IM and 7-IM reduced water application 20 and 28%, respectively,
    compared to 2-WRS. However, these last proportions were far from the water savings
    achieved by the other SMS-based treatments, when compared to 2-WRS: AC sensors
    recorded irrigation water savings ranging from 65 to 88%, RBs from 72 to 85%,
    and WWs from 54 to 73%, depending on the irrigation frequency tested. It is important
    to remark that these water savings were on top of those already achieved by 2-WRS.
    Therefore, these results show that, in general, SMSs can also act as rain shut-off
    devices, although with a superior performance than rain sensors in terms of water
    savings. When the irrigation treatments were compared to more than 75% of the
    surveyed homeowners in Florida (Whitcomb 2005), with a nonfunctional or absent
    rain sensor (2-WORS), the difference in water savings increased, ranging from
    77 to 92% for ACs, 81 to 90% for RBs, 69 to 82% for WWs, and 27 to 53% for IMs.
    Even 2-IM (which applied 11% more water than 2-WRS) showed water savings (27%)
    with respect to 2-WORS, indicating that this sensor was operative but did not
    bypass as many scheduled irrigation cycles as other SMS-based treatments. These
    results clearly demonstrate that the use of SMSs (along with traditional timers
    in residential irrigation systems) could lead to water savings more than twice
    as much as a rain sensor device alone, even when the time schedule is programmed
    to provide 60% of net irrigation requirements. Automation of Irrigation Systems
    Complete automation of a residential irrigation system, based on SMSs, could be
    achieved by programming the timer to run every day as a scheduling strategy. Then,
    SMSs will allow the system to initiate the scheduled irrigation cycles only when
    it is actually needed by the turfgrass (or other irrigated plant type), and override
    cycles when the sensed water content is over a preset threshold. In this experiment,
    this type of control was confirmed when the 7 day ∕ week irrigation frequency
    applied significantly less water than the other frequencies (Table 4, Comparison
    C), and when two of the SMS-based treatments, programmed to run 7 day ∕ week ,
    consistently applied the smallest amount of water. In effect, treatments 7-AC
    and 7-RB recorded total water savings of 85% or more, when compared to 2-WRS,
    and 90% or more when compared to 2-WORS. This concept (with a potential irrigation
    frequency of seven days a week) seems contradictory to the water use regulations
    and restrictions imposed by the Water Management Districts and/or municipalities
    in Florida (where irrigation is allowed only one or two days per week). However,
    during wet weather conditions these results suggest that setting the correct threshold,
    and programming the automatic irrigation system to run everyday for a short period
    of time (allowing the SMS to decide whether to irrigate), could save large amounts
    of water and may be a more effective water conservation strategy than day of the
    week watering windows. Moreover, this concept is not in opposition to the general
    recommendation for deeper and less frequent irrigation for turfgrass, because
    these treatments (7-AC and 7-RB) overrode almost every scheduled irrigation cycle,
    resulting in a low actual irrigation frequency, which was supplemented by large
    and/or frequent rainfall events that filled the profile (Figs. 1 and 2). Nonetheless,
    it is important to note that this technology and frequency needs to be evaluated
    during dry weather conditions to be sure that turfgrass quality does not decline
    due to reduced irrigation application. Turfgrass Quality Differences in turfgrass
    quality, including nonirrigated plots, were not detected among treatments, and
    always exceeded the minimum acceptable rating of 5. This result is explained in
    part by the generally wet weather conditions that prevailed through most of the
    experiment, which favored the growth and development of the bermudagrass (Table
    3, and Figs. 1 and 2). Another factor contributing to the general good turf quality
    observed, even during the short “dry” periods, could be found in the species itself.
    Common bermudagrass is known as a more drought-tolerant grass compared to the
    pervasive St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze] found in
    north-central Florida landscapes (Harivandi et al. 2001; Baldwin et al. 2006;
    Turgeon 2005). As a result, the treatment effects were buffered with respect to
    the turfgrass quality parameters, and it could be concluded that no irrigation
    was necessary to maintain an acceptable turf quality during the experiment time
    period. Jordan et al. (2003) obtained similar results working with bentgrass,
    when frequent rainfall coupled with high relative humidity conditions overrode
    the effects of the irrigation frequency treatments on turf quality. Conclusions
    High-frequency rainfall events and a large amount of cumulative precipitation,
    coupled with favorable environmental conditions, favored the growth and development
    of the bermudagrass during the timeframe of this research. The three time-based
    treatments (2-WORS, 2-WRS, and 2-DWRS) were significantly different from each
    other during the study period. The treatment with a functional rain sensor (2-WRS),
    at a 6 mm threshold, applied significantly less water (34%) than the without rain
    sensor treatment (2-WORS), showing the importance of a well-maintained rain shut-off
    device in all automated irrigation systems in Florida. On the other hand, treatment
    2-DWRS, applied close to the desired 60% of the water applied by 2-WRS. These
    time-based treatments were established to mimic the operation of irrigation systems
    carried out by different homeowner profiles. However, according to the results
    of this research, these treatments were fairly well managed compared to homeowners’
    actual operation practices in the Central Florida Ridge. Therefore, results in
    water use from this experiment can be considered conservative and differences
    for actual homeowners could be even larger. For the SMS treatments, all three
    irrigation frequencies tested (1, 2, and 7 day ∕ week ) were significantly different.
    The 2 day ∕ week frequency applied the highest volume of water, followed by the
    1 day ∕ week frequency, and the 7 day ∕ week was the one that applied the least
    amount of water. These results suggest that scheduling high-frequency irrigation
    cycles ( 7 day ∕ week ) in closed control loop irrigation systems appears to be
    a viable strategy regarding water conservation for turfgrass irrigation in Florida’s
    sandy soils during rainy periods. Moreover, it was concluded that irrigation was
    not necessary to maintain acceptable turf quality during the experimental period,
    which was evidenced by acceptable quality in nonirrigated plots. The results showed
    that, on average, the SMS-based treatments were significantly more efficient as
    a means to save water than the time-based treatments. However, not all SMS treatments
    tested performed the same. The 2-IM treatment was the only SMS-based treatment
    that applied significantly more water than 2-WRS (11%). The other two IM treatments,
    1-IM and 7-IM, applied less water than 2-WRS (20 and 28%, respectively), but always
    applied more water than the other brands/treatments in every frequency tested.
    The other brands (AC, RB, and WW) resulted in irrigation water savings compared
    to 2-WRS, which ranged from 54 to 88%, depending on the irrigation frequency.
    These results showed that most SMSs can also act as rain sensors, with superior
    performance in terms of water savings. When these last brands were compared to
    2-WORS, the differences in water savings increased, and ranged from 69 to 92%
    over the 308 - day study period. It should be noted that the specific performance
    of the individual sensors largely depends on the threshold setting and the sensor
    burial depth. Even when sensor burial depths were as similar as practically possible
    in this experiment, the sensor thresholds might have varied slightly, hence, affecting
    the results to some extent. In any case, soil moisture sensor systems appear to
    be a promising technology that could lead to a complete automation of residential
    irrigation systems, to substantial savings in irrigation water, and to sound environmental
    and economic benefits to the state. Testing this technology with actual irrigation
    systems on homes is recommended to validate these results. Acknowledgments The

    Comments ABSTRACT Dearth of fresh water worldwide has given rise to solemn alarms
    since a decade. Economical administration of water resources plays a critical
    role when it is mainly with reference to the agriculture zone. Irrigation is generally
    functions along with canal plan by which water is pumped up into fields once at
    regular period of time according to farmers habitual ways without appropriate
    measurements with none feedback of water level in field. This kind of irrigation
    method will definitely hinder the crop growth and health and produces a poor yield
    as a result of some crops area component too susceptible to water content in soil.
    The ingenuous ICT technique presents an insolent system that uses minimum value
    soil wetness sensing element and temperature sensing element to manage facility
    in water shortage regions. The sensor, those vocations on the standard of moisture
    reliant resistance amendment between two points within the soil, is invented with
    the help of low cost materials and ways. Moisture and temperature knowledge is
    fetched from a sensing element node is distributed through an Arduino to a centralized
    server that controls facility. An automaton application is developed to envision
    the daily wetness and temperature knowledge. Moreover, the planned wetness sensing
    and temperature sensing ways have the power to be incorporated into machine-controlled
    which is automatic irrigation theme and perform automated, exactness agriculture
    in conjunction with de-centralized water management system. Application results
    illustrate that system through the embedded controlled technology which makes
    it complete intelligent irrigation, enhance the agricultural produce and improve
    soil health by irrigation, the water is used fruitfully and irrigation system
    automation is achieved mostly in all aspects. References Angel C and Asha S, "A

    9 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Irrigation in the Central Valley of California
    is essential for successful wine grape production. With reductions in water availability
    in much of California due to drought and competing water-use interests, it is
    important to optimize irrigation management strategies. In the current study,
    we investigate the utility of satellite-derived maps of evapotranspiration (ET)
    and the ratio of actual-to-reference ET (fRET) based on remotely sensed land-surface
    temperature (LST) imagery for monitoring crop water use and stress in vineyards.
    The Disaggregated Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse (ALEXI/DisALEXI) surface-energy
    balance model, a multi-scale ET remote-sensing framework with operational capabilities,
    is evaluated over two Pinot noir vineyard sites in central California that are
    being monitored as part of the Grape Remote-Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration
    eXperiment (GRAPEX). A data fusion approach is employed to combine ET time-series
    retrievals from multiple satellite platforms to generate estimates at both the
    high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolution required for field-scale irrigation
    management. Comparisons with micrometeorological data indicate reasonable model
    performance, with mean absolute errors of 0.6 mm day−1 in ET at the daily time
    step and minimal bias. Values of fRET agree well with tower observations and reflect
    known irrigation. Spatiotemporal analyses illustrate the ability of ALEXI/DisALEXI/data
    fusion package to characterize heterogeneity in ET and fRET both within a vineyard
    and over the surrounding landscape. These findings will inform the development
    of strategies for integrating ET mapping time series into operational irrigation
    management framework, providing actionable information regarding vineyard water
    use and crop stress at the field and regional scale and at daily to multi-annual
    time scales. Similar content being viewed by others Improving the spatiotemporal

    in the California Central Valley Article 23 April 2022 Introduction Water management
    is a critical aspect of successful grape production in California’s Central Valley,
    which represents over 400,000 ha valued at approximately 6 billion dollars (California
    Department of Food and Agriculture and USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service
    2016). Despite competing water-use interests and a reduction in water availability
    over much of California due to recent long-term droughts, vineyard acreage and
    production continues to increase, with acreage devoted to wine grapes increasing
    by 12,950 ha between years 2013 and 2016 (California Department of Food and Agriculture
    and USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 2017). As such, there is significant
    interest in developing efficient water management strategies for these viticulture
    production systems. The adoption of an appropriate and efficient irrigation strategy
    for a specific vineyard is predicated on understanding and controlling the vine
    water stress throughout the season (Girona et al. 2009; van Leeuwen et al. 2009;
    Basile et al. 2011). Moderate vine water stress, achieved through the practice
    of deficit irrigation can improve the composition/quality of grapes used in wine
    production (Williams and Matthews 1990; Williams et al. 1994). The standard indicator
    for vine water stress is the leaf water potential (ΨL), commonly measured using
    a pressure chamber. In some cases, pressure bomb measurements are used in scheduling
    irrigation for commercial vineyards (Girona et al. 2006). However, this practice
    requires individual leaf measurements, limiting its suitability for application
    over large heterogeneous areas. Techniques for mapping ΨL have been developed
    using high-resolution thermal imagery to isolate plant canopy temperatures (Bellvert
    et al. 2016). This technique could be used for mapping variability in vine stress
    across vineyards; however, it would be challenging to provide this information
    on a routine basis over large regions and may require calibration for different
    climates and vine varieties. An additional tool for monitoring water stress and
    use in vineyards is measurement of evapotranspiration (ET), which quantifies water
    loss from the vine and surface to the atmosphere. Numerous studies have explored
    various methods and techniques to measure vineyard ET or water use, including
    lysimeters (Johnson et al. 2005; Azevedo et al. 2008; Netzer et al. 2009), eddy
    covariance (Spano et al. 2000; Ortega-Farias et al. 2010; Rodriguez et al. 2010),
    heat pulse or heat balance (Trambouze et al. 1998; Yunusa et al. 1997; Intrigliolo
    et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010), surface renewal energy balance (Castellvi and
    Snyder 2010; Moratiel and Martinez-Cob 2012), Bowen ratio energy balance (Yunusa
    et al. 2004; Teixeira et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2011), soil water balance (Singleton
    and Maudsley 1996; Fooladmand and Sepaskhah 2009; Cancela et al. 2012), and the
    most common and simplest approach, the FAO-56 method (Allen et al. 1998). However,
    like the leaf water potential measurement method, these approaches simply provide
    point measurements that are difficult to extrapolate over larger areas or fields,
    and fail to indicate in-field spatial variability (Teixeira et al. 2007). Such
    spatial variability limits the effective use of irrigation water. Uniform irrigation
    across a vineyard with variable biomass and soil texture, implying differences
    in plant growth and water requirements, will result in the over- or under-watering
    in these anomalous sections within the vineyard. This will result in variability
    in vegetative growth across the vineyard, and result in non-uniform yield and
    grape composition/quality (Bramley and Hamilton 2004; Bramley et al. 2005; Bellvert
    et al. 2012). Errors are further compounded when extrapolating to vineyards outside
    the area of in-situ ET data collection. Satellite remote-sensing technology offers
    the possibility of providing routine spatial information useful for determining
    sub-field and inter-field-scale heterogeneity in plant conditions and water use.
    Satellite retrievals of land-surface temperature (LST), derived from thermal infrared
    (TIR) imagery, have been shown to be particularly useful for estimating ET and
    plant stress due to the sensitivity of soil and canopy temperatures to variable
    soil moisture availability (Moran 2003). Several TIR-based ET mapping algorithms
    have been developed over the past few decades (e.g., Bastiaanssen et al. 1998,
    Su 2002; Allen et al. 2007; Anderson et al. 1997). Due to significant uncertainties
    associated with determining accurate atmospherically and emissivity corrected
    surface temperature data, most TIR-based models use relative measures of LST variability
    to parameterize ET estimates rather than the absolute LST values (Anderson et
    al. 1997, 2012). This is accomplished either through using an end-member pixel
    scaling method (spatial variability) or a time-differential method (temporal variability).
    For example, the Surface-Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL; Bastiaanssen
    et al. 1998) and the Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration
    (METRIC; Allen et al. 2007) methods use TIR end-member pixels within a satellite
    image to represent limiting (minimal ET; hot pixel) and non-limiting (potential
    ET; cold pixel) moisture conditions. The Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI;
    Anderson et al. 1997, 2007a, b) surface-energy balance model uses the time-differential
    approach, relating changes in morning LST derived from geostationary satellites
    to surface moisture availability and latent heat flux. ALEXI is based on the Two-Source
    Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation originally described by Norman
    et al. (1995). The TSEB can also be used to downscale ALEXI fluxes to finer, sub-field
    scales using an associated flux disaggregation technique (DisALEXI; Norman et
    al. 2003). Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of TIR-based ET approaches
    for monitoring water use and stress within vineyards (Semmens et al. 2016; Xia
    et al. 2016). Specifically, Semmens et al. (2016) applied the ALEXI/DisALEXI modeling
    system, integrated with a data fusion methodology (Gao et al. 2006), to estimate
    daily ET at 30 m spatial resolution over two Pinot noir vineyards near Lodi in
    the Central Valley of California for the 2013 growing season, demonstrating good
    agreement with ground-based flux measurements. Moreover, Xia et al. (2016) evaluated
    TSEB model performance over these two vineyards at high spatial resolution (≤ 1
    m) using thermal and multispectral remote-sensing data from low-altitude aircraft
    over the same two vineyards. Results indicate that the TSEB can derive reliable
    ET patterns at sub-field scale under a wide range of environmental conditions.
    The current study expands upon results presented in Semmens et al. (2016), extending
    the analysis to multiple years to promote a comprehensive understanding of seasonal
    flux dynamics within the unique canopy architecture of vineyards, especially during
    the early spring season when timing of the initiation of irrigation and subsequent
    water-use estimates can have significant errors. In this study, daily 30 m ET
    maps over the Lodi vineyard landscape are evaluated over the period 2013–2016,
    including an extended period of severe drought when water resources in the Central
    Valley became increasingly limited. An analysis is also included on the ratio
    of actual-to-reference ET (fRET), an indicator of crop moisture and stress conditions,
    and its linkages on both spatial and temporal scales to criteria used in irrigation
    decision making. The current study aims to demonstrate the utility of remotely
    sensed ET and fRET mapping time series in support of an operational irrigation
    management framework, supplying reliable spatiotemporal information on vineyard
    water use and crop stress at the field and regional scale and at daily to annual
    time scales. Materials and methods Study area The model study domain includes
    two vineyard sites located in the Central Valley of California near the town of
    Lodi, using data collected as part of the USDA-ARS Grape Remote-Sensing Atmospheric
    Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) (Kustas et al. 2018). Both
    the northern (site 1) and the southern (site 2) vineyards are planted with Pinot
    noir vines trained on quadrilateral cordons with drip irrigation installed. Both
    sites have vine heights that vary between 2 and 2.5 m, with space between rows
    of 3.3 m, space between vines of 1.5 m, and an east–west row orientation. The
    northern site has an area of 35 ha with vines planted in 2009. The southern site
    is smaller and less mature, with an area of 21 ha and vines planted in 2011, resulting
    in lower biomass/leaf area than the northern field. In these plots, vines typically
    leaf out in late March, grow through late August, with grape harvest occurring
    in early September. Flux tower were installed in 2013 approximately half-way north–south
    along the eastern edge of each field, located to maximize fetch as the predominant
    wind direction is from the west during the growing season. These towers continue
    to operate through the 2017 growing season. Field measurements Micrometeorological
    and biological field measurements collected during GRAPEX are designed to serve
    as validation data for models developed to estimate ET and component vine and
    inter-row fluxes, detect stress, and monitor biomass development and root zone
    soil water availability. Both vineyards are equipped with identical micrometeorological
    instrumentation and started recording in late March of 2013. Measurements include
    turbulence and mean profile measurements of wind, surface-energy balance flux
    estimates, temperature and water vapor, as well as ground-based biophysical measurements
    such as leaf area index (LAI). The eddy covariance (EC) systems include a Campbell
    Scientific, Inc. EC150 water vapor/carbon dioxide sensor and a CSAT3 three-dimensional
    sonic anemometer. Both instruments are mounted 5 m above local ground level (a.g.l.)
    facing due west, collecting data at 20 Hz producing 15 min averages. Additional
    instrumentation includes a four-component radiometer (CNR-1, Kipp and Zonen, Delft,
    Netherlands) mounted 6 m a.g.l., upward and downward facing quantum sensors (LI-190,
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) mounted 6 m a.g.l., a combined humidity and temperature
    sensor (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) mounted 5 m a.g.l., two thermal infrared
    thermometers (SI-111, Campbell Scientific) mounted 2.5 m a.g.l. used to measure
    both surface and canopy temperature, a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525, Texas
    Electronics, Dallas, Texas), and five soil heat flux plates (HFT-3, Radiation
    Energy Balance Systems, Bellevue, Washington) buried cross-row at a depth of 8
    cm. Each heat flux plate includes two thermocouples buried at depths of 2 and
    6 cm and a soil moisture sensor (HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring System,
    Portland, Oregon) buried at 5 cm depth. 1 Post-processing of the 20 Hz eddy covariance
    data for computing sensible and latent heat fluxes is described by Alfieri et
    al. (2018). Energy balance flux measurements used in this study were collected
    between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016. During this period, typical closure
    ratios were on the order of 0.91 for Site 1 and 0.88 for Site 2. Original and
    closure-adjusted latent heat flux (LE) measurements were compared to modeled LE
    estimates to determine degree of agreement between measured and modeled fluxes.
    Since daily totals are used for model validation, observed fluxes were corrected
    for closure errors using the residual (RE) method as opposed to Bowen Ratio (BR)
    method (which often yields spurious results for nighttime conditions) described
    in Twine et al. (2000). Measurements of water applied through irrigation began
    in 2015 and are made using an assemblage of pressure switches and Onset HOBO data
    loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA). Irrigation events are recorded
    as the time difference between the beginning and end of irrigation, with events
    lasting roughly 5 h on average between sites. The amount of irrigation applied
    in liters per vine is calculated using an average irrigation pump rate and vine/row
    spacing data provided by vineyard managers. Yield maps for 2013 through 2016 harvest
    in both north and south vineyards are provided by E&J Gallo Winery using Advanced
    Technology Viticulture (ATV, Joslin, Australia) yield monitoring systems and a
    cleanup script used to convert mass flow units into tons per hectare, eliminate
    outliers, and normalized across harvesters. Yield data greater than three standard
    deviations from the mean are omitted. Yield maps are interpolated to a 3 m grid
    using Vesper Spatial Prediction Software for Precision Agriculture (Whelan et
    al. 2002). Multi-scale ET modeling system ALEXI The multi-scale ET modeling system
    used here downscales regional coarse-scale fluxes from the ALEXI surface-energy
    balance model (Anderson et al. 1997, 2007a, b; Mecikalski et al. 1999) to finer
    spatial scales. ALEXI exploits the high temporal resolution afforded by geostationary
    satellites to measure the morning rate of land-surface temperature (LST) rise,
    which is used to guide partitioning of the surface-energy budget. Time-differential
    LST measurements provide the added benefit of being less sensitive to errors in
    temperature retrieval due to atmospheric and emissivity correction (Anderson et
    al. 1997). ALEXI is based on the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, first
    developed by Norman et al. (1995), and later refined through improved parameterizations
    in Kustas and Norman (1999). The TSEB model partitions surface temperature into
    soil and vegetation components, which are then used to solve the surface-energy
    budget for the soil, canopy and combined system associated with the mixed scene:
    $$(R{n_s}+R{n_c}) - G=\left( {{H_s}+{H_c}} \right)+(\lambda {E_s}+\lambda {E_c}),$$
    where Rn is net radiation (W/m2), H is the sensible heat flux (W/m2), G is the
    soil heat flux (W/m2) and λE is the latent heat flux (W/m2). Subscripts ‘s’ and
    ‘c’ represent fluxes associated with the soil and canopy scene components, respectively.
    The TSEB uses an estimate of local vegetation cover fraction to partition the
    composite surface temperature measurement into soil and canopy temperatures, which
    are used to constrain net radiation and sensible heat flux, defined by the surface-to-air
    temperature gradient. The G term is parameterized in as a fraction of the net
    radiation at the soil surface (Rns). Canopy transpiration, λEc, is estimated using
    a modified Priestley-Taylor approach (Priestley and Taylor 1972) which responds
    to signals of vegetation stress conveyed by the surface temperature measurement,
    while soil evaporation λEs is computed as the residual to the energy balance equation.
    The TSEB model is applied at two times during the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
    growth phase, at approximately 1.5 h after local sunrise (t1) and 1.0 h before
    local noon (t2). A simple slab model of ABL development (McNaughton and Spriggs
    1986) is used to provide a means for surface-energy closure by relating the rise
    in air temperature in the mixed layer over the time interval (t1 to t2) to the
    time-integrated influx of H from the surface (Anderson et al. 1997). This approach
    allows near-surface air temperature to be computed internally, eliminating the
    need for an a priori specification of air temperature boundary conditions to the
    sensible heat flux computation. Daily latent heat flux is derived using ALEXI-retrieved
    latent heat flux estimates at t2 and upscaled to 24 h using the ratio of instantaneous
    to daily insolation: $$\lambda {E_{{\text{day}}}}=\frac{{\lambda {E_{{t_2}}}}}{{{R_{{S_{t2}}}}}}\left(
    {{R_{s24}}} \right),$$ where \(\lambda {E_{{t_2}}}\) is the latent heat at t2,
    \({R_{{S_{t2}}}}\)is the insolation rate at t2, and \({R_{{s_{24}}}}\) is the
    time-integrated daily insolation rate. This insolation technique has proven generally
    reliable, with lower bias and sensitivity to errors in retrieval estimates when
    compared to other techniques (Cammalleri et al. 2014a). Daily net radiation (\({R_{{n_{24}}}}\))
    maps are derived using an approach described in Anderson et al. (2012), daily
    \(G\) maps are computed by integrating the Santanello equation over daylight hours
    (Santanello and Friedl 2003), and daily \(~H\) values are computed as the residual.
    All fluxes are expressed in MJ m−2 day−1 to retain consistency with prior publications.
    The daily latent heat is converted to daily ET (in units of mm day−1) by dividing
    by the latent heat of vaporization λ. Missing pixels within the ALEXI ET maps,
    due either to cloud cover or missing or low-quality input data, are gap filled
    by conserving the ratio of actual ET to daily insolation (fsun) over time at each
    pixel. The time series of clear-sky fsun is filtered, smoothed and gap-filled
    for each pixel using a Savitzky–Golay filter, designed to reduce noise while preserving
    signals associated with changes in surface moisture conditions. Missing pixels
    within the daily ET map are then recovered by multiplying the gap-filled fsun
    fields by the daily scaling flux (insolation) maps. ALEXI is run operationally
    by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) at 8 km spatial resolution
    over North America as part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
    (GOES) Evapotranspiration and Drought (GET-D) system. GET-D produces daily ET
    and an ET-based Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) using radiometric temperature data
    retrieved from GOES East and West thermal imagery. The ESI describes standardized
    anomalies in the actual-to-reference ET ratio (fRET), using the Penman–Monteith
    (FAO-56) reference ET for grass (1998). The ESI is an indicator of agricultural
    drought reflecting impacts on crop water use, and has been shown to provide early
    warning of deteriorating crop conditions (Anderson et al. 2011, 2013; Otkin et
    al. 2013, 2014). A 4 km resolution grid is also maintained for research purposes
    and allows assessment of ESI and ET at the regional scale over the continental
    U.S. (CONUS). DisALEXI Due to its reliance on high temporal frequency TIR imagery,
    here obtained from geostationary satellites, ALEXI is constrained to operate on
    coarser spatial scales on the order of a few kilometers. To map flux distributions
    at higher spatial resolution, an associated spatial disaggregation technique known
    as DisALEXI (Norman et al. 2003; Anderson et al. 2004, 2012) can be implemented
    using higher resolution TIR imagery from polar orbiting instruments or from airborne
    platforms. DisALEXI operates by running the TSEB model over each ALEXI pixel area
    within a given modeling domain using the higher spatial resolution vegetation
    cover and surface radiometric temperature information. For this application of
    TSEB, the air temperature boundary condition (set at a nominal blending height
    of 50 m), is iteratively adjusted at the ALEXI pixel scale until the DisALEXI
    daily ET fluxes converge to the ALEXI value on average over that pixel. This ensures
    consistency between the ALEXI and DisALEXI flux fields. Further description can
    be found in Anderson et al. (2012), and Cammalleri et al. (2013, 2014a). ET data
    fusion In this study, DisALEXI was used to generate ET map time series at moderate
    resolution (1 km) and near daily time steps using thermal and reflectance data
    from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Higher resolution
    (30 m) maps were created with periodic Landsat datasets, with thermal band data
    sharpened to the 30-m resolution of the reflectance bands using the Data Mining
    Sharpener tool developed by Gao et al. (2012a). These two time series were then
    fused using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM;
    Gao et al. 2006) to create daily maps of ET at 30-m resolution. In short, STARFM
    predicts Landsat-resolution ET maps on MODIS acquisition dates by developing spatially
    distributed weighting factors representing the spectral similarity and temporal
    difference between observed Landsat/MODIS maps collected on the same day. These
    weighting factors are then used in the disaggregation of MODIS images on days
    when Landsat is not available, resulting in daily Landsat-scale ET maps. For more
    information, the reader is referred to Gao et al. (2006), Cammalleri et al. (2013,
    2014a) and Semmens et al. (2016). Model inputs LST inputs for the 4-km ALEXI simulations
    over CONUS were obtained 11 µm brightness temperature observations from the GOES-EAST
    (at 75°W) and GOES-WEST (at 105°W) Imager instruments. Raw brightness temperature
    values are atmospherically corrected using atmospheric profiles of temperature,
    as described in French et al. (2003). Vegetation cover fraction, used to partition
    LST between soil and canopy temperatures, is computed from MODIS leaf area index
    (LAI) product (see below), aggregated to 4 km and interpolated to daily time steps.
    Landsat 8 (L8) data between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016 were collected
    over the study area, which is in the overlap of two scenes (path 44/row 33 and
    path 43/row 33). A total of 87 mostly clear scenes were processed. Landsat thermal
    band data at native resolution (100 m) were atmospherically corrected using MODTRAN
    (Berk et al. 1989) then sharpened to 30 m resolution to match Landsat optical
    bands using the data mining sharpener (DMS) approach (Gao et al. 2012a). Atmospherically
    corrected shortwave reflectance data were directly downloaded from the U.S. Geological
    Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer website (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). These reflectance
    products were used to derive 30-m maps of LAI using regression tree analysis trained
    by MODIS 1 km LAI data, as described in Gao et al. (2012b). MODIS daily LAI maps
    were generated from the 4-day composite (MCD15A3, Collection 5) products and a
    procedure outlined in Gao et al. (2008), where the 4-day products are smoothed
    and gap filled to daily time steps using the TIMESAT algorithm for analyzing satellite
    time-series data for seasonality and other temporally dynamic vegetation properties
    (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Input MODIS albedo maps were generated from the Solar
    Zenith Angle (SZN)-extended MODIS/Terra + Aqua 30 arc sec Global Gap-Filled Snow-Free
    Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) (MODIS BRDF/Albedo CMG
    Gap-Filled Snow-Free Product MCD43GF V005) parameters product (University of Massachusetts
    Boston, Dr. Crystal Schaaf). MODIS LST maps were generated using the Terra instantaneous
    swath product (MOD11_L2) and geolocation product (MOD03) to obtain correct georegistration.
    LST maps were sharpened using DMS (MODIS 1 km composite NDVI as input) to reduce
    the bowtie effect due to off-nadir pixel smearing (Cammalleri et al. 2014b; Semmens
    et al. 2016). Meteorological inputs to ALEXI/DisALEXI include hourly solar radiation,
    air temperature, wind speed and vapor pressure. These data were obtained from
    the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System
    Reanalysis (CFSR) data set (Dee et al. 2013). All fields were mapped to the 4
    km ALEXI grid and converted to each sensor’s projection at both daily and overpass
    times for ingestion into DisALEXI. ALEXI/DisALEXI also requires landcover class
    to specify surface roughness parameters and vegetation optical properties (Anderson
    et al. 2007a). The ALEXI model uses the University of Maryland (UMD) global land
    cover dataset at 1 km resolution, based on observations from the AVHRR (Hansen
    et al. 2000). Higher resolution MODIS and Landsat disaggregation requires the
    30 m National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) (Fry et al. 2011). For MODIS, the NLCD
    map was upscaled to 1 km resolution using the majority class within each MODIS
    pixel. Prior evaluation of ALEXI/DisALEXI over California vineyards indicate a
    small wet bias in modeled fluxes during the cold season (Semmens et al. 2016).
    The current study incorporates a generalized second order empirical correction
    factor based on the day of year (DOY) to adjust this bias (Anderson et al. 2018).
    Minimal correction is applied during the mid-season, with the largest corrections
    being applied during the beginning and ending of the year, causing minimal impact
    to seasonal total estimates. For more information, the reader is referred to Anderson
    et al. (2018). Results Model evaluation on Landsat dates The accuracy of the fused
    daily 30-m ET time series depends largely on the fidelity in energy balance partitioning
    achieved on dates of clear Landsat overpasses, while the MODIS ET data effectively
    serve to inform interpolation between Landsat dates (Fig. 1). To evaluate performance
    on these key tie-points, modeled daytime flux estimates derived using DisALEXI
    on Landsat overpass dates are compared to EC observations in Fig. 2, with statistical
    metrics of agreement, as provided in Table 1. The modeled flux estimates have
    been averaged over a 3-by-3 pixel area (90 × 90 m) shifted west from the tower
    center to avoid non-characteristic pixels over the adjacent road. Model estimates
    of latent heat flux (LE) have been compared to measured fluxes both as observed
    and closed using the RE method, as described in the “Field measurements” section.
    This enables an evaluation of closure impacts on the assessment of model performance.

    steps Full size table Simulated daytime fluxes derived from DisALEXI generally
    align along the one-to-one line (Fig. 2), indicating reasonable partitioning by
    the TSEB. Insolation and net radiation, defining energy available for partitioning,
    agree well with in-situ measurements. A few days with higher discrepancies reflect
    errors in the CFSR insolation inputs, related to misrepresentation of clouds in
    the reanalysis data. Future implementation over North America will test use of
    NOAA’s GOES Surface and Insolation Products (GSIP; Laszlo et al. 2008) as a near
    real time input data source. Preliminary investigation shows that these hourly,
    20-km satellite-derived estimates developed by Diak (2017) better capture local
    variability in solar irradiance over the northern vineyard (Anderson et al. 2018),
    although some regional calibration may be required. Model performance for the
    2013–2016 period is similar to that reported by Semmens et al. (2016), where MAE
    errors in daily LE of ~ 1.2 MJ m−2 day−1 were obtained for Landsat overpass dates
    during the 2013 growing season. The increase in MAE seen here is likely associated
    with evaluating over multiple years with varying climatic conditions and vineyard
    management decisions, and the extension of analysis to year-round in the current
    study (Semmens et al. 2016 was limited to the growing season only). Modeled LE
    indicates underestimation when compared to closed observed LE estimates at site
    1, yielding a negative MBE of − 0.46 MJ m−2 day−1 (Table 1). The negative bias
    is most prevalent at the highest values associated with peak growing season, and
    is not present at site 2 or in comparison with the unclosed LE measurements. Evaluation
    of daily ET from fused time series Scatter plots and associated time series of
    modeled 24-h ET from the fused daily time series and daily fluxes observed at
    tower sites 1 and 2 between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016 are shown in Figs.
    3 and 4, respectively. Daily ET estimates from the fused remote-sensing product
    follow the same general trend as the direct retrievals on Landsat overpass dates
    (Fig. 3). MAE for the full daily time series (closed) are 0.6 mm day−1 for both
    sites, comparable to the 0.7 mm day−1 errors reported by Semmens et al. (2016)
    for the 2013 growing season in isolation. Relative errors for both sites combined
    are 17% and 12% at daily and weekly time steps—the latter being more relevant
    for weekly irrigation scheduling. Fig. 3 Scatterplots of modeled vs. observed

    line) for site 1 (top panel) and site 2 (bottom panel). Daily precipitation measured
    at each site is indicated by the black vertical bars Full size image On both Landsat
    overpass dates (Fig. 2) and in the full daily time series from the data fusion
    methodology (Fig. 3), the modeled LE and ET underestimates the closed observed
    fluxes at site 1 at the very highest values. As seen in Fig. 4, these periods
    of underestimation occur between approximately mid-June and mid-August for each
    year and most notably for years 2013 and 2016. In both cases, the closure corrections
    using the residual method are relatively large, and the modeled ET is typically
    bracketed between closed and unclosed observed values. Such discrepancies are
    not observed at site 2. These large mid-season closure corrections and enhanced
    model-measurement discrepancies are likely related to advective conditions. In
    semiarid or arid regions, horizontal advection of hot, dry air, heated by the
    surrounding landscape, can significantly increase the localized evaporative demand
    over an irrigated field, driving large latent heat fluxes. In such cases, the
    additional energy required for evaporation is extracted from the surface itself,
    resulting in negative sensible heat and an increase in closure errors (Alfieri
    et al. 2012). A cursory analysis of the observed sensible heat fluxes at sites
    1 and 2 revealed signatures of advection during the periods of lower closure,
    suggesting the RE method may be overestimating the real evaporative flux during
    those intervals. Furthermore, the tower footprint may be impacted under advective
    conditions, effectively sampling surface conditions further upwind. Anderson et
    al. (2018) found that peak observed flux estimates are better correlated with
    model fluxes extracted over a more central region of the vineyard that has more
    vigorous vine growth and yield production. Moreover, the assumption of self-preservation
    to upscale instantaneous flux retrieved at the satellite overpass time to daily
    totals depreciates under advective conditions (Crago 1996; Tang et al. 2013).
    Ongoing work is addressing both modeling and observational issues under the specific
    condition of strong mid-season advection. Within-field variability in water use
    Routine remote sensing of daily ET at 30-m resolution will facilitate identification
    of areas of uneven ET/stress within vineyards due to variations in soil texture
    and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors. Figure 5 shows
    the variability in daily ET across both the northern and southern vineyards (sites
    1 and 2) during the entire period of investigation. Spatial variability in ET
    increases during the growing season, with maximum variation occurring in July,
    then decreasing to a near-homogeneous distribution during the winter season. The
    northern vineyard exhibits a higher degree of spatial variability in ET, both
    in standard deviation and range, when compared to the southern vineyard. In the
    northern vineyard, the ET observed at the flux tower persistently lies near the
    upper bounds in standard deviation and range during the growing season. In general,
    at site 2, the flux tower samples are near the spatial mean of the remotely sensed
    distribution (Fig. 5). Overall, modeled spatial mean estimates of ET over the
    northern and southern vineyard are similar, with the only discrepancy found during
    the late growing season of 2013 and 2015, where values over the southern vineyard
    are slightly lower than in the northern vineyard (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Fig.
    5 Time series of observed ET (black dots), spatial mean modeled ET with plus and
    minus standard deviation (dark red) and spatial range (maximum and minimum) modeled
    ET (light red) for the northern vineyard (top panel) and southern vineyard (middle
    panel). Also included is the time series of modeled spatial mean ET for both vineyards
    (bottom panel) Full size image The analyses in Fig. 5 highlight the challenges
    in using isolated in-situ measurements to infer field-scale states and fluxes.
    As noted by Semmens et al. (2016), the northern field has large variability in
    soil texture, with the northwestern corner of the northern vineyard containing
    a silt/gravelly loam, resulting in poor to moderate water storage capacities and
    subsequently lower ET rates than observed in other parts of both fields, dominated
    by a Kimball silt loam. As a result, the tower footprint in site 1 captures conditions
    that are not always representative of the field as a whole. This is consistent
    with analyses presented by Anderson et al. (2018), who investigated spatial variability
    in correlations between the observed fluxes and modeled ET time series extracted
    in a moving window sampling a 600 × 600 m area around the Lodi tower sites, as
    a metric of tower representivity. They found that on average over two full annual
    cycles, tower fluxes at site 1 were best correlated with modeled ET to the southwest
    of the tower location, shifting to the vineyard center when the analysis was limited
    to the peak of the growing seasons. The southern vineyard showed less spatial
    variability in terms of tower-model agreement. Local variability in water use
    Along with field ET estimates, spatial maps of ET over the local landscape can
    provide valuable context for irrigation decision makers. Vineyard managers often
    operate multiple vineyards, potentially with different varietals and irrigation
    management strategies. There may also be value in understanding irrigation and
    water-use patterns in neighboring fields. As an example, maps of monthly ET over
    a roughly 3 km by 3 km box including the GRAPEX study area, with the northern
    and southern vineyards near the center, are presented in Fig. 6. Over this 4-year
    period, some consistent seasonal patterns in water use are apparent. Beginning
    in March, localized ET enhancements in irrigated fields begin to emerge. Irrigation
    in the GRAPEX vineyards begins in early June and ends in early- to mid-October.
    Remnant evaporation of late season irrigation can be seen in these vineyards in
    October for each year. Fig. 6 Spatial time series (monthly) of ET (mm month−1)
    over a 3 × 3 km area including the northern and southern vineyards instrumented
    for GRAPEX. Boxes demarcate the new vineyard established west of the northern
    vineyard and an alfalfa field left fallow following the 2015 growing season Full
    size image Although seasonal patterns remain relatively consistent from year to
    year, some discernable changes in local water use can be seen over the 4-year
    period, particularly during the growing season. These changes are largely related
    to changes in land use. For example, evidence of irrigation in a new vineyard
    established just west of site one in early 2014 is manifested as a substantial
    increase between 2013 and 2014 and persisting through the 2015–2016 growing seasons
    (outlined in black; Fig. 6). In addition, ET in the field due south of the southern
    vineyard (also outlined in Fig. 6) decreases notably in 2016 due to fallowing
    of an alfalfa field after May of that year, possibly the result of grower response
    to long-term drought conditions and resulting water limitations (Anderson et al.
    2018). Spatial weekly or monthly maps of local ET at this scale provide vineyard
    managers with information about local land- and water-use changes, which may have
    bearing on in-field decision making and long-term strategic planning. Use of remote
    sensing for monitoring vineyard water stress and managing irrigation This study
    investigates two remote-sensing metrics that may be useful in vineyard irrigation
    management are total daily or weekly ET (relating to consumptive water use—water
    extracted from the soil profile requiring replacement), and the moisture stress
    factor fRET. Grape development is strongly dependent on vine water status, and
    strategies for optimizing wine grape quality are often associated with imposing
    some degree of water stress in the vine during specific phenological periods.
    This degree of stress is achieved through regulated deficit irrigation (RDI),
    estimated as a fraction of the full crop potential water use. Current operational
    practices utilize the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO-56) model to estimate
    crop potential water use based on the reference ET and a crop coefficient (commonly
    referred to as Kc) describing the average ratio of actual-to-reference ET for
    different crops under well-watered conditions. The fRET quantity used in the regional-scale
    ESI agricultural drought indicator effectively represents a dynamic crop coefficient,
    diagnostically retrieved via thermal remote sensing and responding to daily changes
    in localized crop stress and development. To illustrate the utility of a daily
    Landsat-scale fRET product for stress detection, Fig. 7 compares modeled values
    to observations derived from tower measurements of actual and reference ET. Reference
    ET is calculated in both cases using the Penman–Monteith formulation, as described
    in the FAO standard for a short grass (Allen et al. 1998), computed using tower
    data in the observed case and using regional meteorological data (NCEP CFSR data
    set; Dee et al. 2013) for the modeled case. Observed Actual ET is taken as the
    observed 24-h daily closed flux tower measurement, while the modeled ET values
    are extracted from the fused time series at the tower sites. Also shown are rainfall
    and irrigation amounts measured in-field, the latter only available for the 2015
    and 2016 growing seasons (see zoom-in in Fig. 7; bottom panel). Fig. 7 Time series
    of fRET derived from closed observations (black dots) and the fused ET time series
    (red line) derived from point estimates for site 1 (top panel) and site 2 (second
    from top panel) during the entire study period, along with daily rainfall (green
    bars). Also included is an enhanced view of 2015 and 2016 (bottom two panels),
    which includes daily irrigation totals (blue bars) presented in Liters/vine Full
    size image In general, the fused fRET time series reproduces observed seasonal
    patterns inferred from the tower observations with good fidelity. Small mid-season
    biases are observed in 2013 and 2015 at site 1, relating to localized advective
    issues discussed earlier. This bias is non-existent at site 2, where both modeled
    and observed fRET estimates are similar throughout the study period. Both modeled
    and measured fRET indicate lower peak season fRET values at site 2 during 2013
    and 2015 when compared to 2014 and 2015, consistent with the cyclical annual ET
    patterns in Fig. 4. During 2015–2016, when detailed irrigation information is
    available (Fig. 7; bottom panels), we can closely investigate relationships between
    fRET and daily irrigation amounts, expressed in in units of liters per vine. Observed
    and modeled fRET fluctuate rapidly during the non-growing season when canopy cover
    is sparse and no irrigation is occurring, reflecting the relative volatility in
    the soil evaporation and cover crop transpiration contributions that dominate
    total ET during this period. Once irrigation commences, fRET remains more stable
    and near target levels (0.8–1.0) until after harvest. Note that irrigation is
    suspended each year briefly (5–7 days) around harvest near the end of August,
    then resumed post-harvest until early-to-mid-October to maintain the canopy. After
    harvest, both observed and modeled fRET decay as the vines senesce. During the
    growing season, remotely sensed fRET values in both vineyards show response to
    seasonal irrigation amounts. In 2015, site 2 received about 60% of the daily irrigation
    amounts applied to site 1, while in 2016 the irrigation strategy was more uniform,
    with site 2 at 92% of site 1 (Fig. 8). Irrigation at site 1 varied by only 1%
    between the two years, while site 2 increased by 54% in 2016. These variations
    in irrigation management are reflected in the average remote sensing fRET retrieved
    during the irrigation season (pre-harvest), around 0.7 for site 2 in 2013 and
    0.8 in all other cases. Fig. 8 Total irrigation applied (liters/vine) over 2015
    and 2016 growing seasons in the site 1 and 2 vineyards Full size image Regional
    differences in applied irrigation can be seen in the spatiotemporal patterns of
    monthly average 30-m fused fRET (Fig. 9). After irrigation is initiated (beginning
    of June), there is a clear distinction in fRET between the vineyards in 2013 and
    2015, but less difference in 2014/2016, reflecting differentials in irrigation
    amounts applied to the two fields (Fig. 8). While the relative patterns in monthly
    fRET are similar to those in total ET shown in Fig. 6, normalization by reference
    ET serves to reduce dependence on the seasonal evaporative demand curve, focusing
    more specifically on variations in moisture conditions driving the evaporative
    fluxes. These maps also provide information on irrigation initiation in surrounding
    fields. The fRET maps for April in Fig. 9 emphasize wetter springtime conditions
    in 2014, as well as early initiation of irrigation in the fields to the southwest
    in 2014 and 2016. Fig. 9 Spatiotemporal time series (monthly) of fRET (top panel)
    and fRET anomaly (bottom panel) over a 3 × 3 km area including the northern and
    southern vineyards instrumented for GRAPEX Full size image Anomalies in monthly
    fRET, computed as the difference with respect to the long-term (here 4-year) mean
    fRET map for each month are useful for highlighting regions anomalous moisture
    stress and water use in real time (Fig. 9; bottom panel). In April, May and June
    of 2015 we see pronounced negative anomalies in the southern vineyard, which are
    also present, albeit to a smaller degree, during the remainder of the growing
    season. These anomalies indicate stress in the vineyard likely correlated to the
    lesser amount of irrigation applied during the 2015 growing season and subsequent
    reduced yield as discussed earlier. Regional precipitation in October of 2015
    may have helped to reduce the fRET anomaly signal from September to October. In
    some cases, reflect changes in land use and water management rather than stress.
    In 2013 we see strong negative anomalies in the areas where new vineyards were
    established in 2014, to the west and south of site 1. The alfalfa field fallowed
    in May of 2016 is clearly apparent. Drier than normal conditions are detected
    for the month of September in 2015 over the region just east of the GRAPEX vineyard
    sites. This may be related to management/harvest decisions in response to the
    multi-year drought conditions that prevailed in California during the study period,
    leading to increasing pressure on water availability for irrigation. Spatial fRET
    and fRET anomaly products such as these prove capable of monitoring dynamic crop
    coefficients and highlighting changing conditions, not only within a field of
    interest, but also on a regional scale. Relationships between vineyard water use,
    stress and yields The ultimate objective in this study is to motivate use of remote
    sensing toward meeting the dual goals of reducing water use while improving yield
    and grape quality. Figure 10 provides a more detailed view of annual water-use
    patterns and its relation to grape yield over the two GRAPEX vineyards, showing
    cumulative ET over the peak growing season (May–August) in the top panel and grape
    yield (tons ha−1) in the bottom panel. Fig. 10 Cumulative peak growing season
    (May–August) ET (mm) (top) and total yield in tons/ha (bottom) over the northern
    and southern vineyards for years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Full size image The
    cumulative ET maps show distinct spatial structure. Two low ET features in the
    south-central portion of the northern vineyard are associated with vernal pools
    - small areas having no vines and no irrigation because of protection by state
    and federal law from any cultivation activities (see also Semmens et al. 2016).
    These ephemeral wetlands emerge after rainfall events, but during most of the
    growing season are dry leading to persistently low values of seasonal ET. There
    is also the persistence in lower ET in the northwest corner of the northern (site
    1) vineyard, which is associated with poor vine growth due to soil properties.
    This corner of the field has silt loam and gravelly loam soils characteristic
    of poor to moderate water storage capacity (Semmens et al. 2016), while the center
    of the northern vineyard is Kimball silt loam and is characteristic of more vigorous
    vine growth. The latter is characterized by high rates of seasonal consumptive
    water use. The increased water use associated with the new vineyards established
    to the west and south of the north vineyard after the 2013 growing season can
    also be observed in Fig. 10. Total ET during the peak growing season increases
    from roughly 300 mm year−1 during 2013 to 520–550 mm year−1 during 2014 over this
    region due to irrigation applied to help establish the recently planted vines.
    Much of this spatial structure in seasonal ET is well correlated in patterns in
    yield maps, collected over the GRAPEX fields using GPS-enabled sensors on the
    harvesters. The cyclical ET dynamics in the southern vineyard (site 2), with relatively
    high cumulative water use in 2014 and 2016, reflects grower decisions in irrigation
    management in this field. In the northern vineyard (site 1), the cumulative water
    use is lower in 2013 than in 2014–2016. Similar spatial and temporal patterns
    are seen in the reported total yield for each site (Fig. 10). Specifically, total
    yield for 2015 in the southern vineyard is considerably lower than in the northern
    vineyard, while also being lower than both the north and south vineyards in 2016,
    corresponding to trends in both fRET and irrigation. This instance of decreased
    yield may be the result of increased stress imposed over the southern vineyard
    (shown in fRET) through restricted irrigation during the 2015 growing season (Fig.
    8). Despite the lack of irrigation data during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons,
    trends in fRET correspond to yield totals—most notably in the southern vineyard—where
    fRET values are lowest during the 2013 and 2015 growing season (Fig. 7). In the
    northern vineyard, yields are lowest in 2013—the year of lowest cumulative water
    use. The spatial distribution of cumulative growing season ET (Fig. 10) also roughly
    follows that of yield, with larger values of both reported near the center of
    the northern vineyard for all years. As noted above, spatial heterogeneity in
    the northern vineyard is associated with soil texture discontinuities and vine
    growth vigor. Low yields in the NW corner are spatially correlated with lower
    seasonal ET, while the center of the northern vineyard has persistently the highest
    yields and seasonal water use. A similar spatial correlation to yield is presented
    in Sun et al. (2017), where the biophysical parameters NDVI and LAI show a similar
    spatial correlation to grape yield over the same vineyards during 2013 and 2014,
    although the relationship is more variable from year to year. Ongoing work looks
    to expand upon research done in Sun et al. (2017) by examining the joint use of
    remotely sensed LAI/ET/fRET signals to predict yield variations over a larger
    dataset of vineyards and over an extended period. Summary and conclusions A remote-sensing
    approach for mapping daily ET at 30-m spatial resolution is evaluated over two
    vineyard sites in central California for the 2013–2016 growing seasons to investigate
    the utility for irrigation management. Mean absolute errors in comparison with
    in-situ eddy covariance measurements of daily ET were 0.6 mm day−1, or about 17%
    of the mean observed value. Errors reduced to 15% at the weekly time steps relevant
    to irrigation management. In comparison with eddy covariance fluxes forced for
    closure, the model tended to underestimate closed observations in the northern
    vineyard site during highly advective periods for the peak growing season in 2013
    and 2016. During this period, the closure errors in the observations were exacerbated,
    and therefore, the tendency to underestimate is partly attributed to issues with
    the flux measurements and closure technique and not the model alone. Model errors
    may be associated with the self-preservation assumptions in the daily upscaling
    technique, which may be less reliable under advective conditions. Monthly total
    ET maps and the spatial variation time series demonstrate strong seasonal water-use
    variability, both within the vineyards themselves and over the surrounding landscape.
    In the northern vineyard, the flux tower location was not representative of the
    field-scale mean properties in some years, highlighting challenges in managing
    irrigation decisions based on point-scale measurements. Time series of monthly
    ET maps revealed consistent seasonal dynamics year-to-year in water-use patterns
    over the GRAPEX study area, but with some notable variations due to changes in
    land use and water management. Within vineyard spatial variability of cumulative
    growing season ET and actual-to-reference ET (fRET) correlate well with yield
    totals, demonstrating the impact of potential stress on future yield prospects.
    Maps of fRET demonstrate utility for monitoring how consistently target values
    (between 0.8 and 1.0 in this case) are achieved for a given field, and could be
    useful for adaptive management of irrigation applications in real time. Maps of
    fRET anomalies highlight emerging areas of anomalous water use or stress that
    could alert needs for modified management or further investigation. The modeling
    approach described here can provide detailed and robust information on daily to
    seasonal crop water use and stress. Applied operationally, this ET mapping framework
    can be of great utility to irrigation managers, both for individual vineyard assessment
    and larger regional application. Improved spatial and temporal monitoring will
    improve water allocation and conservation efforts through an ability to identify
    areas of uneven productivity/stress due to variations in soil texture and composition
    and other environmental or anthropogenic factors. This will allow vineyard managers
    to identify areas in their blocks with water, nutrient or other environmental
    stressors as well as malfunctions in the irrigation systems. Moreover, with reliable
    daily 30-m ET, growers and irrigation managers have the potential to make use
    of variable rate irrigation systems that can apply appropriate amounts of irrigated
    water and nutrients to specific areas within a vineyard to achieve more uniform
    grape quality and yield goals. There is also potential to incorporate very fine
    resolution aerial imagery from UAVs or manned aircraft for identifying individual
    or groups of vines requiring intervention at critical periods during vine and
    grape development stages when stress conditions are detected at the coarser 30
    m satellite resolution. In ongoing work, this fusion-based ET mapping system is
    being applied over different vine varieties and climate regions within California
    as part of the continued effort of the GRAPEX project (Kustas et al. 2018). The
    ability to reliably monitor evaporative water loss and crop conditions at both
    the field and regional scale is imperative to viticulture and agricultural production
    systems alike, especially in regions with competing demands for limited water
    resources. Notes The use of trade, firm, or corporation names in this article

    \ paper came from the developing countries where the economy is mostly dependent\
    \ on agriculture\nand climate conditions. Based on current conditions and historical\
    \ records, proﬁtability in production farming depends on\nmaking a right and timely\
    \ operational decision. Precision farming is a systematic program designed to\
    \ maximize the productivity\nof agriculture by carefully tailoring the soil and\
    \ crop management to meet the speciﬁc requirements in each ﬁeld while preserving\n\
    environmental quality. Tis review paper highlights the development of an automated\
    \ irrigation system with portable wireless\nsensor networks and decision support\
    \ methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters in an agriculture ﬁeld.\
    \ Radio\nsatellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication, and\
    \ microcontroller capture the ecological parameters such as\nsoil moisture, temperature,\
    \ humidity, and light intensity. Te knowledge gained from the sensors is transferred\
    \ directly to the\ncloud server by using IoT technology. Users from anywhere in\
    \ the world can display them through an internet-enabled device.\nDevelopment\
    \ of sensor-based application in modern agriculture makes it cost-eﬀective and\
    \ potentially productive and increases\nthe eﬃciency through precision agriculture\
    \ farming. Diﬀerent limitations have been reported in the previously reviewed\n\
    publications like the shortage of power in the ﬁeld that can be solved by using\
    \ a solar panel that recharges the battery at the same\ntime using electricity.\
    \ Bluetooth application in the agriculture sector is mainly improved by design\
    \ system optimization. Problems\nrelated to transmission and radio range frequency\
    \ can be solved by using a power class upgraded antenna.\n1. Introduction\nHuman\
    \ civilization around the globe is preparing for a\npopulation explosion to hit\
    \ a total of 10 billion inhabitants by\n2050 (United Nations, 2017). It has been\
    \ estimated that global\nfood production must increase by least 70% over the coming\n\
    years to keep pace with this growth [1–3]. Over the years,\nagricultural methods\
    \ have not improved much, and farmers\nstill use conventional strategies based\
    \ on expectations of the\ncrop’s nutritional needs. Delivering the same nutrient\
    \ input\nacross the entire farm is no longer the best choice, as this leads\n\
    to heavy fertilizer and pesticide usage, unnecessary water\nconsumption,\nenvironmental\n\
    degradation,\nand\nhigh\noperating costs [4, 5]. Extensive irrigation consumes\
    \ ap-\nproximately 70% of global water [6]. Te industrial and\ndomestic sectors\
    \ account for 13% and 20%, respectively, al-\nthough this variation in percentage\
    \ is considerable variation\nacross countries. According to the Act 1947, it deﬁnes\
    \ ag-\nriculture, including livestock’s breeding, dairy farming,\nhorticulture,\
    \ seed growing, and fruit growing [7]. Agriculture\naims to utilize maximum land\
    \ and increase the proﬁt. Te\nagricultural sector needs to adopt smarter methods\
    \ of\nfarming. Innovative techniques in agriculture, such as pre-\ncision farming\
    \ techniques, help with these concerns. Precision\nfarming is a farm management\
    \ method that uses information\ntechnology to eﬃciently distribute resources and\
    \ ensure that\nHindawi\nAdvances in Meteorology\nVolume 2020, Article ID 8396164,\
    \ 14 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8396164\nthe crops and soil receive the\
    \ exact nutrients needed at the\nperfect time for enhanced health and productivity\
    \ [8]. In\nrecent years, the researchers have tried to develop automated\ncontrol\
    \ irrigation systems for irrigation management by using\ncloud computing and IoT\
    \ technology; IoT can be charac-\nterized as a network of independent objects\
    \ that link and\nshare data remotely over the Internet [9, 10]. Te gap between\n\
    supply and demand is rising and sets new challenges adding\npressure on the agriculture\
    \ supply chain [11]. Traditionally\navailable techniques for irrigation are drip\
    \ irrigation, ditch\nirrigation, sprinkler systems, and terraced systems. Te\n\
    standard irrigation practices are classiﬁed by demand increase\nfor productivity,\
    \ shortage of water, and poor performance for\nagriculture practice. Tese problems\
    \ are solved by using\nautomated irrigation systems.\n1.1. Need for Automatic\
    \ Irrigation\n(i) Saving energy and resources for utilizing in a precise\nway.\n\
    (ii) Easily installation of the system on the ﬁeld.\n(iii) To apply the right\
    \ amount of water at the right time\nfor the sake of farmer’s easiness to control\
    \ farm\nirrigation and nursery.\n(iv) Valves are used in automated irrigation\
    \ systems to\nturn on/oﬀ the motor.\n(v) Pump or motor can be easily operated\
    \ with a sensor-\nbased controller and no need for any labor to\nmanage or monitor\
    \ irrigation systems. Crop eﬃ-\nciency includes improvement in the reduction of\
    \ the\noverwatering from the saturated soil and avoiding\nthe wrong time of irrigation\
    \ to save more water.\nA signiﬁcant part of freshwater is consumed in the\nagricultural\
    \ sector due to the unavailability of cost-eﬀective\nirrigation systems [12–14].\
    \ Fortunately, previous imple-\nmentations of agricultural monitoring systems\
    \ for irrigation\npractices were riddled with problems that prevented the\nprogress\
    \ of this sector. Previously, farm surveillance systems\ncomprised of a wired\
    \ data collection system in which a data\ntransmission linked the sensor units\
    \ with monitoring sta-\ntions [13, 15, 16]. Rainfall and evapotranspiration is\
    \ an\nimportant factor which inﬂuences the moisture of the soil in\nclimatology\
    \ and geography soil wetness measured by the\nproportion of monthly (or annual)\
    \ evaporation and pre-\ncipitation. Soil moisture daily can also be calculated\
    \ by the\nratio of daily evaporation and precipitation in the above\nperspective\
    \ from the routine weather reports precipitation is\ndirectly accessible, and\
    \ evaporation is derived from other\nmetrological essentials [17]. Heterogeneous\
    \ systems are used\nto gather information at a higher level; smart algorithms\
    \ can\nbe organized for evaluating scientiﬁc knowledge to provide\nan enhanced\
    \ understanding of the ongoing processes\n[18, 19]. For sensors-based irrigation,\
    \ diﬀerent terminolo-\ngies are used, i.e., Precision Farming, Variable Rate Tech-\n\
    nology (VRT), Smart Agriculture, Global Positioning\nService (GPS), and Site-Speciﬁc\
    \ Crop Management. [20].\nNowadays, sensors can be used in the domain of human\
    \ life\ndue to its modern technology and small size. Due to the\nconsequence of\
    \ this technology, numerous problems asso-\nciated with sensor networking are\
    \ in research. Low memory,\nenergy constraint, and data security are some of the\
    \ sig-\nniﬁcant issues of sensor networks in which diﬀerent re-\nsearchers in\
    \ the world are trying to solve these issues [21, 22].\nTis review is proposed\
    \ to support aggressive water man-\nagement for agricultural land. It aims to\
    \ explain the diﬀerent\nmodern and sensor-based irrigation management tech-\n\
    niques and track environmental parameters in the ﬁeld of\nagriculture and provide\
    \ warnings and information on\ncurrent conditions to ﬁeld managers while saving\
    \ data for\nfuture reference in a database, which includes information\ncollecting\
    \ using remote sensor collection, wireless sensor\nnetwork, target controlling,\
    \ and data management scheme\nas shown in Figure 1. Tis review paper is based\
    \ on sensor-\nbased irrigation systems and modern technologies in the\nprevious\
    \ works; this study will be helpful to new researchers\nin this ﬁeld to get more\
    \ knowledge and provide more up to\ndate and ﬁll the gap through this review study.\n\
    2. Related Work\nAn automatic sprinkler is a new irrigation technique of\nmodern\
    \ agriculture, but until now, it is not entirely accepted\namong the farmers.\
    \ Mostly, it is practiced by the researchers\nfor performing the experimental\
    \ studies. Wireless sensor\nnetwork (WSN) is conceived as a new concept in agricultural\n\
    applies, which encouraged many scholars to accomplish\nresearch in this zone.\
    \ Recent developments in wireless\nsensor network (WSN) technologies have enabled\
    \ wired\nsensor systems to solve speciﬁc problems [23–26]. Recent\ndevelopments\
    \ in wireless sensor network (WSN) technol-\nogies have enabled wired sensor systems\
    \ to solve particular\nproblems [27–29]. Tis segment is mainly focusing on how\n\
    diﬀerent researchers used WSN systems to support agri-\ncultural practices and\
    \ irrigation. Abbas et al. have developed\na smart sensor-based system for parks\
    \ and gardens that\nmake use of diﬀerent modern sensors. In this system, the\n\
    latest soil moisture sensors are used to sense the ﬁeld\nmoisture as well as diﬀerent\
    \ soil characteristics such as water\nholding capacity [30]. Te main aim of this\
    \ system is to\ncalculate the time that is taken by the sensors to get activated\n\
    and distinguished the irrigation zone. ZigBee is used to make\na connection between\
    \ sensor nodes and wireless-based\nstations. Tis system has four signiﬁcant portions,\
    \ i.e.,\ncontrol unit, water controller, security systems, and mobile\nmessaging\
    \ unit [31]. Te primary function of the water\ncontroller is to identify the level\
    \ of water in the ﬁeld and to\nrepresent the microcontroller. Output functions\
    \ of water\nsensors are to switch the microcontrollers and automatically\nturn\
    \ on or turn oﬀ the pump mechanism. If the farm is\nsubmerged, then the controller\
    \ is automatically turned on\nthe pump that takes out additional water from the\
    \ ﬁeld.\nSecurity systems and password protection were used to\ncontrol unit and\
    \ pumps from unauthorized access. Water is\nbeing applied through proper network\
    \ systems that involve\npipes, pumps, valves, and sprinklers. Irrigation sprinklers\n\
    can also be used for industrial, commercial, residential, and\n2\nAdvances in\
    \ Meteorology\nagricultural purposes. Moreover, several studies considered\nsensor-based\
    \ irrigation is a modern-day irrigation activity\nthat is practiced in a large\
    \ area under entire controlled-\nconditions, as it could eliminate the external\
    \ environmental\nfactors compared with the traditional irrigation activities.\
    \ Te\nGSM sensor-based irrigation control system with a gun\nsprinkler was declared\
    \ in [32–34] with rain gun systems\noperated with the automatic microcontroller\
    \ for crops re-\nquiring a more signiﬁcant amount of water in the ﬁeld. Cell\n\
    phone applications play a fundamental part in the multiple\nneeds of humans. GPRS\
    \ feature in the mobile phone appli-\ncation is used for irrigation control systems,\
    \ but these systems\nare not economical and cover less range of agricultural land.\n\
    Te methods used GSM feature and the android app for\nsending a message to farmers\
    \ and notify them about over-\nirrigation and under irrigation that causes losses,\
    \ leaching the\nnutrient content of soil [35, 36]. Satellite communication\nschemes\
    \ are widely used or prefer where topography dif-\nference is signiﬁcant, and\
    \ cell phone service is not reachable\n[37, 38]. Radio systems with certiﬁed power\
    \ (e.g., 5–10 W)\nwith modems are also a good option but aﬀected by topo-\ngraphic\
    \ hindrance. For radiofrequency, repeater stations may\nbecome too costly when\
    \ there is communication over a\nsigniﬁcant distance and diﬀerent topography.\
    \ Te central\naspect of this technology is to develop decision support\nsystems\
    \ based on ﬁeld-speciﬁc information that exploits the\nchemical or applied water\
    \ concentration [39]. Lamb et al.\ndeveloped a system which is operated by photovoltaic\
    \ irri-\ngation to enhance water depletion by using temperature\nsensors and moisture\
    \ sensors [40].\n2.1. Soil Evaporation Model [41, 42]. For proper irrigation\n\
    management, prediction of soil moisture plays a vital role.\nTe Penmen method\
    \ was considered to get the possible\naccurate results with a minimum error related\

    measurement\nmethod\nwas\nestablished on neurofuzzy (NF) inference and originated\n\
    that the NF model (depended on relative humidity, solar\nradioactivity, and air\
    \ temperature) shows better precision\nover the combination of air temperature,\
    \ wind speed, and\nsolar radiation [45]. Soil moisture has been predicted from\n\
    the weather forecast sensors placed at the farm. Te soil\nmoisture evaporation\
    \ depends on air relative humidity, air\ntemperature, radiation, and temperature\
    \ of the soil [46]. A\nsensor-based and IoTconstructed architecture (Figure 2)\
    \ has\nbeen developed for collecting, processing, and transmitting\nthe diﬀerent\
    \ physical parameters (air temperature, air rel-\native humidity, soil moisture\
    \ soil temperature, and radia-\ntion) of the farmland related to weather forecast\
    \ information\nfor making eﬃcient irrigation.\nTe system comprises two main components,\
    \ i.e.,\nWireless Information Unit (WIU) and Wireless Sensor Unit\n(WSU). Te sensor\
    \ units have diﬀerent types of sensors to\nsense the soil temperature and soil\
    \ moisture, and the main\nmicrocontroller received sensed data and optimized it.\n\
    ZigBee is used to send data to WIU. Such WSN networks\nalso added a small transmission\
    \ spectrum and high network\ncosts [47–49]. Data acquisition structures are developed\
    \ to\nbe used in environmental compliance along with green-\nhouses or food factories\
    \ and lack of solidity to be used\noutside\nfor\nprolonged\nperiods.\nVishwakarma\n\
    and\nChoudhary developed another option for irrigation systems\noperated with\
    \ SMS facilities, and farmers received a text to\nmobile phones. Tis system incessantly\
    \ observes the irri-\ngation pump and electric motor and aware the farmers by\n\
    sending an SMS to the mobile telephone representing the\naccessibility of power\
    \ supply to the motor. Te farmer selects to\nturn oﬀ and on the electric motor\
    \ by sending an SMS to the\nsensor-based systems that are installed on the ﬁeld,\
    \ and net-\nworks can act according to the programming command as\nreceived in\
    \ SMS; the farmers are also able to set the timer\naccording to their need to\
    \ turn oﬀ the motor automatically [50].\n3. Remote Sensing in Modern Irrigation\n\
    Remote sensing is the latest technique for collecting data\nthrough diﬀerent satellite\
    \ sensor technologies. Tis tech-\nnique involves very close examination of vast\
    \ land set images\nand photos that are captured by aerial photographs which\n\
    are followed by an interpretation, identiﬁcation, and map-\nping of diﬀerent agricultural\
    \ resources and various water\ndata that are connected with forest, water bodies,\
    \ villages,\nroads, crop area, soil, and land types. Troughout the ag-\nricultural\
    \ ﬁeld, optical or visual RS is one of the most often\nexploited in remote sensing.\
    \ Tis uses various bands, i.e.,\nNIR and SWIR sensors, to collect images from\
    \ Earth surfaces\nby reﬂecting features from the surface of the target area [51].\n\
    Termal sensors are often used to measure surface tem-\nperature and have detected\
    \ rapid response variables to track\ncrop health and crop stress [52, 53]. Termal\
    \ remote sensing\nis a process of monitoring radiation emitted from the surface\n\
    of the object and transmits it to temperature without cre-\nating any contact\
    \ with the object. All surface objects emit\nradiation above the temperature of\
    \ °K or 273°C [54]. Te\nabsorption intensity of each object depends on the tem-\n\
    perature; the higher the temperature, the greater the in-\ntensity of the radiation.\
    \ Termal remote sensing provides us\nwith substantial temperature and energy transfer\
    \ from the\nearth’s surface, which is essential to assume the processes\nand responses\
    \ of the landscape [55, 56]. For many agri-\nculture application series of airborne\
    \ thermal sensors, the\nsatellite uses directly or indirectly, as shown in Table\
    \ 1.\nTese remote sensing and agrometrological station data\nare very useful to\
    \ improve the actual crop yield estimation\nand involve in the development of\
    \ crop growth and yield\nmodels. Soil moisture conditions also play a vital role\
    \ in both\nrainfed and irrigated conditions. Tus, monitoring the\nmoisture of\
    \ the soil condition status using remote sensing\ndata would be very impressive\
    \ and useful to judge the actual\ncrop condition in advance and provide valuable\
    \ suggestions\nto farmers for their pesticide application, water-saving ir-\n\
    rigation, and postponding fertilizer.\n3.1. Why Sensors in Sprinkler Irrigation.\
    \ Sensors are used in\nsprinkler irrigation to get information about real-time\n\
    physical and environmental characteristics, and they are also\nemployed to acquire\
    \ feedback and have regulators over the\ncurrent situation. Te sensors accumulated\
    \ information to\nidentify the current object, people, location, and conditions\n\
    known as context [57, 58].\nTe agriculture sector carries numerous requirements\n\
    through sensors that are as follows:\n(i) Monitoring of distributed land\n(ii)\
    \ Collecting soil, crop, and weather information\n(iii) Multiple crops in a signal\
    \ piece of land\n(iv) Fertilizer and water requirement of diﬀerent ir-\nregular\
    \ lands\n(v) Protective solution rather than the sensitive solution\nDiﬀerent\
    \ sensors that are mainly used to collect the data\nfor agricultural-related practices\
    \ and acquisition for soil,\nplant, and weather are discussed in Tables 2–4.\n\
    3.2. Use of Sensors in Modern Irrigation. Application of\nsensor is attractive\
    \ in every ﬁeld of life due to the novelty of\nthis technology and size reduction;\
    \ the ability of the sensor is\n4\nAdvances in Meteorology\nto measure the physical\
    \ characteristics and change them in\nto signal for an observer. Trough speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation man-\nagement techniques, producers can maximize their yield by\n\
    saving a large amount of water. Site-speciﬁc irrigation\ncontrol systems are facing\
    \ many challenges nowadays in\nterms of designing software, uniﬁed combination\
    \ of sensors,\ndata interface, and communication protocol [59]. Solar\npanels\
    \ and electric power are a signiﬁcant consideration.\nMany researchers are trying\
    \ to address the diﬀerent issues\nrelated to irrigation control and interfacing\

    \ autonomous control system for the greenhouse [60],\nwhich depends on PC-based\
    \ dataset and linked with the base\nstation at the same time. Te component of\
    \ the based station\nis an actuator, GSM module, sensors, and microcontroller.\n\
    Te GSM module plays a vital role in the base station to send\nand receive messages\
    \ from central stations. Various tech-\nniques can be used to calculate the soil\
    \ moisture (in the\ngravimetric and volumetric forms), which are further\nclassiﬁed\
    \ into modern and classical procedures for both\nlaboratory and in situ measurements.\
    \ Te conventional\ntechniques to calculate the moisture in soil include tensi-\n\
    ometers methods, thermogravimetric, gypsum block, and\ncalcium carbide neutron\
    \ scattering [61]. While for modern\ntechniques, diﬀerent latest dielectric technologies\
    \ and in-\nfrared moisture balance such as heat ﬂux moisture sensors,\ntime domain\
    \ reﬂectometry (TDR), capacitance and optical\nmethod, frequency domain reﬂectometry\
    \ (FDR), and\nmicroelectromechanical systems are used [62, 63]. Radio\ntransmission\
    \ wireless systems were used to transfer soil\nmoisture data from data loggers\
    \ to an essential data logging\nsite where decisions are made and physically improved\
    \ [64].\nFigure 3 describes the practical approaches of the wireless\nsensor network\
    \ mounted on the ﬁeld. In this framework,\nfarmers can obtain information in real-time\
    \ (soil moisture\nand crop growth) through SMS facility or some android\napplication\
    \ for their area to get better management practices\nand crop yield. By utilizing\
    \ this information, farmers can get\nupdates about the farmland and nursery and\
    \ could be opined\nabout when and how much water is needed for irrigation\npractices.\

    \ manager to maintain the moisture level concerning\ntime. Some studies proved\
    \ that if we apply the water at the\nright time and right amount, the productions\
    \ can be in-\ncreased up to 25% to 30% [65, 66].\n3.3. Wireless Signal Communication\
    \ in Irrigation Systems.\nVarious designs and architectures were proposed for\
    \ plug-\nand-play technology to measure the soil moisture and de-\nvelop the sprinkler\
    \ valve controller for site-speciﬁc irrigation\nautomation and management through\
    \ distributed sensor\nnetwork. Wall et al. stated that data arrangement and control\n\
    management are the most eﬀective techniques to manage all\nthe data using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers. However, it is\nchallenging to set the sensing stations on\
    \ the ﬁeld to connect\nbase stations with wires because of station maintenance,\n\
    labor cost, and considerable distance, especially more than\n10 m. Wires systems\
    \ are not very much feasible because\ncables are damaged by farm equipment and\
    \ animals. Tat is\nwhy wireless networks develop grate intentions nowadays\nand\
    \ avoid many of these problems and provide easy re-\nplacement of broadcast stations.\
    \ Diﬀerent wireless tech-\nnologies are often used in much sensor-based research\
    \ work,\ni.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee [68]. A detailed assess-\nment of\
    \ diﬀerent sensor-based technology is discussed in\nTable 5. ZigBee wireless sensors\
    \ are the low-cost and lower-\npower-consumption technology that is mostly used\
    \ to de-\nvelop the wireless sensor network over diﬀerent techniques.\nIt was\
    \ established in May 2003, and ISM (industrial scientiﬁc\nand medical) bands are\
    \ used to operate, i.e., 2.4 GHz,\nglobally.\nFor integrating sensors and actuators,\
    \ there are some\ncontrol standards for RS485 (current based) and RS232\n(voltage\
    \ base) wireless protocol that have been widely ap-\nplied and well documented\
    \ in some industrial application.\nBluetooth and ZigBee (IEEE 802.11 standards)\
    \ are designed\nfor radio frequency of cell phone applications that require\n\
    insuﬃcient data, proper network security, and long battery\nlife [69]. Kim et\
    \ al. stated that ZigBee is a low-cost wireless\nnetworking system with advanced\
    \ features; they provide\nhigh reliability due to its direct-sequence (DS/SS)\
    \ and mesh\nnetworking systems. ZigBee technology is cheaper and re-\nliable than\
    \ Bluetooth, and it can also be used to ensure the\nintegrity and to avoid interference.\
    \ ZigBee not only requires\ndeﬁcient power than Bluetooth but can also transmit\
    \ ef-\nfectively over less distance (e.g., 30 m). Advanced wireless\ntransmitters\
    \ are accessible that are operated with Bluetooth\nand communicate up to 1 km.\
    \ Mostly in the agriculture\nsector, these types of wireless technologies are\
    \ connected to\ncontrol and sense the ﬁeld condition [70, 71].\n4. Description\
    \ of the Data Acquisition\nSystem for the Specific Field\nA total of three sensors,\
    \ including a air temperature and\nhumidity sensor, a light intensity sensor,\
    \ and a soil moisture\nsensor, were used for the assessment of any particular\
    \ area to\ncapture four environmental parameters, namely, tempera-\nture, humidity,\
    \ surrounding light intensity, and soil mois-\nture content. Te data collection\
    \ method provides the\nopportunity to assess the ecological conditions in the\
    \ ag-\nricultural sector accurately. Also, the system’s versatility\nallows additional\
    \ monitors, including a pH sensor, to esti-\nmate plant nutrients, a UV sensor\
    \ to determine ultraviolet\nlight intensity, greenhouse gases and pressure sensor\
    \ to track\nthe ambient air composition, a rain sensor is used to detect\nrainy\
    \ weather, and a water level sensors used to identify\nﬂood in the region, and\
    \ these are included in the system\naccording to client requirement. Te module\
    \ was used to\nread the surrounding environment captured by the sensors\nand process\

    \ shown in Figure 4. Te\nirrigation surveillance system established for this assessment\n\
    is cost-eﬀective and highly interactive and can be easily\nadapted to any agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld using the plug-and-play\ntechnique. Tis system is also operated by solar\
    \ energy,\nrendering individual data acquisition units entirely wireless\nand\
    \ portable, thus eliminating the need for cabling for power\nsupply and data transmission,\
    \ leading to reduce installation,\nmaintenance, and relocation costs.\n4.1. On-Site\
    \ and Functionality Analysis. Te sprinkler irri-\ngation system was designed for\
    \ wheat crop for an area of 1\nacre. Te total area was divided into four plots,\
    \ each part\nconsisting of a rain gun. Te device has been tested to ensure\nthat\
    \ environmental data can be collected via sensors; the\ninformation can be transmitted\
    \ to the IoT platform through\nan online website. Te machine has been running\
    \ for a few\nminutes to get several data entries. Sprinkler ﬁeld has been\ndivided\
    \ into four plots, and soil moisture sensors have been\nmounted in each location.\
    \ Tis test was conducted to ensure\nthat the device can perform as required under\
    \ real-world\ndaily usage conditions. Te prototype and layout of the data\nacquisition\
    \ unit were switched on and staked into the\nground of the research ﬁeld, as shown\
    \ in Figure 5. All four\nplots were atomized by connecting them through Wi-Fi\n\
    networking. An on-site website was developed, which gives\nthe current soil moisture\
    \ readings of all the sensors installed\nin the ﬁeld and save the recorded data.\
    \ Sensor stand, board\ncircuits, and continuous electric supply were managed using\n\
    an uninterruptible power supply.\nTe system was able to capture broadcast and\
    \ envi-\nronmental data as designed successfully. Te light intensity\nsensors\
    \ were also closed as the water was poured into the soil\nto simulate a change\
    \ in environmental conditions. Te\ncomputer was able to detect these changes without\
    \ any\nproblems, as shown in Figure 6. All tested ﬁelds were at-\nomized once\
    \ again by connecting them through a Wi-Fi\nnetwork. An on-site website was also\
    \ devolved, which gives\nthe current soil moisture readings of all the sensors\
    \ installed\nin the ﬁeld and saves the recorded data. An account on Ting\nSpeak\
    \ was also made to make graphs of the recorded data.\nSensor stand, board circuits,\
    \ and continuous electric supply\nwere managed using an uninterruptible power\
    \ supply.\nMoreover, one point of contention during the prototype test\nwas the\
    \ wireless connectivity range. As this test was carried\nout by linking a prototype\
    \ signal processing unit to a Wi-Fi\nnetwork established by a Wi-Fi hotspot from\
    \ a cell phone,\nthe device would lose its connection and stop transmitting\n\
    information to the IoT platform if it moved approximately\n5 m apart from the\
    \ user. Tis problem could be overcome by\ninstalling wireless access points (WAPs)\
    \ throughout the ﬁeld\nvia the wireless local area network (WLAN) since this is\
    \ the\nprimary form of wireless connectivity for the full-scale\nimplementation\
    \ of the device. One WAP implementation\nwill provide an enhanced wireless network\
    \ range of up to\n0.5 km. Tis system facilitated to improve the labor eﬃ-\nciency,\
    \ water productivity, and water use eﬃciency in cereal\ncrops (i.e., wheat and\
    \ maize) and saved water about 44% in\nthe case of a sprinkler irrigation system.\
    \ It was also con-\ncluded that 20 feet border treatment was better treatment\n\
    than other treatments as agronomic results were better for\nthis treatment, and\
    \ cutoﬀ distance must be between 60 and\n70 percent of total length. Based on\
    \ wireless sensor network\nsystems, diﬀerent opportunities must have been created\
    \ for\nexisting application areas that require real and remote\nsensing data for\
    \ observing consequences. However, these\ntools have possessed many problems that\
    \ must be solved for\na long-time variability of the proposed system. Diﬀerent\n\
    issues like more energy are required for operating sensors\nnodes, development\
    \ issues containing communication, de-\nployment, and protocols. Te problems in\
    \ wireless networks\nwere discussed in the previous work [22, 72] and have been\n\
    addressed to a solution [73, 74]. Tere are some possibilities\nthat strong wind\
    \ also creates some problem in the sensor so\nthere should be robust ﬁtting around\
    \ the sensors to support\nthe nodes. Te advantages and disadvantages of (WSN)\
    \ in\nsensor-based irrigation are discussed in Table 6.\n4.2. Advantages of Automated\
    \ Sprinkler Irrigation. Te\nprimary objective of automated sprinkler irrigation\
    \ is to\nsupply a minimum amount of irrigation water throughout\nthe ﬁelds. Sensor-based\
    \ irrigation has a signiﬁcant poten-\ntiation to save water and increase economic\
    \ eﬃciencies. Te\nmain advantage of this system is to reduce the input cost or\n\

    9\nto increase the yield for the same input. With this irrigation\ntechnology,\
    \ the human intervention must be minimized.\nWith the automated technology of\
    \ irrigation, human in-\ntervention can be reduced [75, 76]. Some advantages of\
    \ this\ninnovation can be discussed as follows.\n4.2.1. Water-Saving Technology.\
    \ Many researchers have\nbeen reported that the intelligence irrigation method\
    \ is the\nideal possible method of accomplishing signiﬁcant water\nsaving [77].\
    \ Muñoz-Carpena and Dukes stated that sprinkler\nirrigation with sensor applications\
    \ could improved the water\neﬃciency up to 80–90% as against 40–45% in the surface\n\
    irrigation method [78]. Blomquist et al. [62] concluded that\n16% of water could\
    \ be saved in this irrigation practice.\n4.2.2. System Cost. Te irrigation system\
    \ is developed with\nthe module design, which helped a lot to reduce the cost.\
    \ Te\nwireless sensor node and actuator node were about 30 US\ndollars, and the\
    \ portable controller was around $100. Te\ntotal cost to build up a wireless ﬁeld\
    \ irrigation system\ndepended on the planting area, and for a case of 5000 m2,\
    \ it\nwas approximately $500 in terms of hardware cost.\n4.2.3. Proﬁt and Yield.\
    \ Proper timing of irrigation is stated\nto be a critical factor in production\
    \ while delaying irrigation\ncan result in losses of between US$ 62/ha and US$\
    \ 300/ha.\n[79]. El-Kader and El-Basioni conducted an experiment on\n[67] potato\
    \ yield measured in Egypt using sensor-based\nnetwork technology. It has been\
    \ conﬁrmed that yields have\nimproved, and a loss of 2 billion pounds has been\
    \ recovered\nin a year. Due to these reasons, the quality of water used is\nreduced\
    \ and the distribution of water is not optimized.\nFarmers irrigate their ﬁelds\
    \ based on their traditional in-\nformation without worrying about soil moisture\
    \ levels, soil\nquality, crop water requirements, and weather forecasting.\n4.3.\
    \ Control Options of Sprinkler Mechanism. During irri-\ngation, the event control\
    \ system is responsible for regulating\nthe speed of sprinkler systems multiple\
    \ times and also moves\nthe sprinkler position at 360° of the ﬁeld, where the\
    \ rate will\nbe changed and decision about more lees or no irrigation\nwater is\
    \ taken. Tis phenomenon would be used where\ndiﬀerent crops are planted in the\
    \ same ﬁeld [80, 81]. A series\nof the on-oﬀ cycle can be used to accomplish the\
    \ water depth\napplication for the individual sprinkler control system\n[82, 83].\
    \ Adjusting the traveling speed of the center pivot\nsprinkler system is the most\
    \ basic method to measure the\nwater depth against ﬁeld topographic, soil condition,\
    \ and\ndiﬀerent crops. Te primary function of center pivot systems\nis to irrigate\
    \ the land from one point in a circle and work on\nthe diﬀerent topography regions\
    \ having a range in soil\ntextures present under a single machine. So that these\
    \ factors\nare the main reasons to use the controller to manage the\nwater application\
    \ in the ﬁeld based upon the need. Site-\nspeciﬁc irrigation and variable rate\
    \ irrigation are the main\nterms that describe the water applications devises\
    \ in order to\nmaximize the yield and economical value for irrigation water\n\
    applied through diﬀerent moving systems [84, 85]. Chavez\net al. reported that,\
    \ for better performance of remote irri-\ngation systems, control and monitoring\
    \ systems are ﬁxed on\ntwo diﬀerent lined moves. A series of in-ﬁeld and onboard\n\
    wireless sensor networks are used to verify the precision\nirrigation systems\
    \ with high accuracy. Separate nozzle\nregulators were pounded according to sanction\
    \ maps\n[86, 87]. Various manifolds attached with diﬀerent sizes of\nsprinkler\
    \ nozzles should be used for accomplishing and\ncontrolling irrigation water application\
    \ depth to ﬂuctuate\nwater and nitrogen application [88, 89]. Usually, open so-\n\
    lenoids were attached with systems to allow the insurance to\nsupply the irrigation\
    \ water even when control systems failed.\nFor controlling irrigation water application,\
    \ a variable ﬂow\nsprinkler was developed by King and Kincaid [90] and Liu\net\
    \ al. [91]. It used the activated pin, which is operated\nmechanically to regulate\
    \ the oriﬁce area of nozzle and\nmainly it depends on operating pressure, and\
    \ the ﬂow rate of\nthe sprinkler is adjusted within the range of 35% to 100%.\n\
    Hydraulic or electric actuators were used to control the pin.\nTe main problem\
    \ is that the droplet size distribution and\nthe wetted pattern are changed with\
    \ ﬂow rate and create a\nuniformity issue with overlapping of the sprinkler pattern\n\
    [92, 93]. 2-3 manifolds were used in these systems, which\nserve to maintain the\
    \ depth of water and water application\nrate.\n5. Summary and Conclusion\nTe objective\
    \ of this research work was to highlight the\ndevelopment of improved agricultural\
    \ monitoring systems\nthat address problems of existing plans, including price,\n\
    availability, and outdoor accessibility. A simple, low-cost,\nsustainable agricultural\
    \ control system that is extremely\ncustomizable and reliable for outdoor use,\
    \ self-powered to\nreduce the need for long power supply cables, while pro-\n\
    viding better functionality that helps to reduce the agri-\ncultural burden and\
    \ promotes crop yields and income, has\nbeen developed. In semiarid regions of\
    \ emerging countries,\nsmall farmers and marginal farmers (who have land b/w 4\n\
    and 6 hectares) are facing many problems regarding pow-\nered irrigation. Most\
    \ of the time, they are relying on seasonal\nprecipitation for their productivity.\

    \ increased the crop productivity. Te WSN\nsystem built in this study oﬀers an\

    has been discussed in this review paper, controlling the\ndiﬀerent irrigation\
    \ management practices by sensing dif-\nferent agriculture parameters such as\
    \ soil moisture, soil pH,\nhumidity, and temperature. Tese systems allow farmers\
    \ to\nmonitor and control their farmland with user friendly\nmobile applications.\

    of intelligent sprinkler irrigation technologies for remote autonomous system
    Xingye Zhu, Prince Chikangaise, Weidong Shi, Wen-Hua Chen, Shouqi Yuan  Abstract  Changing
    of environmental conditions and shortage of water demands a system that can manage
    irrigation efficiently. Autonomous irrigation systems are developed to optimize
    water use for agricultural crops. In dry areas or in case of inadequate rainfall,
    irrigation becomes difficult. So, it needs to be automated for proper yield and
    handled remotely for farmer safety. The aim of this study is to review the needs
    of soil moisture sensors in irrigation, sensor technology and their applications
    in irrigation scheduling and, discussing prospects. The review further discusses
    the literature of sensors remotely communicating with self-propelled sprinkler
    irrigation systems, distributed wireless sensor networks, sensors and integrated
    data management schemes and autonomous sprinkler control options. On board and
    field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation
    management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless
    networks to the main control panel or base computer. Communication systems such
    as cell phones, satellite radios, and internet-based systems are also available
    allowing the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any
    location at any time. Selection of the communication system for remote access
    depends on local and regional topography and cost. Traditional irrigation systems
    may provide unnecessary irrigation to one part of a field while leading to a lack
    of irrigation in other parts. New sensors or remotely sensing capabilities are
    required to collect real time data for crop growth status and other parameters
    pertaining to weather, crop and soil to support intelligent and efficient irrigation
    management systems for agricultural processes. Further development of wireless
    sensor applications in agriculture is also necessary for increasing efficiency,
    productivity and profitability of farming operations. Keywords: intelligent sprinkler

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The Algerian economy is
    currently experiencing a significant deterioration because of its dependence on
    oil revenues, which drops in prices recently. Therefore, it is necessary to revive
    the Algerian economy with other important sectors, mainly agricultural sector
    especially in the south of Algeria. The southern Algeria Contain all necessary
    conditions for agriculture, which are the large agricultural areas, water resources
    and good illumination (sunlight).The mismanagement of irrigation water affects
    negatively the agricultural production of Algeria because of the shortage of irrigation
    water. Thus, with the benefit of the Internet of Things and the smart technologies,
    we will propose in this paper a new strategy for smart irrigation in southern
    Algeria regions, to optimize the water consumption, and to provide a remote control
    and monitoring for the irrigation system. Tests were realized to prove the validity
    of our proposed system by using Contiki-Cooja simulator. Published in: 2015 Fourth

    IEEE Conference Location: Luton, UK SECTION I. Introduction Recently, the Algerian
    economy starts to decline due to the drop in oil prices. The decline in oil prices
    shows the dependence and vulnerability of a system built on the only resource
    of the hydrocarbon sector. In this case, it is urgent to develop other sectors
    of the economy to reduce the dependence on hydrocarbons. Agriculture is a strategic
    and important sector for economic development, especially in southern Algeria.
    This Saharan and semi-arid region has all conditions required for agriculture;
    there are wide agricultural surfaces, sun light and large water resources. Agricultural
    production, including livestock production, consumes more fresh water than any
    other activity in the world. Agricultural irrigation accounts for 85% of the consumed
    fresh water over the planet, and this percentage will continue to be dominant
    in water consumption due to population growth and the increasing of demand for
    food [1]. In general, poor irrigation management affects agricultural production,
    for this purpose it is necessary to develop strategies to optimize irrigation.
    An automated irrigation system is designed to monitor and control the various
    factors derived from an agricultural field such as humidity, water level, temperature,
    and human interaction. This system is generally composed of controllers and a
    wireless sensor network using ZigBee as the transmission technology for detecting
    values of an agricultural field. The sensors gather the various agricultural factors
    in real time and transmit them using Internet of Thing (IoT) applications [2].
    The control architecture of smart agriculture based on cloud computing and IOT
    is presented in [3]. The integration of modern technology in irrigation management
    system is one of the ways to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the
    use of water, electricity consumption and labor costs. In this regard, with the
    new technology and the development of the Internet and the Internet of Things,
    we will propose in this paper a strategy for smart irrigation in southern Algeria
    regions based on the use of the Internet of Things and new communication technologies.
    In this paper, this new scheme proposed for intelligent irrigation using IoT is
    an extension of our already attendant solution [4]. This new mechanism allows
    the farmer to monitor and manage agricultural area using smart phones via Internet.
    The rest of paper is organized as follow: in section 2 we will present generality
    about basic notions of Internet of Things, the section 3 presents current state
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in Algeria, our proposed approach
    will be presented in section 4 and finally, a conclusion and proposed perspectives
    of this work will be presented in section 5. SECTION II. Generality A. Internet
    of Things (IoT) The term “Internet of Things” was first used by the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology in the year 1999[5]. There are several definitions of
    the Internet of Things. Definitions focus on technical aspects of IoT when the
    other based on the applications and functionalities. Some definition defined IoT
    as “an extension of the current Internet to all objects that can communicate directly
    or indirectly with electronic equipment and connected to the Internet”[6]. Other
    defied as “a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of
    modern wireless telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the pervasive
    presence around us of a variety of things or objects - such as Radio-Frequency
    IDentification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. - which, through
    unique addressing schemes, are able to interact with each other and cooperate
    with their neighbors to reach common goals”[7]. B. The Application Domains of
    IoT According to the definition of IoT, this technology can be applied in all
    domains possible but in reality IoT applied in specific domains. We categorize
    this application into four application domains: 1) Daily Life A Smartphone become
    a necessity in our life, several application for Apple iOS, Google Android and
    Windows Phone operating can be used for interfacing sensors measuring various
    parameters, which implies that facilitate the use of the concept of IoT in our
    daily life [8]. The use of IOT in daily live appear in several application such
    as control of home equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, washing
    machines, etc [8]. Sensors and actuators distributed in houses and offices can
    make our life more comfortable in several aspects, and domestic incidents can
    be avoided with appropriate monitoring and alarm systems, etc. [7]. Other application
    necessary of IoT like for losses, IoT can be helped to find objects that we don''t
    remember where have been left. Or in thefts an application similar to the previous
    one may leave the user to know if some objects are moved from a restricted area
    which would indicate that the object is being stolen [7]. 2) Transportation and
    Mobility Transport domain is one of most important domains, and one of the most
    complicated domains. Urban traffic is the main contributor to traffic noise pollution
    and a major contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Traffic congestion directly imposes significant costs on economic and social activities
    in most cities [8]. Advanced cars, trains, buses as well as bicycles along with
    roads and/or rails are becoming more instrumented with sensors, actuators, and
    processing power. Roads themselves are also equipped with tags and sensors that
    send important information to traffic control sites to better route the traffic,
    provide the tourist with appropriate transportation information. In this domain
    exist several applications such us assisted driving offer collision avoidance
    systems and monitoring of transportation of hazardous materials, or mobile ticketing
    and augmented maps [7]. 3) Work Environment In this domain they are several uses
    of IoT such us Industrial plants, enterprise, logistics, etc. Sensors have always
    been a part of the factory setup for security, automation, climate control, etc.
    Which ultimately will be replaced by a wireless system giving the opportunity
    to make changes to the configuration whenever necessary? It is nothing but a subnet
    IoT dedicated to the maintenance of the plant [8]. In industrial plants, IoT also
    contribute to improving the automation of industrial plants with a massive deployment
    of RFID tags associated with production parts. An event is generated by the reader
    with all the necessary data, such as RFID number, and stored on the network. The
    machine / robot is notified by the event and picks up part of the production [7].
    Logistics is a work domain but also attached to the transport domain including
    the management of transport offers good logistics management. With the application
    of IoT can improve these domains to offers the best customer services. 4) Others
    Utilities Other domains are necessary need the IoT as a Healthcare domain, military
    and smart environment, etc. In the military domain smart objects can protect the
    lives of people. In another side many benefits of IoT technologies in healthcare
    and resulting applications can be grouped essentially of: tracking objects and
    people, the identification and authentication of people, automatic data collection
    and sensing of sickness [7]. One of the major IoT application areas that are already
    drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT. There are several test beds being
    implemented and many more planned in the coming years. Other use of the IoT is
    Smart museum and gym and Monitoring environmental parameters. Smart museum and
    gym as to smart leisure environments, the museum and the gym are two representative
    examples where the IoT technologies can help in exploiting their facilities at
    the best. Monitoring environmental parameters perishable goods such as fruits,
    fresh-cut produce, meat, and dairy products are vital parts of our nutrition.
    From the production to the consumption sites thousands of kilometers or even more
    are covered and during the transportation the conservation status need to be monitored
    to avoid uncertainty in quality levels for distribution decisions. Pervasive computing
    and sensor technologies offer great potential for improving the efficiency of
    the food supply chain [3]. C. The Protocols Layer of the IoT Protocols layer of
    the IoT consists of 4 main layers: a) Physical and Data Link Layers The most common
    physical layer protocols used (10,100, 1G) WiFi (802.11b, g, n), GSM, 3G, LTE,
    4G, IEEE 802.15.4, PLC, etc. b) Network Layer The protocols of this layer are
    IPv6, RPL. • Routing Protocol for Low and Lossy Networks (RPL) The Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) formed a new Working Group called ROLL (Routing Over Low-power
    and Lossy networks) in 2008[6] which was defined a new protocol RPL to solve de
    problem of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). Algorithmic and protocolary foundations
    of RPL described in RFC 6550[10]. RPL was developed from four sets of requirements
    that represent the four main foreseen uses of WSN: Home Automation, Building Automation,
    Industrial and Urban environments [15]. RPL is a Distance Vector IPv6 routing
    protocol for LLNs that specifies how to build a Destination Oriented Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DoDAG) using an objective function and a set of metrics/constraints
    [9]. The objective functions to adapt the generic behavior to a particular environment
    and specify more precisely the rules of construction of DoDAG [11]. RPL is based
    on the topological concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The DAG defines
    a tree-like structure that specifies the default routes between nodes in the LLN.
    However, a DAG structure is more than a typical tree in the sense that a node
    might associate to multiple parent nodes in the DAG, in contrast to classical
    trees where only one parent is allowed. More specifically, RPL organizes nodes
    as Destination-Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), where most popular destination nodes (i.e.
    sinks) or those providing a default route to the Internet (i.e. gateways) act
    as the roots of the DAGs. A network may consist of one or several DODAGs, which
    form together an RPL instance identified by a unique ID, called RPLInstanceID.
    RPL defines three types of nodes: Low Power and Lossy Border Routers (LBRs): it
    refers to the root of a DODAG that represents a collection point in the network
    and has the ability to construct a DAG. The LBR also acts as a gateway (or edge
    router) between the Internet and the LLN. Router: it refers to a device that can
    forward and generate traffic. Such a router does not have the ability to create
    a new DAG, but associate to an existing one. Host: it refers to an end-device
    that is capable of generating data traffic, but is not able to forward traffic
    [14]. c) Transport Layer There are two protocols: TCP, UDP. d) Application Layer
    There are several protocols in this layer but the most important protocols are:
    HTTP (TCP), CoAP (UDP). Appear of IoT and the limits of IP architecture obliged
    to define new protocols and an adaptive layer. • Constrained Application Protocol
    CoAP The IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application-layer
    protocol designed to provide a REST-like interface [16]. The CoAP protocol can
    remove HTTP limitations constrained environment while ensuring high compatibility
    with existing. It is relatively easy to turn HTTP requests in CoAP queries. A
    old device connected to an IPv4 network may well request access to a resource
    on a connected server to an IPv6 network and gateway translates between the two
    worlds [11]. Thus the side of a sensor network, we can use the protocol stack
    CoAP / UDP / 6LoWPAN for IPv6 auto configuration properties and the small size
    of the battery, and it will keep the Internet side HTTP stack / TCP / IPv4 which
    is present on all devices. If, for example, an iPhone wants to know the temperature
    measured by a sensor, it will send its HTTP request, it will be transformed into
    CoAP by a bridge, and the answer may be stored for a period specified by the sensor
    in the gateway. If another device on the Internet requires the same value during
    this time interval, it will not be necessary to propagate the query to the sensor
    [11]. • CoAP vs HTTP CoAP is network-oriented protocol, using similar features
    to HTTP but also allows for low overhead, multicast, etc. As HTTP protocol is
    a long-term successful standard, it can use small script to integrate various
    resources and services. Interoperation provided by HTTP is the key point of IoT,
    for this, http is employed in application level. However, HTTP is based on TCP
    protocol using point to point (p2p) communication model that not suitable for
    notification push services. Also, for constrained devices, HTTP is too complex.
    Unlike HTTP based protocols, CoAP operates over UDP instead of using complex congestion
    control as in TCP [12]. CoAP is based on REST architecture, which is a general
    design for accessing Internet resources. In order to overcome disadvantage in
    constrained resource, CoAP need to optimize the length of datagram and provide
    reliable communication. On one side, CoAP provides URI, REST method such as GET,
    POST, PUT, and DELETE. On the other side, based on lightweight UDP protocol, CoAP
    allows IP multicast, which satisfies group communication for IoT. To compensate
    for the unreliability of UDP protocol, CoAP defines a retransmission mechanism
    and provides resource discovery mechanism with resource description [13]. e) A
    Version of IPv6 Adapted to Constrained Networks 6LoWPAN In 2005, the IETF chartered
    the IPv6 over Low Power, Wireless Networks (6LoWPAN) working group to standardize
    adaptations oflPv6 over mesh networks composed of low-power, wireless links [9].
    The difference in size of the package IPv6 and datagram of IEEE 802.15.4 obliged
    6LoWPAN group to define encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow
    IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks.
    SECTION III. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Algeria Algeria
    wants to position itself as one of the strongholds of the wireless Internet in
    the Maghreb. The development of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability
    for Microwave Access) is a wireless data transmission standard, with a theoretical
    speed of 70 megabits per second, the equivalent of hundreds of ADSL (Asymmetric
    Digital Subscriber Line) connections with range of 50 kilometers. This wireless
    radio technology that aims to connect any wireless equipment: access points Wi-Fi,
    IP phone, mobile phone. The commercialization of wireless telephony in fixed mode
    (4G LTE) has just started through all the capitals of the 48 provinces of the
    country with a gradual roll in each province. This new generation of wireless
    technology used in the majority of developed countries to provid users a remote
    and speed access to the Internet that not depend on fixed phone lines as ADSL
    and with a higher performance, as the incumbent Algeria Telecom has launched this
    technology. Choosing the 4G LTE was motivated to its flexibility, easy to deploy
    and competitiveness. SECTION IV. Our Approach A. The System Design The communications
    technologies in the Internet of Things is developing rapidly in recent years so
    it can meet the demands of the connections between the physical world “things”
    and “human”. Thus, the use of smartphones helps to handle remote objects via Internet.
    Our approach proposed in this paper is mainly based on our system for irrigation
    shown in [4]. The difference is that here we have used the technologies of the
    Internet of things for smart irrigation management in southern Algeria via the
    Internet, and using smart phones. As shown in figure 1, this system consists of:
    wireless sensor network system, the 6LoWPAN smart gateway that connects the Zigbee
    network with the internet via mobile communication network (4G LTE). The sensors
    placed in the agricultural field, measure continuously the soil moisture values,
    the water tank level and the water well level, then send these values through
    a ZigBee mesh network to a smart gateway (Generic IoT Border Router Wireless Br
    1000), those information are then sent via a mobile data communication 4G LTE
    network to a web service that uses intelligent software application to automatically
    analyze the data and act according to the obtained results, by selective activation
    of controllers as needed. The routing protocol used in this proposed design is
    the RPL protocol. The outputs results and irrigation recommendations are presented
    to the user on a smart phone web application using CoAP or HTTPs interfaces. Our
    system focuses on the following performance objectives to ensure its widespread
    adoption by farmers: The system is easy to deploy, to use, and facilitates planning
    of irrigation tasks. The system is modular and flexible, making it easy to maintain
    The system design is robust and reliable. Fig. 1. The system design. Show All
    The Smart gateway connects the two parts of our system (the first part: the wireless
    sensor networks and controllers, the second parts: is the internet and smartphones),
    it is the 6LoWPAN Border Router translates between the two standardized protocol
    stacks. In addition it is an application level gateway for other IoT protocols
    such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, and ZigBee. WLAN or LTE may be used for
    the uplink to the Internet [17]. B. Communication in Our System The network of
    our system consists of several tiny devices (sensors, microcontrollers, smart
    gateway) that communicate with themselves via a Low and Lossy networks (LLNs),
    using the routing protocol dedicated to this type of network called RPL (Routing
    protocol for Low and Lossy networks). This LLN network is connected to the internet
    by a smart 6lowpan gateway that represents the root of the RPL, as it shown in
    figure 2. The construction of DODAG involves two phases. Phase 1. Creating the
    up paths (from the root to the nodes): The smart gateway sends a DIO message (DAG
    Information Object) to its neighbors which are (coordinators nodes, sensors detection
    of the water level and the controller of the electric pump) for the construction
    of DODAG. Each one of these neighbors in turn send a DIO message to its neighbors
    in each irrigation area for the creation of the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph).
    Phase 2. Creating the down paths (from the nodes to the root): Each node in the
    network when receiving the DIO Message send a DAO message (Destination Advertisement
    Object) to its root for creating paths to the root and filling tables routing.
    The soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture, these values must be sent to
    the root nodes of sub-DAGs (coordinators nodes). Each soil moisture sensor sends
    the measured values to his favorite parent until the reception of these values
    by the coordinator node, this latter calculates the average of the received values
    and send them to the smart gateway. Fig. 2. The system communication. Show All
    The sensors detection of the water level measure the water level in the well and
    in the tank, also send these measured values to the smart gateway. The smart gateway
    sends the received values (soil moisture values and water level values) via a
    mobile communication network (4G LTE) to the farmer. The farmer can check the
    soil moisture values, and also water level in the tank and in the well with smart
    phone application that connect directly to the smart gateway using http or CoAP
    protocols. Therefore, the farmer may decide either the irrigation of dry areas
    or filling the tank by sending a response to the gateway, which represent an intermediate
    that send this response to the coordinator node in order to control the opening
    and closing of the solenoid valves or to electric pump controller in order to
    activate or deactivate the electric pump in the well according to the specific
    needs. In the case where the values of soil moisture or the values of the water
    level in the tank are critical which means that areas are dry or the water level
    in the tank is minimum, our system will automatically pass to standalone mode
    (our proposed system in [4]), which makes our system tolerant to faults. SECTION
    V. Simulation and Discussion of Result In order to validate the Performance of
    our approach by simulation, we use Cooja simulator provided by Contiki, which
    unlike most simulators also allows real hardware platforms to be emulated [18].
    This simulation is about how the network converged and stabilized using the RPL
    protocol and OFO implementation of ContikiRPL. The simulation scripts consists
    of RPL sender nodes and LLN Border Router (LBR) programs which are emulated as
    Tmote sky nodes and derived from Cooja and uIPv6 module including UDP, ICMPv6,
    IPv6, SICSLoWPAN and Rime of the Contiki kernel [19] [20]. With the help of the
    CollectView tool [21] provided by Cooja, the following metrics could be observed:
    The time taken to find the first source-destination pair in the whole network;
    The time taken for the network to fully converge when all nodes join the network
    tree; The time taken for the network to fully stabilize after convergence, the
    time taken for the Estimated Transmission Count (ETX) value for each node. As
    shown in figure 3, our network consists of 15 RPL nodes; deployed in an irrigation
    land which composed of 3 areas, where each area consist of 4 RPL sender nodes,
    and the RPL sender nodes in the tank and in the well, all these nodes are connected
    to The RPL border router, and this router is used in order to interface a regular
    IP network with an RPL 6LoWPAN network. Fig. 3. The network simulation in cooja.
    Show All Figures 4 and 5, presents the network tree and the communication between
    DAGs roots (node 2.2, node 3.3, node 4.4, node 5.5, node 6.6) and DODAG root (RPL
    border router node 1.1). Fig. 4. Communication between nodes. Show All Fig. 5.
    The network tree. Show All All data collected by the wireless sensor network are
    used by the system to handle an intelligent, automated irrigation of vegetation
    (by saving water and energy use) and can be accessed in real time via a web application
    in smartphones, which can also send alerts and commands when the ground is too
    dry or a lack of water in the basin and offer suggestions to maximize plant health.
    These first results obtained by simulation using the Cooja simulator are satisfactory,
    especially in routing information by RPL and COAP protocols. This will encourage
    us to go further towards creating a web application in smartphones to complete
    all the proposed system and facilitate the tasks of the farmers for a good monitoring
    of their agriculture. Also, we hope that this approach will be very beneficial
    if we can experiment it in the fields of agriculture especially in Saharan and
    arid areas such as the south of Algeria. SECTION VI. Conclusion The intelligent
    technologies play a very important role for an effective management of irrigation,
    we have proposed in this article a smart irrigation system for a Saharan area
    like the south of Algeria. This proposed system is based on ICT and IoT technologies.
    Using these technologies, the control of irrigation will be ensured at low cost
    and high accuracy. Our proposed system facilitates the irrigation tasks and optimizes
    the costs in term of minimizing the water consummation and reducing the cost of
    the working force. The validation of the proposed approach by simulation showed
    us the value and the importance of the adoption of WSN and IoT technologies in
    precision farming. As a perspective we plan to complete the implementation of
    our system using the CoAP protocol and web application for monitoring the irrigation
    via the internet using IoT, and also to apply this system in real world. Authors

    Abstract Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) based sensing systems have improved
    capabilities to precisely monitor environmental conditions. Plants are sessile
    organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding
    environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation,
    and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems)
    of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision
    agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication
    aspects of the WSN''s, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components
    for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured.
    The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access,
    and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed
    sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a
    framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement
    (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing
    system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities
    such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement
    estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management. Also, the modeling
    techniques were integrated with the interoperable web-enabled sensing system for
    addressing water management problems of horticultural crops in semi-arid areas.

    Sensor Network 1. Introduction Agriculture is an important sector which drives
    the economy and food security of many nations. Various kinds of sensing systems
    are emerging in the area of precision agriculture in which the current trend is
    towards the design and development of cost-effective, energy efficient and fault
    tolerant Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for various monitoring and management
    applications. The focus of recent research is on improving and sustaining the
    productivity of different crops. Current advances in Information Communication
    and Dissemination Technologies (ICDT''s) have well proven their ability in information
    and knowledge dissemination. Globally, the ICDT initiatives in the field of agriculture
    have shown that with accurate monitoring and analysis of crop/weather parameters,
    it is possible to judiciously allocate available resources in agriculture (Nash
    et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2010, Prabhakar et al., 2010, Li et al., 2011). Several
    WSNs are being deployed in many countries, and have a wide range of applications
    in agriculture, such as: • Crop/pest disease monitoring (Riquelme et al., 2009,
    Tripathy et al., 2011). • Crop water management (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, uAgri C-DAC, 2013, Sudharsan et al., 2012, Ojha et al., 2015). •
    Crop yield prediction (Honda et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011). • Weather
    based advisory services (IMD, 2016, ISRO, 2015, mKRISHI, 2016). In general, several
    dissemination systems are currently being deployed, which enables the discovery,
    access and retrieval of various meteorological, biophysical, ocean and coastal
    water quality parameters. This kind of systems can be divided into two types:
    (1) Stovepipe or standalone systems which provide sensor details (i.e. metadata,
    observations and measurements) in their own formats (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, Riquelme et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011, Sudharsan et al.,
    2012, Tripathy et al., 2011, Ojha et al., 2015). (2) Interoperable systems and
    platforms which implement commonly agreed standards for sensor metadata, observation
    and measurement representation (Korduan et al., 2004, Murakami et al., 2007, Mizoguchi
    et al., 2008, Nash et al., 2009, Durbha et al., 2010, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Bröring
    et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2011b, Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Jazayeri et al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015, Du et al., 2016,
    Geipel et al., 2016). However, there is a paucity of standards driven, interoperable
    systems in the Agriculture domain that severely impedes the discovery and access
    of data across Agri-WSN''s. For example, to answer a question such as “What is
    the crop water requirement during a particular crop growth stage?, there is a
    need for weather parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, solar
    radiation, wind speed, and rainfall. from weather station and crop growth stage
    information from field/cultivation practice. It''s hard for users from diverse
    areas of study to understand the exact lineage of the collected data i.e. how
    the measurement is transformed into an observation. It is possible that the measurement
    has gone through various transformations (e.g. application calibration curves),
    which can also give rise to heterogeneous data formats (Comma Separated Values
    (CSV), Tab Separated Values (TSV), EXtensible Markup Language (XML), etc.). With
    this ever increasing spread of WSNs, there is a need for standard sets of specifications
    (both syntactic and semantic) and encodings to bring multiple sensor networks
    on a common platform (Durbha et al., 2010, Bröring et al., 2011a, Patil et al.,
    2012, Liang and Huang, 2013). Which enables the development of geographically
    distributed systems that are standardized at the semantic (Folmer and Verhoosel,
    2011, Compton et al., 2012) and Syntactic (Bröring et al., 2011b) level for regional
    agricultural practices planning (i.e. irrigation, pest/disease management, etc.).
    The initiatives such as, FOODIE: Farm-Oriented Open Data in Europe (Esbri et al.,
    2014), GeoCENS: Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for the World-Wide Sensor Web (Liang
    and Huang, 2013), Sensor Asia (Mizoguchi et al., 2008) and Service Oriented Architecture
    for sensor data discovery in agriculture (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Chen et al., 2015), are some of the attempts towards facilitating the interoperability
    and sensor data discovery. These studies have shown the utility of Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) specified Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standards for sensor
    data access from geographically distributed sensing systems (OGC, 2016, Bröring
    et al., 2012, Bröring et al., 2011a). Keeping in view of the requirement of a
    sensing and analysis platform in the ever increasing precision agriculture area,
    the specific objectives of this paper are: • to design a sensor platform (hardware)
    with integrated SWE architecture for precision agro-meteorological monitoring
    • to integrate the OGC''s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards to achieve interoperability
    and scalability of heterogeneous sensing systems • to demonstrate the utility
    of such interoperable sensing systems for agro-meteorological monitoring and potential
    evapotranspiration estimation. This paper is organized into various sections:
    Section 2 describes the design of sensor platform (hardware) and integration of
    sensor web architecture (software) for agriculture monitoring. A case study on
    the application of interoperable sensor system for crop water requirement analysis
    is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents results and discussions on the integrated
    sensor web system and its utility for crop water requirement analysis. Section
    5 concludes with a comparison between current SWE initiatives for precision agriculture
    and a description of the future work. 2. Materials and methods The sensor web
    enablement framework of the agro-meteorological observation and analysis platform
    consists of three layers: (1) Sensing systems, (2) Sensor Web Enablement (middleware)
    and (3) Web based visualization layer (Fig. 1). Below is a description of each

    heterogeneous sensing systems (i.e. a set of standalone and interoperable sensing
    platforms). 2.1.1. Development of an interoperable sensing platform An interoperable
    wireless sensing system (henceforth called as SenseTube) has been designed using
    low powered System on Chip (SoC) single board computer (i.e. Raspberry Pi/R-Pi,
    Raspberry Pi (2016)) as a data collection and dissemination platform (Fig. 2a)
    (Sawant et al., 2015). Multiple sensor nodes (child nodes) can be interfaced with
    the SenseTube base station. Download : Download high-res image (226KB) Download

    block diagram and (b) interoperable sensor data communication architecture. Field
    level node to node communication has been established using Wi-Fi (i.e. IEEE 108.11)
    communication protocol (Fig. 2b) (Sawant et al., 2015). The General Purpose Input
    Output (GPIO) pins of SoC hardware are utilized to connect the Analog to Digital
    Converter (ADC), and through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) the data is collected.
    The ADC has eight analog channels for connecting external sensors. The resolution
    of ADC is 10 bit thereby facilitating to interface analog sensors such as temperature,
    and humidity. The digital (raw) voltage observations collected from ADC are converted
    into physical measurements and stored onboard. The sensor sampling and polling
    frequency can be adjusted through the configuration interface. The default sampling
    interval has been set to fifteen minutes and polling frequency to one hour. The
    sensing system comprises of sensor node collecting observations at fixed interval.
    The sensing system can be configured as a base station and child node. When set
    as base station sensor node receive observations and measurements from distributed
    child nodes and transmit over remote address/service. The child node configuration
    provides a capability to receive and locally transfer sensor observations and
    measurements to the base station. Table 1 lists sensing system configurations
    for interoperable sensing system (SenseTube). Table 1. Sensing system configuration.
    SN Configuration parameter System configuration 1. Resolution Analog to Digital
    Convertor (ADC) 10 bit 2. Number of analog channels 8 channels 3. Sampling frequency
    15 min 4. Polling frequency 1 h Existing infrastructure of Internet Service Providers
    (ISP''s) has been utilized in the present study for internet connectivity. Normally,
    the ISP''s dynamically assign Internet Protocol (IP) address to the field based
    sensing system, this configuration brings out two cost-effective approaches to
    communicate with the data processing layer: (1) through Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) server configured on fixed IP addressed remote/cloud service platform (Liu,
    2000), (2) using cost-effective cloud service (e.g. ownCloud, Dropbox, etc.) which
    is easily accessible to both the field based sensing system and remote/cloud based
    data processing server (ownCloud, 2016, Dropbox, 2016). Direct reliable and secure
    access to SWE sensing platform facilitate the on-board data processing (i.e. estimate
    reference evapotranspiration, daily minimum/maximum temperature, humidity, etc.).
    The remote/cloud based data processing server can access the field nodes using
    SWE requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation detailed
    information about communication between field based interoperable sensing systems,
    and sensor data storage and data analysis layer (middleware) is described in the
    subsequent section. 2.1.2. Existing standalone sensing systems Various studies
    have provided methodologies for SWE of standalone (the sensing systems which provide
    sensor details in their formats) sensing systems (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015). A wrapper (a piece of software
    to transform sensor observations) is necessary to make standalone sensing system
    into OGC standardized, interoperable sensing system. The method for design of
    Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) proposed by Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012 has been used for regional Automatic Weather Station (AWS). This methodology
    facilitates the integration of standalone AWS into interoperable sensor web layer.
    2.2. Sensor web enablement layer (Middleware) The SWE layer provides sensor data
    polling and processing facility. The OGC standards such as SOS, Observations and
    Measurements (O&M), Sensor Model Language (Sensor ML), and Web Processing Service
    (WPS) are used to establish communication between sensing systems and client interface.
    2.2.1. Background 2.2.1.1. Sensor model language The Sensor ML has the primary
    objective to provide a robust and semantically-tied means of defining processes
    and processing components associated with the measurement and post-measurement
    transformation of observations. This includes sensors and actuators as well as
    computational processes applied pre- and post-measurement (Botts and Robin, 2007).
    In sensor web enablement architecture shown in Fig. 1, SensorML encoding is used
    to define each sensor of the sensing system. The sensor details include observed
    property, transducer information, manufacturer, geographical location, etc. The
    detailed description about sensor Observations and Measurements is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.2.1.2. Observations and measurements The OGC O&M standard
    specifies an XML implementation for the OGC and ISO Observations and Measurements
    (O&M) conceptual model, including a schema for sampling features. The O&M encoding
    is an essential dependency for the SOS interface standard as it defines XML schemas
    for observations and for features involved in sampling when making observations
    (Cox, 2011). The O&M specifications are used to formulate the response to the
    GetObservation request which is comprised of observed properties and constrained
    by observation schema definitions (Fig. 1). The GetObservation request states
    the feature of interest with begin and end timestamp and observed properties.
    The details of SOS component is described in subsequent section. 2.2.1.3. Sensor
    observation service The OGC SOS standard defines a web service interface which
    allows querying observations, sensor metadata, as well as representations of observed
    features. Further, this standard defines means to register new sensors and to
    remove existing ones. Also, it defines operations to insert new sensor observations
    (Bröring et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2012, Na and Priest, 2007). The SOS stores
    time series sensor observations in a relational database and facilitates the formulation
    of response for various requests (DescribeSensor, GetObservation, InsertObservation,
    etc.). Fig. 1 shows the integration of all sensor observations into SOS relational
    database. 2.2.1.4. Sensor event service (SES) The SES provides the user an interface
    to access sensor data and measurements (Chandy and Schulte, 2007, Echterhoff and
    Ingo, 2010). The SES facilitates user to subscribe for the particular sensor or
    set threshold value/s and enable notifications about selected phenomenon (e.g.
    event notifications are triggered on depletion of soil moisture to the set threshold
    i.e. allowable depletion). It also provides methods to dynamically add new sensors
    and send notifications to the service (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (108KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Architecture of sensor event
    notification service. 2.2.1.5. Web processing service The WPS interface standard
    provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses)
    for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, the daily mean of
    sensor observation time series, etc. The standard also defines how a client can
    request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled
    (Mueller and Pross, 2015). Fig. 1 shows the core WPS requests i.e. GetCapabilities,
    DescribeProcess, and ExecuteProcess. The GetCapabilities request provides information
    about available processes (e.g. a process to estimate root-zone soil moisture
    storage based on soil moisture sensor observations). The DescribeProcess provides
    details about selected process. For example, the process for estimation of root-zone
    soil moisture storage requires, input (i.e. time series observations from soil
    moisture in date and float data type) and output (i.e. estimated soil moisture
    storage time series of date and float data type) parameters. The ExecuteProcess
    handles actual computation defined by process and output results are provided
    in response. The detailed description of each component of SWE layer is described
    in subsequent section. 2.2.2. Architecture of SWE layer The Architecture of SWE
    layer comprises of, an SWE web services module (e.g. Sensor Observation Service
    version 1.0) for data query and access, Sensor Alerts and Notification (e.g. Sensor
    Event Notification Service) based on pre-defined parameter thresholds and rules
    and Sensor data archival module. These various components run in parallel with
    the supporting functionalities (Fig. 1) as discussed below: SWE Web services module
    maps the details about each sensing system using Sensor ML. The O&M standards
    are used for encoding the observations (e.g. observed values, observed property,
    references to feature and procedure, time stamps, etc.). For example in case of
    air temperature sensor, O&M standards are used to represent parameters such as
    observed values (i.e. actual sensor observations), observed property (i.e. identification
    of observed property air temperature), feature of interest and procedure (i.e.
    identification of associated feature with procedure), time stamp (i.e. time at
    which observation is collected), and offerings. The user interactions are handled
    through SOS requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation
    (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (530KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Sequence diagram representing interactions among various components
    of sensor web enabled service platform. The SOS GetObservation request specifies
    the sensor offering (i.e. sensor system), O&M sampling time, observed property
    and response format (Fig. 5a). The GetObservation response returns the location
    of the feature of interest (i.e. sensor) and observation collection for specified
    time interval (Fig. 5b). Details about Sensor Alerts and Notification are discussed
    in subsequent section. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download

    high-res image (383KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5b. Snippet of
    SOS GetObservation response. Sensor Alerts and Notification provides capabilities
    to report the sensor observations over email, social network site such as Twitter
    (2016). The main advantages of this functionality are (a) observations from sensing
    system are available on user''s social web page/account without maintaining a
    separate database on cloud service and (b) as observations are directly posted/updated
    on social media the latency in information dissemination are significantly reduced.
    The critical information about events such as sudden increase in temperature,
    and drop in relative humidity below a certain level can be effectively notified
    to the user''s/stakeholders thereby ensuring the initiation of quick response
    for mitigation of effects of these events. Social network tweet capability is
    configured to one hour in sensing system (Fig. 4). In future, the event notification
    service can be improved by incorporating the OGC publish/subscribe interface standard
    (Braeckel et al., 2016). The data from heterogeneous sensing systems is collected
    and organized in SOS complaint format by sensor data polling process. To continuously
    update the state of service the data polling process executes SOS request GetCapabilities
    and InsertObservation. As internet connectivity (GSM/GPRS network) at the test
    site (remote villages) widely varies, the process of sensor data polling is independently
    maintained, which ensures communication with all remote sensor systems. The data
    polling frequency can be configured to any duration, and it has been set to one
    hour in the present study. The size of text data transferred per sensing system
    during each polling event ranges between 1 and 1.5 kilobytes (Fig. 4). The request
    specific algorithms required for sensor data processing (e.g. daily minimum and
    maximum temperature calculation, reference evapotranspiration estimation, etc.)
    are maintained using WPS. In this study, existing implementations of the OGC SWE
    and WPS provided by OSGeo community are used (OSGeo, 2017). The OGC SOS standard
    version 1.0 implementation provided by istSOS is used, the architecture is also
    tested with OGC SOS standard version 2.0 (istSOS, 2017). Major differences identified
    between the SOS version 1.0 and 2.0 during preliminary tests of SenseTube interoperable
    sensing and analysis platform are: (a) each observation offering is limited to
    associated with only a single procedure (i.e. one to one constraint). In SenseTube
    platform, multiple procedures (e.g. for temperature sensor associated ADC values
    and observations) were stored as a single offering which caused issues while retrieving
    only the sensor observations. This improved specification for observation offerings
    in SOS 2.0 facilitated identification of correct procedure and removed ambiguity
    in obtaining the observations. (b) The improved specification for temporal and
    spatial filters added in the GetObservation request of SOS 2.0 has facilitated
    the effective retrieval of sensor observations. For example, to estimate reference
    ET for long duration (i.e. quarterly/monthly time interval) would require the
    retrieval of a large number of sensor observations. The updated temporal filters
    in SOS 2.0 enable to divide the request into smaller chunks thereby reducing memory
    overloads. The spatial filters are used to identify the nearest AWS and SenseTube
    observations to validate the observed and model estimated soil moisture and temperature.
    (c) In SOS 2.0, the response format conversion (serialization) is loosely coupled
    and can be moved from server side to client side; this helps in reducing processing
    overhead. In the long-term deployment with very high sensor sampling frequency
    this improved specification would help in reducing the energy footprint of SenseTube
    sensing and analysis platform. The OGC WPS version 2.0 implementation PyWPS 4.0
    is used (PyWPS, 2017). The SOS and WPS implementations are selected mainly because
    of lightweight Python based implementation on single board computer. The proposed
    methodology provides the on-board implementation of SWE and attempts towards independent
    hardware or software implementation. The web/mobile user interacts with SWE layer
    through SOS and WPS requests handled by the interoperable thin client. The detailed
    explanation about a web based client and SWE service platform is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.3. Web based visualization layer A web based thin client
    has been designed to establish seamless communication between the SWE processes
    and user/stakeholder. In this study thin client has been designed for user e.g.
    farmer, researcher, etc. The OGC specified standards such as SOS, WPS and third
    party Web Map Service (WMS) are the primary access point of the web based thin
    client. The service architecture can also facilitate machine to machine interaction
    through process sharing and seamless data access (this study do not cover the
    details about machine to machine communication). Designed thin client acts as
    a gateway interface to the SWE architecture, and it hides the complexities of
    sensing systems from the end user (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image

    WMS layer. Fig. 6 shows snapshots of modules of web based thin client, (1) details
    about sensing system and capabilities, (2) sensor observations in a chart and
    table format, and (3) sensor observations over third party WMS layer (e.g. Open
    Street Map, Google Map, Bing Map, etc.). The client is interoperable with any
    SOS, WPS based sensing system. The first module provides basic information about
    service platform facilitating the details about geographic location, manufacturer,
    the number of sensors on sensing system, etc. (Fig. 6a). This information leads
    to the further query about details of each procedure and identifies the exact
    feature of interest e.g. air temperature, relative humidity, etc. Also, it provides
    details about each observed property and its associated sensor lineage e.g. minimum/maximum
    range, observed property, time of first and recent observation insert into SOS,
    etc. The sensor data access and visualization are important for any sensing system,
    particularly to the novice farming community. Sensor data observation module of
    the interoperable client comprises filter (e.g. date, time, sensor id, etc.) based
    sensor data querying mechanism. The user can select any sensor from selected sensing
    system and visualize the observations in table and chart format, and also facilitate
    the sensor data download in comma separated variable (CSV) format (Fig. 6b and
    c). The sensor observations are overlaid on third party WMS layer to understand
    the geospatial location and details of observed phenomenon (Fig. 6d). We have
    designed a web based thin client (i.e. interoperable web client) in PHP and Python
    programming language and it''s available for download on GitHub URL''s https://github.com/suryakant54321/sos-client-in-php
    and https://github.com/suryakant54321/Python-SOS-Client. A case study on agro-meteorological
    monitoring and potential evapotranspiration estimation have been discussed below
    to understand the need and utility of interoperable sensing systems. 3. A case
    study on application of SOA for citrus crop water requirement estimation A major
    Citrus (Orange/Mandarin) growing region in the semi-arid tropical region was selected
    to demonstrate the need and utility of SWE in agriculture. The details about study
    area, deployment of interoperable sensing system and estimation of agro-meteorological
    parameters are described in subsequent section. 3.1. Study area and field deployment
    of sensing system Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, India experiences severe climatic
    uncertainties (uneven rainfall and severe heat) thereby giving rise to crop failure.
    The area receives rainfall during southwest monsoon. The average annual rainfall
    ranges between 700 and 800 mm. The maximum temperature during summer recorded
    up to 46 °C while the minimum temperature during winter drops to about 5 °C (GSDA,
    2016). Wheat and Gram are major irrigated crops; Cotton, Jowar (Sorghum) and Toor
    (Pigeon Pea) are major non-irrigated crops; Orange, Cotton, and Groundnut are
    major cash crops cultivated in the region. The harvesting of Orange takes place
    in two fruiting seasons Ambiya (November-December) and Mrig (February-March).
    As per ground water resource estimates, Warud is categorized as one of the three
    over-exploited groundwater resources regions (tahsils) of Amravati district (CGWB,
    2007). The main reasons for selection of this study area to study the prospects
    of Sensor Web Enablement for irrigation management in agriculture are (a) the
    problem of ground water table depletion is more prominent in this region (NRAA,
    2011). (b) the groundwater is a major source of irrigation for Orange cultivation
    of this region and it is adversely affected due to improper irrigation practices
    (NRAA, 2011), (c) Orange crop diseases have a very close relation with poor drainage
    and excess irrigation (Grimm and Timmer, 1981). The soil-borne crop disease infestation
    is caused due to unavailability of right information on stage-wise crop water
    requirement. For initial test deployment of sensing system Orange orchard from
    Nagziri village from Warud tahsil has been selected. The World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) guidelines for automatic weather station deployment are considered
    for sensor placement in SenseTube sensing system (WMO, 2012). Two each temperature
    and relative humidity sensors are placed at 5 m (above at top of canopy) and 2.5
    m (within the canopy) from ground. Two soil temperature and one soil moisture
    sensors are placed at 15, 30 and 30 cm depth, respectively at a radial distance
    of 5 m from the Orange tree. Remaining ADC channel was closed using pull-down
    resistor (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (212KB) Download : Download

    ease in wire connection and placement of entire module on the base structure.
    The sensor observations are continuously being polled using data polling process
    (Fig. 4) since the date of field deployment (16 Feb. 2014). To monitor the state
    of the sensing system, SES (sensor Twitter feed KrishiSense) has been configured
    to upload two sensor tweets per event. Considering the character restriction of
    a tweet, each event consists of timestamp and value of recorded phenomenon. The
    URL to access sensor system Twitter feed is “https://twitter.com/KrishiSense”.
    3.2. Reference evapotranspiration estimation Widely used reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) estimation equations i.e. FAO Penman-Monteith (ETo PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (ETo Harg) (Allen et al., 1998) were used in order to understand
    seasonal variation in crop water requirement of orange crop grown and to study
    the feasibility of SenseTube sensing system for field level agro-meteorological
    monitoring and analysis. ETo estimations were performed for both AWS and SenseTube
    weather observations. The equation for estimation of ETo by Penman-Monteith (Allen
    et al., 1998) method is given as, (1) where Δ is slope of saturation vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), Rn is net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), G is
    soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), Ta is mean daily air temperature at 2 m
    height (°C), U2 is wind speed at 2 m height (m/s), es is the saturation vapour
    pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapour pressure (kPa), (es − ea) is the saturation
    vapour pressure deficit (kPa) and γ is psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1). The
    equation for estimation of ETo by Hargreaves (Allen et al., 1998) method is given
    as, (2) where Tmean mean daily air temperature (°C), Tmax is maximum daily air
    temperature (°C), Tmin is minimum daily air temperature (°C) and Ra is extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm day−1). 4. Results and discussions The agro-meteorological observations
    recorded by SenseTube sensing system during one cropping season of Orange i.e.
    July 2014 to August 2015, locally known as Mrig (July-February) and Ambiya (March-October)
    flowering (locally called bahar), are used for the study. The sampling (for air
    temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture) and polling (data
    update to the remote server) frequency were set to fifteen minutes and one hour,
    respectively. In order to compare the performance of SenseTube sensing system,
    a commercially available Automatic Weather Station (AWS) was set in the study
    area. The AWS has been set up according to World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
    guidelines for automatic weather station installation (WMO, 2012). The spatial
    distance between both sensing systems is less than one kilometer. The daily variations
    in air temperature (°C) at test site are shown in Fig. 8. Ranges of daily minimum
    and maximum temperature at the test bed during the said period were observed to
    be 6.44–34.09 °C and 20.30–46.73 °C, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    by AWS. The composite plot in Fig. 10 shows daily soil temperature observed by
    SenseTube and rainfall events observed by AWS. The soil temperature at 30 cm depth
    varies between 23 °C and 32 °C. It can be observed that there is a steady change
    in soil temperature and rainfall events have very low impact on the change in
    soil temperature at depth of 30 cm. Observed soil temperature shows seasonality
    with the return period of the year which closely resembles with variations in
    surface air temperature. Fig. 11 shows daily volumetric soil moisture at 30 cm
    depth observed by soil moisture sensor mounted on SenseTube. The variations in
    soil moisture are observed to be corresponding rainfall events. The minor variations
    in soil moisture during the absence of rainfall event are caused by irrigation
    events. In selected citrus orchard drip irrigation systems are functional during
    the crop growth period. The volumetric minimum and maximum soil moisture content
    were 12.04% and 48.77%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (445KB)

    are available, whereas ETo Harg was obtained with AWS and SenseTube system as

    comparison. The results show that for most of the period SenseTube based ETo Harg
    underestimates than ETo PM (Fig. 12). The close vicinity of crop canopy and variations
    in field level relative humidity may have caused overestimates of SenseTube based

    proposed SWE hardware and software architecture has unique features over existing
    implementations. The major advantages of proposed SWE architecture are, • Scalability:
    the proposed sensor web enablement architecture based on heterogeneous sensing
    systems provides the ability to seamlessly connect with multiple sensor nodes.
    • On the fly data processing: dense observations of agro-meteorological parameters
    with seamless data access facilitate important decisions regarding irrigation
    interval and depth. • Distributed computing: design of web enabled client has
    a unique advantage for distributed computing of domain specific environmental
    and crop parameters. With evolving OGC SWE specifications there are few limitations
    in the integrated architecture. Some of the major limitations of proposed SWE
    architecture are, • Scaling up estimates from point to region: the proposed SWE
    architecture needs to be configured with OGC Web Feature Service and Web Coverage
    Service to scale-up actual ET estimates at field level. • Need for sensor plug-n-play:
    significant improvements in analog multi-bus (Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C),
    Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), RS485, RS232, etc.) sensor hardware connection
    needs to be integrated on sensing system hardware. • Public availability of sensor
    observations: very few public, private organizations are providing sensor observations
    in OGC O&M specifications which impose limitations on the utility of service oriented
    architectures. However, there is need to compare the studies based on SWE for
    precision agriculture. Comparison of available studies based on selected features
    is discussed in subsequent section. 4.2. Comparison between SWE studies Available
    published studies on SWE architectures for precision agriculture application are
    studied based on features proposed by Chen et al. (2015). The proposed features
    of SWE are architecture, sensors supported, data sharing, process sharing, services
    involved, data model, validation and complexity. In this study two additional
    features were identified for comparison of SWE implementation, (1) sensor plug-n-play
    and (2) SWE integration on hardware. The sensor plug-n-play feature describes
    implementation of OGC PUCK Protocol Standard ensuring seamless integration of
    sensors. Feature on SWE integration with hardware was identified to ensure the
    seamless communication between standardized web-enabled hardware platforms (Table
    2). Table 2. Comparison of SWE based architectures. Empty Cell Features Empty

    (2015). 2. The features marked by double asterisk (**) symbol are newly added.
    3. The fields marked by right (√) represents available and cross (×) represents
    not available. Table 2 shows a comparison between various SWE implementations
    in precision agriculture application. The SOA proposed by Korduan et al., 2004,
    Murakami et al., 2007, Nash et al., 2009, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Patil et al.,
    2012, Sawant et al., 2012 primarily focus on SWE of existing sensing systems/platforms.
    Whereas, SOA proposed by Liang and Huang, 2013, Geipel et al., 2016, Chen et al.,
    2015, Du et al., 2016 integrate SWE on hardware layer of sensing system/platform.
    The OGC SWE standards are evaluated for their usability and applicability in precision
    agriculture application. The scalability of proposed architecture is facilitated
    by O&M, SensorML and SOS standards. On the fly data processing and distributed
    computing is facilitated by WPS standard. Integrated geospatial information with
    sensor observations facilitates spatio-temporal estimation of the critical agro-meteorological
    parameter. On-board implementation of the SWE framework facilitates ease in acquiring
    processed information at client interface which has potential to extend sensor
    as a service. The large deployment of such SWE based sensing system facilitates
    system identification and reliable access to sensor observations which facilitates
    the hardware maintenance and remote software (i.e. firmware) updates. 5. Conclusions
    With ever increasing capabilities of open source hardware and software tools,
    cost effective IoT based agro-meteorological observation systems can be designed
    for monitoring the weather conditions at very high precision and temporal scale.
    This will facilitate the open field based agricultural research and decision making
    abilities of resource poor farmers in developing countries. Through on-board implementation
    of OGC specified SOS standards the designed sensing system facilitates storage
    and dissemination of sensor observations thereby reducing syntactic heterogeneity
    among sensing systems. The multiple modes (VPN and cloud service) of sensor data
    transfer over the internet ensured the IoT capability of the sensing system. Sensor
    event notification service through social media (Twitter) has shown the effective
    mode of sensor information dissemination to the larger audience. The web based
    interoperable service oriented application client provides better sensor data
    dissemination capabilities thereby facilitating the stakeholders to easily access
    the required sensor observations. The operational field deployment of the sensing
    system in Orange orchard has proved the capabilities of designed SOA. When implemented
    on large scale these distributed interoperable sensing systems can have very wide
    range of applications in solving the regional issues pertaining to the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. The study has been initiated to collect soil moisture observations
    from multiple depths and locations for validation of proposed modeling approach
    for field scale irrigation scheduling of Orange crop. It has been envisaged to
    integrate OGC specified Sensor Planning Service on sensing platform for effective
    in-situ data processing for better decision making. Attempts are being made towards
    deployment of multiple sensing systems for agro-meteorological data collection
    for precision water management in the horticultural crop (Orange) of the semi-arid
    tropical region of Maharashtra India. Acknowledgements This is a part of research

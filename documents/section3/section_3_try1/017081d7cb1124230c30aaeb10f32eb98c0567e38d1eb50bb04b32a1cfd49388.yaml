  description: Cotton, a crucial cash crop in the textile industry, faces significant
    threats from various diseases that can impact both yield and fiber quality. This
    research explores the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) innovations to revolutionize
    cotton plant disease detection, providing real-time monitoring and data-driven
    decision support for sustainable agriculture practices. The proposed system employs
    wireless sensor networks deployed in cotton fields, UAVs equipped with advanced
    imaging technology, and a centralized data processing platform. These components
    collect crucial environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture, alongside high-resolution images of the cotton crops. The dataset is
    then transmitted to a centralized platform where machine learning algorithms and
    analytics are applied for precise disease detection. Machine learning models,
    trained on diverse datasets containing images of cotton plants with various diseases,
    analyze incoming data to identify potential outbreaks promptly. Upon detection,
    the system triggers automated responses, such as notifying farmers or activating
    precision-targeted treatment protocols, minimizing environmental impact and optimizing
    resource usage. Implementation of this IoT-driven disease detection system not
    only enables early intervention but also contributes to sustainable agriculture
    by reducing reliance on broad-spectrum pesticides and optimizing yield. The collected
    data supports long-term trend analysis, offering insights into crop management
    practices and encouraging the adoption of precision agriculture. This research
    demonstrates the efficacy of IoT technologies in addressing critical challenges
    in cotton farming, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for sustainable
    agriculture. By presenting a comprehensive framework for disease detection and
    management, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on utilizing
    technological innovations for ensuring food and fiber security in an ever-changing
    agricultural landscape.

  description: Pest and disease infections pose significant challenges to corn production,
    affecting crop yield and quality. Addressing this issue demands innovative solutions
    to enable sustainable agriculture practices. This research investigates the application
    of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for environmental monitoring to facilitate
    proactive pest and disease control in corn cultivation. The problem statement
    highlights the lack of real-time data for proactive pest and disease management,
    leading to yield losses and environmental concerns. The proposed system integrates
    WSN technology into corn fields, deploying sensors to monitor crucial environmental
    parameters such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The working flow
    begins with continuous data collection by WSNs, feeding into predictive models
    for early detection of pest and disease outbreaks. This real-time data drives
    an adaptive control system, enabling timely interventions and reducing reliance
    on chemi-cal pesticides. Results demonstrate improved pest and disease control,
    enhancing crop health and yielding increased agricultural productivity. Through
    the integration of WSN-generated insights, the system optimises resource utilisation,
    minimising environmental impact while promoting sustainable practices in corn
    production. The study underscores WSNs’ transformative role in revolutionising
    agriculture by offering proactive and data-driven solutions for pest and disease
    management, ensur-ing a healthier crop yield while maintaining environmental sustainability.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and the Internet
    of Things (IoT) have emerged as transforming technologies, bringing the potential
    to revolutionize a wide range of industries such as environmental monitoring,

    framework; WSN-IoT; future communication 1. Introduction The amount of energy
    stored in a node’s battery impacts the node’s lifespans [1,2]. The stored energy
    is used for a variety of node tasks, including sensing, gathering, analyzing,
    and communication. Sensor node batteries are typically tiny and cannot be changed
    or recharged. Although energy-harvesting systems exist, they cannot eliminate
    the necessity for energy management. As a result, the most difficult task is to
    organize the limited battery power by adopting energy-effective protocols for
    WSNs. WSNs are used for a variety of purposes, including military surveillance,
    remote patient monitoring in healthcare, measuring environmental temperature,
    humidity, light, pressure, monitoring machinery in industries, and so on [3,4,5].
    WSN design difficulties include energy conservation, scalability, data aggregation
    and compression, security, routing, resource constraints, and so on. To overcome
    these design challenges, a multidisciplinary approach involving hardware design,
    networking protocols, algorithm development, and domain-specific knowledge is
    required. The goal of research in these areas is to produce robust and efficient
    solutions that allow for the effective deployment of wireless sensor networks
    across a wide range of Future IoT applications. Because sensor nodes are self-contained
    devices that rely entirely on their batteries to function, several academicians
    have recently been investigating energy-efficient clustering and routing strategies
    to reduce energy usage in sensor nodes. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) are ideas that are closely linked and frequently overlap
    in their applications and technologies. The Internet of Things can be viewed as
    an evolution of WSNs [6]. As WSNs are critical to the Internet of Things (IoT),
    sensors in IoT-based WSNs continuously monitor the surroundings and promptly alert
    the base station (BS) whenever any incident is detected. An IoT-based WSN also
    includes a gateway for uploading acquired data to the IoT Cloud. In some setups,
    the BS might serve as the gateway. Users can access the data saved in the IoT
    Cloud remotely at any time. The incorporation of IoT principles into WSNs expands
    their capabilities and creates chances for novel applications across different
    areas. IoT with WSN support has brought about a number of applications and improved
    the convenience of everyday living. The distributed network across different WSN
    applications for the Internet of Things may be static or dynamic depending on
    its specific requirements [7,8]. Smart healthcare monitoring systems enable dynamic
    networks, unlike static networks, which are supported by crop monitoring and environmental
    monitoring, for instance. WSN-assisted IoT networks cover a larger area than WSN
    networks and have a higher number of nodes (due to resource constraints) compared
    to WSN networks. As a result, standard WSN methods may be ineffective in a scalable
    WSN-aided IoT network. Many researchers used the cluster-based hierarchical framework
    to solve the scalability and network lifetime problems [9,10]. The choice and
    management of Cluster Head (CH) nodes is the primary focus of clustering-based
    routing systems. The CH receives data from the cluster’s nodes. The CH is in charge
    of aggregating data from localized cluster participants and transmitting it to
    the base station or surrounding CHs towards the Base Station (BS). This adds additional
    strain to CH, leading to more energy consumption as compared with ordinary nodes.
    Moreover, the CH towards BS also serves as Relay Nodes (RN) for the transmitting
    packets received from far located CHs, and therefore, depletes their energy more
    faster [11,12]. To address energy-related issues in scalable WSN-IoT environment,
    this research aims to design an Energy Efficient Data Communication (EEDC) scheme
    by utilizing a multi-tier hierarchical clustering framework where each tier is
    further divided into various regions.The proposed routing protocol aims to provide
    network load balancing and convert communicating over long distances into shortened
    multi-hop distance communications, hence enhancing network lifetime. This paper’s
    main contribution can be summarized as follows: This work discusses Region-based
    Hierarchical Clustering for Efficient Routing (RHCER) that employs energy-efficient
    clustering and routing techniques. RHCER employs a novel CH selection mechanism
    to ensure efficient deployment for scalable networks. To ensure efficient long
    distance communication along with even load distribution across all network nodes,
    a subdivision technique was employed in each tier of the proposed framework. RHCER
    considers three critical parameters: distance from BS(D), threshold energy (TE),
    and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a multi-criteria decision-making function f(n)
    for cluster head selection. In the findings section, the outcome of RHCER is compared
    to that of various existing energy-efficient protocols in the same area. According
    to the findings from simulations, the suggested model beats competitors in terms
    of minimizing energy consumption in sensors and prolonging the lifetime of WSN-associated
    IoT. This article is divided into several sections: Section 2 discusses the prior
    work along with problem statement, Section 3 describes the System model along
    with required settings. Section 4 explains the proposed EEDC scheme in detail.
    Section 5 discusses the simulation environment and experimental results, and Section
    6 concludes and discusses future work in this domain. 2. Related Work Considering
    the huge and scalable networks, the difficulty in WSN-assisted IoT differs differently
    from that of regular wireless and wired networks. The usual routing protocol,
    which is based upon IP and does not provide scalability, is insufficient for the
    WSN-assisted IoT [13]. As a result, a wide variety of efficient routing methods
    have been created to satisfy the demands of WSN-assisted IoT [14,15]. The majority
    of routing protocols fall into one of three categories: data-centered routing,
    GPS-based routing, and hierarchical routing. The best routers in every cluster
    are promoted to the title of Cluster Head (CH) in hierarchical routing, which
    groups nodes into clusters. The local member transmits the data to the cluster’s
    CH. The data are combined by CH into one packet [16]. A number of researchers
    have developed various clustering strategies in order to increase the lifetime
    of networks and data transmission efficiency. The work in [17] introduced the
    low energy adaptive cluster hierarchy (LEACH), with the goal of introducing the
    concept of a cluster-based strategy while improving energy efficiency over older
    systems. It is intended for use in applications where each sensor is restricted
    by power sources, such as batteries. LEACH divides sensor nodes into clusters,
    with each cluster having an assigned node known as the “Cluster Head” (CH). The
    CH is in charge of aggregating and transferring data from its cluster nodes to
    a central base station or sink node. LEACH’s fundamental idea is to spread energy
    consumption equitably across the network by rotating the CH duty among the sensor
    nodes over time. While LEACH was created to extend the life of wireless sensor
    networks, it does have several limitations that become more apparent when applied
    to bigger and more complicated contexts, such as IoT networks. As the network
    is expanded across a large area, the amount of distance between CH and BS grows,
    resulting in huge energy loss. Second, the LEACH CH selection process is randomized
    and does not guarantee the most suitable node allocation for CH. Table 1 presents
    the comparison among various existing solutions in this domain. Table 1. Comparison
    with Existing Solutions. Multi-hop LEACH (M-LEACH) is an expansion of the standard
    LEACH protocol that integrates multi-hop transmission to overcome the restrictions
    of traveling a long distance between Cluster Heads (CHs) and Base Stations (BSs)
    in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [19]. M-LEACH attempts to increase energy economy
    and network performance by allowing intermediary nodes to operate as data relays.
    The primary idea underlying M-LEACH is to build a multi-hop link from the CHs
    to the BS, where data are transmitted across numerous intermediary nodes before
    arriving at the final destination. This helps to distribute the network’s energy
    load more equally and allows for communication over longer distances without severely
    depleting the energy of CHs. To address the shortcomings of LEACH, a centralized
    form of LEACH (LEACH-C) was proposed. LEACH-Centralized combines the advantages
    of both LEACH and centralized techniques in order to deliver a more energy-efficient
    and controlled data collection process [18]. A centralized controller or base
    station is important in managing network functioning and data communication in
    LEACH-C. Unlike the original LEACH, cluster heads (CHs) gather and broadcast data
    autonomously. The authors of [23] proposed Information Systems (PEGASIS), an upgraded
    version of LEACH. The network of nodes and sensor nodes uses PEGASIS to enable
    data transmission and reception from their nearby neighbors. One network node
    is chosen at random to serve as the leader node in each chain. Data are sent across
    the network by the leader node to the base station through all nodes’ communication
    with one another. Due to an even distribution of resource consumption, which leads
    to less loss of energy per round in the network, PEGASIS offers a longer lifetime
    than LEACH. The PEGASIS protocol was altered by Jafri and his associates in [24]
    to incorporate the multi-head chain and the sink mobility idea. The sink is permitted
    to go along a predetermined path from one area to another. At the sojourn location
    (where the sink briefly resides for data collection), it waits for a sojourn time.
    Before the network is deployed, the sojourn location is established. A sink’s
    sojourn time is the period of time during which it remains at a predetermined
    location and gathers information from the chain leaders. Compared to PEGASIS,
    this strategy extends the network lifetime. Another routing technique created
    for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed
    Clustering (HEED). HEED uses a hybrid strategy that includes both centralized
    and distributed processes to balance energy consumption, extend network lifetime,
    and increase overall data collection efficiency in WSNs. HEED is especially efficient
    in circumstances with densely deployed sensor nodes because it takes advantage
    of node proximity to optimize cluster formation and communication. The Energy-Efficient
    K-Means Technique (EKMT) [20] is based on the general concept of K-mean clustering
    with energy as an add-on parameter.The K-Means clustering algorithm is a prominent
    unsupervised machine learning technique for partitioning a dataset into a fixed
    number of groups (k). The center of each cluster is derived as the mean of the
    data points within that cluster. The algorithm distributes data points to clusters
    iteratively based on their closeness to cluster centers, and the centers are updated
    depending on the newly assigned points. An energy-efficient form of K-Means is
    constructed to reduce energy usage during the clustering process, particularly
    in resource-constrained contexts such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The
    proposed technique reduces communication distance between nodes while increasing
    network lifetime. However, in an unsecured and unlimited space environment, the
    proposed method is ineffective since it is vulnerable to intentional exploitation
    and may be damaging to sensor data. Further, Improved Chain-Based Clustering Hierarchical
    Routing (ICCHR) works by organizing CHs in a sequential chain-like structure [21].
    Each CH act as in charge of a subset of clusters, with data transmitted down the
    chain until it reaches a sink or base station. This chaining strategy brings benefits
    such as lower overhead and more efficient data aggregation. From the simulated
    outcomes, the suggested ICCHR algorithm reduces the energy consumption ratio while
    spreading the load uniformly among sensor nodes. In the framework of Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the study in
    [22] proposed Energy-Aware Cluster-based Routing (EACRLEACH). The selection of
    Cluster Heads (CH) is an important part of the clustering process in this protocol.
    This protocol likely aims to select Cluster Heads that have sufficient energy,
    good connectivity with neighboring nodes, proximity to the sink, and possibly
    an even distribution of CH roles throughout the network by combining Remaining
    Energy, Number of Neighbors, Distance between Sensor Node and Sink, and Number
    of Times Node Acts as CH. The authors of [14] suggested a hierarchical routing
    technique for fog-assisted sensor networks. Regular sensor nodes and CHs just
    serve to forward data packets. Because fog nodes are superior in terms of storing,
    analyzing, and computation, they make all routing decisions. We examined the aforementioned
    protocols and found a number of shortcomings with Cluster Head (CH) selection
    and organization that fall short of the fundamental needs of the WSN-assisted
    IoT network. To ensure connection to the network and data transmission, robustness
    is necessary [25,26]. However, the techniques outlined in this section might not
    be able to maintain network interaction because of the early demise of nodes close
    to BS. The objective of these routing protocols is energy optimization. They do
    not, however, consider additional WSN-assisted IoT features, such as scalability,
    load distribution, and other related ones. The goal of this research is to increase
    network lifetime by providing network load balancing and turning long-distance
    communications into shorter multi-hop distance communications. 3. System Model
    This section provides a general description of the deployment framework for any
    smart IoT application. The subdivision technique, in order to split the network
    into regions and clusters, has been further discussed. Following that, several
    assumptions concerning communication flow inside network nodes have also provided.
    3.1. Proposed Deployment Framework Architecture The proposed deployment of the
    multi-tier clustering framework for the smart WSN-IoT network is demonstrated
    in Figure 1. The framework considers a rectangular network area where all the
    nodes in the network are stationary and uniform. Each sensor node is equipped
    with GPS and a temperature sensor and they are randomly distributed across all
    network areas. Each node may communicate with the Base Station by varying its
    transmission range. The Base Station is present at the top in the uppermost layer
    and is responsible for collecting information from network nodes and sending it
    further to the IoT cloud for processing. The sensor nodes periodically send data
    to BS. The network is divided into various regions and each region is further
    divided into various sub-regions, which are commonly referred to as clusters.
    To ensure even load distribution across all network nodes, area covered by regions
    keep on decreasing towards BS and the number of sub-regions in each region keeps
    on increasing towards BS. As a result, the lowest region is the one with the maximum
    occupied area and the least number of sub-regions (clusters), while the highest
    region is with the least covered area and the maximum number of sub-regions. The
    motivation behind this is listed as the highest region. It not only sends aggregated
    data towards BS but also sends traffic coming from lower regions to BS, thereby
    utilizing more energy and network resources. This implies reduced intra-cluster
    communication distance in higher regions with increased number of clusters. Moreover,
    the sub-regions present in any particular region occupy the same area. Figure
    1. Proposed multi-tier clustering framework for WSN-IoT applications. 3.2. Subdivision
    Technique To increase the network lifetime by evenly distributing the load across
    all network nodes, the network is divided into regions and sub-regions. Assuming
    r as the radius of sensor node, the diameter of the node sensing area was 𝐷 𝑛
    . The maximum size rectangle that could be formed within the node sensing area
    has a diagonal 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 and side length as 𝑠 𝑙 𝑒𝑛 . The breadth of the entire network
    area is presented as 𝐵𝑟𝑒 𝑑 𝑛𝑒𝑡 . Therefore, the number of regions that could be
    formed are calculated as: 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒 𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑔 = 𝐵𝑟𝑒 𝑑 𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝑟 +1 (1) From mathematics we
    know, 𝐷 𝑛 =2∗𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 = 𝑠 𝑙𝑒𝑛 ∗ 2 − − √ Here, the length of both 𝐷 𝑛 and 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐
    are the same and therefore: 𝐷 𝑛 = 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑐 This implies 2∗𝑟= 𝑠 𝑙𝑒𝑛 ∗ 2 − − √ 𝑠 𝑙𝑒𝑛
    = 2∗𝑟 𝑠𝑞𝑟𝑡2 The area covered by the rectangle is 𝑠 𝑙𝑒𝑛 ∗ 𝑠 𝑙𝑒𝑛 (2) 2∗𝑟 𝑠𝑞𝑟𝑡2 ∗
    2∗𝑟 𝑠𝑞𝑟𝑡2 2∗ 𝑟 2 Assuming 𝑚∗𝑛 as the dimension of the bottom region (region 1),
    respectively, the number of sub-regions (clusters) that could be formed in this
    area are: 𝑁 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠 𝑡 𝑘 = 𝑚∗𝑛 2∗ 𝑟 2 (3) Keeping in mind that the number of clusters
    at bottom regions (region 1) are minimal, the number of clusters in the next regions
    would be: 𝑁 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠 𝑡 𝑘 = 𝑁 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠 𝑡 𝑘−1 +1𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒1≤𝑘≤𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒 𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑔 (4) The breadth of
    the regions are: 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑟𝑒 𝑔 𝑢𝑝𝑝 = 𝑟 3 − − √ (5) 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑟𝑒 𝑔 𝑚𝑖𝑑 = 𝑏𝑟𝑒 𝑑 𝑛𝑒𝑡
    −𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑟𝑒 𝑔 𝑢𝑝𝑝 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒 𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑔 −1 (6) 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑟𝑒 𝑔 𝑙𝑜𝑤 =𝑏𝑟𝑒 𝑑 𝑛𝑒𝑡 − ∑ 𝑖=2 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒
    𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑔 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑟𝑒 𝑔 𝑖 (7) Here, 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑟𝑒 𝑔 𝑢𝑝𝑝 denotes the topmost region which
    is nearest to BS, 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑟𝑒 𝑔 𝑙𝑜𝑤 represents the lowest region, and 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑡 ℎ
    𝑟𝑒 𝑔 𝑚𝑖𝑑 represents the middle region. Any region beyond these mentioned can be
    formed and area can be calculated based on the above calculations. 4. Proposed
    Energy Efficient Data Communication Scheme: Region Based Hierarchical Clustering
    for Efficient Routing (RHCER) The RHCER is a multi-tier clustering protocol for
    improving the network lifetime by achieving efficient balance between load and
    energy depletion across all network nodes. The Base Station (BS) is presented
    at the top of the network. Each node in the network sends their data to BS in
    multihop way. BS is aware of the entire network location and divides the whole
    network into various regions and sub-regions, as mentioned in Algorithm 1: Line
    1–6. The proposed RHCER protocol deploys the multi-tier network for an agriculture
    scenario. The selection of CH in each cluster is done via BS using Algorithm 2:
    Cluster Head Selection. Immediately after the selection of CH in each cluster,
    the local cluster nodes send Join-Req to CH. Upon the reception of the Join-Req
    message from the sensor nodes, CH sends a reply via an acknowledgment message.
    Once connection between sensor nodes and CH within a local cluster is established,
    sensor nodes start sending their sensed data to CH. CH aggregates the data received
    from the nodes and transmits the data to the nearest neighbor CH present in its
    upper region. The selection of nearest neighbor CH in the upper region (One region
    above the current region towards BS) is done through Algorithm 1: Line 13–22.
    In this process, CH is chosen based on the ratio of residual energy of CH of the
    upper region to the distance between CHs of local region and the upper region.
    The process repeats itself until the packets finally reach BS. The energy of selected
    CH periodically gets checked and compared with the energy threshold. If at any
    point in time the CH energy is found to be lower than the threshold, the CH selection
    process gets started in that cluster. The time required for the evaluation of
    Algorithm 1 depends on the number of regions and the number of clusters in each
    region, and was therefore computed as 𝑁 𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 ∗ 𝑁 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 . Algorithm 1: Region

    𝐻 𝑙 = first node of array End Procedure The selection of the most appropriate
    node as CH within the local cluster is crucial. The node with the highest residual
    energy within the local cluster can provide uniform energy depletion for the entire
    network. The energy of each node within a local cluster is mainly utilized for
    transmission. The energy consumed for sensing and processing is minimal and is
    therefore considered as constant G (Algorithm 2: Line 10). The distance between
    BS and node is also one of the factors impacting energy depletion. Satisfying
    the condition that residual energy is higher than chosen threshold, the Cluster
    Head election process in local cluster for eligible node determines its residual
    energy, distance from BS, and Signal to Noise (SNR) ratio from BS. The efficient
    cluster head selection through the multi-criteria decision-making function, which
    includes distance from BS(D), threshold energy (TE), and signal-to-noise ratio
    (SNR), would have a significant impact on packet drop ratio as the high number
    of requests would be satisfied by cluster heads first due to aggregation of data
    from nodes of the same cluster. The reduced packet drop ratio will ultimately
    enhance the packet delivery ratio. From the list of eligible nodes in the cluster
    head election process, the node with the highest value was selected as CH. The
    ratio between a node’s residual energy and the network’s overall energy was used
    to calculate the threshold energy regarding the ideal number of CH [27]. The time
    required for the evaluation of Algorithm 2 depends on the number of nodes in each
    sub-region, computed as 𝑆+𝑆 , i.e., 2𝑆 , ignoring constant number 2, implies S.
    5. Evaluation and Performance The simulation environment employed to evaluate
    the efficiency of our proposed technique is presented first in this section. Following
    that, we identify the performance criteria, which is crucial to compute the performance
    of any network clustering technique. Finally, we give an extensive analysis of
    our simulation results. 5.1. Simulation Environment The simulation of the proposed
    multi-tier clustering framework for energy efficient routing was performed using
    MATLAB R2015a. The parameters used for evaluation has been listed in Table 2.
    The whole network is divided into four zones. The bottom-most zone has only one
    cluster, while the uppermost zone has four clusters. The upper zone aggregates
    the traffic from lower zones and hence traffic at zone near BS is higher compared
    to the lower zone. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been analyzed and
    results have been compared against state-of-the-art clustering techniques such
    as LEACH, M-LEACH, EACRP, and EEMAC. Table 2. Evaluation parameters with values.
    5.2. Results and Discussion The simulation outcome of our proposed approach has
    been compared against various network performance metrics. The metrics used in
    this evaluation mainly include network throughput, energy consumption, and number
    of alive nodes after each round [28,29]. The detailed discussion on the results
    retrieved for these metrics has been provided below. 5.2.1. Network Throughput
    The comparison of the proposed RHCER against considered state-of-the-art techniques
    in terms of network throughput under varied simulation rounds has been performed
    (refer Figure 2). The throughput is calculated as number of bits of data transmitted
    over network per sec. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves
    network throughput performance by 13%, 17.5%, 21%, and 26.8% for EEMAC, EACRP,
    M-LEACH, and LEACH, respectively. The improved network throughput is due to better
    network management in terms of regions and sub-regions, which leads to better
    load distribution. Moreover, unlike other considered solutions where signal strength
    has not been taken into account, the proposed scheme utilizes SNR for optimal
    selection of cluster heads, thereby improving the proportion of packets delivered
    in agricultural land due to their robust actions. In this regard, the suggested
    framework has a higher network throughput than previous alternatives. Figure 2.
    The impact on network throughput with varying number of simulation rounds. 5.2.2.
    Energy Consumption The depletion of energy in the proposed scheme for the transmission
    of packet from sensor node to BS mainly includes energy used for transmission
    from sensor node to local CH, local CH to neighbor CH (number of rounds vary depending
    upon position of local zone in network), and finally from CH in the uppermost
    Zone to BS. The energy consumption for the proposed scheme in comparison to other
    solutions is analyzed in Figure 3. Figure 3. The impact on energy consumption
    with a varying number of simulation rounds. The results revealed a better performance
    of proposed RHCER in terms of energy usage for the transmission of data packets
    to BS. The highest gain in energy savings has been computed from LEACH, which
    is about 31%, and from M-LEACH as 26%. This is because the proposed system distributes
    the strain of energy use among sensor nodes uniformly. The proposed methodology
    selects appropriate nodes for cluster placement in agricultural land based on
    a decision made using multiple criteria function. Furthermore, rather than being
    scattered, the process of CH selection, cluster formation, and zone distribution
    is controlled by BS, which significantly reduces the ratio of energy exhaustion
    in the observing field. Furthermore, the suggested framework avoids the process
    of recurring re-clustering and re-routing due to the multiple variables as a decision
    function. Because the most appropriate cluster heads are selected based on energy
    efficiency, distance to BS, and signal intensity characteristics, the proposed
    framework considerably reduces energy usage in the agriculture domain. 5.2.3.
    Packet Drop Ratio Figure 4 depicts the numerical results of the RHCER in comparison
    to other alternatives in terms of packet drop ratio. The RHCER significantly improved
    the packet drop rates compared to earlier solutions. The existing method ignored
    the importance of the transmission link element, resulting in higher drop rates.
    Our suggested architecture measures signal intensity as well as the remaining
    energy of nodes throughout data forwarding, resulting in efficient routing performance.
    Furthermore, the suggested framework enhances the packet delivery ratio by analyzing
    the multiple criteria-making process and avoiding crowded data routing nodes.
    Furthermore, the suggested framework includes the distance to and from the BS
    factor. Figure 4. The impact on packet drop ratio with varying number of simulation
    rounds. 6. Conclusions The nodes in WSN are powered by modest batteries, and the
    amount of energy available from these sources is restricted. The preservation
    of energy is an essential issue in the large-scale development of a WSN-assisted
    IoT network. This research proposes a unique energy-effective routing protocol,
    RHCER, based on the network subdivision technique, as well as a multi-tier-based
    clustering architecture. We also devised an approach for region and sub region
    construction that varies with network area dimensions to suit the need of an energy-efficient,
    resilient network. The proposed framework has been simulated for a varying number
    of rounds and performance, and has been analyzed for various performance metrics.
    Further, to check the effectiveness of our proposed solution, the retrieved results
    from the proposed solution have been compared against existing clustering protocols.
    The comparative analysis proved the outstanding performance of RHCER for all the
    tested parameters in comparison to earlier considered protocols. However, the
    scheme has limitations in maintaining secure transmission inside network nodes.
    To work in this direction, this research can be further extended in the future
    while applying blockchain-based security solutions during content transmission.
    Moreover, applying artificial intelligent techniques in the future for the prediction
    of frequently accessed content to be stored inside cluster heads may enhance network
    performance. Author Contributions Conceptualization, D.G. and S.R.; methodology,

    and fertiliser process. It also includes an Environment Monitoring Aggregator
    node, which has sensors to monitor air temperature, humidity, etc. NPK sensor
    used to assess the soil''s chemical makeup for fertiliser management. The solenoid
    valve opens the specific fertiliser tank to release fertiliser into the soil based
    on the data gathered. Along with UV traps for pest control, this system uses current
    and voltage sensors to keep an eye on the motor. The obtained results of our proposed
    system show that the fertiliser system operates effectively and that fertiliser
    can be added automatically as needed. Published in: 2023 International Conference

    India SECTION I. Introduction The agricultural practice of administering regulated
    watering to land to help with crop production as well as the development of lawns
    and landscape plants is known as irrigation. In modern years, this process of
    irrigation has been integrated with many sensors and devices for automatic process
    and easy maintenance for farmers. It is known as Smart Irrigation. Smart irrigation
    controllers automate the process while monitoring weather, soil conditions, evaporation,
    and plant water, whereas standard methods works as schedule program with timer
    support. Existing systems do not focus on the chemical composition of soil. The
    proposed system uses a type of soil sensor known as NPK which measures the Nitrogen,
    Phosphorous & Potassium content of the soil and a humidity sensor to measure soil
    water level. A Battery Backup is powered to solar panel and UV bug trap of all
    the components of systems is available. Thing Speak through LoRa module is collection
    of data which is transferred from sensor. A type of machine learning algorithm
    known as Bayesian algorithm is cast-off in the proposed structure. The data collected
    by Thing Speak is used to train the algorithm. Each crop and soil has various
    requirements of water and fertilizer. A threshold value can be set using the algorithm.
    The suggested uses three distinct types of fertiliser tanks that hold nitrogen,
    phosphorus, and potassium fertilisers. An algorithm is used to control the valve
    used to open and close the tanks. Whenever the chemical content drops below a
    threshold value, the algorithm opens that particular solenoid valve thereby supplying
    only the required fertilizer. SECTION II. Related Works The adoption of smart
    city resolutions by metropolises to cover and mechanize various areas, such as
    commerce, energy feasting, civic auditoriums, or sewage structure, has amplified
    dramatically in recent years. The five areas that make up the concept of a “Smart
    City” are e-health, e-education, traffic management, eco-smart cities, and e-energy
    [1]. However, there might be other varieties of organizations. Research on “Smart
    Cities,” with concepts like “water-sensitive urban strategy” or “using smart metres
    to track non-revenue water” as examples [2]. Smart water technologies can be used
    in decentralised water management to use less energy than centralised systems.
    Research conducted in the case of Australia [3] indicates that as part of smart
    city projects, options for cooling in hot weather can be offered through water
    operation. These clever techniques rely on the use of technology, which enables
    the automation of specific processes. They include devices that control the lighting
    or spray water. These systems have potential because of their portability, compactness,
    and labor-intensive nature. On the other hand, the challenges are brought on by
    how challenging it is to grow large-scale crops. So the objective is to always
    apply the right amount of irrigation for soil moisture. Monitoring soil moisture
    is a prerequisite for achieving this objective, according to scientific irrigation
    scheduling, a branch of precision agriculture [5] and [6]. There are many ways
    to monitor and measure the soil moisture levels in agricultural areas. In order
    to avoid the cost and difficulty of installing and maintaining long cables, wireless
    technology is preferred to measure soil humidity because crop fields typically
    cover large areas. In the field, many sensors can be placed using a wireless technique
    to build a wireless sensor network that can send information about soil moisture
    to the network server from various points all over the field. In a related application,
    the use of Zigbee wireless sensor-based forest fire monitoring systems has also
    been demonstrated. [9] provides an overview of the research issues related to
    wireless subterranean sensor networks. A key selling point for devices would be
    their ability to completely submerge all sensor nodes and communication modules,
    allowing them to avoid interfering with farm machinery. A significant drawback
    of this system compared to above-ground communication is its significant RF (radio
    frequency) route loss, which causes low data rates for given powers or high power
    requirements for given data rates [9]. Data must be quickly diverted to an above-ground
    stationary or mobile base station or gateway because it cannot be transmitted
    over long distances in an underground sensor network without consuming a lot of
    power [9]. Building a dense network of above-ground base stations is the ideal
    solution to this issue, but doing so is neither practical nor cost-effective.
    Magnetic induction, a less common wireless technology, was also researched for
    subsurface communication [10]. Since nonpropagating magnetic fields have lower
    material losses for communication, this method uses them. However, because the
    near-field power density decreases more quickly, it has a very limited range.
    With many relay coils placed between the transmitter and receiver and spaced closely
    apart, a significant range could be achieved, as was found through research into
    subsurface magnetic induction waveguide systems [11]. This significantly increases
    the difficulty and cost of this option, though it is still feasible. To track
    various agricultural data, such as soil moisture, [13] developed a wireless sensor
    network based on the Internet of Things called the Greenhouse 80 Irrigation Management
    System. This effort will benefit significantly from the creation of the Internet
    of Underground Things (IoUT), a subset of the Internet of Things that operates
    in environments where linked effects are partially or completely buried [14].
    The LoRaWAN wide area network protocol makes use of the LoRa wireless radio technology
    [15]. In our work, we utilized LoRa technology in conjunction with a variety of
    sensors to automatically monitor, regulate, and process field parameters. The
    irrigation and fertiliser systems are controlled by the proposed system in this
    paper using LoRa and Wi-Fi modules from the ESP32 series. SECTION III. Proposed
    Work Various components in the proposed system such as humidity sensor and NPK
    sensor helps to fetch the status of the soil. Via the use of LoRa, this data are
    sent to Thing talk. Using the ESP32 module, the data contained in the Thing Talk
    is wirelessly communicated. If the value drops below the threshold level, the
    starter is used to control the motor for channeling water through the pipes. The
    NPK sensor is also used to fetch the Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium content
    in the soil. The use of fertilizer tanks helps us to supply fertilizer based on
    the data from NPK sensor. UV traps are also used in order to control the pests.
    All the components are powered using solar panels. We also use Voltage and Current
    sensors which are connected to the motor help us monitor the motor. If any problem
    arises for example, the current input to the motor is high, it will warn us and
    help us turn off the motor before permanent damage occurs to the coil. Architecture
    In this part, we offer a design for an irrigation system for smart cities that
    is suited for urban gardens. Nevertheless, there are not as many concepts centered
    on the employment of UV traps to manage pests, current and voltage sensors to
    monitor the motor, and smart watering systems deployed within the framework of
    a smart city. The suggested system uses LoRa and ESP32 series Wi-Fi modules, along
    with the Bayesian method of machine learning, to operate the irrigation and fertilizer
    systems. In order for crops to be grown in agricultural areas, they must either
    meet standards for soil consumption or specific growth requirements. For fertilizer
    management, a type of soil sensor known as an NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium)
    is measure the chemical composition of the soil. The solenoid valve opens the
    specific fertilizer tank to release fertilizer into the soil based on the information
    gathered. Finally, while implementing wireless communications-enabled equipment,
    it''s critical to take interference into account. The data is collected and stored
    in Thing speak which is used as the platform for the proposed work. The proposed
    system uses a type of machine learning algorithm known as Bayesian algorithm.
    We can upload the Bayesian network using Things peak''s API (Application Programming
    Interface). The data gathered by Thing talk is used to train the algorithm. To
    regulate the solenoid valves thing talk data is used. This system also uses current
    and voltage sensors to monitor the motor and UV traps to control pests. The fertilizer
    system is integrated with water pipeline and thus fertilizer is added automatically
    as per requirement. The architecture in Figure 1 is provided while accounting
    for each of these elements. The Soil Monitoring Nodes are made up of an embedded
    system and sensors for monitoring fertilizer and humidity. Figure 1. Architecture

    use precision agricultural techniques. This study offers a monitoring architecture
    for an irrigation PA system''s water quality. Fields, soil areas, and irrigation
    water channels have all been taken into account. WiFi and LoRa nodes are connected
    by bridge and is used to transmit the data using both WiFi and LoRa wireless technologies.

    Agricultural systems will be under tremendous pressure to increase food production
    in sustainable ways as the world’s population is projected to nearly double to
    10 billion by 2050 [1]. In order to be prepared for the future, agriculture must
    find inventive solutions to problems like unstable climatic patterns and dwindling
    arable lands. Agricultural frameworks in the modern era face a number of difficulties.
    Unpredictable weather patterns brought on by climate change include more frequent
    droughts and floods. Such unpredictabilities place a severe pressure on conventional
    farming techniques, necessitating a change to more robust agricultural practises
    [2]. Further increasing the need for effective and sustainable agricultural methods
    is the growing loss of arable land, which is mostly linked to urbanisation and
    soil deterioration [3]. The potential of technology intervention shines brilliantly
    in the midst of these difficulties. A ray of hope is provided by precision agriculture,
    which is supported by cutting-edge sensor technologies. By continuously tracking
    crop conditions, weather patterns, and soil health, these devices provide actionable
    data that enable well-informed decisions and prompt treatments. In essence, sensor-based
    technology integration in farming landscapes resolves many of the current problems
    and, more importantly, sets the way for a sustainable and productive agricultural
    future [4]. 2. Sensor-Based Technologies: An Insight into Modern Agricultural
    Practices The era of traditional farming is evolving towards a tech-centric agricultural
    paradigm. Sensor-based technologies, leveraging data, promise enhanced production
    and sustainability. Table 1 highlights key sensor technology advancements and
    their agricultural applications to illustrate this shift. Table 1. Advanced sensor
    technologies being used in modern agriculture. By providing real-time information
    on the qualities of the soil and optimising irrigation and fertilisation, soil
    sensors have transformed precision farming [5]. Farmers can adjust to changing
    atmospheric conditions by using weather sensors to optimise planting and harvesting
    seasons [6]. Crop health and yield are improved by the fine-tuning of microclimatic
    conditions by light and humidity sensors [7]. Spectral imaging-based crop health
    monitors notify farmers to problems like infections or nutritional deficiencies
    and allow for pre-emptive interventions [8]. 3. The Convergence of IoT and Wireless
    Communication in Precision Agriculture Through the incorporation of sensor technology
    and cutting-edge wireless communication systems, the Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed agriculture. Transmitting enormous amounts of real-time data over
    great distances, especially in difficult circumstances, becomes crucial as farms
    transform into digital ecosystems. 3.1. Sensor Networks in IoT-Based Agriculture
    Interconnected sensor networks, which collect various agronomic metrics, are agriculture’s
    IoT [9]. Their true value comes from their ability to interface with centralised
    databases and decision-making tools, giving farmers the power to make quick decisions
    based on current data and promoting a precision culture [10,11]. 3.2. Communication
    Technologies: Bridging the Gap Numerous communication protocols, ranging from
    well-established ones like ZigBee to more recent ones like 5G (fifth generation)
    and NB-IoT (NarrowBand Internet of Things) are available in the tech world for
    smart farming. ZigBee provides balanced power and range, making it perfect for
    isolated farms [12], while NB-IoT provides extensive coverage with low energy
    requirements for large-scale agricultural endeavours [13]. With its speed, low
    latency, and dependability, 5G is poised to redefine data transfer [14]. 4. The
    Interplay of Sensor Technologies and Data Management Modern precision agriculture
    is built on a foundation of seamless sensor technology and data management, creating
    a synergy that offers increased agricultural productivity and better resource
    management. 4.1. Need for Interoperability among Diverse Technologies Different
    sensor systems used in smart agriculture have unique data formats and protocols
    [15]. Interoperability becomes more important as systems become more complex.
    Enhanced interoperability optimises yield and resource consumption by consolidating
    and coherently analysing data. 4.2. Data Analytics, Management Techniques, and
    Challenges Artificial intelligence and smart algorithms help with the rigorous
    management and analysis of the massive amounts of data from sensors [16]. Making
    the transition from raw data to usable insights presents difficulties, such as
    managing storage and protecting data privacy. To solve this, you need to have
    a solid grasp of agriculture and be an expert data manager. 4.3. Techniques for
    Sensor Data Analytics and Management To analyse huge amounts of sensor-generated
    data, advanced analytics, from classical statistical techniques to contemporary
    machine learning, are required. An overview of these analytics and management
    methods for agricultural sensor data is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Comprehensive
    overview of sensor data analytics and management techniques in precision agriculture.
    5. Future Perspectives and Current Challenges in Sensor-Based Agriculture The
    nexus of sensor development, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence is
    the next frontier in agricultural technology. These cutting-edge fields, while
    they hold the potential for paradigm-shifting effects, are also rife with complex
    problems that each call for in-depth investigation. 5.1. Potential of 5G Technology
    and AI Predictive Modelling 5G’s ultra-reliable low latency promises more than
    fast data transfer, facilitating real-time analysis in distant agricultural fields
    [22]. AI (artificial intelligence) predictive modelling, enhanced by real-time
    data, offers precise forecasts, from weather to pest detection [23]. 5.2. Challenges:
    Cost, Data Privacy, System Compatibility, Energy Management Economic difficulties
    arise with the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, particularly for agrarians
    who are resource-constrained [24]. Increased encryption and security measures
    are required due to the increase in data [25]. In order to combine several digital
    platforms in agriculture, seamless system compatibility is essential [26]. Energy
    conservation, notably the use of renewable energy for sensors, must be prioritised
    [27]. For a thorough summary of the obstacles and future directions for sensor-based
    agriculture, see Table 3. Table 3. An analytical synopsis of prospective avenues
    and challenges in sensor-based agriculture. 6. Conclusions With the combination
    of cutting-edge sensor technology and data-driven innovations, agriculture’s historical
    evolution is ready for yet another important revolution. This discussion went
    deep into the technical details of these technologies and highlighted how they
    might affect present and future agricultural endeavours. The analysis of our research
    yields the following key conclusions: Primacy of Sensor Integration: Sensor technologies
    that track factors like soil quality, weather erraticness, light, humidity, and
    crop health are largely responsible for the advancements in precision agriculture.
    They have fuelled data-centric farming methods by offering granular insights,
    assuring the best use of resources and raising yields. Sensor Technologies and
    Data Management Confluence: Different sensor technologies add different data formats
    and communication protocols to the agricultural tapestry as they are woven in.
    Thus, interoperability is essential for achieving a seamless connection. A sophisticated
    analytics and management solution is also required to transform the massive amount
    of collected data into a useful agricultural strategy. Prospective Technological
    Boons: The impending use of 5G technology and the skill of AI predictive modelling
    are positive signs for the future of agriculture. These tools could revolutionise
    agricultural decision making since they promise accurate forecasting and real-time
    data transfer. Inherent Challenges: Even with advances in technology, significant
    problems still exist. These cover issues including the price tag associated with
    adopting new technology, protecting data privacy in an era of information overload,
    establishing system interoperability among various tech solutions, and dealing
    with energy management for remote sensor operations. Implications for Upcoming
    Research: Focused Investigation: Future studies may benefit from focusing on particular
    sensor types as technology continues to progress. This would enable a deeper investigation
    of the problems and applications that are unique to them. Holistic System Design:
    The creation of complete systems that integrate various sensor technologies should
    be prioritised in order to streamline data collection, processing, and the extraction
    of insightful information. Broader Dimensions: Prospective studies ought to extend
    beyond the strictly technical to include ethical considerations of data privacy
    and the larger socio-economic effects of technology adoption in agriculture. Fundamentally,
    even while the fusion of sensor-based technology with agriculture ushers in a
    new era of productivity and sustainability, the road ahead is not without obstacles.
    However, the advantages they offer vastly outweigh these challenges, prompting
    a concerted effort by academics, technologists, and agricultural stakeholders
    to fully realise this enormous potential. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: The agriculture industry faces significant challenges from pests and
    diseases, which pose threats to crop production and the livelihoods of farmers.
    One such menacing problem is Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR), a fungal disease that wreaks
    havoc on coffee trees, causing defoliation and reducing yields. Timely disease
    detection is essential to mitigate the impact and protect crop value. This study
    proposes a diagnostic model for Coffea liberica, a coffee species, leveraging
    both Wireless Sensor Network and Deep Learning Algorithm. The system deploys wireless
    sensors strategically across the plantation to gather real-time data on plant
    health and environmental conditions. This data is then fed into sophisticated
    Deep Learning algorithms, which effectively analyze patterns and accurately identify
    CLR and other diseases. By detecting diseases early on, farmers can implement
    proactive measures like targeted treatments and cultural practices to mitigate
    CLR's effects and enhance overall plant health. This not only safeguards farmers'
    livelihoods but also ensures sustainable production of premium-quality coffee.
    The fusion of Wireless Sensor Network and Deep Learning equips farmers with timely
    information, empowering them to make informed decisions and implement efficient
    disease management strategies. The proposed diagnostic model serves as a valuable
    tool for monitoring and preserving the health of coffee plants, enhancing crop
    productivity, and bolstering the resilience of the coffee industry. Through this
    integrated system's implementation, our goal is to support farmers in combating
    pests and diseases, minimizing crop losses, and securing the long-term sustainability
    of coffee production.

    Location: Chiang Mai, Thailand SECTION I. Introduction Coffee is produced from
    the ripe seeds of Coffea arabica Linn [1]. The beverage created from such coffee
    seeds is also known as coffee. Coffee is a top-of-line after-drink and a highly
    valued commodity [2]. According to Philippine Coffee Board Inc, only three of
    the seventy species of coffee are farmed. Coffea Arabica supplies 60% of the world''s
    coffee, followed by Coffea Canephora (Robusta) at 25% and Coffea Liberica (Kapeng
    Barako) and other species at less than 1%. In the Philippines, Cavite produced
    25% of the Luzon coffee production, as reported by PSA, and is considered one
    of the country''s top coffee-producing regions because of its quality and taste
    [3]. Cavite coffee farmers produced robusta, excelsa, arabica, and liberica coffee
    beans. Climate unpredictability, nutritional inadequacies, and insect and disease
    risks are critical concerns for coffee farmers worldwide [2]. The most widespread
    and destructive coffee disease is coffee leaf rust. Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR), a
    fungus regarded as the most significant phytosanitary threat to coffee crops,
    is a disease that hinders coffee output. In the 1880s, the exportation of coffee
    beans by the Philippines placed the country in fourth place among all countries
    worldwide, but when coffee rust struck the country in 1889, coffee production
    decreased [4]. Now, the Philippines ranked 32nd in coffee production around the
    globe. Once extreme degrees of severity are attained, little corrective measures
    may be taken. Inappropriate disease treatment can severely harm coffee plants.
    Although it is a disease with a rapid spread and devastating effects on the economy
    of coffee growers, visual examination, such as that performed while wandering
    through the fields, is adequate for identifying and diagnosing the disease. Visual
    inspections, progression scales, and standard severity diagrams are among the
    tools used in this method to diagnose plant diseases. Personnel in charge of the
    crops will go through them when inspecting and handling the plants to identify
    and quantify symptoms of the sickness that causes them [5]. The researchers of
    this study aim to detect coffee leaf rust at its early stage and prevent its spread.
    Utilizing wireless sensors and mobilevnet to create a convolutional neural network
    with over 294 dataset is used in this model, achieving 88.14% of accuracy rate
    [6]. Thus, proposing this technology-based aid to the local agricultural department
    will alleviate the rampant spread of the leaf rust. SECTION II. Methodology Figure
    1 illustrates the visual representation of how this study was executed. It provides
    a comprehensive and well-structured overview of the methods employed to accomplish
    the objectives of the study. The study comprises two main sections. The first
    part focuses on the microcontroller system, which incorporates the ESP8266 as
    its core component. The ESP8266 serves as the central control unit, facilitating
    seamless communication and coordination between the field devices and the application
    system. To enable effective monitoring, a network of wireless sensors is strategically
    deployed in the desired monitoring area. These sensors are specifically designed
    to capture and transmit data related to various environmental parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, nitrogen levels, potassium levels, phosphorous levels,
    and wind direction [7]. The wireless sensors continually collect data from their
    respective environments and transmit it to the microcontroller. Upon receiving
    the data, the microcontroller processes it using specific algorithms that analyze
    the readings and compare them against predefined threshold values [8]. Based on
    this processed data, decision-making algorithms within the microcontroller come
    into action. These algorithms evaluate the sensor readings against specific criteria
    to identify abnormal or critical conditions. If any readings exceed the predefined
    thresholds, the system triggers appropriate actions. In cases where the sensor
    readings surpass the threshold values, the microcontroller initiates a notification
    process using GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) technology [9]. The
    system sends a notification to a designated recipient, alerting them about the
    detected anomaly or critical condition. Furthermore, when the temperature and
    humidity levels exceed their respective threshold values, the system activates
    a water pump to address the situation. Alternatively, when the sensor readings
    fall within the normal range, the microcontroller maintains its continuous monitoring
    of the data. It displays the values through an application system, allowing for
    easy visualization and tracking of the environmental parameters. Simultaneously,
    the microcontroller persists in its analysis, utilizing decision-making algorithms
    to ensure proactive surveillance. This approach ensures that the system remains
    alert and prepared to respond promptly to any deviations that may arise in the
    future. In the latter part of the study, the Raspberry Pi (RPI) is employed for
    image processing tasks. Specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is
    utilized on the RPI for this purpose [10]. The dataset is divided into two subsets
    using an 80–20 split. 80% of the dataset is allocated for testing the CNN model,
    while the remaining 20% is dedicated to its validation. This division allows for
    robust evaluation and assessment of the CNN''s performance. After completing the
    testing phase, the CNN model will provide an accurate assessment to determine
    the health condition of the coffee leaf. It will analyze the input image and classify
    whether the coffee leaf is healthy or not based on the patterns and features it
    has learned during the training process. This classification will serve as a valuable
    indicator of the health status of the coffee leaf. Fig. 1. Conceptual framework
    of Methodology Show All SECTION III. Image Processing The first step in the process
    involved collecting data. This data consisted of images of coffee leaves, categorized
    into two classes: ‘with_clr’ (indicating leaves infected with Coffee Leaf Rust)
    and ‘healthy’ (indicating disease-free leaves). Each image was labeled accordingly
    to indicate its class. After the data collection, the next step was data preprocessing.
    This involved resizing the images to a standardized size to ensure consistency
    in the dataset. Resizing is important as it helps in reducing computational complexity
    and ensures that the model can process the images efficiently. Once the images
    were resized, the data was transformed into a features array. This means that
    the images were converted into numerical representations, where each image is
    represented by a set of features or attributes. These features capture the important
    characteristics and patterns present in the images. With the features array prepared,
    the model was trained to distinguish between the two classes: ‘with_clr’ and ‘healthy’.
    This process involved feeding the features array into a learning algorithm, such
    as a Deep Learning model, that can analyze and learn patterns from the data. The
    model was trained to recognize the distinctive features associated with each class,
    enabling it to classify new images as either ‘with_clr’ or ‘healthy’ based on
    the learned patterns. By going through this process of data collection, preprocessing,
    and training, the model becomes capable of accurately distinguishing between coffee
    leaves infected with Coffee Leaf Rust and disease-free leaves. This allows for
    effective identification and classification of CLR-infected leaves, aiding in
    early detection and subsequent management strategies to minimize the impact of
    the disease on coffee plantations [11]. Figure 2. Accuracy rate of the image processing
    technique Show All Figure 3. Accuracy rate of the image processing technique Show
    All The accuracy rate of 88.14% demonstrated in the illustrations provides a strong
    justification for the effectiveness of the image processing technique used in
    classifying coffee plants as healthy or diseased. The feature explorer shows all
    data in test set classified by the neural network, items in green are classified
    correctly, items in red are misclassified. This level of accuracy signifies that
    the Mobilevnet convolutional neural network architecture, employed for image recognition,
    has performed exceptionally well in distinguishing between different health statuses
    of coffee plants. An accuracy rate of 88.14% indicates that the model''s predictions
    are highly reliable, making it a robust tool for coffee plant health assessment.
    With such a high accuracy, farmers and agricultural experts can confidently rely
    on this image processing technique to identify diseased plants early on, enabling
    them to take timely and targeted actions for disease management. By intervening
    at an early stage, farmers can implement necessary treatments and preventive measures,
    thereby reducing the spread of diseases and minimizing crop losses. Additionally,
    the diverse and substantial dataset used for training and testing the model contributes
    to the credibility of the results. A varied dataset ensures that the model has
    been exposed to a wide range of coffee plant samples, making it more resilient
    and better equipped to handle different scenarios in real-world agricultural settings.
    In a broader sense, the 88.14% accuracy rate proves that the image processing
    technique is a valuable and practical tool for coffee plant health monitoring.
    Its ability to accurately differentiate between healthy and diseased plants can
    greatly support coffee growers in maintaining the health of their crops, optimizing
    production, and ensuring the sustainability of the coffee industry. SECTION IV.
    Convolutional Neural Network Implementation Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    implementation is a popular approach for image classification tasks, including
    the detection of diseases in plants such as Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR). A CNN is a
    deep learning model specifically designed to analyze visual data, making it well-suited
    for image-based tasks [10]. The implementation of a CNN involves several key steps.
    Firstly, the dataset consisting of labeled images is prepared. This dataset typically
    includes two classes: ‘with_clr’ (infected leaves) and ‘healthy’ (disease-free
    leaves). The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets to
    evaluate the performance of the model. Next, the CNN architecture is defined.
    This architecture typically consists of multiple layers, including convolutional
    layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply
    filters to extract important features from the input images, capturing patterns
    and structures relevant to disease detection. Pooling layers downsample the feature
    maps, reducing their dimensionality. Fully connected layers use the extracted
    features to make predictions. Once the architecture is defined, the model is trained
    using the training set. During training, the model learns to optimize its internal
    parameters by iteratively adjusting them based on the provided labeled images.
    This process involves forward propagation, where the input images are passed through
    the network, and backward propagation, where the network''s predictions are compared
    to the ground truth labels to compute the loss. Optimization algorithms such as
    gradient descent are used to update the parameters of the model and minimize the
    loss. After training, the model is evaluated using the validation set to assess
    its performance and fine-tune its hyperparameters if necessary. Finally, the effectiveness
    of the model is tested on the testing set, providing an estimation of its real-world
    performance. Figure 4. Sample Data set for leaves with CLR Show All Figure 5.
    Sample Data set for healthy leaves Show All SECTION V. Wireless Sensor Network
    The wireless sensor network (WSN) used in the study played a crucial role in collecting
    and transmitting data from the monitoring area. By strategically deploying wireless
    sensors, the WSN provided a comprehensive coverage of the environment, allowing
    for accurate and timely data collection. This network facilitated real-time monitoring
    and analysis, enabling the researchers to make informed decisions based on the
    captured environmental parameters [8]. The process of data gathering using wireless
    sensors involved four key stages. Initially, the functionality and accuracy of
    all the sensors were tested to ensure their effective operation. Once confirmed,
    calibration was performed to establish appropriate thresholds for each parameter.
    These thresholds were set to trigger alarms and notify the user through GSM technology
    when the readings exceeded the predefined values. In cases where abnormalities
    were related to temperature and humidity, the water pump was also activated. Following
    calibration, the assembly stage involved strategically placing the sensors according
    to their specific usage and functionality. This ensured optimal coverage and accurate
    data collection. Finally, multiple tests were conducted to verify the accuracy
    of the sensors in reading and transmitting data, as well as their ability to trigger
    alarms and notifications effectively. These rigorous tests aimed to ensure the
    reliability and functionality of the wireless sensor network throughout the data
    gathering process. Figure 5. Sample readings from DHT22 sensor Show All Figure
    5.1. Sample readings from NPK sensor Show All SECTION VI. Convolutional Neural
    Network and Wireless Sensor Network Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) are powerful and independent systems that operate in distinct
    ways to address different tasks. CNN is a deep learning architecture designed
    for image recognition and analysis. It processes visual data by extracting relevant
    features through convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers,
    allowing it to classify and detect objects, including diseases in plants like
    Coffee Leaf Rust. On the other hand, WSN is a network of interconnected wireless
    sensors deployed strategically in an area to collect and transmit real-time data
    on environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and NPK (Nitrogen,
    Phosphorous, Potassium) content. It enables remote monitoring and analysis, facilitating
    informed decision-making for agriculture monitoring. While CNN excels in image-based
    tasks, WSN provides comprehensive and timely data collection, enabling users to
    gain valuable insights into the monitored environment. Together, these systems
    are combined to enhance the application by using WSN data as input for CNN to
    improve disease detection accuracy. SECTION VII. Results and Discussion The testing
    phase of the model proved its proficiency in accurately classifying coffee leaves
    as healthy or infected with Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR). The wireless sensor network
    effectively transmitted data to the system application, facilitating real-time
    monitoring of environmental parameters. Notifications were promptly generated
    when the sensor readings surpassed the predefined thresholds, ensuring timely
    awareness of potential issues. Moreover, the system offered practical solutions
    for addressing abnormal readings from NPK and DHT22 sensors. When temperature,
    humidity, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium values deviated from the normal
    range, the system implemented predefined actions, such as activating a water pump
    or taking specific measures to restore optimal conditions [12]–[13]. The integration
    of the model and wireless sensor network provided a comprehensive solution for
    monitoring coffee leaf health. It enabled the identification of CLR-infected leaves
    and timely notifications based on predefined thresholds. Additionally, the ability
    of the system to address abnormal readings from NPK and DHT22 sensor demonstrated
    its practical utility in maintaining optimal conditions for the coffee plants.
    Overall, the combined features of the model and wireless sensor network enhanced
    the detection of CLR and contributed to the effective management and maintenance
    of coffee plant health. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The classification of coffee
    plants as either healthy or diseased was conducted meticulously through multiple
    rounds of testing. To achieve this, we employed the Mobilevnet convolutional neural
    network architecture, known for its excellent image recognition capabilities.
    Our dataset comprised a substantial number of images, providing a diverse range
    of coffee plant samples, which ensured accurate analysis. During the testing phase,
    our objective was to achieve a validation rate of 80%. However, we were delighted
    to find that our results surpassed expectations, demonstrating an impressive accuracy
    rate of 88.14%. This highlights the effectiveness of the Mobilevnet model in precisely
    classifying coffee plants based on their health status. Furthermore, we sought
    to understand the factors influencing the growth and spread of Coffee Leaf Rust
    (CLR) disease. For this purpose, we deployed a network of wireless sensors, thoughtfully
    configured with specific threshold values to detect and monitor relevant environmental
    parameters. The data collected through this sensor network was then meticulously
    analyzed to determine if it accurately reflected the conditions conducive to the
    growth and spread of CLR. The results of this analysis were truly remarkable,
    showing a 100% accuracy rate in transmitting information through the Blynk App
    and GSM technology whenever the sensor readings exceeded the predefined threshold
    values. This achievement underscored the system''s success in promptly notifying
    relevant stakeholders whenever critical conditions for CLR were detected. In conclusion,
    our study demonstrates the exceptional performance of the Mobilevnet model in
    classifying coffee plants as healthy or diseased and showcases the effectiveness
    of our wireless sensor network in accurately detecting and alerting about conditions
    favoring CLR growth. These findings have significant implications for coffee plant
    health management and can greatly benefit coffee growers in safeguarding their
    crops and livelihoods. SECTION IX. Recommendations for Future Work In order to
    further enhance the study, the proponents suggest some key factors for consideration.
    Firstly, it is recommended to carefully calibrate and fine-tune the threshold
    values to align with the specific application and environmental conditions. This
    meticulous adjustment will ensure the accurate detection of anomalies while minimizing
    false alarms, thereby improving the reliability of the system. Secondly, the proper
    placement of wireless sensors is emphasized as essential for obtaining representative
    data and achieving comprehensive coverage. Future researchers are advised to strategically
    distribute the sensors, taking into account the spatial distribution of the monitoring
    area to capture relevant environmental variations effectively. By ensuring a well-thought-out
    placement, the system can collect comprehensive and reliable data, leading to
    more insightful analysis. Furthermore, the proponents suggest designing an intuitive
    and user-friendly interface for system configuration, data visualization, and
    notification management. By prioritizing usability, future researchers can simplify
    the operation of the system, making it easier for users to navigate and interact
    with. An intuitive interface will also facilitate effective user engagement, ensuring
    that stakeholders can fully utilize the system''s capabilities. By considering
    these recommendations and incorporating them into the study, future researchers
    can further enhance the overall performance, reliability, and user experience
    of the system. These improvements will contribute to the successful implementation
    of the system in real-world scenarios, providing practical solutions for monitoring
    and managing agricultural environments. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The researchers sincerely

    Location: Ahmedabad, India SECTION I. Introduction We are tremendously progressing
    towards a technological era, but the advancements and progress done in agriculture
    are relatively less compared to other demanded areas. In rural areas, many farmers
    struggle to keep track of multiple agricultural fields. Crop growth could be adversely
    impacted by sudden and significant climate changes [1], [2]. Although there are
    several remote monitoring systems available in the market, they are not made to
    be economical and are not designed for farmers with relatively little farming
    land. Smart agriculture is a solution to these challenges, which uses advanced
    technology to monitor and control various aspects of agriculture operations. One
    of the key technologies used in smart agriculture is the Internet of Things (IoT),
    which enables wireless communication between sensors and devices [3]. The existing
    wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, ZigBee, LoRa, RFID, mobile communication,
    and bluetooth used in the smart agriculture are analyzed and summarized in [1],
    [4]–[9]. It is concluded that IoT based devices provide useful information on
    a wide range of physical parameters to enhance cultivation practices and crop
    productivity. However, IoT-based agriculture system faces challenges and limitations
    in terms of overall cost, system scalability, data reliability, data storage,
    device standardization, and device connectivity. The LoRa-based smart agriculture
    systems are analyzed in terms of scalability, interoperability, network architecture,
    and energy efficiency [3]. Compared to current communication technologies, LoRa
    has a number of benefits, including long-range communication, low power consumption,
    cost-effectiveness, and resilience. In [10], LoRa-based smart agriculture system
    is developed to transfer multimedia data such as images or video. The LoRa-based
    wireless sensor networks provides smart agricultural monitoring with lower power
    consumption and long range transmission [11]. The Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) based protocols are suited for remote agricultural field monitoring due
    to the advantage of energy efficient transmission [12]. For the IoT to be used
    effectively in agriculture, there are a number of issues with low power consumption
    and long-range transmission. A LoRa communication modem consisting of helical
    antenna is integrated with low power hardware to transmit data from farm areas
    to cloud server [13]. In [14], LoRa-based testbed operating at 433 MHz is developed
    for evaluating both underground-to-underground and undergroundto-aboveground wireless
    communication technologies in situ soils. Non planar omnidirectional and directional
    antennas are integrated with 433 MHz LoRa module. It is noted that most of the
    LoRa based systems makes use of commercially available non planar antennas for
    data transmission. Those antennas are able to provide high gain in the operating
    bandwidth, which helps to improve the overall performance of the system. However,
    non planar antennas faces integration issues with the other circuits [13]–[16].
    In this paper, we propose a smart agriculture monitoring system that uses LoRa
    technology and soil moisture sensors to collect and transmit data on soil moisture
    levels, weather conditions, and other environmental factors that impact agriculture
    operations. The proposed system aims to optimize irrigation and crop management
    practices, leading to increased efficiency and productivity in agriculture. The
    system is tested and evaluated in a controlled environment to determine its effectiveness
    and potential for implementation in real-world agriculture operations. To overcome
    the limitations of existing systems, a low profile compact printed monopole antenna
    is designed and developed for the proposed LoRa based smart agriculture system.
    This antenna operates at an operating frequency of 868 MHz. Planar antennas has
    several advantages such simple design, low cost, low complexity, and provides
    easy integration with the other planar circuits. Rest of the paper is organized
    as follows: Section II presents the overall system design along with geometrical
    design and results of the printed monopole antenna. Section III presents results
    of the proposed smart agriculture system. Concluding remarks are discussed in
    Section IV. SECTION II. System Design Over the years, wireless communication technologies
    such as ZigBee and bluetooth have been prominent to establish low-power, short-range,
    multi-hop networks. Although these standards are considered low-cost systems,
    their restricted coverage is a major drawback that makes them difficult to be
    deployed in major irrigation systems. LoRa is relatively a new technology that
    has got the best cost vs range vs power among its competitors [17]. The proposed
    system makes use of LoRa technology for monitoring remote agricultural fields,
    where frequent maintenance visits are required. This system continuously monitors
    various weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture content.
    The system does not need internet or GPRS as the transmission is done over the
    air. In addition this system will be able to monitor the field remotely, record
    various climatic conditions, weather prediction, and turn ON/OFF pump for watering
    crops remotely. Figure 1 presents the transmitter and receiver section of the
    proposed system. Transmitter section consists of LoRa module SX1276, patch antenna,
    sensor input ports, DC charging section, AC voltage sensing, battery input, onboard
    30 A relays, and ESP-32 WiFi enabled chip. Both the transmitter and receiver sections
    are powered by the inbuilt lithium polymer batteries. In the proposed system mainly
    DHT11 (temperature/humidity sensor) and capacitive soil moisture sensor are used.
    The WiFi enabled microcontroller ESP32 WROOM collects data from all the sensors
    and process it and transmit to the receiver through LoRa module. The receiver
    section consists of the Lora module SX1276, patch antenna, DC charging section,
    DC input, battery input, control switches, and WiFi enabled chip. The transmitter
    unit is fabricated on a double layer FR4 substrate. SX1276 LoRa transceiver and
    ESP32 WROOM are mounted on the top layer of the fabricated Printed Circuit Board
    (PCB). An SMA right-angled connector is added on the topside edge of the PCB,
    as it is a through-hole component it gives greater stability and strength while
    holding the planar antenna. The device is primarily intended for use in isolated
    agricultural fields where electricity may not always be accessible. As a result,
    we developed the device rechargeable to address the problem of power scarcity.
    This system consists of two Lithium Polymer (Li-Po) cells, and the charging is
    regulated and controlled by HY2120 IC and TP5100 IC. Using TP5100 circuitry the
    unit can be directly charged from a solar panel as this IC can handle a wide range
    of voltage inputs from 5 V to 18 V and provide a maximum charging current of 2
    A. The output of the batteries is fed into the unit through MP2307DN-LF-Z IC which
    is a monolithic synchronous buck regulator. It regulates the battery voltage to
    a lesser voltage for powering the unit. The PCB is equipped with two onboard 30
    A relays which can be controlled through the receiver unit as well as through
    mobile using the Blynk IoT platform. These relays can be used for switching any
    high power rated equipment below 30 A rating. Due to the independence of these
    two relays, we can control two distinct devices simultaneously. A significant
    problem for farmers is a sudden voltage loss. We have a live voltage detection
    system made up of ZMPT101B to address this problem. It is an accurate AC voltage
    transformer that may be used to precisely measure the AC voltage. Figure 1 (b)
    depicts the receiver section of the proposed design. Similar to the transmitter
    section, this unit is also fabricated on an FR4 double sided substrate. It mainly
    consists of three switches for controlling the load remotely. Figure 2 shows the
    detail circuit interconnections used in the proposed smart agriculture system.

    of the proposed system. Show All Figure 3 shows geometrical design of the proposed
    printed monopole antenna consisting of microstrip line fed meandered printed monopole
    with a partial ground plane. The proposed antenna is simulated using Finite Element
    Method (FEM) based software Ansys High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) [18].
    Optimized dimensions of the proposed antenna are as follows (in mm): Fw = 3, FL
    = 25, PG = 5, Lp = 35, Gw = 50, and GL = 24. Main radiator is placed on the top
    side of the substrate and partial ground plane on the back side of the substrate.
    The antenna is designed and developed using low cost FR4 substrate with the following
    properties: ϵr= 4.3, h = 1.6 mm, and tanδ = 0.02. Figure 4 shows top and bottom
    view of the fabricated antenna. The antenna is fabricated using standard photolithography
    process and green masking is placed on the antenna to minimize corrosion effects.
    Figure 5 shows reflection characteristics of the proposed antenna. The antenna
    achieves −10 dB impedance bandwidth from 790 MHz to 930 MHz. The antenna produces
    omnidirectional radiation in φ = 90° plane and dipole like radiation pattern in
    the φ = 0° plane, as shown in Figure 6. Gain of the antenna at 868 MHz is found
    to be 1.1 dBi. Fig. 2. Circuit diagrams of the proposed LoRa based smart agriculture

    Show All The user needs to turn on both systems simultaneously. If both systems
    are within a discoverable range, pairing happens instantly; if not, an error message
    is shown. If both units are paired successfully, the receiver unit displays the
    received signal strength. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value
    is converted into a percentage for easy understanding. The system is ready to
    use once it displays range. The fluctuations in temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture content are now visible in real time. If the soil moisture content drops
    below the threshold value, the user is notified, and the pump is automatically
    turned on to water the fields and will be automatically turned off once the field
    is watered. By holding down any switch for longer than ten seconds, the automated
    watering option can be turned off. The pump will only thereafter be turned on
    based on user control. In a LoRa-based agriculture monitoring system a soil moisture
    sensor works by measuring the water content in the soil and transmitting this
    data to a central monitoring system using LoRa technology. The soil moisture sensor,
    DHT 11 sensor, and relay are connected to the LoRa transmitter. The sensors collect
    data about soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, and the relay can be turned
    on or off as required. The LoRa transmitter collects the data from the sensors
    and creates packets of information to be sent over the wireless network. The packets
    include sensor data, a unique identifier for the transmitter, and other relevant
    information such as the time of data collection. The LoRa transmitter then transmits
    the packets of information over the air using LoRa wireless protocol. This protocol
    allows for long-range communication with low power consumption. The LoRa receiver
    processes the packets of information. The processed data is then displayed on
    the LCD display connected to the LoRa receiver. If necessary, the LoRa receiver
    can also control the relay connected to the LoRa transmitter based on the data
    received. Figure 7 shows the prototype of proposed smart agriculture system. The
    entire circuitry is assembled in an IP65-grade waterproof cabinet, which enables
    it to function flawlessly on rainy days. As the cabinet has a transparent polycarbonate
    lid, we might not need to open the lid regularly to check the reading. Fig. 7.
    The proposed smart agriculture system along with the printed monopole antenna.
    Show All The LCD will display all the sensor reading along with the relay status
    and the signal strength. First two characters on the first row will indicate the
    status of both the relays. The signal strength is displayed at the end of first
    row of the 20×4 character LCD in percentage. Similarly the temperature and humidity
    data are displayed on the next line. The temperature displayed will be in degree
    Celsius and the relative humidity is in percentage. The third line will show the
    soil moisture level, while the fourth line displays raining status and the status
    of the water pump. The automatic watering can be enabled or disabled using the
    switch SW1. An additional relay is also provided and can be activated using the
    second switch SW2. If the controller does not receive any signal from the transceiver
    for more than ten seconds the controller will alert the user by displaying an
    error message on the display until a proper signal is received. The IoT dashboard
    will also show the live status from the controller, as shown in Figure 8. The
    controller is connected to the IoT server via the onboard Wi-Fi. It will show
    the humidity, temperature, soil moisture, raining status, both relay active status
    in text as well as in graph format. The dash board also has built in switches
    to control the pump and additional relays through internet. All control and data
    acquisition options are enabled on the IoT dashboard. The developed unit is deployed
    in the agricultural field and tested in real-time using the proposed antenna.
    The transmitter and receiver unit are kept in a Line-of-Sight (LOS) medium at
    about a separation distance of 25 m, as shown in Figure 9. Transmitter unit is
    kept in the field with capacitive soil moisture sensor immersed in the soil. Rain
    sensor and Temperature/Humidity sensor is kept along with the unit. The system
    provided around 50% range at about 25 meters of LOS communication. All the data,
    including the sensor reading, is displayed in the 20×4 LCD Display, and the RSSI
    value is transformed to a percentage value for ease of understanding. Fig. 8.

    and inexpensive IoT network is developed for smart agriculture. The proposed is
    capable of measurement of factors affecting production and quality of crops and
    can be used to increase the efficiency in agricultural management. Soil moisture
    sensors are used to record the parameters such as humidity and temperature. LoRa
    based technology is used to transmit the data over long distances. The proposed
    systems makes use of printed monopole antenna operating in the 868 MHz band. The
    use of sensors in LoRa based systems allows for real time monitoring of the temperature
    and humidity levels, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    crop management, and other agriculture practices. This will lead to increased
    efficiency, productivity, and sustainability in agriculture. Authors Figures References

  description: The heat stress due to the progressive increase in the earth's atmospheric
    temperature impacts plant growth endangering ecosystem quality and world food
    security. Such less favorable climatic conditions create greater risks that affect
    crop production as well as threatens food security. Tracking plant health can
    help mitigate the heat stress due to global warming. Technology plays a central
    role in mitigating the pressure the farming industry is facing. Smart sensor systems
    take advantage of machine learning algorithms and modern computer hardware to
    create a smart node that is tailored specifically for sensing applications. These
    sensor systems combine ML and IoT technologies to assist the agriculture industry
    with innovative ideas and technological advancements to increase yields and improve
    farm performance. Also, having a good machine learning model with good performance
    could help farmers and governments to make early decisions to mitigate the impact
    of environmental changes that reduce the quantity or quality of crops. In our
    research, we attempt to detect heat stress by using an in-situ ML-enabled subsurface
    sensor system in an agricultural field so that the device can independently make
    inferences. The sensor node is buried in the soil and we need a machine-learning
    model to predict the ambient temperature based on the soil characteristics data
    and the heat stress would be detected using the ambient temperature. In order
    to find a machine learning model, a publicly available dataset with the soil variables
    was evaluated for performance using different machine learning algorithms to predict
    the air temperature at the subsurface. This trained ML model would be deployed
    in an FPGA in the field that is equipped with soil sensors. The heat stress metric
    is based on the ambient temperature and duration of exposure to heat that would
    be wirelessly transmitted from the node. This paper discusses the development
    of the software framework for the subsurface wireless sensor node.

    IEEE Conference Location: Valencia, Spain SECTION I. Introduction Climate change
    and global warming have resulted in an ever-increasing temperature which is a
    major environmental stressor. The global average temperature has increased by
    0.6°C during the last century due to greenhouse emissions and if the current rates
    continue then this will exacerbate the climate changes and may result in 2–6°C
    warmer temperatures with more frequent occurrence of extreme events(heat, drought,
    cold, floods, etc.). The ensuing heat stress severely impacts plant growth, endangering
    ecosystem quality and world food security [1] . The main industry which is affected
    by this increase in global temperature is agriculture as this has a significant
    impact on its productivity [2] . Each species of plant requires an optimal growth
    temperature and root-zone temperature for its overall development. Long-term exposure
    to elevated temperatures can slow down plant growth, increase the evaporation
    rate and reduce the nutritional uptake rate. According to the United Nations’
    prediction data on population and hunger, the world population will increase by
    2 billion people by 2050 and it requires a 60% increase in food production to
    feed them [3] . In the US alone, growing, processing, and distributing food is
    a $1.7 trillion business, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic
    Research Service. As the agriculture sector continues to be suffering from climate
    change, the challenges of less favorable climatic conditions thrive greater risk
    of threatening food security and crop losses. Technology plays a key role in mitigating
    the pressure faced in the agriculture domain. The latest emerging trends like
    Blockchain technology, cloud computing, Internet of Things(IoT), Artificial Intelligence,
    Machine Learning(ML), and Deep Learning(DL) are already showing their potential
    to improve agriculture practices to improve yields and minimize losses [4] . The
    recent advancements in the Machine learning domain have resulted in many sectors
    like healthcare, robotics, banking, finance, security, biochemistry, etc. benefiting
    from its real-world application [5] . The advantage of using machine learning
    is the ability to learn non-linear patterns from the data and its ability to reveal
    the hidden relationship between different parameters which traditionally might
    be a time-consuming process or even difficult for a domain expert. Also, there
    is a growing amount of data available due to rapid advancement in wireless sensor
    networks which can be used for gaining knowledge in the agriculture sector. The
    machine learning algorithms progressively adapt to enhance their performance as
    the number of training samples increases. This results in minimal human intervention
    along with better decision-making [6] . Heat stress is defined as the rise in
    temperature beyond a threshold level for a period that causes irreversible damage
    to overall plant growth and development [7] . Heat stress is a serious threat
    to crop production worldwide [8] . There is an imbalance in photosynthesis, respiration,
    and conductivity and it has deleterious effects at high temperatures. As plants
    lack locomotion, they should tolerate stress. Extreme heat stress reduces plant
    photosynthetic and transpiration efficiencies and negatively impacts plant root
    development which collectively reduces the agricultural yield [9] . The impact
    of heat stress depends on the developmental stage of the plants [10] . Plants
    produce chemical signals in response to stress. Given the high content of chemical
    signals in the soil, sensing these signals would allow an early reliable detection
    of plant stress. Plant researchers have indicated that plant injury on exposure
    to high temperatures yields a sigmoidal response in beans [11] , tomato [12] ,
    citrus, etc. Heat stress can be visually identified in plants by stumped plant
    growth, wilted leaves, no fruiting, fruits developing different colors other than
    normal, dry leaf edges, smaller fruit size, etc. Our goal is to develop a wireless
    sensor network system in an agricultural field, with a sensor node embedded with
    communication and sensing components buried underground in an agriculture field
    for real-time monitoring of heat stress in plants. The wireless sensor network
    comprising of the sensor nodes, mobile sink, and base station is shown in Fig.
    1 . There are two types of communication involved in the network: subsurface wireless
    communication and subsurface to above-ground wireless communication. The subsurface
    to above ground communication has been evaluated in our previous work [13] . The
    subsurface wireless IoT sensor node comprises of four modules as shown in Fig.
    2 . The sensors refer to the off-shelf sensors that measure soil temperature,
    soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and other soil properties at a depth
    where it is buried. The wireless transceiver would enable wireless communication
    between the base station, mobile sinks, and sensor nodes. The software module
    at the sensor node provides real-time decision-making that is deployed in the
    node after studying the data patterns in a dataset. The decision making module
    comprises of two components: ML model and a Mathematical model as in Fig. 3 .
    These two blocks are sequential to one another and the output of the ML model
    is sent as input to the Mathematical model that would give a final output to be
    wirelessly transmitted. The ML Model helps in predicting the ambient temperature
    based on soil characteristics and the mathematical model provides a heat stress
    metric based on ambient temperature and duration of exposure. The ML model to
    predict ambient temperature based on soil characteristics would be given by T
    a =f(EC,VWC, T s ,D) (1) View Source where T a refers to the ambient temperature,
    EC refers to soil electrical conductivity, T s is the soil temperature and D refers
    to the depth at which the soil data is collected. T a is passed as an input to
    the mathematical model that outputs a heat stress metric, H that lies between
    0 and 1, given by H=f( T a ,t) (2) View Source where T a refers to the ambient
    temperature and t refers to the duration of exposure to heat. There has been promising
    research in agricultural applications of wireless underground sensor networks
    such as monitoring soil properties, toxic substances, etc [14] . Also as the subsurface
    nodes are deployed at a safe depth in the ground, it does not cause disturbance,
    damage, and movement during soil rotation. To the best of our knowledge, this
    is the first work that proposes to use in-situ inferencing using machine learning
    algorithms in an embedded wireless underground sensor node. While this is not
    a first study to use machine learning approaches to solve an agricultural problem,
    the novelty of our work lies in the fact that we are using subsurface soil properties
    to predict ambient temperature and map it with a heat stress surface. Fig. 1 Wireless

    the decision making framework that comprises of ML model and the mathematical
    model are discussed. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the
    background and literature review. Section 3 is the methodology and model development,
    and Section 4 discusses the results. Section 5 concludes the research and Section
    6 discusses the future work. SECTION II. Background and Literature Review Machine
    learning is broadly divided into two categories, Supervised and Unsupervised learning
    where the former uses labeled data to train a model whereas the latter relies
    on finding hidden patterns from the unlabeled data. Supervised learning is used
    for classification and regression applications, where the output is a categorical
    and continuous variable respectively. Unsupervised learning is used for clustering
    and dimensionality reduction applications.. The application of machine learning
    in agriculture was investigated during the literature review. In today’s world
    due to the availability of large datasets and systems with high computational
    power, the research community is trying its best to solve a lot of complex problems
    in agriculture. The ML algorithms make it possible to extract crucial information
    from large complex datasets based on mathematical and statistical methods. Fig.

    Show All Precision agriculture refers to the strategy of adopting high-technology
    sensor data analysis in the agriculture domain to improve quality and productivity.
    Precision agriculture is an emerging tool to address the challenges faced in agriculture
    through predictive analysis. We conducted a comprehensive review on the various
    applications of machine learning in agriculture and also analyzed the commonly
    used algorithms. The authors in [15] have reviewed the commonly used classification
    and regression algorithms in precision agriculture with different areas of focus
    such as prediction of soil parameters, crop yield prediction, disease and weed
    detection, drip irrigation, etc. The applications of IoT and data analytics as
    a smart system in agriculture along with its challenges were discussed in [16]
    and the authors proposed a prediction model of Apple disease in the apple orchards
    of Kashmir valley using data analytics and Machine learning in the IoT system.
    N. Materne and M. Inoue [17] experimented to use an IoT system in farmland for
    data collection and analysis for identifying a prediction model to predict the
    outbreaks of plantation diseases with better accuracy. The authors [17] evaluated
    the performance of KNN, RF, Logistic and Linear regression on an environmental
    dataset collected from farmland using sensors to predict the outbreak of agricultural
    pests and diseases [17] . Thomas Troung et. al [18] designed an IoT system that
    sends real-time environmental data to cloud storage and a machine learning system
    based on SVM to assist in predicting the conditions for fungal diseases in a local
    crop field using this stored environmental data. Alizamir et al. [19] presented
    a data-driven approach to predict soil temperature at four different depths using
    extreme learning machine learning(ELM), artificial neural networks(ANN), classification
    and regression trees(CART), and group method of data handling(GMDH) using climatic
    variables from a public dataset of a meteorological station. In [20] the authors
    proposed a smart agriculture system to improve the yield of a field where a wireless
    sensor network is used to collect data from a field and used deep learning techniques
    LSTM, GRU, and Feedforward neural network to learn and train soil and environmental
    data to predict the suitable crop to be sowed. The authors in [21] used weather
    data from four stations to study the impact of the look-back period to estimate
    soil temperature using linear, SVM, ensemble, and ANN regression models. S. Dimitriadis
    et. al [22] demonstrated the application of machine learning to predict water
    stress in plants using an experimental dataset with environmental parameters.
    Feng et. Al [23] investigated the modeling of half-hourly soil temperature using
    extreme learning machine(ELM), Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN),
    back propagation neural networks (BPNN), and Random forests (RF) on a meteorological
    dataset collected by field experiment. Singh et al. [24] presented an application
    to optimize irrigation in an IoT smart irrigation framework by determining soil
    moisture using field data collected from deployed sensors and weather forecast
    data using machine learning algorithms(Multiple Linear Regression(MLR), Elastic
    net Regression(ENR), Gradient Boosting Regression Trees(GBRT), and Random Forests
    Regressor). N. Nahvi et. al [25] used a public dataset to predict soil temperature
    at six different depths using a self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine
    (SaE-ELM). Also we investigated into how the high temperature and exposure time
    could be modelled mathematically and how the agriculture researchers detect heat
    stress. The agriculture community mainly uses electrolyte leakage assay and TTC
    test to evaluate the plant responses to heat stress. Plant researchers rely on
    developed mathematical models to predict plant responses to temperature stress.
    Each plant has its own unique response curve and is appropriately determined by
    data fitting. Several studies have indicated that plant response to heat stress
    is sigmoidal i.e. when the degree of injury is plotted as a function of temperature
    a sigmoidal response has been shown [11] [12] [26] [27] . The theory is that when
    plant is subjected to stress the electrical conductivity of the plant increases
    that means that plant releases chemicals when subjected to heat stress. The degree
    of heat stress is influenced by high temperatures and duration of heat exposure.
    SECTION III. Methodology This section discusses the computations involved during
    the development of the machine learning model and the mathematical model for heat
    stress detection. The software module first predicts the ambient temperature using
    the machine learning model and then uses this ambient temperature as an input
    to the mathematical model that outputs a heat stress metric. A. Machine Learning
    model Our main objective was to find hidden patterns to explore the interrelationships
    between the soil variables to predict the ambient temperature above the soil.
    The goal of this study is to find a ML model that can be used in our subsurface
    wireless IoT sensor node system. We have developed a machine-learning regression
    model after evaluating it with few ML algorithms and assessing the performance.
    The soil environmental dataset used in this study was obtained from literature
    data [28] located in Colorado, United States. The data which we considered for
    training comprised data collected at various depths(10,20,30,50,75,100,130 cm)
    below the soil that had hourly measurements. The soil environmental dataset used
    for machine learning model development comprised of the following attributes which
    are all continuous values- Soil Temperature(°C): It is an indicator of the measurement
    of the warmth of the soil. An ideal soil temperature is essential for various
    biochemical processes to ensure optimal crop growth and development. Electrical
    conductivity(dS/m): It is a parameter that measures the amount of salts in the
    soil. It is used in the agricultural community as an indicator of soil health
    [29] . The measurement of EC gives insight into crop yields, amounts of nitrogen
    usage, water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, rooting depth, etc. Volumetric
    Water Content: It is a numerical measure between 0 and 1 indicated by the ratio
    of water volume to the soil volume. This parameter is an indicator of soil moisture.
    TABLE I Summary Statistics of the dataset Soil depth (cm): It indicates the depth
    at which the soil data are collected by the sensors. Air Temperature(°C): It is
    the measured ambient temperature above the soil. The summary statistics of the
    dataset are provided in Table I . The dataset in our study comprised of 56861
    data points which are hourly sampled data from 2016–2018. The following subsection
    details each of the models developed in this study to predict air temperature
    and the performance metrics used for assessment. The models which were used for
    evaluation were chosen are the ones that help in the predictive analysis of highly
    nonlinear data. 1) XGBoost Regressor XGBoost also known as Extreme gradient boosting
    is a supervised machine-learning algorithm using a gradient-boosting decision
    tree proposed in 2016 [30] . It builds a model comprising of multiple decision
    trees and works well with structural and tabular datasets. Assuming that the model
    has trained for t-1 rounds, the model should train for t-round according to the
    residual as shown in the formulae: f (t) i = ∑ k=1 t f k ( x i )= f (t−1) i +
    f t ( x i ) (3) View Source where x is the input variable, f t (x i ) is the learner
    at the time step t, f (t) i and f (t−1) i are the predicted values at the time
    step t and t-1 respectively. The XGB model was introduced to evaluate the superiority
    of the model over the original model to prevent overfitting by adding training
    loss that measures how well the model fits into the training data and regularization
    term that measures complexity of trees: Ob j (t) = ∑ k=1 n l( y i , y i ^ (t−1)
    + f t ( x i ))+ ∑ k=1 t Ω( f i ) (4) View Source l is the loss function, ŷ i is
    generated from the accumulation of the residual trees, n is the observed value,
    Ω is the regularization term, and is expressed as: Ω( f t )=γT+ 1 2 λ|||ω| | 2
    (5) View Source where T in the above equation represents the number of leaves
    of the tree, ω is the weight vector, λ is the regularization parameter and γ is
    the minimum loss parameter. 2) Support Vector Machine(SVM) Support Vector Machine(
    SVM) are supervised learning method used to solve classification and regression
    problems by finding a hyperplane in n-dimensional space to distinctly classify
    the data points [31] . The decision boundary is called a hyperplane. The data
    points that influence the position and orientation of this hyperplane are called
    support vectors. The hyperplane is separated from the support vectors by a distance
    called a margin. The objective of SVM is to find a hyperplane that maximizes this
    margin. SVM can handle highly non-linear data using kernel tricks where the input
    data is transformed to a higher dimensional space using a mapping function. The
    commonly used kernels in SVM are linear, radial basis function, polynomial and
    sigmoid. If we have dataset [(x 1 , y 1 ),(x 2 , y 2 ),....,(x n , y n )] with
    n observations where x is input and y is the output, then f(x)=ω.ϕ(x)+b (6) View
    Source where ϕ ( x ) is the result of the nonlinear transformation of training
    data, ω is the weight vector, and b is the deviation term. Coefficients are estimated
    by minimizing the canonical risk function: R(C)= 1 2 ||ω| | 2 + C n ∑ i=1 n L
    ϵ ( y i ,f( x i )) (7) View Source L ϵ ( y i ,f( x i ))={ |f( x i )− y i |−ϵ,when|f(
    x i )− y i |≥ϵ 0,otherwise View Source The slack variables ξ and ξ * are introduced
    into the equation, || ω || is the norm of the ω parameter vector. Therefore, the
    regression problem can be transformed as a constrained optimization problem: min[
    1 2 ||ω| | 2 +C ∑ i=1 n ( ξ i + ξ ∗ i )] (8) View Source constraints as follows:
    ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ y i −(ω.ϕ( x i )+ b i )≥ϵ+ ξ i (ω.ϕ( x i )+ b i )− y i ≥ϵ+ ξ ∗ i ξ i
    , ξ ∗ i ≥0 View Source where C is the penalty factor and ∊ is the loss function,
    the constrained optimization problem is solved by Lagrange method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
    condition method L= C ∑ i=1 n ( ξ i , ξ ∗ i )+ 1 2 ||ω| | 2 − ∑ i=1 n a(ωϕ( x
    i )+b− y i +ϵ+ ξ i ) − ∑ i=1 n a ∗ i ( y i −ωϕ( x i )−b+ϵ+ ξ ∗ i )− ∑ i=1 n (
    β ∗ i ξ ∗ i + β i ξ i ) (9) View Source where L is the Lagrangian number, and
    β and β * , a and a * are Lagrangian multipliers. We have used the radial basis
    function kernel in our study which is given by k( x i ,x)=exp( −||x− x i | | 2
    2 σ 2 ) (10) View Source where σ represents the kernel extension parameter. Fig.
    4 Neural Network Architecture Show All 3) Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) An Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) is a type of machine learning approach that was developed
    inspired by biological neurons. ANN is an interconnected group of nodes(where
    each node is called a neuron) that comprises an input layer, hidden layers, and
    output layers. The neurons of each layer connect to the previous layer and the
    layer following the neurons. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons
    can vary. Each neuron in the ANN is assigned a weight and bias that is adjusted
    during the training process based on its objective. The nonlinearity in the network
    is introduced by activation functions in each layer before being passed to the
    next layer. The neural network developed in our study is shown in Fig. 4 which
    is visualized using netron software. B. Evaluation metrics In regression models,
    the performance of the model is evaluated by measuring how accurately the model
    predicted the target value. The results of the metrics influence the decision-making
    process to choose the type of machine learning algorithm for implementation. The
    three evaluation metrics computed in this study to indicate the performance of
    different models are given by equations 11 , 12 and 13 where N represents the
    total number of observations, y i represents the actual value and ŷ i represents
    the predicted value of the i th observation. Fig. 5 Mathematical model Show All

    agricultural community use electrolyte leakage as an indicator of high-temperature
    injury. Hence in our approach, we have used the rescaled electrolyte leakage as
    a heat stress metric. We have taken a dataset collected by the authors from literature
    where tomatoes are subjected to heat stress [12] . The dataset comprises of the
    Temperature(°C), Exposure time (min), and Electrolyte leakage(%). As the plant
    response to heat stress is indicated by the electrolyte leakage, we have re-scaled
    the Electrolyte leakage(%) to between 0 and 1 as an indicator of heat stress.
    The details about the fitted model and the corresponding equations obtained in
    our study are discussed in the next section SECTION IV. Results and Discussion
    We performed the computations on an Nvidia DGX A100 server ( 8xNVIDIA A100 40GB
    Tensor Core GPUs, 320 GB GPU Memory, 1TB system memory, Dual AMD Rome 7742 CPUs
    totalling 128 cores with 2 hardware threads per core) for high-performance computing
    using 3.8.10 version of python. The idea was to make use of GPU resources to speed
    up training process. The imported libraries for the analysis include numpy, xgboost,
    pandas, scikitlearn, matplotlib, xgboost, tensorflow, keras, pickle, seaborn.
    The machine learning models developed in this study were evaluated for performance
    in terms of mean square error(MSE), root mean square error( RMSE), and mean absolute
    error(MAE) metrics on the testing dataset which were discussed in the previous
    section. TABLE II Hyperparameters considered for Hyper-parameter tuning TABLE
    III Performance Metrics in °C on Training set The dataset was divided into training,
    validation, and testing datasets that comprised 60%, 20%, and 20% of the size
    of the original dataset resulting in a division of the 56861 sample dataset into
    34116, 11372 and 11373 training, validation, and testing samples respectively.
    Each algorithm considered had its own hyperparameters that influenced how a model
    learns relationships from the data. Over 10000 model configurations were evaluated
    with a cross-validation value of K = 5. To find the optimal hyperparameters, RandomizedsearchCV
    was employed to reduce the computational time. Table II shows the list of hyperparameters
    that were evaluated for each algorithm. Hyperparameter tuning is an important
    step in a machine learning model development as it contributes to the model’s
    predictive performance. The performance metrics obtained in our study are shown
    in Tables III , IV and V which indicate the values obtained in training, validation,
    and testing data. The best-performing model of XGBoost and SVM was saved in .pickle
    format and the neural network model was saved as .h5 format. We have chosen the
    MAE to identify the best model as we deal with the temperature and require greater
    interpretability. TABLE IV Performance Metrics in °C on Validation set TABLE V
    Performance Metrics in °C on Testing set The XGboost model was evaluated for performance
    for various configurations by varying the hyperparameters namely max depth, n
    estimators, learning rate, min child weight, gamma, max delta step, alpha, col
    sample by tree,etc. There was a significant improvement in performance when the
    hyperparameters considered were only max depth, n estimators, learning rate. The
    performance did not improve much when the rest of the hyperparameters were used
    as there was no improvement in the tenth’s decimal place though the improvement
    was there for the hundredth’s decimal place in the accuracy of the MAE value.
    The SVM machine learning model was optimized using the hyperparameters-kernel,
    C, gamma, epsilon-using the scikit learn framework. We have used the rbf kernel
    as it is widely used in a variety of applications because of its ability to capture
    the non-linear relationships between the input features, robustness to ovefitting
    and efficiently handling noisy data. SVM was the most time consuming algorithm
    yielding poor results in the study. The dataset in this study was trained with
    shallow neural networks, namely two layers, three layers, and four-layer neural
    networks. Neural networks with two, three, and four hidden layers yielded performance
    with decreasing MAE along the same range as 3.5 °C, 2.9 °C and 3.4 °C respectively.
    Among the neural networks evaluated, the three hidden layer neural network showed
    the smallest MAE. We have evaluated only up to four hidden layers as the rule
    of thumb is to keep the number of hidden layers upto the number of features which
    is four in our case. It was observed that increasing the number of epochs helped
    reduce the MAE. We evaluated up to 20000 epochs range and did not increase the
    epochs further as it might lead to overfitting. The greater the number of epochs
    the model was trained for the better the model performance. We used K folds cross-validation
    with K = 5 and Randomized Search CV to obtain the best learning results in our
    predictive modeling. The value of K=5 or 10 is a common choice for large datasets.
    To check the behavior with different values of K we evaluated the search with
    K = 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30. Changing the K to a higher value of 10, 20 and 30
    did not yield much better results. This indicated that there is not much to learn
    for the model. The results indicated that XGBoost is the best performer that could
    predict air temperature accurately upto 2.7°C and SVM showed worst performance
    of the algorithms chosen. The conclusion was assessed in terms of testing dataset
    as it is unseen data to the model. XGBoost had the least running time while SVM
    required the most running time. Though there were several works that tried to
    predict ambient temperature as a function of weather data features through our
    work we explore the possibility of using machine learning to predict air temperature
    from soil properties which is unique about our approach. After the training process,
    we also computed the inferencing time for the models developed in our study which
    was 0.8 ms, 2.6 ms and 15ms for XGBoost, SVM, and Neural Network respectively.
    For fitting the mathematical model we used nonlinear modeling in MATLAB to get
    a suitable surface to predict heat stress for our data points. The data-points
    were obtained from literature data as discussed in the previous section. The predicted
    ambient temperature and the exposure of heat duration would give a heat stress
    metric between 0 and 1. The fitted model shown in Fig. 5 is given by the equation
    below z=f(x,y)=−18.8964+5.5821x−0.27604y−0.12507 x 2 0.0078161xy+0.00089812 x
    3 −0.07096 x 2 y (14) View Source where x is the heat stress metric, y is the
    duration of exposure and z is the ambient temperature The heat stress from the
    surface corresponding to temperature and duration of exposure could be determined
    by using the mathematical model. This heat stress metric generated by this heat
    stress surface would be wirelessly transmitted. SECTION V. Conclusion Wireless
    subsurface networks is a promising area of research with a lot of potential applications
    in precision agriculture. In this work, we performed computations to find a decision
    making framework that comprises of a regression ML Model to predict ambient temperature
    and mathematical model to quantify heat stress in plants. Our results indicated
    that XGBoost is the best machine-learning model that could accurately predict
    ambient temperature as a function of soil sensor values accurately upto 2.7°C
    among the models chosen for evaluation. We also fit a mathematical surface that
    provides a heat stress metric that indicates high-temperature plant injury. The
    use of machine learning in agriculture can help in better decision-making to improve
    food security. This paper also discusses the subsurface wireless sensor network
    architecture which we wish to deploy. SECTION VI. Future Work We would quantize
    and deploy the model in an FPGA SoC with soil sensors that measure soil temperature,
    soil volumetric content, soil electrical conductivity and bury it at different
    depths as a next step to validate the model. As a future scope in this study,
    we can use a dataset with greater features for the development of the machine
    learning model. Also, different crops would show different responses to heat stress,
    we are planning to explore datasets for other crops for heat stress modeling.
    We are also considering performing heat stress experiments in our lab for mathematical
    modelling of crop response. Another aspect to consider is how different soil types
    influence the behaviour of the machine learning model developed in this study.
    Additonally future work would also include the study of wireless communication
    aspect such as signal strength and range between two sensor nodes in soil. Authors

  description: Agriculture is a critical resource for survival of all living things
    on earth. Agriculture also provides most of the food and fabrics to the world.
    Environmental changes have impacted today's agriculture and it has slowed down
    the productivity of crops. Shortage of water and pests are the major issue that

    all living things on earth. Agriculture also provides most of the food and fabrics
    to the world. Environmental changes have impacted today’s agriculture and it has
    slowed down the productivity of crops. Shortage of water and pests are the major
    issue that mitigates the yield in agriculture. To sort out these issues, experts
    and researchers have proposed new processes and adoption of new technologies like
    Internet of Things (IoT), Smart sensors, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Image

    Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture is the practice
    of cultivating to sustain life on earth. Over a period of time, lot of innovations
    have been adopted in cultivation process to combat the changing environment. This
    innovation includes usage of new technologies and instruments to increase production
    quality, efficiency, and decrease crop damage from the environment. The foundation
    and backbone of the Indian economy is agriculture [1]. It has been noted that
    the agriculture industry has made relatively little progress over the last ten
    years. Implementation of technologies like wireless sensor networks could highlight
    their vital contribution to precision farming. The given below Figure 1 shows
    the Classification in Smart Farming. Figure 1 – Classification in Smart Farming
    Show All A wireless sensor network comprises of large number of sensor nodes deployed
    in a random manner to monitor a physical phenomenon of the environment and they
    work as a cooperative network. Each sensor nodes consists of a CPU, memory, sensor
    and a communication device [2]. These sensor nodes have constraint in processing
    power, memory capacity and energy and yet the design of WSN has made it simpler
    to handle problems like monitoring of different types of soil and their ingredients.
    Sensor networks can be used in all regions and they are very economical and portable.
    WSN were utilized to support farmers and numerous experimental investigations
    on the agriculture sectors. This aids in gathering data on the many sensor kinds
    that were employed to keep an eye on the agricultural land. Pest assault is one
    of the greatest problems that the plant faces, and one of the primary problems
    that all farmers experience is that the infection cannot be recognized in the
    earlier stages when it is done manually. IoT along with image processing technique
    is used to gather information about the presence of plant disease and their detection
    of disease at an early stage. The implementation of the Internet of Things (IOT)
    in agriculture along with fungicides and pesticides has resulted in smart and
    precision farming. The usage of modern technologies includes Smart farming, pest
    control and soil monitoring. Figure 2 represents the architecture of IOT in Smart
    Farming. Figure 2 – Architecture of IoT in Smart Farming Show All SECTION II.
    Related Work Many solutions are implemented in order to get benefited in modern
    agriculture. Such techniques help in many ways in Smart Agriculture. Certain techniques
    which are published by experts are listed in Figure 3. Figure 3 – Technology domains
    in Smart Agriculture Show All A. Technology 1) Internet of things Network of Things
    New digital agriculture is made possible by smart technology. Technology is now
    a must-have to overcome today''s issues, and many industries are automating jobs
    with the newest technologies. By maximizing the use of fertilizers to increase
    plant efficiency, advanced agriculture, which is WSN, which is a key component
    of precision agriculture technology based on the Internet of Things, aims to help
    farmers and producers cut waste and increase productivity. agriculture. It allows
    farmers more control over their animals, crop growth, cost and resource reduction,
    and livestock. Smart farming has enabled farmers to reduce waste and boost output
    by utilizing sensors for light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc. and
    irrigation system automation. [3] [4] Furthermore, farmers may check on the state
    of their fields from anywhere with the aid of these sensors. Advanced farming
    based on the IOT is far more effective than traditional farming. Intelligent agriculture
    uses are not limited to conventional, large- scale farming [5] [6]. In addition
    to operations, new levers could be used to support other emerging or well-established
    agricultural trends, such as organic farming and family farming (complicated or
    constrained spaces, specific animals and/or cultures, preservation of particular
    or superior kinds, etc.) [7]. Smart agriculture based on the Internet of Things
    creates a system to keep an eye on the environment using sensors that can detect
    things like temperature, light, humidity, soil moisture, etc The irrigation system
    should then be automated, and using an Internet of Things Analytics Platform,
    farmers should be able to remotely monitor the state of their fields [8] [9] [10].
    To further improve the intelligence and accuracy of the agricultural process,
    precision agriculture is used. In terms of farming and animal husbandry, this
    increases the control and precision of agricultural activity. The use of IT and
    additional components, such as sensors, agricultural drones, autonomous vehicles,
    control systems, automated hardware, robotics, variable speed technology, and
    others, Internet of Things-based Advanced Farming is essential. Usage of IoT in
    Smart Farming is shown in fig4 Figure 4 – Usage of IoT in Smart Farming Show All
    2) Wireless sensor network A self-organizing network is a wireless sensor network.
    For monitoring purposes, WSN can be installed in a variety of situations. WSN
    has numerous important applications in the fields of agriculture, weather monitoring,
    military surveillance, and health monitoring. The use of wireless sensor networks
    in agriculture has grown in popularity recently. The use of WSN in precision agriculture
    makes it possible to assess a variety of environmental variables, including temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and soil PH. By using precision farming, crop quality
    can be improved. management and wireless sensor technologies. Tools can be used
    to detect various crop diseases, excessive pesticide use, etc [11]. In order to
    assist farmers, this research suggests an effective usage of sensor networks in
    precision agriculture This paper describes the types of sensors used in precision
    agriculture as well as the agricultural fields where they are used. It also makes
    suggestions regarding the environmental factors that affect agriculture. This
    study examines the ways in which agricultural wireless sensor network (WSN) applications
    are discussed in the most recent academic literature. To ascertain the temporal
    distribution of WSN research, the most effective journals, the most cited authors,
    the most significant studies, and the most pertinent keywords, 2444 articles were
    collected from the Scopus database and analyzed using bibliometric methods. The
    appropriate literature was segmented, and a term co-occurrence network was created
    was created using the computer tool VOS viewer. The results demonstrate the extraordinary
    expansion of WSN research in recent years. Additionally recognized were the top
    publications, nations referenced, and research with the highest impact. The major
    findings from the comprehensive study and keyword co-occurrence clustering show
    that WSN is an essential tool for precision farming [12] The involvement of other
    technologies, including the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence,
    and unmanned aerial vehicles in assisting various agricultural tasks, such as
    smart irrigation and soil management, is another area of WSN research. This study
    clarifies the perspectives of researchers and practitioners on the topics that
    have been studied and identifies potential areas for further investigation [13]
    Sensor networks are utilized in a wide range of applications, including site security,
    safety management, environmental monitoring, machine monitoring, wireless data
    gathering and maintenance, smart buildings and roadways, and many others. Additionally,
    WSN has task management, power management, and mobility management planes. Figure
    5 represents about WSN in Smart Farming. Figure 5 – WSN in Smart Farming Show
    All 3) Image processing The necessity to efficiently develop a plant and boost
    its output is crucial due to the rising demand in the agriculture sector. It''s
    critical to keep an eye on the plant both during its growing stage and when it''s
    being harvested in order to achieve this. In this study, image processing is employed
    as a method to track fruit disease outbreaks from planting through harvest. Artificial
    neural network theory is applied for this aim Two apple illnesses and three grape
    diseases have been chosen. The system makes use of two image databases, one for
    query image implementation and the other for training with disease images that
    have already been saved. For training database weight adjustments, the back propagation
    idea is applied. Three feature vectors— color, texture, and morphology—are used
    to classify and map the photos to the appropriate illness categories. Morphology
    provides a 90% accurate result from these feature vectors, which is more than
    the other two feature vectors. This study presents efficient algorithms for mango
    counting and disease propagation. MATLAB has been used to implement neural networks
    in practice [14]. For image classification, pattern extraction, and feature extraction,
    there are numerous mathematical and computer algorithms that are applied to the
    images. It has made it possible to apply a wide range of algorithms to the input
    image, including methods for removing issues like noise and image distortion.
    In order to identify rodents and detect illness in a crop, it uses a variety of
    Fourier transformation and filtering techniques on the source photos. 4) Artificial
    Intelligence Predicting crop output is challenging since so many variables, including
    environment and genotype, are involved. After gaining a grasp of how these factors
    affect agricultural yields, we can accurately estimate future yields. Artificial
    intelligence can help with it. Crop yield can be predicted by providing the proper
    datasets to the right computers [15] [16]. AI systems have the ability to effectively
    predict crop yield over time by using historical crop yield data and comparing
    it to more recent data. Growers will be able to make data- driven decisions about
    managing their farms with the help of accurate yield forecast. Let''s not overlook
    their financial situation [17]. Farmers can use AI systems to measure the quantity
    of light that reaches the leaves of their crops. They can change crop spacing
    to make space for sunlight penetration if some plants are not getting enough sunlight.
    It is expensive and time-consuming to manually observe the foliage gap.AI systems
    with visual capabilities can also track and evaluate the daily changes in plants
    to estimate their growth rate. These systems can employ information from thermal
    cameras, satellite imaging, and infrared sensors [18]. The future of the agricultural
    sector is AI and smart farming. They will enhance farming by assisting in the
    early detection of crop pests and illnesses while raising the calibre of the harvest.
    AI-based crop yield prediction that is accurate will assist nations in achieving
    food security. As you can see, artificial intelligence has significant advantages
    for the agricultural sector [19]. It enables more strategic operation, greater
    effectiveness, and cheaper production. Although technology is the way of the future
    for agriculture, it cannot function independently. Applications of modern technologies
    in Smart Agriculture is shown in fig6. B. Application Figure 6 – Applications
    of modern technologies in Smart Agriculture Show All C. Irrigation Agriculture
    is a crucial resource for humanity because it gives us food and clean water and
    because it utilizes water to do so. Agriculture has been greatly impacted, water
    supplies around the world have been negatively impacted, and ongoing development
    is essential due to environmental devastation and high population expansion. Use
    the smart irrigation system technique employing automated and Internet of Things
    (IoT) technology to solve the problem. An intelligent agriculture management system
    is used in this study to increase crop output and provide agricultural advantages.
    The Global Positioning System (GPS) and Radial Function Network(RFN)-based hybrid
    remote-controlled device was designed to operate the irrigation system, predict
    temperature, maintain air pressure, and lower humidity in water content. [20]
    Using IoT sensors, it controls and keeps tabs on clever solar irrigation systems
    and Internet of Everything (IOE) environmental data. With the use of automation
    and IoT technology, the goal is to make agriculture intelligent. In order to remotely
    control the geolocation of devices, it was scientifically developed to perform
    tasks like weeding, watering, humidity monitoring, trying to scare birds and cattle,
    keeping watch, etc. As a result, the design will achieve all of its water use
    goals and result in lower overall labour, energy, and productivity costs. The
    accuracy, sensitivity, hit rate, and caching rate of the proposed Radial Function
    Network were determined to be 0.7734f, 0.9834, 0.8955, and 0.77, respectively.[21
    D. Pest Control Insecticides and pesticides have been quite effective at preventing
    infestations. They do, however, have various social and environmental repercussions.
    Extreme pesticide application can contaminate the soil and water severely and
    poison plants with poisonous chemicals. Additionally, with repeated exposure,
    insects and bugs become resistant to them, forcing farmers to use stronger pesticides.
    Although there are alternative ways to strengthen crops against pest attack, such
    as genetic seed manipulation, they are too expensive for widespread usage. There
    is a unique framework for controlling environmental variables by data gathering,
    information aggregation, and the right algorithm in order to identify plant illnesses
    and insect annihilation. IoT has recently been used in IPM ontology, which serves
    as a web ontology, is an advancement of integrated pest management language guide.
    Through automated ontology, plants are protected from pests. The Utilizing IoT
    in agriculture minimizes the need for fungicides and insecticides on farms. This
    is consistent with information from weather stations and pest forecasts. This
    aids farmers in constructing controlled actions to protect their crops with knowledge
    of illnesses and pests. Due to their low cost and great return on investment,
    image- capturing sensors for pest monitoring are well- known among farmers. They
    equip the traps with a cheap image sensor that takes pictures of the pests inside
    and wirelessly transmits them to a centralized platform. Farmers locate areas
    of insect infestation and take action to eradicate them from fields based on the
    quantity of insects found in the traps. This sensor has benefits in terms of great
    scalability and mobility in addition to its affordable price. [22] E. Monitoring
    1) Soil temperature monitoring The activity of plants below ground is greatly
    influenced by soil temperature, which affects root development, respiration, nitrogen
    mineralization, and decomposition. The most precise measurement is made with a
    probe buried in the soil, although IoT sensors may estimate soil temperature by
    sensing air temperature and other parameters. Multiple probes can be inserted
    at various depths, depending on the root system of the plant in question. A different
    kind of IoT sensor that makes use of IR technology can measure the temperature
    of the surface of the soil. [23] 2) Soil moisture monitoring Buried probes with
    electrodes can also be used to determine the soil''s moisture content. In hydrology,
    soil chemistry, plant development, and groundwater recharge are all significantly
    influenced by agricultural moisture content and soil science. Several factors
    make the moisture content of the soil crucial: All plants and crops need water
    in the soil as a vital ingredient. Water has a crucial role in photosynthesis.
    The amount of water in the soil has a significant influence on crop yield. For
    the growth of plants, soil water is a crucial carrier of soluble food components.
    Temperatures in the soil are regulated by soil water. 3) Weather monitoring Wind,
    humidity, air pressure, and precipitation are all crucial for plant growth. Several
    cutting-edge weather stations are supported by our Smart Agriculture systems.
    You can see your farming business from every angle thanks to weather stations
    and soil sensors. the comparison of various technology used in Smart Farming is
    shown in table 1. The following can be measured by IoT weather stations: Precipitation

    Survey On Various Technologies TABLE 1 Shows The Comparison Of Various Technology
    Used In Smart Farming IV. Conclusion Agriculture can combat and overcome the current
    issues by making use of the latest technologies. WSN and IOT technologies are
    widely used to produce crops at a minimal cost and with a high yield. Using technologies
    like Image processing and Artificial Intelligence, the plant health conditions
    can be monitored. Early detection of disease in plants can be addressed immediately
    to reduce the degradation in the yield. To minimize human effort, the sensor networks
    are used to collect data regarding the soil moisture, soil health and plant conditions.
    Sensor nodes congregate the information and transmit it to farmers and agricultural
    specialist. With usage of technologies like Cloud services, the data can be received
    in mobile devices also. The farmers can use their mobile phones to know about
    the cultivation status anywhere, at any time and at any moment. Now, the researchers
    are exploring more on the application of modern technologies to improve the plant
    cultivation and agriculture as a whole. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    Keywords: intelligent packaging; temperature; humidity; supply chain; food waste;
    food quality; food preservation; transportation 1. Introduction The degradation
    of food quality is caused by microbial growth [1]. This degradation can lead to
    health hazards, food waste, and profit losses. The factors that affect microbial
    growth can be intrinsic (food pH, nutrients, moisture, etc.) or extrinsic (relative
    humidity, temperature, and atmosphere composition). Extrinsic factors are easier
    to control to increase food preservation [2,3,4,5]. Different food products require
    different ideal extrinsic conditions for optimum preservation [6,7]. Temperature
    is the extrinsic factor that affects food preservation the most, allied with the
    fact that inefficiencies leading to thermal losses are still a problem in the
    food industry [8,9,10,11]; this means that it is crucial to monitor the temperature
    of perishable foods along their life cycle to diagnose faults and cut losses.
    The thermal losses can be caused not only by inefficiencies such as bad insulation,
    system design and frost formation [12], but also by common routines such as doors
    opening and closing [13] which are unavoidable events during the distribution
    of refrigerated goods. The impacts of these events should be thoroughly monitored.
    Refrigeration is essential for the preservation of horticultural products, but
    it requires significant amounts of energy [14]. In retail, the energy spent during
    the commercialization of refrigerated food products is about 50% of the supermarket’s
    total energy consumption [15]. Along with the energy used for storage and transport,
    refrigeration is one of the main causes of energy consumption along the life cycle
    of perishable food products [16]. To make matters worse, the amount of food products
    that are wasted before reaching the final consumer is approximately one-third
    of the total production; in horticultural products, this waste reaches 45% [17].
    This leaves plenty of room for the development of technologies that monitor and
    help maintain food quality to reduce waste, energy consumption, and associated
    environmental impact [12,18,19]. Packaging has the objective of facilitating transportation
    while maintaining the quality of food products. Nowadays, new technologies are
    being developed to make packaging more efficient and sustainable [20,21]. Packages
    can incorporate materials to enhance food preservation [22], such as phase change
    materials (PCM) that help maintain a stable temperature when conditions outside
    the package vary [23,24,25]. Traceability is also increasingly being incorporated
    into packaging along the supply chain [26,27]. The use of sensors for agricultural
    applications is not a new subject [28] but it is a field that has been through
    accelerated growth in both scientific and industrial sectors [13]. In the packaging
    sector, intelligent packaging technologies use sensors to measure and transmit
    the packaging conditions, with the aim of reducing food waste and meeting new
    food safety regulations, which are frequently updated to be stricter [26]. Intelligent
    packaging is the result of technologies that allow for the incorporation of communication
    and sensing tools in a food packaging system to measure the conditions of the
    environment in which the system is deployed [13]. Measurement of parameters such
    as temperature and relative humidity or vibrations, and light can be useful to
    perform quality control, objectively, which would be otherwise impossible [26].
    Of these parameters, temperature is the most associated with energy consumption,
    and food quality degradation is the most important to monitor [29]. Traceability
    of food quality leads to increased sustainability and profit [30] while decreasing
    health hazards [31,32]. This can be magnified if traceability systems are integrated
    into decision support systems for perishable food products [33,34]. This way strategies
    such as price rebates can be applied to sell products whose storing and transport
    conditions monitored can be associated with quality degradation [35], resulting
    in dynamic pricing according to the quality of the food products [1]. Furthermore,
    with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), the data gathered by intelligent
    packaging can be fed to AI algorithms for the best decisions to be made to increase
    sustainability and profitability [36]. In previous works, Morais et al. [37,38]
    developed a monitoring device to read temperature and relative humidity during
    transportation. The measurements were transmitted via GSM, along with GPS coordinates.
    Subsequently, the iTrace platform was developed, allowing real time access to
    measurements made with an array of temperature and relative humidity sensors [6].
    Testing this system in a real case scenario was the aim of the present study.
    This way, extrinsic factors for food preservation can be monitored along the cargo
    volume and as close to the food product as possible. This is important as the
    arrangement in which the products are conditioned can have an impact on temperature
    and relative humidity distribution and fluctuations, which ultimately, if inadequate,
    results in quality degradation [39]. Temperature fluctuations among different
    products have already been studied in supermarkets, within the display cabinets
    [40,41]. The heterogeneous cargo and produce crate distribution of a real case
    scenario only accentuate the differences in the fluctuations of temperature and
    relative humidity. Ultimately, the aim of the study is to highlight the importance
    of monitoring produce by crate, to track and diagnose flaws in the conservation
    of extrinsic conditions for food preservation, and energy losses associated with
    it, that otherwise would go undetected. 2. Materials and Methods The present work
    aimed to study the temperature and relative humidity distribution close to the
    different horticultural products during a distribution route. For this, a system
    to read and transmit the readings of temperature and relative humidity is needed.
    Moreover, the cargo must be organized and characterized to facilitate the interpretation
    of large volumes of data. 2.1. Temperature and Relative Humidity Measurement and
    Communication System The sensing module was composed of several parts, shown in
    Figure 1. The measurements of temperature and relative humidity were taken using
    an SHT30 sensor. This sensor had an accuracy of ±0.3 °C with a repeatability of
    0.06 °C for temperatures between 10 °C and 55 °C, and accuracy of ±3% with a repeatability
    of 0.13% for relative humidity values between 10% and 90%. The sensor was connected
    to a LOLIN D1 mini pro V2.0 microcontroller using an LOLIN SHT30 v2.1.0 shield.
    The sensor, microcontroller, and a 3.7 V 500 mAh lithium battery were conditioned
    within a 3D printed box for protection. This box had a mesh, visible in Figure
    1e, so that the sensor could make direct contact with the air surrounding the
    food product. Figure 1. Sensing module components: LOLIN SHT30 v2.1.0 shield (a),
    LOLIN D1 mini pro V2.0 microcontroller (b), 3.7 V 500 mAh lithium battery (c),
    assembled sensing module (d) and 3D-printed case (e). It is worth noting that
    the measurements of relative humidity have significant errors which required a
    calibration of the sensors to be made before experimental testing. After calibration,
    a repeatability of 0.13% relative humidity ensured accurate data, considering
    these are low-cost sensors. More precise and expensive sensing methods would render
    the application unfeasible for real case applications, due to higher costs associated.
    An array of these sensing modules communicated with the gateway composed of an
    industruino microcontroller, with a GSM/GPRS module to allow for real time data
    transmission with GPS location pinpointing. The values were measured and transmitted
    every five minutes. These data could be accessed at the iTrace platform, developed
    for this purpose [8]. The gateway and system schematics can be seen in Figure
    2. Figure 2. Gateway (a) and system schematics (b). The system was developed so
    that the sensing modules could be placed in the crates within the horticultural
    products. This proximity to the produce allowed measurements of temperature and
    relative humidity to be taken as close to the food product as possible. 2.2. Distribution
    Vehicle and Refrigeration System The fleet of distribution vehicles was composed
    by IVECO Daily vans, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Distribution vehicle example.
    The cargo area and loading doors of these vans can be characterized by the dimensions
    shown in Table 1. Table 1. Van dimensions. The van had a hwasung HT-250RT-ESC
    refrigeration system installed with a controller in the driver’s compartment that
    displayed the instantaneous temperature value, as shown in Figure 4a. These displayed
    temperatures were measured at the outlet of the heat exchanger, as shown in Figure
    4b, and were compared to the measurements taken by the sensors within the produce
    crates. As this temperature was only displayed while the van was working, only
    measurements before and after stops were taken. Between stops, temperature values
    were manually registered in intervals of 15 min. The temperature setpoint was
    3 °C. No relative humidity values are monitored by the refrigeration system; therefore,
    no van relative humidity measurements were taken for later comparison. Figure
    4. Controller (a) and heat exchanger with temperature sensor (b) of the trucks
    refrigeration system. 2.3. Cargo and Sensor Distribution The route consisted of
    the distribution of an assortment of horticultural products along five stops.
    The diversity of horticultural products made it necessary to characterize the
    distribution and content of the crates along the cargo area to facilitate the
    interpretation of results later. Table 2 displays the abbreviations used to represent
    the different horticultural products. Table 2. References for the horticultural
    products in the crates. The distribution of the products was arranged by the drivers,
    to facilitate deliveries; therefore, the arrangement order was diverse and complex.
    In the example shown in Figure 5, there were 108 crates of diverse produce and
    26 bags of 20 kg of potatoes and onions. Figure 5. Final produce arrangement within
    the truck (a), and sample of the diversity of produce transported (b). The sensors
    were distributed along the piles (columns) of crates/bags, in the top, middle
    and bottom. Figure 6 shows a column of crates with a sensor (sensor 3) placed
    within the tomatoes, in the middle crate. Figure 6. Placement of sensor 3. To
    explain the sensor distribution across such a heterogeneous cargo, the top and
    section views were schematized as shown in Figure 7. In this representation, the
    cargo area is divided into groups, each group is divided into columns and each
    column is layered into lines. As an example, sensor 19 is placed in group 4, column
    3, line 3, so G4C3L3 is a short reference that gives exactly the position of the
    crate the sensor is in. This representation also allows for a sectioned view,
    that can be helpful to interpret results, considering how the surroundings can
    influence the environment. Figure 7. Organization of crates among the cargo area
    and sensor distribution. 2.4. Route and Stops The route consisted of the distribution
    of an assortment of horticultural products, along with five different local retail
    stores within the northern region of Castelo Branco, Portugal. The measurements
    were taken during the month of June, in the beginning of the Portuguese summer
    season, with the temperatures within the minimum average of 15.1 °C and maximum
    average of 29.4 °C, reaching a maximum absolute value of 38.5 °C [42]. Figure
    8 displays a map of the route along with the stops and a graphical representation
    of the duration of those stops. This graphical representation was overlayed with
    the sensor data in the results section of the present work, so that the context
    of the stops could be taken into consideration while analyzing the results. Figure
    8. Route stops (a) and graphical representation of the duration of those stops
    (b). The route started at a point Ⓞ. At 8:40 h, the van started, and the van’s
    refrigeration system was turned on. After leaving the warehouse, five more stops
    were made for unloading, before returning. Table 3 displays the details about
    all the unloading stops made. Table 3. Stops and relevant information. It is important
    to note that some of the produce (leaf vegetables such as cabbages and lettuce)
    were watered before transportation to decrease the degradation associated with
    lower relative humidity. This was analyzed further as sensor measurements varied
    for this produce. An example of a watered crate of cabbages with sensor 12 (position
    G1C1L4) is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Crate with cabbages that were watered
    prior to loading in the truck. 3. Results and Discussion Data were compiled to
    better display and compare the results. Averages of different sensors are shown,
    and the comparison is analyzed below. These averages were made from the readings
    taken in five-minute periods. 3.1. Average Values of All Sensors The average of
    all the sensor readings was the first step to understanding the overall fluctuations
    in temperature and relative humidity along the route. In Figure 10 the averages
    for all the readings are presented. Figure 10. Average measured temperature, and
    refrigeration system displayed temperature (a) and average measured relative humidity
    (b). Fluctuations were easily observed, especially during stops in the periods
    that cargo was unloaded. The graph that shows the average temperature of all the
    sensors also plots the measurements displayed by the refrigeration system installed
    in the van. This display shows measurements taken right at the outlet of the refrigeration
    system. It is notable how the temperature readings in the sensors differed from
    those displayed in the driver’s cabinet, only matching when the refrigeration
    system was turned off. This happened because this sensor measured the outlet of
    the refrigeration system and not the temperature of the air close to produce.
    The refrigeration system only measured temperature; therefore, no relative humidity
    values are presented for comparison. Overall, temperature and relative humidity
    values decreased during trips, and increased during stops. Although it is known
    that relative humidity is inversely proportional to temperature, in this case,
    the refrigeration system while lowering the air temperature also acted as a dehumidifier
    due to the surface temperature of the heat exchanger being below the dew point
    temperature. This resulted in measurements showing a decrease in temperature along
    with a decrease in humidity during trips, while both temperature and relative
    humidity increased during stops. 3.2. Sensors in the Top Versus Sensors in Lower
    Crates Top crates were directly exposed to the refrigerated air during transportation
    and warm air during unloads, while crates in lower layers should have been more
    protected against fluctuations. In Figure 11 the average temperatures and relative
    humidity for sensors in the top (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) and inner layers (3, 6, 8,
    7, 5) are shown. Figure 11. Average of top and inner sensor readings for temperature
    (a) and relative humidity (b). It is possible to observe that as was expected,
    sensors in the lower layers registered fewer aggressive fluctuations in temperature
    and relative humidity. The temperature was lower in the top sensors due to them
    being exposed directly to the outlet of the refrigeration system while traveling,
    but the values quickly rose to those of the inner sensors while unloading. Relative
    humidity was also higher for the crates positioned in lower levels, especially
    between unloads, but the fluctuations were comparable to those in the upper levels,
    except during unloads. 3.3. Average of All Sensors versus Sensors Placed near
    the Side Door It was expected that the sensors placed near the doors would suffer
    higher fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity when unloading due to
    the proximity to external environment and larger thermal interaction. In Figure
    12, readings from the sensors near the side door (14, 2, 4) are compared to the
    average. It is worth noting that the side door was only opened from the stop onwards.
    Figure 12. Average of all the sensor readings versus the average of the readings
    from sensors near the side door for temperature (a) and relative humidity (b).
    As expected, near the unloading door, temperatures were a lot less stable and
    particularly higher than the average after this door started being used. Furthermore,
    fluctuations in relative humidity were comparable to the fluctuations in the average
    relative humidity, but the readings showed consistently lower values after the
    side door started being used for unloading. 3.4. Sensors Placed in Wet Produce
    versus Sensors Placed in Dry Produce To increase the shelf life of some horticultural
    products, such as cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce, the procedure established
    in the warehouse is to hose this produce down with tap water before loading it
    for distribution. Produce such as potatoes, melons, and onions do not go through
    this procedure, so the relative humidity measured near them was expected to be
    lower. In Figure 13, the average of measurements in crates with watered produce
    (5, 6, 12, 13) is compared to the average of measurements in drier produce (2,
    7, 9). It is worth noting that from 11:30 h onwards, all the dry readings shown
    were from sensor 2, as crates from sensors 7 and 9 were unloaded in stop Ⓒ. Figure
    13. Average of the readings of sensors placed in crates with produce watered previously
    to being loaded, versus the readings of dry crates for temperature (a) and relative
    humidity (b). The temperature difference was mostly seen after sensors 7 and 9
    are disabled, and the side door started being used. Sensor 2, being placed among
    potato bags, near the side door measured higher values from stop Ⓒ onward as shown
    in Section 3.3. For relative humidity, fluctuations were of similar amplitude
    along the route, but a higher relative humidity was measured near produce watered
    prior to loading. 3.5. Individual Sensor Measurements with Different Readings
    Although the averages help to achieve an overall understanding of how the events
    during transportation affect the extrinsic conditions along the distribution route,
    the point of distributing an array of sensors along the cargo volume was to realize
    how the conditions of individual crates of produce vary independently from each
    other, and if those variations were relevant enough for individual crate sensitization
    to be considered. In Figure 14, two different sensors with quite different readings
    are compared. Sensor 2, in position G1C4L2 was placed among potato bags, while
    sensor 6, in position G1C1L1 was placed among cabbages. This comparison aimed
    to display the importance of measuring crates individually, instead of single-point
    measurements during the transportation of horticultural products. Figure 14. Readings
    of sensor 2 and sensor 6 for temperature (a) and relative humidity (b). The differences
    between readings were quite surprising, considering the produce spent the night
    in the same climatized pavilion and were transported in a van adapted for refrigerated
    transportation of goods. At 12:30 h, for example, the temperature differences
    were approximately 4 °C, and the relative humidity had a difference of approximately
    25%. In this case, the different nature of the horticultural products, their positioning
    and the procedures undergone before loading were the principal causes for these
    discrepancies. It is also worth noting that not even the fluctuations were similar.
    3.6. Maximum, Minimum and Average Values per Sensor To better characterize the
    temperature and relative humidity distribution along the cargo volume, Table 4
    shows the absolute maximum shows the highest value measured, the absolute minimum
    shows the lowest value measured, the average shows the average of all the readings
    from that sensor, and the range was calculated by subtracting the values of absolute
    minimum to the values of absolute maximum, to obtain the range within each sensor
    fluctuates for temperature and relative humidity. The values were measured during
    the distribution route, while the sensor was active, i.e., before turning off
    the sensor and unloading the monitored crate. The times when the absolute maximum
    and absolute minimum values were recorded are also shown. Table 4. Absolute maximum,
    absolute minimum, range, average temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) per
    sensor, with time of measurement for absolute maximum and absolute minimum values.
    When analyzing Table 4, we can observe that for sensor 2 and sensor 9, the difference
    between absolute maximum temperatures recorded was 5.3 °C, the difference between
    absolute minimum temperatures recorded for these same sensors was 5.6 °C and the
    difference between average recorded temperatures was 4.8 °C. For sensor 10 and
    sensor 6, the difference between the ranges of recorded temperatures was 6.1 °C.
    For relative humidity, sensor 6 and sensor 14 showed a difference between the
    absolute maximum relative humidity recorded of 14%, while the difference between
    the absolute minimum relative humidity recorded in sensor 7 and sensor 10 was
    32.5%. The difference in average recorded relative humidity for sensor 6 and sensor
    7 was 19.7% while the difference in the range of recorded relative humidity for
    sensor 4 and sensor 10 was 31.9%. These were significant fluctuations among different
    sensors, which highlights the importance of distributing the measurements between
    produce crates, instead of single point measurements. Furthermore, absolute maximum
    and minimum values for temperature and relative humidity, allowed us to inspect
    when and where the worse conditions for loss of quality were met, while average
    values indicated an overall state of preservation, and range highlights fluctuations
    along the trip. Together, this can be a powerful tool to diagnose faults that
    otherwise would go undetected. The best demonstration of the application of this
    system as a tool for the detection of faults was finding a flaw concerning the
    procedures taken by the distribution company. After completing the measurements
    and analyzing the data, the authors were intrigued by the disparities measured
    in some sensors, namely between sensor 2 and sensor 6, whose values were already
    compared in Section 3.5. Sensor 2, in position G1C4L2 was placed among potato
    bags, while sensor 6, in position G1C1L1 was placed among cabbages. What intrigued
    the authors was how sensor 6, placed in the lower levels, and far from the door,
    could have a higher range of temperature measurements than sensor 2, placed near
    the door. Upon close inspection, and as shown in Figure 14a, temperature fluctuations
    during stops were measured in both sensors, but during the overall trip, the temperature
    in sensor 6 dropped significantly more than the temperature in sensor 2. In addition,
    sensor 6 had the second highest value for absolute maximum temperature, which
    is also unusual, as cabbages were stored at lower temperatures than other products
    such as potatoes and onions. It was only when looking at the relative humidity
    which is significantly higher for sensor 6 than for sensor 2 that the following
    hypothesis arose: cabbages, and other leaved produce, went through the procedure
    of being watered prior to loading, receiving heat from the tap water, which was
    aggravated in the warm days of summer the data was collected. This hypothesis
    would be impossible to achieve if it were not for the array of sensors, together
    with a diagram of their position and type of horticultural product. After sensor
    6, sensors 15, 14 and 16 registered higher ranges, which was expected, as these
    were all on the top crates near the side door, and as shown in Figure 11a and
    Figure 12a the top and door side sensors should have measured higher fluctuations.
    4. Conclusions The impact of inadequate temperature and relative humidity in the
    preservation of horticultural products is known, but it is not easy to predict
    if sensors are not placed near the produce. This study presented evidence that
    reinforces the importance of parameter monitoring within the packages for the
    precise control of food quality preservation along the supply chain. The disparity
    between the crate temperature measurements and the readings displayed from the
    van refrigeration system further reinforces these claims. The results also showed
    that the order in which products are stored can have an impact on the temperature
    and relative humidity fluctuations during distribution. This information can be
    used to rearrange the order in which products are conditioned to decrease the
    impact of temperature fluctuations, especially in produce most prone to degradation.
    For instance, produce that requires higher relative humidity, or is more sensible
    to temperature and relative humidity fluctuations should be stored in the bottom.
    This suggestion does not interfere with the duration or unload procedure, as the
    produce are unloaded in columns, and only the column order is altered, not the
    position of the column within the cargo area, which is left for the driver to
    decide how to best accommodate for faster distribution. The unpredictability of
    the type and order of transported goods, especially in short-range distribution,
    does not allow for any assumption of cargo homogeneity, which further reinforces
    the need for distributed monitoring. Measurements such as those presented in this
    work can be used to diagnose and fix flaws along the supply chain. In the case
    of this study, it was found that a procedure was introducing undesired thermal
    loads by watering produce with tap water prior to loading it into the distribution
    vehicle. This may result in lower shelf life for the affected produce due to increased
    fluctuations in conservation temperature, higher energy consumption associated
    with refrigeration, to compensate for the thermal load, and energy loss associated
    with food waste. The negative effects of this procedure would otherwise go undetected
    if the monitoring of temperature and relative humidity was not spread across the
    cargo volume. To fix this flaw, chilled water could be sprayed on the produce
    that require watering, or misting could be applied instead of hosing the produce,
    to reduce the volume of warm water and associated thermal load. Obviously, the
    impact of the procedure on the degradation of quality should be studied, to access
    if changes would result in improvements significant enough to modify it. The application
    of the studied sensing system will be specific to every case. The number of variables
    such as refrigerated or non-refrigerated transportation system, produce variety,
    season, weather, trip length, number and duration of unloads, produce, and so
    on will influence results, and that is why this is a good tool to measure what
    can be almost impossible to predict, helping diagnose flaws that affect the shelf
    life of produce. This complexity will increase with the number of sensors, as
    recording positions, and sensed produce is crucial to a complete analysis, which
    will become a harder task, without a tool specifically designed for the purpose.
    The cross analysis of sensor readings is useful to understand the variations during
    transportation, diagnose flaws and develop improved procedures, although to predict
    the shelf life of produce in a single crate, data measured close to the specific
    produce is the most important. This system has some limitations. The measurement
    and analysis of temperature and relative humidity fluctuations along an uneven
    cargo volume was complex enough, given different sides of the van being exposed
    to the sun, different doors being opened in different phases of the distribution
    route, and the position of the outlet of the refrigeration system. Added to this
    was an uneven cargo, with different produce organized not by type, but by client,
    with different storage temperatures across them and some of them being watered
    before loading will add to the complexity of the analysis. Furthermore, the fact
    that some produce is unloaded right at the beginning of the route resulted in
    a small window of time for these sensors to gather data. The need for a wireless
    sensing system means that a battery must be charged from time to time, and although
    this is a low-power sensor, the logistics associated with charging several dozens
    of sensors, even if optimized to be a weekly charge, must be addressed and simplified,
    to make this a viable option. The robustness of the sensor is also a limitation
    that must be addressed. The crates of produce endure though mechanical stresses
    during transportation, being dragged and dropped, or even thrown when empty. If
    the sensor is attached to the crate, it will need to endure these conditions while
    remaining undamaged and reliable for the next usage. A high sample rate is crucial
    to understanding abrupt changes in temperature and relative humidity, but a low
    sample rate should be enough to measure slower changes between unloads. The problem
    with high sample rates is higher power consumption, and therefore lower battery
    life. This can be solved by implementing a dynamic sample rate that increases
    sample rate during unloads, by either measuring the state of movement with an
    accelerometer, or by measuring luminosity within the cargo area, which increases
    when the doors are open. Further studies should be made with a larger array of
    sensors, and a higher frequency of measurements to better understand the fluctuations
    of temperature and relative humidity along with the horticultural goods during
    transportation. This will also require a system for data analysis and comparison;
    as mentioned above, a larger array of sensors will result in a higher complexity
    of data that in turn will be more difficult to process and understand, find flaws,
    and monitor quality. Author Contributions Conceptualization, P.D.G., M.L.A., L.C.D.

    Agriculture is critical to sustainable development and the alleviation of poverty
    in many developing countries. It plays a fundamental role in the management of
    the economy of the country. It also offers large-scale employment opportunities
    for people. Development in the agricultural sector is beneficial for the health
    of the economic situation in the region. Unfortunately, many farmers also use
    traditional farming practices that lead to lower yields of crops and fruit. And
    when robotics as possible, then the yield was increased, and machine tools were
    added to humans. The European Commission''s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) also
    advocated a greening policy aimed, along with many other things, at achieving
    energy efficiency in crop yields. The objective achieved through the introduction
    of technological advances to farms[1].The implementation of controlled drip irrigation
    from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) may also be one of many other aspects of green
    computing that aim to reduce carbon emissions and encourage new techniques to
    make use of our technical advancements in computing without impacting the environment
    harmfully. Agribusiness is one of the main contributors to global warming, even
    though not all of this is due to the use of fossil fuels in drip irrigation.Furthermore,
    global warming projected to have a detrimental effect on agriculture and to cause
    significant harm to food security. To address this constraint, RES such as renewable
    radiation is applied to energy-irrigated agriculture. Another significant factor
    of irrigated agriculture appears to be the need for the production of water supplies
    to resist spoilage [2].Even so, plant irrigation is typically a very time-consuming
    process that needs to be carried out on time with a significant component of physical
    resources. Generally, a human has performed all the moves. Multiple systems now
    use automation everywhere to limit the number of staff members to grow the garden
    for the time needed. There is very minimal regulation of such systems and so many
    assets are mostly unused [3].Plenty of the papers explain the use of IoT devices
    that uses information from multiple sensors and then uses it to transmit it to
    the database server using a wireless protocol. Information on environmental conditions
    produced by the data collected and, in effect, is capable of detecting the device.
    There is no suitable and complete solution to environmental factors while increasing
    the production of crops [4].This system, which was helpful in monitoring field
    data and regulating agricultural activities and providing versatility, was then
    established. The contribution of this work is as follows: • The method used to
    ensure an agricultural model for measuring the use of water to minimize pollutants
    and to create a software framework that would help farmers control soil quality
    and regulate the irrigation system through a digital application of some kind.
    Many researchers have prioritized the forecasting of climate, weather, and land
    conditions, but not within the framework of using new agricultural practices [5].
    Significant amounts of water and energy are lost, often as a factor, resulting
    in poor harvests (leading to increased moisture) whenever plant spraying occurs
    or quickly follows rainfall. Any internet-connected remote smart PC or laptop
    and inter-process communication detectors, Wi-Fi, camera and microcontrollers
    and actuators can execute instructions to monitor all these other functions. For
    safety purposes, the app shows the signals from its water pump sensor units. The
    literature survey of the existingpaper is discussed in Section 2. The background
    of smart irrigation system and its components deliberated in Section 3, and in
    Section 4, the analysis results of the proposed system areelaborated. Section
    5 discussed about the experimental results and finally, concluded in section 6.
    Literature survey Implementation of the irrigation system was the topic of interest
    explored in [6]. The researchers used cell phones to take an image of the soil,
    while the micro-controller hardware tests the moisture. In comparison, 59% and
    15% of water was retained by the computer tested in Tamil Nadu. AI technology
    implemented within a - sector to perform variable irrigation rates within the
    conventional flood and drip irrigation methods [7].Though sustaining the dense
    soil, the current proposal executes groundwater wetness at 24%.All climate forecasts
    promoted in central Europe to encourage the effective use of smart irrigationare
    used [8]. The scheme provides a precise estimation of soil humidity for three
    weeks in advance. Low-cost and energy-driven sensors include the technique of
    smart irrigation using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology with IoT WSN that
    is affordable, awareness, and occurrence sensor networks to maximize water use
    for clever irrigation purpose[9]. Another way of using WSN, Global System for
    Mobile communication (GSM), and mobile devices to enable Fuzzy logic to allow
    android apps and master irrigation management. Sequencing of the Support Vector
    Regression and K-means used to model the variants of soil humidity due to regional
    weather.In the Morden situation of dwindling groundwater, running dry from rivers
    and tanks, and unpredictable weather, there seems to be an immediate shortage
    of better water use [10].Relative humidity sensors used for seedbed preparation
    atthe right position to deal with all of this. An algorithm designed with statistical
    parameters of humidity and temperature can be coded into a micro-controller portal
    to track the amount of water. Photovoltaic cells can run the system, and it can
    be configured via a web page using a link to structure interviews based on even
    a cellular internet feature that allows data security control and methods of irrigation
    [11]. In the following study in the agricultural sector, reclaimed the scientific
    advances in WSN have allowed using plantation parameter tracing.In reality, agriculture
    productivity has shown to decrease little by litter, a signal processing, and
    irrigation management system developed using a remote WSN aimed at detecting new
    real-time area mortgage irrigation, site-specific precision linear flow irrigation
    network management to efficiently information with limited water use [12].The
    methods have established metadata of variable rate irrigation design and equipment,
    WSN, and real-time in sector monitoring and instrumentation. Control by the use
    of an appropriate application. Such a need to produce accumulation indicators
    to determine soil conditions for smart agriculture have been specifically recognized.
    The development of both the micro-irrigation IoT service which guides hundreds
    of granular soil sensors have been recognized [13].Intelligent electronics terminal
    units used in wireless network technology to save vast quantities of food. In
    WSN-related hypotheses, the research measured soil-related factors such as temperature
    and humidity.Sensors are placed under the earth, interacting through cluster heads,
    by using active data transmission that provides a small pulse width and thereby
    improves the durability of the same soil monitoring system. The device''s drawbacks
    are cost and also the positioning under the soil of such a detector that causes
    attenuation of Radio Frequency (RF) signals [5]. here are many wireless technologies
    that can address the challenges faced by the water industry. Cellular, Wi-Fi,
    and BTLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy) are widely adopted but introduce a gap between
    high-cost, high-data rate cellular and low-cost, localized Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
    connectivity. Furthermore, these solutions are often not available or reliable
    in remote and rural areas where water supply and management are critical functions
    of industrial and agricultural operations. This gap has been filled by a new IoT
    network technology — Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWANs are designed
    for sensors and applications that need to send small amounts of data over long
    distances a few times per hour from a variety of environments. In [14] AgriSens
    has a farmer-friendly user interface, which provides field information to the
    farmers in a multimodal manner - visual display, cell phone, and Web portal. In
    [15] dynamic clustering which coupled tightly with the Back-Propagation Neural
    Network and empowered by the Particle Swarm Optimization (BPNN-PSO). We implement
    the overall framework using a Bayesian Neural Network, where the outputs from
    BPNN-PSO are supplied as weights to the underlying neuron layer. Smart irrigation
    system The Automatic irrigation structure is based on IoT technology means of
    managing the pump for water storage of groundwater to the farmer’s field and tracking
    the soil humidity, pressure and temperature conditions of a farm field. Fig. 1

    system. During the first phase, the operator keeps running the software application
    through the use of the mobile portal, which manages the farm field irrigation
    either through the mobile device. This paper contains three terminals and the
    operating system or cell phone software for the operation. The various technologies
    in the proposed scheme linked to each portal and linked to each central server.
    By making use of the internet access, each server transmits user-end data. There
    are two main stages in the process: automatic mode and manually operated. The
    smart irrigation application allows the user to manage his irrigation status with
    the following paragraphs, including farmer’s field: moisture status, relative
    humidity status, air temperature, energy, and pump. The position sensor allows
    the user to access the water pump by means of switching between on, off and automatic,
    either switching the water pump on, attempting to turn the water pump off or establishing
    the auto mode of water pump. Block diagram of interconnected subsystem of smart
    irrigation For smart irrigation systems, the above features integrated: solar
    thermal plants, networking equipment including irrigation planning and development
    centres, plus groundwater recharge, watering sprinkler system, water pumps, detectors,
    and Micro-Controller Unit (MCU). By using a graphical representation, Fig. 2 shows
    the whole structure. Again the solar plant is independent of these subcomponents
    and the other subsystems that rely more on solar power plants input. Download

    Block diagram of smart irrigation system. As information from either the routing
    module influences the IoT-based system, which has in effect contaminates reporting
    and monitoring subsystems, such systems are co-dependent on one another. The suitable
    delivery framework consists of both the combination of the solar power module,
    the communication framework and also the water reporting, and monitoring module
    in an IoT based environment. Component description Soil moist (YL 69) The amount
    of humidity available in the soil accompanying it may be identified by a soil
    humidity sensor. Soaking gold, that defends nickel against oxidation, is used
    in the current moisture sensor. Electroless nickel penetration gold also has benefits,
    including surface quality adhesive properties, excellent oxidation tolerance and
    versatility towards uncontrolled contact surfaces such as plasma flips and points
    of contact over more traditional surface plantings like HASL(solder). Pressure
    sensor (BMP 280) A pressure sensor that could very accurately measure vibration
    temperature and pressure. Because frequency changes with elevation, they also
    can use it as an altimeter via a reliability with + or – sensor. A barometric
    tension range are + or – hPa and + or – 1.0° C for maximum weather. Humidity and
    temperature sensor(DHT11) The DHT11 is a small electronic sensor for relative
    humidity. To calculate the surrounding air,it uses a capacitive humidity sensor
    and a thermistor and pulls out such a digital signal pin (no analog signal pins
    needed). It’s also easy to do that but needs careful timing in order to acquire
    data. The main possible drawback of such sensor is that you could just get fresh
    information on through it only per tow seconds, so detector measurements can become
    delayed for close to two second while utilizing a library. Wireless network node
    MCU(ESP 8266) Microcontroller is an IoT framework which would be free software.
    Which uses protocols that operates on either the Wi-Fi ESP8266. Espress if devices
    Soc, as well as the ESP-12 key requirement equipment. The concept “module” MCU
    applies to the chipset instead of the dev kit by definition. Water pump It is
    a remotely operated water pump of a compact size(hardly any personality). These
    are assembled and use a wind turbine. Supplying a whisper -quite process due to
    a conventional water pump. Transistor(BC548) The BC548 is a transistor of a specific
    application NPN. It is used in the reasons of magnifying and trying to switch.
    The current gain may range from 120 to 789. The maximum possible gain of DC current
    is 800. Relay A circuit is a flip which is transfer of energy. A gravitational
    flux which tends to attract a nozzle and distorts the switch connections is formed
    by liquid passing thru the secondary coil. Resistor Along with other applications,resistance
    are being used to decrease flow of current,modify signal power,separate amperage,bias
    active ingredients and break transmission lines. Solar power terminal The intelligent
    irrigation device is supported exclusively either by solar panel’s photovoltaic
    cell. The energy therefore produced is stored in a power pack for use in the water
    monitoring and control unit to drive the pump. During day hours, the solar panels
    hold their battery charged such that the power pack has enough ability to protect
    the pump working when appropriate mostly during overnight time due to the lack
    of solar insolation. The implementation of the solar power plant seems to be as
    follows. If the capacitor provides the pump explicitly whenever a direct current
    pump should be used, when an alternating current pump should be used, a solar
    cell system is set up to convert the direct current energy created to alternating
    current. Proposed system Water monitoring and irrigation units include of a water
    pump, a sensor, a water collection irrigation sprinkler including a MCU in Fig.

    Monitor management. Water pumps power from the solar power plant have been used
    to pump water, that is then preserved in reserves to guarantee that watering could
    be conducted out because when needed in the event of power failure. In partnership
    with the microcontroller, heat,moisture,relative humidity and air pressure detectors
    are used to monitor the irrigation system by enhancing the effectiveness of water
    resources, all of which have been integrated and connected to a web application
    where the data can be extracted and equipment could be regulated by approved staff
    utilizing remote internet connectivity. Watering sprinklers are being used to
    support the crops with water if needed. The detectors of heat,moisture and relative
    soil humidity calculate surrounding environment also including surface temperatures,
    moisture,air humidity,that are essential to watering,are handled either by remote
    server but are also deposited in it. At the rooting depth of both the field (usually,16–31
    cm),the detectors are mounted.If 30% of total of an accessible groundwater is
    consumed,moisture sensors trigger irrigation.Temperature detectors evaluate heat
    in the 0–39° C range,while our systems optimal value is fixed at 21–29 °C shown

    image Fig. 4. Overview of Proposed network architecture. The business network
    consists of number devices connected (PC) linked to a change, as well as the rooftop
    solar unit and water control station IoT-based machines are mostly wired to the
    swap. The organization device that would be linked to the intelligent irrigation
    server is required to integrate through everlasting routers which are permitted
    to view their freshwater database. The watering server is really a centralized
    IoT-based device to be linked. Approved members can view detector data from the
    user and therefore can physically trigger the irrigation system if appropriate.
    As it has a router as well as a transmitter that make up the core of the network,
    the core router is identical to the exchange server, the cloud services are designed
    and simulated as well as an IoT device is also connected to the network to enable
    remote access to the system through phones. Prediction of environment conditions
    using neural network To forecast the far more significant environmental factors
    and for specific application. They then use Radial Base Function Network (RBFN),
    i.e., moisture. Daily weather statistical information is also the feeds of both
    the network,whereas the result is really the predicted weather incident the very
    next day.RBFN is a single feed-forward neural network with a hidden layer. Interactions
    after the first layer are not measured [16]. In hidden units, the transmission
    parameters are performed either by quantitative vector mass function in terms
    shown in Equation 1. ξy (m)=ě (1) Here,m is the state vector; the mean and the
    deviation of the gaussian parameters are also the μand σvector. Every component
    of RBF is triggered throughout an area defined by μand σ. The ties are balanced
    throughout the second level. Linear interpretation is worked through by the destination
    node. The value of the ith output node γ is determinedby that of the γth output
    terminal expressed in Equation 2. γi(n) =  Uij φj(n) + Uk0 (2) Where even the
    mass of the relation seen between ith output terminals and also the jth hidden
    terminal is w and the discrimination expression is U. There’s three parts of RBF
    channels: their input nodes, the hidden units and the output units as shown in
    Fig. 5. For each dependent variable, each processing unit always has neuron. For
    this scenario, they utilized weather levels of seven preceding days and also present
    months mean average weather and also relative humidity, day-to-day temperature
    extremes relative humidity, prevailing winds or wind speed of seven preceding
    days, results in fifty sample activation function. In this case the output unit
    does have single neuron, even if we only forecast seasonal variations. There may
    be a variable set of nodes in the secret layer four. The corresponding principle
    of thumb was followed:the amount of hidden neurons must be 4/6 of that scale of
    any input level and the size of the output level. Thus in the secret layer, we
    have thirty five neurons. Download : Download high-res image (134KB) Download

    practice is carried out in tow steps. The learning stage uses the clustering method
    of its sequential k-means towards locate the unit clusters ω [6].The unit centres
    are adjusted from either a set of basic randomly generated positions by imposing
    the training principle as expressed in Equation 3. ωj= (3) The management of failure
    rate is connected to the training algorithm in Equation 4 Δ ωj == (xk -ωj) (4)
    Here Lj is the count of wins of unit j in the competition. The cycle is continued
    because, mostly during successive stage, cluster centres may not adjust the location.
    Then a probabilistic strategy is being used to evaluate the width of the groups
    as well as the total Euclidean distance here between cores of the group. Eventually,
    they utilize linear regression via a goal for least squares process to get the
    volume of the second level. they supportive campus normalisation to use the dropout’s
    methods to avoid network fitting problem. The likelihood of becoming temporarily
    ignored in measurements becomes allocated to each and every components of a channel.
    Also set the dropout rate from every repetition. Experimental results Data obtained
    from data.govt.in from March 1 to October 30, 2020,resulting in 335 sample points.
    We use 81% of overall of that same training examples on the platform,reserved
    19%of the information for the study. As indicated in the following assessment
    indexes were checked for the analysis of the weather phenomenon detection accuracy
    expressed in Equations 5 – 8. (5) (7) SP (8) TR is hit rate (correctness)here,UR
    is cache rate,Se is tolerance,Sp is specifics, E is a chain of actions in which
    the prediction event matched the observed reality,F is the number of events where
    the predicted activity missed,G is the number of incidents in which the anticipated
    activity refused. Non-event(because when weather pattern was really the consequence
    of both the indisputable fact),and H is the number of incidents in which the expected
    event mirrored non-event(whenever a non-event was the outcome of its observable
    phenomenon). There seems to be functionality on the smartphone app facility to
    show information gathered straight first from detectors through the firebase,
    which seems to be the cloud which generates a walkway between both the equipment
    and the directory of a cloud. The Smartphone software’s system seems to be the
    menu which shows the programs authentication server. By each user,this would be
    to establish a safe login and also to discourage someone else from knowing information
    operated by yet another customer. If the user has successfully entered further
    into software,further menu displays the irrigation control system choices. Then
    client will use any of the alternatives available to access the device. The control
    option allows the user to control either power “on or off “to the water pump,
    or maybe just switch this to automatic mode in which it is operated. It monitors
    the function of the pump tied to the value including its detector which is placed
    throughout the unit. Result and discussion The computer web online system, from
    here all located in different geographical detectors are being controlled, but
    if needed, there seems to be a choice to switch over the irrigation sprinkler
    or water pump as there may be many conditions which could cause each device to

    We decided to be using a graphical programming technique which requires neural
    pathways to still be established, to construct the RBF network. For incorporate
    a neural network for weather activity forecasts, they picked that neural net kit
    shown in Fig. 7. Relative to current designs, the method utilizes IoT to provide
    soil moisture sensors with remote control and protection. In such a sensor -based
    irrigation scheduling algorithm, these design requires use of certain necessary
    detectors, provides a farm progress report and also the capacity. To use an ambient
    sensor to track the atmosphere. An additional to this as well permitted staff

    panels intelligent irrigation model is implemented when using IoT environment.
    Detectors and climate conditions have been used to remotely regulate the irrigation
    system with an IoT-based viewpoint. An online portal was introduced to allow the
    incident of a negligence or unexpected unforeseen situation which needs a speedy
    response, remote manually management. The intelligent irrigation system satisfies
    the objective of monitoring and controlling the agricultural irrigation system.
    These are focused on IoT technology which is incorporated with some detectors:
    moisture sensors, asoil moisture sensor, and pressure sensor for controlling the
    soil conditions of its farmer’s field. Except these systems are attached through
    a Wi-Fi device to just the WSN. Such integrated operation is intended to give
    the irrigation process increased tolerance. The consumer can track the irrigation
    system through the dashboard as seen on the digital application again from system
    application MCU. Throughout the event of an accident, the programme functions
    to monitor measurements for detectors as well as to regulate water pump. These
    are in addition to informing the user and make it possible to use the application.
    RES used to regulate the drip irrigation, the expected values of the water level,
    forecast, temperature, humidity, and irrigation information. Research progress
    might include widening the program to include all forms of renewable resources
    and grid connected systems in order to make sure the programs grid independence
    and stability, including creating a requirement for the entire program to be used
    in remote rural states of India. It aimed to make agriculture intelligent by using
    automation and IoT technologies. It scientifically designed to perform tasks such
    as weeding, irrigation, sensing humidity, attempting to scare birds and livestock,
    maintaining surveillance, etc., to control the geolocation of devices remotely.

  description: The development of Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) is
    currently receiving significant attention to collect data underground all along
    the year without impacting aboveground activities. Although the opportunities

    agriculture 1. Introduction In the coming years, Wireless Underground Sensor Networks
    (WUSNs) are expected to play a major role in the environment monitoring and real
    time decision making (Sardar et al., 2019, Sambo et al., 2020). The applications
    range from smart irrigation and precision farming to minimize water losses and
    optimize the use of agricultural resources (Silva and Vuran, 2010) to the detection
    of pesticide residues in soil near rivers (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006) and
    early population warning against risks of landslides (Ferreira et al., 2019).
    Other potential applications are underground infrastructure monitoring (e.g. pipes,
    storage tanks), sport field monitoring and detection of people or vehicles aboveground
    (Zaman and Forster, 2018). These applications are based on the development of
    nodes composed of sensors, radio communication devices and antennas, all buried
    at a few dozens of centimeters deep to collect data directly from the underground
    environment (e.g. moisture, temperature, salinity, vibrations) without impacting
    the aboveground activities and all along the year. The interest to conceal the
    nodes underground is also to protect them from potential damages caused by humans,
    animals and machines (Huang et al., 2020). The data collected in the field are
    next transferred to the cloud, leading to the new paradigm of Internet of Underground
    Things (IoUT) (Saeed et al., 2019, Salam and Raza, 2020). As depicted on Fig.
    1, three communination links, called underground to underground (UG2UG), underground
    to aboveground (UG2AG) and aboveground to underground (AG2UG), are possible in
    a wireless underground sensor network (Silva et al., 2014). The establishment
    of the communication between the different nodes is however challenging as the
    radio electromagnetic waves are significantly more attenuated in the soil in comparison
    with in the air (20–300 times worse) (Da Silva et al., 2014). In particular, the
    UG2UG link is difficult to obtain, the communication ranges reported in the literature
    being generally lower than a few meters. Moreover, compared with in the air, many
    environmental factors affect the inter-node communication distance in a WUSN,
    especially the Volumetric Water Content (VWC) or soil moisture which drastically
    attenuates the propagation of the radio signals underground (Bogena et al., 2009).
    In UG2UG, the strength of the received signals can decrease of several dozens
    of decibel-milliwatts on wet soil compared to a dry soil (Vuran and Silva, 2009).
    The composition of the soil, i.e. the percentage of sand, silt and clay (Foth,
    1990), impacts also indirectly the inter-node connectivity with greater or lesser
    water holding capacity. The topology of the terrain is also an important point
    to be considered to adequately place the nodes in the field, as well as the burial
    depth (i.e. the distance between the antenna and the surface) which impacts the
    strength of the received signal for the UG2AG/AG2UG links (Sambo et al., 2020),
    but also for the UG2UG links which are affected by the reflection of the radio
    waves by ground surface. The roots of plants and trees as well as the stage of
    vegetation aboveground can also impact the UG2AG/AG2UG communications (Vuran and
    Silva, 2009). Several work aim to characterize, modelize and simulate the propagation
    of radio waves in soil face to such varying environmental conditions (Vuran and
    Akyildiz, 2010, Silva et al., 2015). Download : Download high-res image (126KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Communication links in WUSN and main
    influencing factors. The choice of the operating frequency for the radio transceivers
    is also essential as the attenuation in soil increases with the frequency value.
    Several studies highlighted however that the 300–900 MHz frequency band is particularly
    relevant for WUSNs as it leads to higher communication ranges compared for example
    with the 2.4 GHz (Silva et al., 2015) and it enables to use reasonable sizes of
    antennas (a quarter of the signal wavelength). The antennas can be directly in
    contact with the soil or inside a container, and of different types (e.g. monopoles
    or dipoles antennas) (Tiusanen, 2009, Salam et al., 2019). The maximum transmit
    power is limited by the regulations in the country where the WUSNs are deployed.
    A compromise has also to be found between the transmit power and energy consumption
    of the buried nodes to obtain run times ideally for several months or years without
    battery replacement. In Europe, the 433.05–434.79 MHz and 863–870 MHz are licence
    free bands particularly relevant to develop WUSNs. They are already used for IoT
    applications by the Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), as SigFox, NB-IoT and
    LoRaWAN, for sending small data packages over long distances with low energy consumption
    on battery powered nodes. With its open protocol, the interest of LoRaWAN (LoRa
    Alliance, 2018) is its physical layer, the LoRa technology, developed in 2014
    by the French start-up company Cycleo and today managed by Semtech. This technology
    is based on a Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation technique, which encodes
    information using frequency chirps having a linear variation of frequency over
    time (Augustin et al., 2016). In the air, this modulation leads to a certain immunity
    against interferences and multi-paths (Staniec and Kowal, 2018). Several LoRa
    radio modules are today off the shelf at 433 MHz and 868 MHz. In the regard of
    European regulations, 433 MHz transmissions are allowed at +10 dBm/10 mW whereas
    868 MHz transmissions are allowed at +14 dBm/25 mW for the specific 868.0–868.6
    MHz frequency band. In addition to the operating frequency and transmit power,
    several parameters can be configured on the LoRa radio modules, in particular
    the spreading factor (SF), the coding rate (CR) and the bandwith (BW), see (Augustin
    et al., 2016). A compromise has to be found between these parameters: high SF
    values lead to high sensitivity and long communication range to the detriment
    of airtime and thus energy consumption. High CR values lead to increase the robustness
    of transmission to the detriment of the airtime and thus also energy consumption.
    High BW values lead to high data rate and short airtime, but low sensitivity (Zorbas
    et al., 2018). In the literature, still very few work have investigated the performance
    of LoRa communication for WUSNs in real conditions. In (Hardie and Hoyle, 2019),
    LoRa nodes operating at 433 MHz are buried in the soil from 15 to 30 cm deep with
    different combinations of LoRa parameters. The obtained transmission distances
    UG2AG with a transmit power of +25 dBm in SF 12 in relatively dry soil were about
    100–200 m, depending on the chosen configuration and soil composition. This work
    highlighted the difficulty to reach more than a few meters in UG2UG that leads
    to question the interest of this link in an agricultural context. The issue of
    power consumption for the buried node is also pointed out. In (Ebi et al., 2019),
    the radio transmission performances in LoRa and LoRaWAN are evaluated at 868 MHz
    to monitor an underground infracstructure. They highlighted the interest to first
    use the LoRa technology for the UG2AG communication, in order to obtain reliable
    packet delivery, to next use the LoRaWAN protocol for the aboveground communications.
    In (Lin et al., 2019), the link quality of the UG2AG LoRa communication is investigated,
    in particular with respect to the burial depth and the internode distance. No
    packet loss was observed if the RX node is located at the vicinity of the TX node,
    even at the maximum burial depth (0.8 m). This was also the case with an internode
    distance of 50 m when TX nodes are buried at 0.4 m. For Tx nodes buried more deeply
    (0.6 m and 0.8 m), the packet loss increased progressively with the internode
    distance to be total at respectively 28 m and 22 m. In (Gineprini et al., 2020),
    less than one percent of the transmitted packets was lost with an UG2AG communication
    link composed of 27 m aboveground and from 0.1 m to 0.5 m underground. In (Di
    Renzone et al., 2021), the performances of data transmission in LoRaWAN for different
    soil compositions was studied for depths up to 0.5 m. The packet loss was below
    whatever the soil composition with the gateway placed at 15 m. In (Wu et al.,
    2019), a simulator was developed to study the impact of soil moisture and burial
    depth on a LoRaWAN network with a centre frequency ranging from 915 to 928 MHz
    in New Zealand. Although UG2UG links are difficult to establish, the UG2AG links
    with a star topology can be sufficient for numerous applications. This is the
    case for example of sensors and nodes deployed underground with aboveground collector
    and repeater nodes. The UG2AG link must however be robust and well-designed. The
    objective of this paper is to first compare the performance of LoRa technology
    at both 433 MHz and 868 MHz frequency bands for this UG2AG link and next establish
    an adequate configuration, in particular in terms of burial depht, inclination
    of the receiving antenna and contact of the emitting antenna with the soil, with
    the aim to develop future environmental and agricultural monitoring applications.
    For that, the nodes were built from commercial components. The maximum transmit
    powers authorized in Europe for each of the frequency bands were used. The experiments
    were carried out with a spreading factor (SF) ranging from 7 to 12 to highlight
    the impact of this parameter on the attainable communication range. The impact
    of the soil moisture on the UG2AG communication range was first studied to determine
    the preferred choice for the frequency band for the UG2AG link. Next, the impacts
    of the burial depth, the inclination of the receiving antenna and the way to bury
    the emitting antenna were investigated, as well as the analysis of the packet
    loss. 2. Experimental setup 2.1. Presentation The experimentations reported in
    this paper follow the scheme presented on Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res
    image (74KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Experimental setup. A
    soil moisture sensor is buried at the deep in an open field. This sensor is connected
    to an underground node TX transmitting periodically the data of the probe (humidity,
    temperature, dielectric permittivity) in LoRa to a receiving node RX located aboveground
    at the height and a varying distance : the RX node is moved until the UG2AG link
    is disrupted. The data frame are recorded on a computer which is connected to
    a GPS to georeference the successive positions. First experiments use a set of
    TX and RX nodes operating at 433 MHz, and second experiments use a set of TX and
    RX nodes operating at 868 MHz. The power of the radio transmitters are tuned to
    the maximum value allowed by the European regulations, respectively +10 dBm/10
    mW and +14 dBm/ 25mW. On a periodic basis (every 12 s), the TX node picks up the
    measured values from the sensor and sends a set of six frames with the LoRa parameter
    SF going from 7 to 12. The RX node waits several minutes on a position enabling
    to receive several sets of six frames. These experimentations are repeated with
    different soil moistures, burial depths, RX antenna inclinations and with the
    TX antenna directly in contact with the soil or inside a PVC container. 2.2. Materials
    A first set of TX and RX nodes is built with RFM98W radio modules operating at
    433 MHz. A second set uses RFM95W radio modules operating at 868 MHz. These radio
    modules are manufactured by HopeRF and include the SX1276 transceiver from Semtech
    with the LoRa technology. The TX nodes, see Fig. 3, are composed of a microprocessor
    ATmega328 running at 8 MHz installed on an Arduino Pro Mini board and a radio
    module RFM98W/95 W with a quarter wave whip antenna (RF FLEXI-SMA90-433, 2 dBi
    gain, 16.2 cm at 433 MHz and RF FLEXI-SMA-868, 2 dBi gain, 13.6 cm at 868 MHz).
    The radiation pattern of these antennas is maximum at perpendicular to the whip
    and close to zero at the end. They will be vertically oriented in the experiments.
    The TX node is powered with a 3.6 V/8800 mAh Lithium-Ion battery, and connected
    to a Truebner SMT100 probe. The RX nodes, see Fig. 4, are composed of a microprocessor
    ATmega328 running at 8 MHz installed on an Arduino Pro Mini board and a radio
    module RFM98W/95 W with a quarter wave whip antenna (Siretta Delta 12A, 3 dBi
    gain, 13 cm at 433 MHz and Taoglas TI.18.3113, 3.2 dBi gain, 39 cm at 868 MHz).
    The supply of the RX node is delivered by the USB port of the computer on which
    it is connected. Download : Download high-res image (91KB) Download : Download

    of the TX nodes are programmed to configure the parameters of the radio module
    LoRa (frequency, transmit power, spreading factor SF, coding rate CR, bandwith
    BW) and periodically transmit the data frame presented on Table 1. Table 1. Data

    SF are used in order to experimentally quantify its impact on the communication
    range. Theorically, the higher it is, more the range increases but to the detriment
    of the data rate as the signal is transmitted over a longer period of time, see
    Table 2, but also to the detriment of the energy consumption as the radio communication
    is longer. At each cycle, the TX node reads the data of the SMT100 probe and successively
    transmits six frames with a spreading factor SF varying from 7 to 12, see the
    diagram of the TX program on Fig. 5a. The output power is constant and tuned at
    +10 dBm for the 433 MHz node and +14 dBm for the 868 MHz node. The coding rate
    CR is equal to 4/5 and the bandwidth BW is tuned to 125 kHz. Table 2. Transmit

    at SF = 7 and scans until the reception of a frame, see the diagram of the RX
    program on Fig. 5b. At each received frame, the RX node reads the values RSSI
    (Received Signal Strength Indication) and SNR (Signal-to-noise Ratio) which qualify
    the RF signal. It concatenates then the received frame of the TX node and the
    values of the RF signals to next send this frame to the computer, see Table 3.
    On the computer, a program in Python reads the data frames and stores them in
    a dated file with the GPS position. These data are next processed and analysed
    using Matlab software. Table 3. Data frame sent by the RX node to the computer.

    hectares is an open environment, flat without obstacles. At low depth, the composition
    of the soil is of sand ( of fine sand and of coarse sand), of silt ( of fine silt
    and of coarse silt) and of clay. The weather conditions were low temperatures
    (respectively 7.6 °C and 8.7 °C) with cloudy sky. Download : Download high-res

    3.1. Tests with different soil moistures A PVC tube of 8 cm diameter is buried
    on the field with the moisture probe on the side, see Figs. 7a and b. It is next
    covered with soil and compacted. A first set of experiments uses a set of TX and
    RX nodes operating at 433 MHz. A second set of experiments uses nodes operating
    at 868 MHz. Two different soil moistures (10% and 22%) are investigated. For each
    experiment, the TX node is installed inside the tube at about cm deep. The RX
    node is positionned on a tripod at m height, see Figs. 7c, d, e, and is straightly
    moved with steps of 5 m, see Figs. 7f anf g. Download : Download high-res image

    is buried with the probe at 15 cm depth, (c,d,e) The RX node is installed on a
    tripod at 2 m height, (f,g) Steps of 5 m are carried out. In the first set of
    experiments, the soil moisture is measured by the probe at , the soil relative
    permittivity at and the soil temperature at C. The results are presented on the
    left part of Fig. 8: at each inter-node distance RX-TX, the SF graphics highlight
    if the UG2AG link was successfully established or not for a spreading factor SF
    varying from 7 to 12. Clearly, the set of nodes operating at 868 MHz reached longer
    distance (170 m) than with the set at 433 MHz (125 m). These distances were reached
    by configuring a high spreading factor (SF 12) for the LoRa modules, that enables
    a high sensitivity and communication range to the detriment of the airtime and
    high energy consumption. We can observe that until 90 m, the UG2AG link at 868
    MHz is maintained for all the SF values, whereas only 55 m for the UG2AG link
    at 433 MHz. Therefore, although the 433 MHz is theorically more relevant to obtain
    longer communication range compared with the 868 MHz, the possibility to tune
    higher the power transmit at 868 MHz (+14 dBm for the 868 MHz and +10 dBm for
    the 433 MHz in line with the regulations) reverses the results. The values RSSI
    (Received Signal Strength Indication) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of the RX
    node decrease slowly with respect to the internode distance. They are however
    clearly higher at 868 MHz than at 433 MHz enabling to maintain the communication
    at a longer distance, despite more variations at 868 MHz. Download : Download

    on the UG2AG link obtained with a soil moisture of respectively (left part) and
    (right part). In the second set of experiments, the soil moisture and permittivity
    were doubled in comparison with the first experiments (soil moisture and relative
    permittivity ). The soil temperature was at C. The results are presented on the
    right part of Fig. 8. We can observe that the maximal internode distance with
    the set of nodes at 868 MHz is slightly affected by the higher soil moisture,
    leading to communications until 175 m. Moreover, until 80 m, the communications
    are always possible with all the SF values. The set of nodes at 433 MHz is however
    more impacted by the higher soil moisture: the maximal internode distance is slighly
    reduced (from 125 m to 115 m) but the communications are only possible with high
    SF values, and that from the distance 70 m. The RSSI and SNR values are however
    more stable at 433 MHz than at 868 MHz which have more variations. For these tests,
    we can also notice that the minimal RSSI value for the RX node is measured at
    −144 dBm, that is close to the sensitivity given in the datasheet of the SX1276
    component (-148 dBm). These experiments highlight the importance of this parameter
    in the choice of the radio component. By comparison, the sensitivity of the first
    LoRa transceiver SX1272 from Semtech was −137 dBm. In addition, these experiments
    highlight that as the communication signal is less attenuated at 868 MHz than
    at 433 MHz, a lower SF can be used to reach the same distance (e.g. at 100 m and
    soil moisture , the TX node at 868 MHz can use a SF = 9 whereas the TX node at
    433 MHz has to use a SF = 12). That enables to reduce the transmit time (this
    time is divided by six from SF = 12 to SF = 9, see the previously presented Table
    2), and therefore limit the energy consumption of the TX node. 3.2. Tests with
    the same transmit power (10 mW) The previous tests were carried out with TX nodes
    in line with the European regulations, i.e. +14 dBm/25 mW at 868 MHz and +10 dBm/10
    mW for the 433 MHz, meaning a difference of 4 dBm. To compare the performances
    with the same transmit power, the transmit power of the 868 MHz TX node was decreased
    at +10 dBm/10 mW. The results are presented on Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res
    image (129KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Same transmit power.
    We can observe that, even with the same transmit power, the communication at 868
    MHz is less attenuated than at 433 MHz (e.g. at the distance of 100 m, the signal
    is received at 868 MHZ with SF = 8 and SNR=-13 dB whereas at 433 MHz the signal
    is received with SF = 11 and SNR=-18 dB). Face to such results, we decided to
    continue the investigations on the UG2AG communication link using exclusively
    the 868 MHz frequency band. We investigated different configurations for the deployment
    of the nodes which can impact the communication range. The following section addresses
    the impact of the inclination of the RX antenna on the communication range. 3.3.
    Tests with different RX antenna inclinations The objective is here to study the
    impact of the inclination of the RX antenna on the communication range, see Figs.
    10a and b. Preliminary tests enabled to select two relevant inclinations of the
    RX antenna for the field experiments, i.e. a vertical RX antenna and an inclined
    RX antenna at . The RX antenna is pointed towards the buried TX node. As previously,
    the TX node is placed in a PVC tube and buried at 15 cm deep. The RX node is placed
    at 2 m above the soil. The experimental conditions were permittivity , humidity
    , temperature C. Download : Download high-res image (123KB) Download : Download

    pointed toward the TX node. The results are presented on Fig. 11. They highlight
    that the inclination of the RX antenna enables to maintain the communications
    with low SF (e.g. at 250 m, SF = 9 when the RX antenna is inclined, and SF = 12
    when the RX antenna is vertical) and significantly reduce the attenuation of the
    signal: the RSSI signal is about 10 to 15 dBm higher when the RX antenna is inclined
    in comparison when the RX antenna is vertical. The SNR signal remains moreover
    positive on a distance largely superior when the RX antenna is inclined (positive
    until 150 m) in comparison when the RX antenna is vertical (positive until 50
    m). Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size image

    burial depths for the TX node After have highlighted the interest of the 868 MHz
    frequency band and the inclination of the RX antenna, the objective of the following
    experimentations were to evaluate the impact of the depth of the buried node on
    the UG2AG communication. For that, two burial depths were considered, respectively
    15 cm and 30 cm as depicted on Fig. 12. The RX node is still placed at 2 m above
    the soil, and the measurements are carried out successively with a vertical RX
    antenna and an inclined RX antenna. The experimental conditions were permittivity
    , humidity , temperature C. The results are presented on Fig. 13. Download : Download

    respectively 15 cm and 30 cm with a vertical RX antenna (left part) and inclined
    RX antenna (right part). When the RX antenna is vertical, the communication range
    was 250 m when the TX node is at 15 cm deep. At 30 cm deep, the range is reduced
    to 175 m. The values of RSSI and SNR are however similars until 175 m, but when
    the TX node is at 15 cm, the RSSI signal is maintained about −142 dBm until 250
    m. When the RX antenna is inclined, the RSSI signal decreases of about 7dBm when
    the TX node is at 30 cm deep in comparison with 15 cm. The SNR signal is positive
    until 100 m for the TX node at 30 cm deep, and until 150 m for the TX node at
    15 cm deep (in comparison, the SNR signal is only positive until 50 m for the
    two burial depths when the Rx antenna is vertical). These results highlight the
    negative impact on the UG2AG link of the burial depht. However, the performances
    remain acceptable, even at 30 cm deep, that enables to envision environmental
    and agricultural monitoring applications. 3.5. Tests with the Tx antenna inside
    a container (PVC tube) or directly in contact with soil In all the experimentations
    presented in the previous sections, the TX antenna was located inside a PVC tube
    of 8 mm diameter. However, in order to check if this container had an impact on
    the quality of the communication, some comparative tests were carried out with
    the TX antenna directly in contact with the soil and the TX antenna in the PVC
    tube, see the principle scheme and materials on Fig. 14. For each of these two
    configurations, the measurements were carried out with respectively 15 cm and
    30 cm burial depths, and with respectively a vertical and inclined RX antenna.
    The experimental conditions were permittivity , humidity , temperature C. Fig.
    15, Fig. 16 present the results, and Table 4, Table 5 highlight particular points.

    cm Tube −130 −6 −140 −15 The RX antenna was vertical in Table 4, and inclined
    in Table 5. In the two Tables, the results are given for the inter-node distances
    of respectively 150 m and 250 m. In Table 4, at 150 m, the RSSI value decrease
    of 3 dBm at 15 cm deep when the TX antenna is placed on the PVC tube (from −132
    to −135 dBm), and 8 dBm at 30 cm deep. At 250 m, the RSSI signal is attenuated
    of 5 dBm at 15 cm deep, and no communication is possible at 30 cm deep. In Table
    5, it appears clearly that the RSSI and SNR values are improved when the RX antenna
    is inclined. In particular, at 150 m, the SNR value remains positive when the
    RX antenna is directly in contact with the soil at 15 cm and 30 cm. These results
    highlight clearly the negative impact of the PVC container on the communication.
    The performances are better when the TX antenna is directly in contact with the
    soil with RSSI signals about 10 dBm higher. Moreover, when the RX antenna is inclined
    and the burial depth is 15 cm with the TX antenna in contact with the soil (see
    the right part of Fig. 16), this configuration enables to emit with SF = 7 whatever
    the distance, leading to a short transmit time and energy consumption. The atteinable
    communication range with this configuration was 275 m. However, the limit of the
    communication range was not reached and longer distance could certainly be attainable.
    In fact, at 275 m, we reached the limit of the experimental field. However, such
    distance is already suited to develop monitoring applications based on UG2AG communications.
    3.6. Reliability of data transmission The packet delivery ratio (PDR), i.e. the
    ratio between the number of received packets (R) to the total number of sent packets
    (S), is an indicator of the reliability of the communication, see (1). (1) Experimentations
    were carried out to determine this ratio at each SF for internode distances going
    from 50 m to 200 m, see Table 6. The TX node was buried at 15 cm depth with the
    antenna directly in contact with the soil, and the RX node was located 2 m above
    the ground with a vertical RX antenna. At each SF, the TX node sends 100 packets
    and the number of received packets by the RX node was measured as well as the
    RSSI value. Table 6. Packet delivery ratio at different SF and RSSI values. Experimental
    conditions are 868 MHz/ 25mW, burial depth 15 cm, TX antenna in contact with the
    soil, vertical RX antenna, soil moisture . RSSI −115 dBm −120 dBm −130 dBm −135
    dBm Internode distance 50 m 100 m 150 m 200 m SF = 7 SF = 8 SF = 9 SF = 10 SF
    = 11 SF = 12 The results highlight that for RSSI values up to −120 dBm, that corresponds
    to an internode distance of 100 m, less than of packets were lost and the value
    of SF has little impact. However, from RSSI values below −130 dBm, the value of
    SF significantly impacts the quality of the link. At SF = 7 and −130 dBm, only
    of the packets transmitted were received in comparison to at SF = 12. At −135
    dBm, no packet was received at SF = 7 and still at SF = 12. 4. Discussion and
    conclusions This paper addresses the issue of the communication range of an UG2AG
    link in a WUSN to serve as basis for future applications in agriculture and environment
    monitoring. Based on the LoRa technology, two sets of nodes at 433 MHz and 868
    MHz were built and tested in real conditions, i.e. an open field with sandy soil
    composition, soil moisture of and , and burial depht of the nodes at 15 cm and
    30 cm. The interest of the 868 MHz radio modules at the maximal allowed transmit
    power in Europe (+14 dBm/25 mW) was first clearly highlighted with results more
    relevant in comparison to the 433 MHz frequency at +10 dBm/10 mW. Next, completed
    with a TX antenna directly placed in contact with the soil, as it was shown that
    a PVC container significantly attenuates the communication signal, and with an
    inclined RX antenna at pointed toward the buried node, UG2AG communication ranges
    of more than 275 meters long were reached. At this distance, the LoRa parameter
    SF can moreover be maintained at a low value enabling to limit the energy consumption
    of the buried TX node. The benefit to place the TX antenna directy in contact
    with the soil and incline the RX antenna is highlighted in the Table 7 which is
    the synthesis of the results at the internode distance of 100 m. Table 7. Synthesis

    are already relevant to envision the deployment of such nodes in the field, several
    improvements could be considered in future work. First, it will be necessary to
    deploy several TX buried nodes in the field during several seasons to study the
    behavior and reliability of the communications over different weather conditions
    and vegetation cover. Moreover, it could be interesting to adapt some parameters
    of the nodes, as well as the layout of the RX node in the field. In particular,
    the SF parameter could be tuned with respect to the soil moisture measured by
    the probe (e.g. low value in dry soil and high value in wet soil). Another way
    could be to modify the SF value with respect to the RSSI and SNR values measured
    by the RX node as with the adaptive data rate (ADR) in the LoRaWAN protocol (Li
    et al., 2018). This approach requires however to implement the AG2UG link and
    define listening windows for the RX node. During our experiments, we have also
    observed the benefit for the communication range to orientate the antenna of the
    RX node towards the TX node. In case of several TX nodes disseminated in the field
    or a mobile RX node embedded on a vehicle, an approach could be to actuate the
    orientation of the RX antenna to control and maintain this direction during inter-node
    communications, e.g. from the knowledge of the GPS coordinates. This approach
    requires however some memory capacities of the TX nodes and bi-directionnal communications
    with adequate strategies. Another point that could be considered is to investigate
    the robustness of the UG2AG communication face to the potential presence of interferences.
    In fact, the experimentations reported in this paper were performed in relatively
    interference-free areas, i.e. without active transmitters in the immediate vicinity
    with the same frequency range. Most of the time, this is the case in the considered
    applications (agriculture and monitoring of natural environments). However, although
    LoRa is a robust technology which possesses a remarkable immunity to multipath
    and interferences, in particular when small bandwidths and high spreading factors
    are used, the presence of interferences in more disturbed environmenst could be
    studied, with the possibility to adapt both the channel frequency and the coding
    rate. Finally, other frequency bands could also be advantageously investigated
    in the WUSN, as the 869.4–869.65 MHz which allows transmit powers of 500mW, that
    means twenty times higher than the transmit power used in this paper. This band
    is not part of the LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Networks) and is thus not suited
    for monitoring applications as it would involve a high energy consumption for
    the TX buried node, but it could be used as an alternative to send alert messages
    requiring reliable communications. CRediT authorship contribution statement Laure

  description: The global economy benefits significantly from agriculture. However,
    there are significant issues and difficulties in the irrigation sector as a result
    of a significant regional imbalance in power supply, water availability, rainfall,
    and adoption of technology. The most economical approach to supporting agriculture
    in the modern day is through irrigation powered by renewable energy. Productivity
    is impacted by environmental issues, defective irrigation systems, and unknowable
    soil moisture content in agricultural fields. Traditional watering systems might
    lose up to 50% of the water used due to ineffective irrigation, evaporation, and
    overwatering. As a result, the proposed study will modify solar tree-based smart
    irrigation systems that use the most recent sensors for real-Time or old data
    to influence watering flows and change watering schedules to enhance the system
    efficiency. One application of a wireless sensor network is proposed for low-cost
    wireless controlled irrigation and real-Time monitoring of soil water levels using
    Arduino controllers. Data is gathered for drip irrigation control using wireless
    acquisition stations powered by renewable energy, which lowers the risk of electrocution
    and boosts output.

    from agriculture. However, there are significant issues and difficulties in the
    irrigation sector as a result of a significant regional imbalance in power supply,
    water availability, rainfall, and adoption of technology. The most economical
    approach to supporting agriculture in the modern day is through irrigation powered
    by renewable energy. Productivity is impacted by environmental issues, defective
    irrigation systems, and unknowable soil moisture content in agricultural fields.
    Traditional watering systems might lose up to 50% of the water used due to ineffective
    irrigation, evaporation, and overwatering. As a result, the proposed study will
    modify solar tree-based smart irrigation systems that use the most recent sensors
    for real-time or old data to influence watering flows and change watering schedules
    to enhance the system efficiency. One application of a wireless sensor network
    is proposed for low-cost wireless controlled irrigation and real-time monitoring
    of soil water levels using Arduino controllers. Data is gathered for drip irrigation
    control using wireless acquisition stations powered by renewable energy, which
    lowers the risk of electrocution and boosts output. Published in: 2022 International

    Location: Mahendragarh, India SECTION I. Introduction Every nation''s economy
    depends heavily on agriculture. Around 80% of fresh water is used for agriculture,
    and as the population grows, this proportion will become even more significant
    in terms of water use. Therefore, it is essential to create a system for long-term
    water management that is based on science and technology. The simplest to the
    most advanced water-saving techniques are available for a wide range of crops.
    A different strategy based on plant canopy temperature was created to organize
    irrigation of the agricultural water stress index. This study utilized a low-cost
    wireless device for data transmission. An autonomous irrigation system was developed
    using a low-cost moisture sensor. A data collection system was created for the
    purpose of monitoring crop status. Data on soil moisture, air quality, and canopy
    temperature were retrieved using a computer connected through a serial connection
    for analysis and storage. To increase the efficacy of water management, a new
    system based on a WSN and a weather station for online drainage water monitoring
    is being created. The development of WSNs based on communication and microcontroller
    technologies has the potential to advance current approaches. Home applications
    depend on wireless embedded sensors for the monitoring and control of household
    goods. Additionally, the utilization of sensor networks can enhance security.
    WSNs, which collect data in real time in industrial settings, have been set up
    for inventory management. It is commonly known that solar energy is a crucial
    resource for the future of the world. A sizable portion of the nation''s energy
    requirements might potentially be satisfied by solar energy. Numerous applications,
    particularly agricultural loads, benefit from its maintenance benefits [1]. One
    of the most appealing solutions available today is solar-powered water pumping
    systems. Moreover, the advantages of using solar water pumps instead of electric
    or diesel power to pump groundwater. It shows how important it is to use good
    pumping systems in the field when using different types of irrigation [2]. Maintaining
    science-and technology-based approaches to water sustainability, including managerial,
    technological, agronomic, and institutional developments, is crucial. Automated
    agricultural irrigation is mostly focused on crop water requirements. Utilizing
    the Internet and sensor network technology can help reduce water waste and make
    the most of scientific advancements in irrigation techniques. It might therefore
    greatly increase water utilization and production. It became obvious how valuable
    the Internet of Things (IOT) was in creating the foundation for a number of businesses,
    such as smart health services, smart homes, smart education in schools, and automation.
    It mostly focuses on efficient farming and the resources that go into it. Agricultural
    products need applications like monitoring soil moisture, monitoring temperature
    and moisture, managing the supply chain, and managing the infrastructure [3].
    In the meantime, knowledge of technologically based irrigation systems is needed
    to properly analyze, estimate, and monitor the farm field. Many studies suggest
    keeping the agriculture water pumping system running by using IoT-based agriculture,
    smart farming with Precision Agriculture (PA) [4], Smart Solar Water Photovoltaic
    Pumping System (SSPWP) [5], and other utilities. This research introduces an innovative
    smart irrigation system that makes use of a solar tree as an energy source in
    place of conventional energy sources. In particular, solar tree designs are being
    developed in urban areas for a range of uses. The challenge arose when it came
    to manufacturing the solar tree in large quantities. Many of the solar tree sculptures
    are shown in this study for better comprehension. The paper''s flow begins with
    an explanation of the various solar tree designs in section 1 and a suggestion
    for a new solar tree utilizing the CREO 2.0 programme. In the next section, we
    will also look at and analyze how Proteus software is used to measure and track
    soil moisture and solar radiation. SECTION II. SOLAR TREE MODELS A. Need of Solar
    Tree instead of Traditional Solar Panels Solar trees allow for the placement of
    multiple layers of solar panels in locations with limited space, maximizing the
    productivity of the available space. The solar tree design is beautiful as well
    as practical. Solar trees are much more aesthetically pleasing than conventional
    solar panels because of the way they are arranged. Additionally, a solar array
    shaped like a tree might be visually appealing. For homes where solar roofing
    is not an option, solar panel trees can be a great substitute. They are also made
    accessible by built-in vacuuming machines and involuntary sun tracking. They are
    primarily used in a range of schools and businesses around the world to inform
    and persuade people about the significance of solar technology. There are various
    solar tree designs that are thought to produce much more electric power when compared
    to typical solar panels covering the same surface area B. Main Objectives of Solar
    Tree To conserve land resources To improve the efficiency of solar modules by
    strategically placing panels. To raise public knowledge about the benefits of
    solar energy. C. Advantages of solar Trees By putting the PV panels in a higher
    place, it gets an extra hour of sunlight every day. It also consumes 10 to 15%
    more electricity than an earlier setup on land. Farming difficulties can be addressed
    while solar energy can be employed on land with the potential to produce. Both
    rural and urban areas have been shown to be viable for the concept. Solar equipment
    would take the place of traditional tools on the ground, drastically changing
    the output of the agriculture sector. Solar trees are capable of producing a lot
    of energy. These trees can absorb energy from the sun''s beams and the wind since
    they are plants in the natural world. Solar Tree can create energy from the wind
    by shaking itself, just like a real tree, and has flexible stems that can rotate
    in any direction. If people anticipate solar technology and understand its significance,
    they will be more conscious of the growing need for renewable energy. They will
    see in their daily lives that the majority of the power on Earth is provided for
    free and in great quantities by the sun, leading them to believe that by installing
    a number of panels, property owners will be able to receive all of the power they
    need throughout the day and save hundreds of dollars per month on energy bills.
    Agricultural workers can also gain from solar energy by switching out out-dated
    equipment for more modern, effective models. The national government can buy the
    extra electricity produced by solar panels at a price that gives farmers a sizable
    discount over the cost of producing solar power, replacing conventional pump sets,
    especially those that utilize diesel, with solar pumps instead. For instance,
    if you need a PV unit to produce 2 MW of electricity, you''ll need 10 to 12 acres
    of land to accommodate the panels. To create the same amount of energy, however,
    you only need 0.10–0.12 acres of land if you have a solar tree. Due to their amazing
    ability to produce energy while consuming the least amount of possible land, solar
    trees are currently in use and are anticipated to do so in the long run. For better
    comprehension, below are some examples of current solar trees as in table.1. SECTION
    III. PROPOSED SOLAR TREE FOR AGRICULTURE APPLICATIONS For instance, it would need
    10 to 12 acres of land to accommodate the panels if you needed a PV unit to produce
    2 MW of electricity. However, if you have a solar tree, you just need 0.10–0.12
    acres of land to generate the same amount of electricity. Solar trees are being
    utilized and are anticipated to be used for a long time since they may offer exceptional
    energy while requiring the least amount of land possible. Below are a few examples
    of current solar trees to help you understand. A. CREO-2.0 Computer-aided design
    (CAD) software called Creo, developed by PTC, is used by many businesses to produce
    products. You can perform technical illustrations, viewing, and visualization
    in Creo as well as 3D CAD parametric modeling, solid applications, 3D modeling
    directly, 2D orthographic views, schematic design, simulation, and finite element
    analysis. A water pump in a particular agricultural area is supposed to be powered
    by the suggested solar tree. The proposed solar tree as shown in Fig. 1 with a
    capacity of 0.58 kW and 12 panels of 50wP set at a suitable height of 8 to 10
    ft. Simple tools like sketch, extrude, and other similar ones were used in conjunction
    with the CREO 2.0 software to produce these models. A three-dimensional understanding
    of its branches and shadow-free solar leaves is intended by the models that are
    being given. Table. 1. Literature of Solar Trees SECTION IV. SOLAR TREE BASED
    WATER PUMPING SYSTEM AND RESULTS These solar trees'' main use is to use an Arduino
    controller to control and power a water pumping system. The objective is to measure
    the moisture in the field, together with the temperature and humidity, in addition
    to operating the water pump. When of now, the system''s primary goal has been
    to pump water as needed for irrigation, with demand being estimated by moisture
    and temperature readings. Relays are engaged when it reaches the threshold value,
    delivering signals to the Arduino controller. The GSM module receives the signals
    in the interim and uses them to activate or deactivate the motor. The fundamental
    steps specify the system''s operational strategy. Fig. 1 (a) Proposed Solar Tree:
    Front View Show All Fig. 1 (b) Proposed Solar Tree: Left side View Show All Fig.
    1 (c) Proposed Solar Tree: Right Side View Show All A. Soil Moisture Measurement
    In addition to soil moisture sensors, soil moisture meters are also used. It is
    primarily used to monitor soil moisture, measure the volumetric water content
    of soil, irrigate crops, and protect forests. The most widely used soil moisture
    sensor at the moment has FDR type and TDR type, or frequency domain type and time-domain
    type, respectively as shown in fig. 3. B. Temperature and Humidity Measurement
    A farming operation may succeed or fail based on how well you measure air, temperature,
    and moisture. Thus, accuracy is crucial. When growing vegetables in a greenhouse,
    humidity and temperature go hand in hand. partly because abnormalities in either
    can frequently result in comparable outcomes. Plants naturally respond to their
    surroundings. Additionally, for plants to survive, a specific set of atmospheric
    conditions must exist for them to their need to breathe is mostly to blame for
    this. In plants, respiration is the process by which water is removed from the
    leaves through evaporation through the stomata on the underside of the leaves.
    Stomata are tiny holes that are often on the surface of a plant''s leaves. They
    help control how gases and water move through the plant during photosynthesis.
    Fig. 3 shows that the overall block diagram for the application with proposed
    solar tree. Fig. 3: Soil Moisture Measurement using capacitance Show All Fig.
    4: Block diagram of the Proposed System Show All 1. Implementation through Proteus
    Proteus Software is used to create a working model to measure the soil moisture,
    temperature, and humidity from fig. 4 sulpture. Solar trees are proposed as a
    source of energy for a particular application. The work flow is simulated, and
    the results are as follows: First, the moisture level, which is determined by
    moisture sensors, is regulated to 0.3wf for healthy and normal plant growth. The
    user receives an irrigation alarm and has the option to turn on or off the motor
    when the field’s moisture level drops below 300. The LCD display shows the moisture,
    temperature, and humidity readings, while the GSM module sends messages as shown
    in fig 5. A. Moisture, Temperature and Humidity Measurement in various Test cases
    The circuit is activated by varying soil moisture, humidity, and temperature values.
    The moisture measuring electrodes then transfer these values to the soil DHT sensors,
    which compare them to the soil’s real tolerance value. When it drops or rises
    above a certain threshold value, the controller immediately takes action to give
    the user the information via a GSM module based on whether or not the motor needs
    to be turned on or off. This same method can be used for the other parameters,
    and it has been tested with low, medium, and high values to make sure that the
    LCD screen shows the right values, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 5: Simulation of Proposed
    Circuit in Proteus Show All Fig. 6 Circuit with lower moisture level Show All
    The circuit is tested with defined temperature and humidity values, and according
    to Fig. 7, it not only sends an SMS to the appropriate cell but also displays
    the information on an LED panel. It functions as an alarm in abnormal circumstances
    to prevent damage or outages. These examples were simultaneously verified at various
    humidity and temperature levels. Fig. 7: Circuit with sufficient temperature and
    humidity values Show All 2. Discussions A fresh strategy is proposed to advance
    the agriculture industry. To take care of the agriculture feeder for a variety
    of reasons, like improving the quality of the supply, the voltage profile, reducing
    losses, etc. Using the proposed solar tree, automate the Arduino controller for
    the solar water pumping system. The benefits of energy ownership to end users
    Reducing human interference when farming to prevent electrocution while operating
    the water pump. SECTION V. CONCLUSIONS Due to issues including clumsy energy supply,
    ongoing human needs, and insufficient watering systems, traditional farming operations
    do not yield the desired outcomes. The most effective solution is \"smart irrigation
    using renewable energy sources.\" This study uses a solar tree as a sustainable
    energy source for irrigation to measure metrics including soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. In this instance, the proposed solar tree is preferable to the conventional
    one. The Arudino controller manages and runs solar tree-based farming, and it
    may connect sensors like a moisture sensor, a temperature sensor, and a humidity
    sensor in order to get the best weather conditions for running our irrigation
    system within the allotted period. Due to the device’s complete computerization,
    a farmer may control the motor while getting an irrigation alarm from a distance,
    which also eliminates the need for labor. This technique makes use of drip irrigation,
    a particularly efficient irrigation technique. There is no need for a farmer to
    worry about production as a result. Their crops receive the appropriate quantity
    of water for drip irrigation. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors wish to thank CHRIST

  description: Agriculture is one of the main areas where a country’s economy hugely
    depends on. But, the agricultural lands yielding the crops and the crops themselves
    face huge threats from environmental impacts and aggressions. To overcome these
    issues, several steps have been taken from the past to the present. Though the
    problems keep on evolving, the countermeasures are also being developed alongside.
    In this way, the introduction of Wireless Sensor Network into agriculture made
    a huge revolution. With Wireless Sensor Network, the crops could be grown with
    precaution. The sensor nodes of the network update the user with interest data
    through a sink node. This process is automatic and much faster than the existing
    methods. The Wireless Sensor Network can even be upgraded by optimizing it with
    relevant optimizers. This enhancement is necessary for constant improvements in
    crop yield. And hence, a genetic algorithm-based optimization method is implemented
    in Wireless Sensor Network in this paper. A genetic algorithm is nothing but an
    algorithm like other algorithms with a background of any behaviour or activity
    of certain living species that perfectly matches the concerned system approach.
    The genetic algorithm being used here is the newly emerged Red Deer Algorithm.
    The red deer algorithm is derived from an unusual behaviour of the Scottish red
    deer species during their mating saga. The simulation results show that introducing
    the red deer protocol in wireless sensor network gives massive output and is more
    efficient than the former existing methods

    IEEE Conference Location: Antalya, Turkey SECTION I. Introduction Demands on water
    resources are constantly increasing due to natural growth in population. It is
    predicted that world population will double in the next 50 years. In response,
    greater yields must be extracted from the current agricultural areas and more
    marginal lands should be prepared. Generally, and particularly in Palestine region,
    agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water accounting for more than 50%
    of water consumption [1]. A pressing challenge facing the agriculture sector is
    how to boost production with less land, less water, and without damage to the
    environment. To meet these requirements, there is a strong need to create new
    unconventional agricultural techniques with the focus on productivity and better
    management of the available resources-productive farming. The focus of these techniques
    is to maximize the agricultural productivity [2] by increasing the yield and minimizing
    the cost and losses. One main component in productive farming is the employment
    of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) [3] into agricultural management
    systems. These systems are called Smart Farming systems [4]. In smart farming,
    multiple recent emerging technologies such as Internet of things (IoT) [5], Wireless
    Sensors Network [6], and Cloud Computing [7] [8], combined with machine learning
    techniques are integrated to create an environment that advance productivity in
    farming practice. Smart farming is expected to have a major impact on the advancement
    of this development in the near future. This paper describes the design and implementation
    of the software component of a smart farming system with the focus on the management
    of water use in agriculture, irrigation. The work in this paper is based on the
    Masters'' thesis of the first author [9]. Irrigation is one of the main consuming
    factors of agricultural resources. To get an optimal irrigation schedule, it is
    necessary to deliver to the plant the required quantity of water taking into consideration
    other parameters, such as the environment condition, the texture of the soil,
    the kinds of crop and its growth stage. In Palestine, the irrigation schedule
    is mainly conventional based on the farmer experience. This conventional approach
    causes inefficient use of water and over or under irrigation. This can reduce
    the crops'' yield and increase wasted fresh water due to non-beneficial evaporation,
    drainage, leaching, or ineffective water delivery. Furthermore, a loss in fertilizers
    which are delivered through water is likely to happen. Even though, there is a
    significant effort in establishing additional surface water resources, saving
    water and improving operational skills can have a major impact on agricultural
    productivity [10]. One challenge facing farmers to practice productive farming
    is the lack of knowledge about the state-of-the-art productive farming techniques.
    Inexperienced farmers need better knowledge of the texture of the soil, the characteristics
    of the field, and the development of the crops. One goal of the application described
    in this paper is to gather this knowledge from agricultural experts and the environment''s
    condition. This knowledge together with a decision-support system will allow inexperienced
    farmers practice best farming in a semiautomated manner. In this system, the farmer
    only needs to decide what he want to plant, and the date of planting, then the
    smart farming process will lead him to practice productive farming that minimizes
    consumption of resources and maximizes the yield. The main contributions of this
    paper are: 1) a cloud-based application that controls automatic irrigation in
    the field, and 2) a database schema that integrates the sensors'' data with information
    gathered from agricultural experts and information gathered from the farmer about
    the characteristics of the field. SECTION II. Related Work The integration of
    Wireless Sensor Networks with Cloud Computing has received attention in multiple
    domains [11]–[15]. This includes smart hospital [16] and patient monitoring [17].
    The need and challenges of this integration and how they are approached are discussed
    as well [18]. In agriculture, Anisi et. al [19] presented a survey of wireless
    sensor network approaches and their energy consumption for monitoring farm fields
    in Precision Agriculture. The potential of WSN on sugarcane crop is explored in
    [20]. The optimal topology of the WSN in agriculture for improving the network
    lifetime is explored in [21]. However, these systems did not consider cloud computing
    and data management. The work in [22] gathers information from experts and made
    them available to the farmer through a cloud application. A review on big data
    and using it in smart farming is discussed in [23]. The development of smart farming
    technologies and their application in Brazil [24] show the impact of these technologies
    on production system and the environment. The SWAMP project [25] develops an IoT
    -based smart water management platform for precision irrigation in agriculture
    with the focus on replicability and scalability. However, the focus of our work
    is on the data management using database schema to manage the automation process
    in smart farming. SECTION III. Method and Material A. Root Zone Management Irrigation
    can be defined as the proper application of water to the plant root zone at the
    proper time. To get an optimal irrigation schedule, it is necessary to deliver
    to the plant the required quantity of water, taking into consideration several
    factors include. The kind of plant.. The stage of growth of a plant, plants require
    more water as they grow. The texture of the soil, the fraction of sand, silt and
    clay in the soil mix. Different soil textures have different water holding capacity.
    In addition to its own need for the plant, water acts as a delivery medium for
    transporting the necessary nutrients and treatments to the root through irrigation.
    Therefore, optimal water management can help achieve optimal nutrients and medicines
    management. A plant available water must be in the root zone in sufficient quantity
    for optimal growth. In addition to water and nutrients, plants need sufficient
    air concentration in the soil. Field Capacity refers to a moisture level where
    all excess water is drained out due to the force of gravity. At this level small
    pores space of soil are full of water while large pores are full of air. This
    is the ideal condition for plant growth. It is easy for a plant to pull water
    and nutrition from the soil and air is available as well. Lack of air in the soil
    “may be” due to excess water in the root zone, a condition called waterlogging
    or saturation, where soil pores are filled with water. If this condition happened
    for a long period of time, it can cause harm to the plant due to the lack of Oxygen
    (plant air stress) and causes a reduction in the yield [26]. Plant air stress
    will limit the growth of the root and makes plants more susceptible to diseases
    and other deficiencies. Further, it causes losses in water, fertilizers, and labor.
    As shown in Fig. 1, when the moisture level in the root zone drops below a threshold
    value called wilting point, where the plant cannot pull water from the soil, it
    causes a condition called plant water stress. Under this condition, water is strongly
    bounded by capillary “action” to the soil particles and it is hard to be extracted
    by the plant. If this happens for a long period of time, the plant will wilt and
    possibly die. Field capacity [27] and the wilting point [28] depend on the soil
    texture and the kind of crops. F or optimal growth to maximize the yield and to
    reduce wasting resources, water content should be maintained in the available
    water range. At this level, it is easy for the plant to absorb water and air is
    available in the soil as well. Fig. 1 shows these cases. In summary, maintaining
    soil moisture at optimal level in the root zone can enhance farming productivity.
    Too much moisture can cause root diseases and wasted water. While too little moisture
    can cause yield loss and plant death. Fig. 1. Field capacity and wilting point.
    Show All In conventional farming, there are several challenges to achieve optimal
    irrigation schedule include, when to irrigate ? and how much? The required amount
    of irrigation must, at least, meet the crop water loss through evapotranspiration.
    Both timing of irrigation and the amount of irrigation has a major impact on productive
    farming. However, timing of irrigation has a significant influence on crop yield
    and quality. In some growth stage, delayed irrigation can reduce the potential
    yield and quality significantly. The application described in this paper provides
    the software component of an automation technique to manage the root zone moisture.
    The goal is to control the water and air concentration in the root zone to their
    optimal level for a given crop and soil texture. Application of such a system
    will help increase the productivity of farming by increasing the yield and decreases
    losses in resources such as water, nutrient and human labor. The application uses
    recent emerging technologies which are described in the following subsections.
    B. Gathering Data and Triggering Action Recent advances in computing power, storage,
    and network communications have enabled Machine-to-Machine communication and shifted
    the roll of computing devices from passive devices to proactive devices. Based
    on these technology advancements, new systems are emerging including Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN) [29]. The main components of these systems are small and
    cheap sensing elements and actuators linked together through wireless connections
    to perform sensing and actuation tasks. Sensor nodes can collect information about
    the physical environment around them and communicate this information wirelessly
    to a base station. Based on this information, a decision-support system application
    running on the base station can be used to trigger events that execute actuation
    responses in the environment. Accessing devices such as GPS, soil moisture sensors
    have become cost effective and widely available to be deployed in the field in
    a large scale. By gathering data from the field using these devices, the use of
    agricultural resources such as fertilizer and water can be more effective. Furthermore,
    controlling the delivery of these resources to the plant will keep them at optimal
    level which results in increasing the yield and the quality. The basic elements
    of a WSN are: sensor nodes, a gateway, and a base station described below. Sensor
    nodes: A wireless sensor node contains sensing and computing devices, radio transceiver
    and power components. It gathers environmental properties through attached sensors,
    translates them into digital form and sends them wirelessly to a base station
    possibly through other nodes. Actuators can be connected to a wireless node to
    trigger actions in the environment (e.g. turning a pump or valve on or off) A
    base station: A base station is a computer that interfaces between users and the
    wireless sensor network. It executes applications that are responsible for receiving
    and processing data collected by the sensor nodes. It is responsible for triggering
    actions in the environment by sending control messages to actuators connected
    to wireless sensor nodes. Typically, the amount of data collected by the sensors
    and the amount of necessary computation is large. Therefore, it is more practical
    that the base station is connected to a cloud-based server through web services
    where the data can be shared and processed. A gateway: A gateway is a networking
    device that interconnects two different networks running different communication
    protocols. The gateway in the WSN is necessary to interconnect the communication
    between a WSN using Zigbee protocol [30] and the IP-based network. C. Cloud Computing
    The amount of data generated by WSN systems is significantly large and requires
    high storage and processing power, which is beyond the capability of a personal
    computer. Further, more information from domain experts in the targeted application
    is needed, and feedback to the decision-support system is useful in improving
    the future decisions based on previous experience through the application of machine
    learning techniques. Typically, those experts are not available on site and their
    remote access to the system is essential to include their experience. Therefore,
    leveraging the recently emerging Cloud Computing Paradigm provides an effective
    solution to these issues. First, Cloud Computing provides a scalable computing
    and storage resource as needed by the system. Second, Cloud Computing provides
    most of its resources as services which allows sharing of data and information
    [31]. The goal of this project is to design a Cloud-based application which manages
    the data coming from the sensors in a WSN for smart farming and water management
    systems. Using Web Services [32]–[34] interface, the application will gather data
    collected by the sensors in the field, which includes environmental conditions
    (e.g. soil moisture and temperature). Furthermore, the application will gather
    data through a web interface from agricultural experts about best agricultural
    practice which includes: 1) knowledge about the amount of water needed for a particular
    kind of crops as a function of age of the plant and the nature of the soil, and
    2) the kind of fertilizers needed for each kind of plant at different age, and
    3) the different types of soil and their specifications. This knowledge will be
    saved in a database. SECTION IV. System Architecture In this section we describe
    the architectural design of a cloud-based application which manages the data coming
    from the sensors in a WSN for smart farming and water management system. The application
    gathers the data collected by the sensors in the farm, such as, soil moisture
    and temperature. Also, through a web interface, it gathers from agricultural experts''
    information about best agricultural practice which includes information about
    the amount of water required for a particular kind of plant as a function of age
    of the plant and the type of the soil. This information and the sensors data are
    saved in a database. Based on this information, the application determines an
    irrigation schedule for the plants that needs it, and communicates this schedule
    to the base station in the field. Consequently, the base station triggers irrigation
    events in the field. The application, not only, schedules irrigation but also
    helps the farmer make decisions about some of these factors in order to automate
    the decision-making process. The architecture of the management system as shown
    in Fig. 2 consists of two main components, the hardware component and the software
    components. The hardware component consists of sensing devices distributed in
    the field. These devices gather data from the environment through sensors and
    communicate this data to a base station using wireless sensor network in the field.
    Other devices (actuators) are connected to a wireless node to trigger action in
    the field such as open and close water valves. The software component consists
    of two applications, the farm application, and the cloud application. The farm
    application is executed on a computer in the farm. It has two main tasks, 1) It
    gathers the data from WSN and puts it in a specific format and communicates this
    data to the cloud application through a web service interface and 2) It receives
    decision from the cloud application in a timely manner about each valve whether
    it should be open for irrigation or closed. The cloud application is a web application
    that runs on a cloud server. It saves the data obtained from the farm application
    and from agricultural experts in a database. Also, it has a decision support system
    that determines when to irrigate each zone of the farm based on sensors data and
    the information provided by agricultural experts. The focus of this paper is only
    the cloud application. Fig. 2. System architecture. Show All The rest of the section
    is organized as follow. Subsection A gives a brief review about web services.
    Subsection B describes how the land is partitioned and the placement of sensors
    in the field. Subsection C give a brief description about the farm application.
    Subsection D provides the design of the smart farming web application and the
    database schema. A. Web Services The communication between the cloud-based framework
    and the base station in the field is based on web services. A web service is a
    piece of software that is available remotely over the Internet. Web services are
    not tied to any operating system or any programming language which makes them
    loosely coupled. They provide a reliable way for publishing data and applications
    over the Internet for sharing. There are two types of web services, the Simple
    Object Access Protocol (SOAP) [35] and the Representational State Transfer (REST)
    [36]. SOAP is a standard-based protocol that has been developed earlier than REST.
    It depends on XML for messaging services and from the beginning it is designed
    to be extendible. SOAP is not tied to any particular transport protocol. Unfortunately,
    the XML-based communication can become very complex in some programming languages.
    Unlike SOAP, REST [37], the successor of SOAP, is not a protocol. It is a network-based
    architectural style developed to simplify the access to web services. It provides
    a lighter way approach. REST web services are built to work best on the web. Instead
    of using XML, REST uses URL for messaging services and uses the HTTP1.1 verbs
    (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform its tasks. REST web services doesn''t
    have to use XML for messaging. It can communicate the data in Comma Separated
    Value (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), XML, and Really Simple Syndication
    (RSS)[38]. These features free the programmer to choose the data format that suites
    the used programming language. Both SOAP and REST has their own advantages and
    disadvantages based on the requirement of the application. We chose the REST web
    services over the SOAP mainly because it is easier to use and develop. B. Sensors
    Placement As shown in Fig. 2, the field is divided into several irrigation zones.
    A zone can be considered as an irrigation management unit that has semi-uniform
    characteristics, such as topography, type of soil, kind and age of the growing
    crops. Each zone corresponds to an area for irrigation. A zone can be irrigated
    by turning on and off an electric valve controlled by the farm application. In
    each zone, several sensors can be placed to get the value of different parameters
    necessary for optimal growth of the plant, such as, moisture levels. For optimal
    irrigation [39], soil moisture level in the root zone must be maintained between
    the field capacity and the wilting point as discussed in Section II. Since the
    size of the root zone increases as the plant grow, moisture sensors are placed
    at different locations and at different depth in the field. Each sensor is connected
    to a wireless node and identified by its zone and to which wireless nodes it is
    connected. The data gathered by the wireless nodes are transmitted through an
    RF antenna to a gateway node, where it receives all different kind of sensed data
    in a timely manner. This data will be passed from the gateway to a computer in
    the field where it then can be transmitted to the cloud application. C. Farm Application
    The farm application is a software that runs on a computer in the field. The main
    tasks of the farm application are: In a timely manner the application reads the
    sensor data from the sensor nodes deployed in the field. Then, it puts the data
    in a specific format and communicates this data to the cloud application by invoking
    the web service uploadSensorsReading provided by the cloud application. In a timely
    manner the farm application invokes the web service zonesIrrigation provided by
    the cloud application to get the list of zones'' ids and which valves to turn
    on and which ones to turn off. Based on the data received from the cloud application,
    it sends a message to the wireless node that controls the water valves to turn
    each water valve on or off. D. Cloud Application The cloud application is a software
    run on the cloud. It gathers sensors data from the field through the web service
    interface, knowledge about the soil and plant characteristics through a web form
    interface, the arrangement of zones and sensors through a farmer web form. The
    cloud application based on this information starts/stops irrigation based on this
    data through the irrigation service. The software architecture of the cloud application
    is shown in Fig. 3. There are three different users of the web application, admin
    user, expert user, and farmer user, in addition to two web services for programs
    to access. All users have different privileges to access the backend database.
    Farmers interface: Farmer interface provides a web form, where the farmer can
    select the crop he wants to plant and the cultivation date. Also, through this
    interface, the farmer sets zones identifiers, different kind of sensors identifiers
    and to which wireless node each sensor is connected and in what zone. Admin interface:
    The admin user has full privileges on all tables of the database. He can create,
    modify, and delete any user he wants. Domain expert interface: This interface
    allows agricultural expert to add, modify, and delete information about different
    kinds of plants and soil characteristics. This information is saved in the irrigation
    optimal values table with the appropriate data for different kind of plants and
    different types of soil. Save sensors data web service: This web service is used
    to upload the readings of the sensors in the field and saves it in the backend
    database. The farm application gathers the sensors data from the field. Then it
    puts this data in a JSON object and invokes the service with the JSON object as
    a parameter. The interface of this service is uploadSesnorsReading(JASON). Irrigation
    web service: The function of the second web service is to return to the caller
    a list of zones that require their irrigation status be changed to start or stop.
    This web service invokes the Irrigation decision support system described below
    to get this information and return it to the caller. Irrigation decision support
    system: The decision support system decides whether a zone is to be irrigated
    or not based on zones'' moisture level, the type of soil, and the kind and age
    of the plant. The moisture level of a zone is calculated by taking the weighted
    average of all sensors'' readings in the zone. Weights based on the age of the
    plant can be used to give lower weights for deep sensors when the plant is young
    and increase the weights for these sensors as the plant grows. However, we didn''t
    implement this approach in this paper. We just calculated the average moisture
    of all sensors in the zone and call it zone moisture. Once the zone moisture level
    is calculated for each zone, it is compared with the threshold data stored in
    the database for each crop and soil type. If the moisture value exceeds the upper
    threshold, the irrigation is set off for that zone. If the moisture level is below
    the lower threshold value, the irrigation is set to on. Otherwise, when the moisture
    level is in the optimal range, the irrigation status stays as it is and no action
    needs to be taken. Fig. 3. Software architecture of the cloud application. Show
    All E. Database The cloud application uses a backend database to manage the data
    gathered from the sensors in the field, the data gathered from agricultural experts,
    and the data from the farmer. A cultivation cycle consists of one or more zones.
    Each zone can be irrigated using an electric valve and it contains multiple different
    sensors. These sensors are connected to wireless nodes to communicate the data
    to the base station. The relational database schema as shown in Fig. 4 consists
    of the following entities. Cultivation entity: Each cultivation cycle consists
    of one or more zones and one kind of plant. Each cultivation cycle has its own
    id, and date of planting. The age of the plant can be calculated from the cultivation
    date. Sensor entity. Several kinds of sensors that measure different quantities
    can be used in this system. Each sensor has attributes: id, name, type, and unit.
    The type attribute of a sensor is the physical quantity that it measures, such
    as moisture, temperature, humidity, etc. The unit attribute is the unit of the
    measured data. For example, degree Celsius for temperature. Data collected by
    the sensors in the system is saved in the Sensors Reading table. Since each physical
    sensor is connected to a wireless sensor node in the field. The sensor entity
    is connected to the node entity as shown in the schema. The relationship is many
    -to-one, since many sensors can be connected to a particular node. But a particular
    sensor can only be connected to one particular node. Also, since sensors are placed
    in zones in the field. The sensor entity is related to the zone entity by a many-to-one
    relationship since multiple sensors are placed in a zone, while a particular sensor
    can only be in one zone. Fig. 4. Data model for the smart irrigation system. Show
    All Node entity. A node entity corresponds to a physical wireless node in the
    Wireless Sensor Network in the field. Each node has the attributes: name and id.
    These attributes should match labels on the nodes in the field. The node entity
    is useful to allow the system communicate with actuator, or detect failure. Zone
    entity. The cultivation farm is divided into zones. The system treats each zone
    as it has uniform characteristics such as topography, soil texture, soil salinity,
    etc. Each zone has the attributes: name and id. The zone entity is related to
    the sensor entity by one-to-many relationship. Since a particular zone can have
    many sensors, but a sensor can be in a particular zone. Also, the zone entity
    is related to the cultivation entity by many-to-many relationship. Soil entity.
    The soil entity contains information about the characteristics of the soil and
    its specifications such as water holding capacity and salinity. The attributes
    of soil entity are: id, name, texture, and salinity. Other attributes regarding
    soil characteristics can be added. Soil entity is related to zone entity by a
    many-to-one relationship since each zone has one particular type of soil, but
    several zones can have same soil types. Irrigation thresholds. This entity holds
    values of the upper and lower moisture level thresholds for a particular plant
    and soil type. In this paper, agricultural expert provides these values through
    a web interface. This entity has the attributes: id, plant age, minimum moisture
    level, and maximum moisture level. Other thresholds can be included as well such
    as minimum temperature, maximum temperature, etc. This entity is related to plant
    entity by many-to-many relationship and to the soil entity by many-to-many. Plant
    entity. The plant entity holds information about different kinds of plants. This
    entity is related to the irrigation threshold entity and the cultivation entity.
    The attributes of this entity are: id, name, and type. SECTION V. Results Several
    software technologies can be used to implement the system. Our choice was the
    Java environment and the state of the-art-oracle technologies. We chose this environment
    mainly because of our familiarity. We used Oracle SQL developer [40], Oracle Database
    Expression Edition [41], and Oracle database XE for the database development and
    management. For web server, we used Oracle Web Logic Server [42]. To implement
    our application which includes the web services interface, accessing the database,
    the web forms, and login pages we used the IDE Jdeveloper [43]. In this paper
    we used Jersy RESTful web service framework to develop RESTFul web service in
    java that provides support for JAX-RS API. For developing the graphical user interfaces,
    we used the Model, View, and Controller (MVC) architecture. Fig. 5 shows the home
    page of the system which appears after the login of administrator user. Adding
    or modifying sensors and nodes can be accomplished through the administrator interface.
    The connectivity of each sensor to which node, and the placement of each sensor
    in which zone, can be set using this interface as well. As an illustration example,
    by clicking on the sensors icon, a list of sensors readings that is stored by
    the web service in the database will be displayed as shown in Fig. 6. This table
    shows the zone, node, sensors, sensors-readings, readings-time, and description.
    Fig. 5. Home page of the administrator. Show All In the farmer form, the farmer
    decides what he wants to plant using the add cultivation icon where the farmer
    can select from a list of plant kinds. Also, he decides in which zone he wanted
    to plant and the date of planting. The agriculture expert form allows the expert
    to add plant by clicking on add plant icon, and to add soil types using the add
    soil icon. Also, he can set the irrigation and other threshold values such as
    temperature as a function of the age of the plants and the plant type. The system
    provides a dashboard that allows monitoring the execution of the system. Fig.
    6. Sensors readings. Show All To evaluate the system we used a simulated data
    of the moisture level in a simulated farm of 4 zones. In this simulation we set
    the moisture level to drop linearly with time. Fig. 7 shows the dynamic of the
    simulated moisture level in a particular zone. Fig. 7. Simulated moisture values
    as a function of time for a particular zone. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In
    this paper we provided the design and implementation of cloud-based application
    that manages the data coming from the sensors in a Wireless Sensor Network located
    in the field, and information supplied by agricultural experts in order to create
    smart farming and water management system. The system provides communication interfaces
    to trigger irrigation schedule in the field. This application enables building
    a decision-support system that allow inexperienced farmer to practice productive
    farming in a semi-automated manner. We are currently integrating this system with
    a wireless sensor network that we have developed. Several issues are being addressed
    in this implementation which includes system security and a more sophisticated
    decision support system that considers a weighted average of the sensors'' readings.

    India Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the last few years, IoT has gained
    much attention and is affecting every aspect of life. IoT is changing the way
    information is collected and being transmitted. IoT network is built with smart
    devices having processing, and communication capabilities. Embedded systems, cloud
    computing, sensors, wireless communication technologies, and web-enabled application
    are some of the backend technologies that are integrating smartness with the devices
    and making IoT implementation possible. Deployment of IoT has a great social,
    economic, and environmental impact. IoT has been deployed in many applications
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart homes, industrial control, and agriculture.
    Wireless communication technologies play an important role in a role providing
    the communication method between the IoT sensor nodes and also with cloud services.
    Some of the wireless communication technologies successfully deployed in IoT are
    ZigBee, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, BLE, LTE, 6LoPWAN, Sigfox, and LoRa. Every technology
    has its advantages and disadvantages, in this article communication range and
    power efficiency of various technologies are reviewed. [1], [2] Precision Agriculture
    is yet another area emerging and gaining importance as an application of IoT due
    to the projected world population and impact of inefficient agricultural practices
    on the environment. Precision Agriculture requires monitoring of soil and weather
    conditions for better decision making. IoT adopted for Precision Agriculture uses
    wireless communication technologies for the collection of the agricultural parameters.
    The most common wireless communication technologies used in agriculture are ZigBee,
    Bluetooth, SigFox, WiFi, and LoRa [3]. In the present article popular and important
    wireless communication technologies are reviewed for their technical specification
    mainly communication range and power efficiency. The technical specifications
    of every technology have a great impact on the utilization of specific communication
    technology in IoT applications. The communication range decides how far the wireless
    node can be placed for monitoring and control, power efficiency decides the operation
    period i.e. lifespan of the wireless node. In the last, the article concluded
    with the suggestion for the suitable technologies for Precision Agriculture based
    on communication range and power efficiency. For open field monitoring and control
    applications LoRa is a good choice offering a long communication range with power
    efficiency, ZigBee is suitable for indoor or Greenhouse monitoring with short-range
    and good power efficiency. SECTION II. IOT and Wireless Communication Technologies
    IoT provides the system with the capability of monitoring and control. IoT idea
    was initiated in 1999 and was to make devices intelligent through the installation
    of sensors, processing units and giving them communication capabilities. The number
    of connected devices by IoT has been forecasted as 2000 billion by 2050. In IoT
    communication is the most important aspect and IoT mainly deploys wireless commutation
    methods for data transmission. Many wireless communication technologies are available
    for IoT with associated advantages and disadvantages. Some of the wireless communication
    technologies are Bluetooth, BLE, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, WiMax, etc. For short-range Bluetooth,
    BLE and ZigBee are used whereas LoRa and WiFi are the technologies for long-distance
    communication [1]. IoT has a wide range of applications including social gaming,
    industry, healthcare, logistics. These applications comprise smart devices that
    transmit/receive data and make the decision to help humans. For such IoT-based
    applications ICT is used for the transmission of information from human to human,
    human to machine, and machine to machine. Wireless communication technologies
    for IoT are divided or categorized into LPWAN and Short Range Network. Different
    wireless communication technologies falling under the LPWAN and Short Range Network
    are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1 IoT wireless communication technologies Show
    All SigFox is a low-power technology capable of transmitting data up to 50 Km
    and suitable for only low data rates. Cellular is suitable for applications where
    a high data rate is desired. ZigBee supports different network topologies like
    mesh, star, tree and has longer battery life. BLE is characterized as low power
    technology and with low setup time. RFID uses preprogrammed RFID tags, which can
    be an active tag or passive tag. RFID cannot be used for direct measurement and
    diagnosis due to its preprogrammed nature. NFC uses technology almost similar
    to RFID [2]. IoT is the communication of the future by transforming real-world
    devices/objects into smart devices. IoT aims to unite every object in the work
    in such a way that humans can control them via the internet. IoT depicts the trisectional
    relationship between things, humans, and the internet as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2 Trisectional relationship of IoT Show All It has been projected that by 2025
    about 75 billion devices will be connected over the internet and IoT will be a
    market of over $300 billion. IoT mainly communicates information via wireless
    communication technologies such as F As per records these are the people who have
    filled the form but not vaccinated to date; get it filled as otherwise they may
    not be allowed to join on campus duties RFID, LR-WPANs, Zways, LTE, LoRa, NFC,
    UWB, M2M, 6LoWPAN. Technical specifications for some of the wireless communication
    technologies are provided in table 1. Table 1 Technical Specifications of Wireless
    Communication Technologies [1] [3] [4] RFID consists of a reader and tags. Each
    tag is associated with a specific address. RFID is used for real-time monitoring
    without the requirement of line-of-sight communication with humans. IEEE802.15.4
    is the standard for LR-WPAN with the working model at 915 MHz. Z-waves are the
    communication protocol for home automation networks with low power consumption.
    Distance between 2 communicating nodes in Z-wave cannot be greater than 30 meters.
    LTE is the high-speed data transfer communication protocol with low latency and
    higher data throughput. NFC is a technology very much similar to RFID and is being
    recognized as RFID integrated into the mobile phone. NFC is a short-range, low-power
    communication technology capable of transferring a small amount of information
    between two devices. UWB is also a short-range communication technology similar
    to NFC but supports bandwidth up to 500Mhz against 13.56 MHz for NFC. LoRa is
    the communication technology used for long-range connectivity in rural areas and
    industries [3]. By 2024 IoT industry is expected to rise by a 4.3 trillion-dollar
    market with applications such as smart cities, smart homes, military, healthcare,
    farming, and many more. IoT architecture comprises four layers namely the actuation
    layer, communication layer, IoT management layer, and application layer. The communication
    layer connects the various layers in IoT architecture and transmits the sensor
    data. Based on communication range and bandwidth requirement, figure 3 shows the
    categorization of wireless communication technologies. Figure 3 IoT wireless communication
    technologies range vs bandwidth Show All The classification of different IoT wireless
    communication technologies is provided in figure 4. NFC and RFID are the technologies
    for the ultra-low range. The main difference between RFID and NFC is of the operating
    frequency range, NFC operates in medium and RFID operated in the highfrequency
    range. NFC data rate varies from 106 to 424 Kbits/s and communication range is
    from 100cm to1m while RFID communication range is 10m to 200mnwith data rate from
    40 Kbits/s to 640 Kbits/s. Bluetooth works at 2.4Ghz and is classified into 4
    classes based on communication distance. BLE or Bluetooth 4.0 has increased range
    and optimized power usage. Bluetooth 5 is also better in power utilization with
    linger battery lifetime higher data rate and speed. ZigBee and Z-wave are some
    of the other wireless communication technologies in the short-range. LoRa, NbIoT,
    and SigFox are wireless technologies for long-distance communication. LoRa and
    SigFox use unlicensed frequency and while NB-IoT operated on a licensed frequency
    band. SigFox has a data rate up to 100bps while LoRa data rate varies from 300bps
    to 37.5Kbps. Both works in the sub-1GHz spectrum. LoRa offers a communication
    range of up to 2 Km while on th3e other hand up to 15 Km while SigFox has a communication
    range up to 30Km [4]. Figure 4 IoT wireless communication technologies Classification
    based on communication range Show All In IoT, energy-efficient and reliable communication
    is an important aspect. LoRa consumes about 1-10mA of current whereas the current
    rating of WiFi is 100-350mA, Bluetooth rating is 1-35mA and that of ZigBee is
    1-10mA. LoRa offers a communication range of up to 2Km while on the other hand,
    different wireless communication technologies offer a range of about from 1-100m
    only. LoRa also offers the data security of 128 bits [5]. SECTION III. Wireless
    Communication Technologies and Precision Agriculture The world population is expected
    to grow by 9.2 billion by 2050. Which may result in food shortage. Precision Agriculture
    is the technological solution to eh sought problem of food shortage along with
    water scarcity and deterioration of soil properties. In article [6], three WSN
    narrowband IoT wireless communication technologies, NB-IoT, LoRa, and ZigBee are
    analyzed for their power consumption and communication range for applications
    in Precision Agriculture. If the range is not a constrain, ZigBee is the most
    suitable technology for agriculture applications. ZigBee falls in short-distance
    communication technology and offers the best power efficiency. But if the communication
    distance is an important factor then NB-IoT and LoRa are suitable options for
    agricultural applications. They offer a coverage range of up to 15Km. But the
    disadvantage with NB-IoT is that it comes up with a monthly subscription cost
    while LoRa works on an unlicensed frequency band. Both offer good power efficiency
    [6]. Due to the social and environmental implications, smart farming is the need
    of the modern world. Under such a situation IoT offers novel solutions and smart
    applications in the agriculture field. The data collection and its management
    through the underlying communications technologies and protocols, mainly application
    layer protocols of IoT architecture are an important aspect of IoT. Various application
    layer protocols in IoT architecture are summarized in figure 5. In terms of power
    consumption CoAP is the best followed by MQTT. The sequence of IoT application-layer
    communication protocols in decreasing power consumption is HTTP, AMQP, MQTT, and
    CoAP. When the latency is compared, irrespective of QoS (Quality of Service),
    CoAP showed less latency than MQTT. Latency of MQTT shows variance with change
    is QoS factor. As for the deployment of protocols in smart farming is considered,
    MQTT and REST protocols are used for simple and small applications such as soil
    water content measurement, controlling of water pump and measurement of atmospheric
    pressure, relative humidity, etc. For smart farming prototypes employed in medium
    and large applications MQTT, CoAP, REST, and sometimes MQTT and CoAP combinedly
    are used [7]. Applications of IoT in Precision Agriculture are elaborated in the
    article [8]. The major applications areas of IoT in agriculture are identified
    as monitoring, control, and tracking. About 70% of the study of IoT in agriculture
    is focused on, monitoring, 25% on control, and only 5% of the total work on Precision
    Agriculture are focused on tracking. Major agricultural applications or activities
    being supported by IoT are monitoring of temperature, humidity, fertilization,
    disease development, animals, water, irrigation, and monitoring of air conditions.
    In the article, the major IoT wireless communication technologies presented for
    Precision Agriculture are RFID, ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth LoRa [8]. WSN employed
    in agriculture fields can provide a large amount of information to farmers. WSN
    nodes are generally battery-operated and incorporate sensors and RF modules. Figure
    5 IoT Application layer communication protocols Show All Few of the IoT wireless
    communication technologies deployed in agriculture are provided in figure 6. ZigBee
    is considered the best protocol for agricultural applications. Many applications
    are developed using ZigBee such as irrigation supervision, water quality management,
    cattle localization systems, WSN-based Greenhouse, etc. ZigBeebased sensor nodes
    can communicate up to a distance of 100m. ZigBee offers good power efficiency
    when made to switch between active and sleep modes. Bluetooth is preferred for
    portable devices with a communication distance of up to 10m. Various agricultural
    applications deploying Bluetooth are weather monitoring, soil moisture monitoring,
    temperature monitoring, and irrigation monitoring. The main advantages of using
    Bluetooth are low power, availability, and ease of use by countrymen. LoRa with
    specifications as low power consumption and long-distance communication range
    is also deployed in many agriculture applications such as smart irrigation, green
    area monitoring, fertilization improvement, and many more. If power efficiency
    is looked at ZigBee, SigFox, and LoRa are the best-suited technology providing
    the best power efficiency and thereafter next comes Classic Bluetooth, WiFi and
    WiFi come under the category of high-power consumption technologies. As for communication
    range, LoRa offers a communication range up to 5Km, Sigfox up to 15Km, BLE up
    to 10m, and ZigBee, classic Bluetooth offers a communication range from 10100m.
    LoRa and SigFox are the best contenders if the cost of deployment for agricultural
    applications is considered, thereafter comes the WiFi, BLE, Bluetooth, and ZigBee
    [9]. In IoT-based smart irrigation systems, air monitoring, humidity, rain wind
    soil moisture, soil temperature, and weather forecast are important monitored
    parameters. In smart irrigation systems, the wireless communication technologies
    deployed are GSM, WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, 4G, 6LoWPAN. Among all the available
    wireless communication technologies, most of the literature is published using
    WiFi for smart irrigation followed by GSM, ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, and 6LoWPAN.
    LoRa is not much exploited and is left with many opportunities in Precision Agriculture
    [10]. In article [11], the performance of WSN networks under varied vegetation
    conditions for irrigation systems is tested. The proposed system was developed
    using an ESP32 WiFi node. On the basis of coverage range and acceptable quality,
    the best results were obtained when sensor nodes are installed near the ground.
    Figure 6 Communication technologies for agriculture Show All The sensors are required
    in agriculture for collecting weather, crop, and soil information for distributed
    land for monitoring, fertilization and water requirement, and different crop requirements
    based on weather and soil conditions. Various agricultural operations/activities
    where WSN has to be used are fertilization, greenhouse monitoring and control,
    irrigation, pest control, animal and pasture monitoring, Horticulture, and Viticulture.
    The article has focused on the use of ZigBee, Bluetooth, and WiFi in Precision
    Agriculture [12]. IoT requires technologies capable of providing cost low cost,
    power-efficient, and simple solutions for end devices with wireless communication
    over a long distance. LPWAN technologies such as SigFox, NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN are
    some of the technologies that qualify the IoT requirements for end devices. LoRa
    is being deployed successfully in many applications such as wellbeing monitoring,
    traffic monitoring, smart city applications, and agriculture monitoring. LoRa
    not only offers the possibility of creating a private network but also integrates
    itself with other IoT platforms [13]. LoRa is low power and long-range wireless
    communication technology for IoT applications. Lora offers much better scalability
    than the pure Aloha protocol. For 1000 devices per gateway, LoRa losses 32% of
    the transmitted packets while Aloha 90% of the packet loss is observed [14]. LoRa
    is operated on a battery and its battery can last up to 5 years. LoRa is being
    deployed in many applications such as healthcare, industrial control, home automation,
    smart cities, environmental monitoring, smart chain and logistics, and irrigation
    monitoring and control. The proposed pump control system for irrigation uses LoRa
    as transmitting and receiver in the control unit. The control and monitoring are
    done through a mobile application developed using MIT app inventor [15]. LoRa
    is different from other suitable wireless protocols for IoT like ZigBee, NRF,
    or Bluetooth in terms of throughput, communication range, and network topology.
    The system proposed for irrigation in agriculture uses LoRa as collector and executor.
    The collector LoRa node was equipped with different sensors to collect and transmit
    the agricultural data. Executor LoRa nodes control the actuators for the irrigation
    of fields [16]. SECTION IV. Conclusion IoT with wireless communication technologies
    is providing a suitable solution to agriculture. IoT makes the system smarter
    and provides the capability of monitoring and control in different application
    areas such as healthcare, industry, and Precision Agriculture. Various IoT wireless
    communication technologies deployed in agriculture are ZigBee, Bluetooth, WiFi,
    RFID, GSM, 4G, SigFox, and LoRa. ZigBee is suitable for short-distance communication
    and offers good power efficiency and scalability but is not suitable for long-distance
    communication range. If a long communication range along with power efficiency
    and acceptable data rate is required, then LoRa is the suitable choice for monitoring
    and control of agriculture parameters. Sigfox also offers good power efficiency
    and a long communication range but is limited in data rate. IoT with wireless
    communication technologies collect the information and provides it to farmers
    related to weather, atmosphere, and soil conditions. The collected information
    helps the farmers to plan agricultural activities efficiently. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Full Text Preview Introduction The global burden imposed by pests is manifold.
    Invading plant pests and pathogens present a constantly increasing risk for agriculture
    brought on by current environmental shifts (Savary et al., 2019; Spence et al.,
    2020). Furthermore, disease carrying pest species, i.e. vectors, represent one
    of the biggest global health issues today, as well as historically, and are only
    exasperated by the introduction of invasive vector species to new areas through
    different mechanisms of climate change (Campbell-Lendrum et al., 2015). Vector
    borne disease (VBD) include diseases such as zika, dengue, malaria, yellow fever,
    chikungunya, leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis (National Academies of Sciences
    & Medicine, 2016). These VBDs have accounted for more human death through the
    last two centuries than all other causes combined (Gubler, 1998; National Academies
    of Sciences & Medicine, 2016). Over 500 million people are infected by Vector
    Borne Disease (VBD) every year. WHO estimates that, annually, over 3 billion people
    are at risk of contracting a VBD, of which a large proportion is diseases transmitted
    by mosquito vectors. More than 2.5 billion people are at risk of contracting Dengue
    alone, and Malaria causes over 500,000 deaths every year. The implementation of
    pest-control strategies in the mid-20th century to reduce mosquitoes populations
    succeeded in the localized reduction of these VBDs (National Academies of Sciences
    & Medicine, 2016). Due to the ethical implication and environmental damage caused
    by most of the firs-used techniques, a shift in pest control towards more environmentally
    sound practices is soon observed. This movement and the collection of practices
    it entails is labelled as Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Ever since the inception
    of integrated management in 1959 by Stern et al. (Stern et al., 1959), Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) has undergone quite a change and evolved into a large concept
    covering different fields (Peterson et al., 2018). This evolution also brought
    in several ethical concerns regarding the direction the concept was going. In
    his Integrated Control Concept, Stern (Stern et al., 1959) speaks about using
    chemical and biological control to supplement each other and not look at them
    as alternatives. Although this core concept hasn’t changed, the implementation
    and technologies have changed quite a bit. Resistance against pesticides was one
    of the main driving factors behind the conceptualization of integrated management
    which is still a driving factor today. There are limitations to IPM both in the
    practical and the ethical sense (Peterson et al., 2018). When it comes to medical
    pest, completely killing the pest is usually still the preferred way when it comes
    to public opinion and tolerance. There are several constraints to developing tolerant
    crops and other hosts. These include identifying tolerance, characterizing tolerance
    mechanisms, and understanding the genetics underlying tolerance (Delaney & Macedo,
    2000; Velusamy & Heinrichs, 1986). Tolerance can be interpreted both as a type
    of resistance or as the factor for economic injury levels (Pedigo & Rice, 2014;
    Peterson et al., 2018). The topics of sampling and economic thresholds are closely
    allied to the focus on management, host stress, and the proper use of tactics
    (Kogan, 1988, 1998). Wireless Sensor Network technology is already widely used
    in a plethora of scientific and commercial applications, and this number will
    only increase with the expected rise of the IoT market. An emerging field for
    environmental WSN systems is autonomous vector surveillance. Sensor technology
    can be used to shoulder ecologically friendly practices within the Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) approach. Proper surveillance and subsequent modelling of
    the impact that pest and disease have on human health and crop agriculture is
    a pressing issue in numerous segments. In-situ, environmental WSN data support
    these practices by defining areas and periods of increased risk for the pest as
    well as providing valuable input to pest distribution and pest population dynamics
    models. IoT networks can be combined with earth observation (EO) data and expert
    knowledge to generate information regarding the pest activity levels, current
    environmental suitability, risk and expected dynamics. Continue Reading References

  description: The Internet of Things has a high impact on upgrade and transformation
    of the traditional greenhouse agricultural techniques. It is necessary to control
    the environmental factors for obtaining the optimum growth conditions for the
    crop and extend the production season to get the optimum yield. These aspects
    are fundamental for Agriculture 4.0, that uses technology not simply for the sake
    of innovation but to improve and address the real needs of consumers. In this
    paper, a prototype of a low-cost electronic platform for real time greenhouse
    environment monitoring has been designed, developed and built. The prototype has
    been developed with the purpose of firmware and software prototyping, in order
    to make the most of device performances. The electronic board is composed by a
    Main Board, a Green House Core, a Wi-Fi Module, a RS485 Module, an Analog-to-Digital
    Converter Module and a USB Module. The system permits to collect data by external
    sensors, elaborate and send them to external devices as laptop, smartphone and
    internet gateway, using both wired and wireless connection. These data concern
    to main greenhouse environmental parameters, such as air temperature, humidity,
    solar radiation, air velocity and CO2 concentration. A Web application has been
    implemented to allow users a consultation of greenhouse environmental state in
    a simple and fast way.

    of Things has a high impact on upgrade and transformation of the traditional greenhouse
    agricultural techniques. It is necessary to control the environmental factors
    for obtaining the optimum growth conditions for the crop and extend the production
    season to get the optimum yield. These aspects are fundamental for Agriculture
    4.0, that uses technology not simply for the sake of innovation but to improve
    and address the real needs of consumers. In this paper, a prototype of a low-cost
    electronic platform for real time greenhouse environment monitoring has been designed,
    developed and built. The prototype has been developed with the purpose of firmware
    and software prototyping, in order to make the most of device performances. The
    electronic board is composed by a Main Board, a Green House Core, a Wi-Fi Module,
    a RS485 Module, an Analog-to-Digital Converter Module and a USB Module. The system
    permits to collect data by external sensors, elaborate and send them to external
    devices as laptop, smartphone and internet gateway, using both wired and wireless
    connection. These data concern to main greenhouse environmental parameters, such
    as air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, air velocity and CO2 concentration.
    A Web application has been implemented to allow users a consultation of greenhouse
    environmental state in a simple and fast way. Keywords: internet of things; greenhouse
    environment; printed circuit board 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT)
    represents a set of technologies which refer to the interconnection and data exchange
    between sensors and electronic devices. The IoT has a high impact on several aspects
    of every-day life and behavior of potential users. From the point of view of a
    private user, the most important effects of the IoT will be visible in both working
    and domestic fields, with assisted living, smart homes and offices, e-health and
    enhanced learning [1]. Similarly, from the perspective of business users, the
    most apparent consequences will be equally visible in automation and industrial
    manufacturing, logistics, business process management and intelligent transportation
    of people [1]. As regards the primary sector, thanks to these recent research
    progresses, it was found that the old farming methods are unable to meet the needs
    of social development [2]. Consequently, an upgrade and transformation of the
    traditional agricultural techniques has been necessary. Agriculture 4.0 represents
    the coming agricultural revolution, which aims to improve and address the real
    needs of consumers and reengineer the value chain, using technological research
    [3]. Thanks to this, modern farms and agricultural operations will work in a different
    way, primarily because of improvement in technology such as devices, sensors,
    machines and other sophisticated technologies, such as robots, which will let
    business be more profitable, efficient, safer and environmentally friendly. Agriculture
    4.0 will no longer have to depend on applying water, fertilizers and pesticides
    across entire fields. On the contrary, farmers will use the minimum quantities
    or even completely remove them from the supply chain, thanks to the analysis of
    information collected by the use of technology [3]. The greenhouse agriculture
    has become a major trend in the development of high-tech agriculture in the Agriculture
    4.0 point of view. In particular, it needs to control the environmental factors
    for obtaining the optimum growth conditions for the crop and extend the production
    season to get the optimum yield [2]. Artificial management, for detecting and
    controlling environment factors (i.e., air temperature, humidity, solar radiation,
    air velocity and CO2 concentration), wastes lots of manpower and relatively large
    of monitoring error, which affect the growth of crops. Measurements of meteorological
    parameters are important for adjusting the environmental conditions and a computerized
    system is necessary for controlling greenhouse environment efficiently. In the
    modern greenhouses, several measurement points are required to trace down the
    local climate parameters in different parts of the big greenhouse to make the
    greenhouse automation system work properly. Cabling would make the measurement
    system expensive and vulnerable. Moreover, the cabled measurement points are difficult
    to relocate once they are installed. Thus, a wireless sensor network (WSN) consisting
    of small-size wireless sensor nodes is an attractive and cost-efficient solution
    to build the required measurement system. For providing suitable environment for
    the growth of crops, many systems were studied and developed by researchers worldwide.
    An embedded systems approach to monitor and control greenhouse systems has become
    quite important nowadays. Considering this approach, Rangan et al. proposed a
    system to measure the main greenhouse environmental parameters, and to send measured,
    processed, controlled and updated data to owner through Short Message Service
    (SMS) communication technology [4]. Candido et al. described the development of
    an embedded real time system, based on hierarchical state machines extended with
    timing constraints, devoted to microclimate control in a complex greenhouse. This
    system is directed by parameters entered at configuration time through a user-friendly
    graphical interface, which depends on the use of Java technologies and on a specific
    methodology suited to the development of real time systems [5]. Another system
    was developed such as a multi-platform application based on Android technology
    and using a wireless mesh network to monitor and control intensive agriculture
    [6]. In order to overcome the possible disadvantages of wired and wireless constraints,
    such as complicated wiring, difficult maintenance and distance, to monitor and
    control the applications, Kumar implemented a system based on embedded systems
    where the threshold levels of the sensors are set manually with the help of push
    button keys or remotely via Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) communication
    mode [7]. Yuquan et al. proposed a master-slave distributed measurement and control
    system composed by personal computer, soil moisture measurement, temperature,
    humidity and CO2 monitoring and control module, in which personal computer is
    taken as the host [8]. Ahonen et al. developed a wireless sensor node for greenhouse
    monitoring by integrating a sensor platform with three commercial sensors capable
    to measure four climate variables, with the goal to collect data to evaluate the
    network reliability and its ability to detect the microclimate layers, which typically
    exist in the greenhouse between lower and upper flora [9]. Pahuja et al. developed,
    using a WSN, an online microclimate monitoring and control system for greenhouses
    [10]. Somov et al. presented an IoT system in a tomato greenhouse in Russia, based
    on WSN, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. This system helps in monitoring
    and controlling of both plants and greenhouse conditions as well as predicting
    the growth rate of tomatoes [11]. The study of the state of the art showed that
    in many WSNs the ZigBee technology that works on IEEE standard 802.15.4 is used.
    This technology, with its low cost, low power and long communication distance,
    is an efficient wireless communication device widely used in home-network. Qiu
    et al. designed an intelligent greenhouse environment monitoring system based
    on ZigBee and embedded technology, adopting the idea of intelligent home, achieving
    intelligent control for the greenhouse fans, lights and irrigation equipment [2].
    Dan et al. reported the design and implementation of an agriculture greenhouse
    environment monitoring system based on ZigBee technology, which was made up of
    front-end data acquisition, data processing, data transmission and data reception.
    In synthesis, processed data was send to the intermediate node through a wireless
    network, which aggregates all data and sends them to the computer through a serial
    port. In this way, there was the possibility to view, analyze and storage the
    data by the computer, in real time mode [12]. Chen et al. proposed a system for
    greenhouse environmental monitoring based on WSN that works within the China-specific
    780 MHz frequency band and fully complies with the IEEE802.15.4c standard (extension
    of ZigBee technology) [13]. Li et al. presented a low-cost system for easy temperature
    control and modulation in this type of environment, with simple structure, convenient
    installation and using [14]. Tsai et al. designed and reported a simple ZigBee-based
    sensor network for the campus greenhouse monitoring with mobile device. The system
    consists of three modules, a mesh structure network, data processing center, and
    mobile application program [15]. In addition to the devices and the systems already
    described, there are other systems that used also commercial electronic platforms.
    As an example, Geng et al. developed a system, based on embedded system approach
    and using wireless sensors, which combines the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino chip,
    which was integrated into a mobile system for shorting the physical distance between
    the on-site data collection and the data processing backend, in order to improve
    the data transmission reliability [16]. Vimal et al. developed a simple, low cost,
    Arduino based system to monitor the values of environmental parameters and that
    are continuously updated and controlled in order to achieve optimum plant growth
    and yield [17]. Other important aspects could be measured in a greenhouse environment
    using electronic system based on embedded systems technology. As an example, the
    collection of accurate information concerning the spatial variability within fields
    are necessary for precision farming of so-called specialty crops. This variability
    is affected by a variety of factors, which can be measured using various types
    of sensing technologies. Lee et al. presented a review of these technologies and
    discussed how they are used for precision agriculture and crop management, especially
    for specialty crops [18]. Another interesting aspect regards dew condensation
    on the leaf surface of greenhouse crops, that can promote diseases caused by fungus
    and bacteria, affecting the growth of the crops, Park et al. presented a WSN-based
    automatic monitoring system to prevent dew condensation in a greenhouse environment
    [19]. In this paper, a prototype of a low-cost electronic platform for greenhouse
    environment monitoring has been designed, developed and built. The system is an
    Agriculture 4.0 perspective that has the aim to permit elaboration and sending
    data, collected by external sensors, to external devices as laptop, smartphone
    and internet gateway, and on-line databases. The prototype has been developed
    with the purpose of firmware and software prototyping, in order to make the most
    of device performances. Since from the state of the art there are available non-flexible
    works that respect their project requirements only for specific scenario [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19],
    we have chosen a flexible modular approach, for the design of our prototype, in
    order to test the best solution case by case basis. The electronic board is composed
    by a Green House Core, a Wi-Fi Module, a RS485 Module, an Analog-to-Digital Converter
    Module and a USB Module, all hosted on a Main Board. The hardware has been developed
    in modular way with the goal to test several combinations with optimized dedicated
    firmware and software, based on the scenario where the device may be involved.
    For example, in certain applications there might be the necessity to have only
    Ethernet interface for connection with external devices, and the requirement to
    work with only digital sensors (RS485 module). Consequently, thanks to our modular
    prototype, it is possible to develop the best firmware and software solution considering
    only the modules involved in this particular scenario (GHC module and RS485 module),
    and to develop, at a later time, a compact board that includes only these chips.
    The same reasoning can be made for other modules based on application needs. Accordingly,
    starting from our electronic prototype that guarantees maximum flexibility in
    terms of applicable scenarios, it is possible to develop an integrated, compact
    and robust board that includes only desired modules. We have chosen each component
    of our electronic platform in order to respect requirements considering low-cost
    solution. Since the electronic board is developed with the purpose of firmware
    and software prototyping, we have decided to implement a device with wired and
    wireless network interfaces. In particular, the installation of Ethernet and Wi-Fi
    module on the board permits to develop and study the best solution of firmware
    and software for wired and wireless connections, making the prototype useful for
    several scenarios. The collected data concern to main greenhouse environmental
    parameters, such as air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, air velocity and
    CO2 concentration. Thanks to the connectivity features of our board, these datasets
    are immediately available, for example, to the other IoT devices that could work
    in the greenhouse. In this way, the agricultural production process of the greenhouse
    could be executed by automation system that increases productivity by reducing
    the need for human workforce, guaranteeing a smart management of the greenhouse.
    On the other hand, we have implemented a Web application in order to allow also
    users a consultation of greenhouse environmental state, through a user-friendly
    graphical interface, in a simple and fast way. 2. Sensors Selection in Respect
    of Measurement Accuracy of Physical Parameters We have developed our prototype
    with the aim to use it in a traditional naturally ventilated single-sloped greenhouse,
    considering the environmental conditions data collected by Hua et. al [20] in
    a measurement campaign in order to validate their deterministic and stochastic
    model for estimation of greenhouse microclimate. In particular, in this kind of
    greenhouse there is a daily variation temperature in the range between 10 °C to
    40 °C and a daily relative humidity (RH) from 10% to about 90%. As a matter of
    facts, our electronic platform has been designed to guarantee best performances
    in these environmental conditions. The board permits to collect a set of measurements
    of the main greenhouse environment parameters, with an accuracy reported in Table
    1, according to data collected by Hua et. al. On the basis of these specifications,
    for each physical parameter can be chosen a sensor for performing measurements,
    from the analysis of the state of art. Table 1. Measurement accuracy for each
    physical parameter. The choice of the air temperature sensor should be dictate
    by the necessity to have an overtime reliability maintaining a measurement accuracy
    of 0.1 °C. In the state of art, there are several air temperature sensors based
    on thermistor, such as resistance temperature detector (RTD), thermistor negative
    temperature coefficient (NTC) and thermistor positive temperature coefficient
    (PTC). Thermistors are generally produced using powdered metal oxides (i.e., platinum
    or nickel and copper). Regarding platinum thermistors, they are preferable thanks
    to the platinum high stability at high temperature range of greenhouse environment.
    In commerce there are two main components: Pt100 and Pt1000. The second one is
    characterized by a greater accuracy and it could be chosen for this application.
    Humidity sensors can be found in a variety of applications with unique requirements
    [21]. Their wide range use has resulted in numerous sensor designs that typically
    incorporate capacitive, resistive, gravimetric, or optical techniques [22]. In
    particular, this type of sensors is classified as capacitive and resistive, from
    the electrical point of view. The firsts one are designed for measuring the RH
    and their behavior is characterized by measuring electrical permittivity variation
    of a dielectric material at the humidity variation. A capacitive humidity sensor
    is made up a capacitor where in its plates a dielectric material with a dielectric
    constant value, which varies with the humidity, is inserted. Whereas, the resistive
    humidity sensors are characterized by the principle that the conductivity in a
    non-metallic conductor material depends on the humidity (or, in other words, depends
    on water content of the material). The conventional sensing materials for resistive-type
    humidity sensors are mainly oxide ceramics and polymers [23]. For this application,
    a unique device, which integrates a capacitive humidity sensor and a Pt100 temperature
    sensor, could be selected from the analysis of commercial components (its features
    are reported in [24]). The principal desired features of a solar radiation sensor
    are fast time response (typically less than 1 s) and wide wavelength spectrum
    (between 0.3 μm and 0.5 μm) [25]. The sensor which could be selected for this
    application is a thermopile solar radiation sensor. This kind of devices uses
    a set of thermocouples for measuring the temperature difference between two different
    surfaces of the system. In this way, the sensor can perform linear measurements
    that respect project specifications. Many models are available in commerce, and
    one that respects specification of Table 1 is described in [26]. One of the most
    performant sensors for measuring air velocity is the 3D ultrasonic anemometer,
    which measures the U-V-W Cartesian components of the wind speed, the wind direction
    and the sonic temperature [27]. A typical system is composed by five analog output
    channels with different voltages and currents. For the magnetic North orientation,
    the sensor could be equipped with a compass features magneto resistive sensor.
    Further details of one system present on the market are reported in [28]. As concern
    CO2 concentration sensors, one of the commercial devices that respects the measurement
    accuracy of Table 1, is described in [29]. It is a nondispersive infrared sensor
    (NDIR sensor), which consists of a simple spectroscopic sensor, nondispersive
    in the sense of optical dispersion since the infrared energy is allowed to pass
    through the atmospheric sampling chamber without deformation [30]. 3. Methods:
    Design and Development of the Electronic Board The electronic board prototype,
    useful for monitoring greenhouse environment, has been designed and developed
    using Autodesk EAGLE software. Autodesk EAGLE is an electronic design automation
    (EDA) software, which allows to enabling printed circuit board (PCB) designers
    to seamlessly connect schematic diagrams, component placement, PCB routing, and
    comprehensive library content [31]. The electronic board has the goal to acquire
    analog and digital data collected by external sensors, and sending them to electronic
    devices such as internet gateway and databases, laptop and smartphone. In particular,
    the board permits communication based on Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Universal Serial Bus
    (USB) interface, RS485, Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Universal Asynchronous
    Receiver-Transmitter (UART) and Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C). The system has
    been developed with the purpose of firmware and software prototyping. Considering
    this aspect, we have decided to implement a device with both Ethernet and Wi-Fi
    network interfaces. In this way, it is possible to develop and study the best
    solution of firmware and software for wired and wireless connections, according
    to user needs. On the other hand, thanks to both wired and wireless connections,
    the device has the possibility to work in several scenarios. As an example, the
    board could be connected to a wired network (with RS485 Ethernet connector) and
    it might provide a Wi-Fi connection to the sensors, working in hotspot mode; it
    could be connected directly to an available wireless network and it could generate
    a wired connection, working as a Wi-Fi-to-Ethernet adapter, maintaining a high
    versatility as concerns programming and employment of the sensors. The designing
    of the board has been realized in modular approach to facilitate hardware and
    software prototyping. In particular, on the board are inserted all connectors
    useful for high prototyping performances, such as 2.54 mm connectors to facilitate
    connections of power supplies and communication buses of every sensor. In Figure
    1 is shown a general block diagram of the board, which is composed by the Green
    House Core (GHC), the Wi-Fi Module, the RS485 Module, the Analog-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC) Module and the USB Module, all hosted on the Main Board. Each component
    of our electronic board has been chosen in order to respect requirements considering
    low-cost solution. Figure 1. Block diagram of the electronic board. A 3D view
    of the board with its modules integrated in the Main Board, is shown in Figure
    2. Each module has been descripted in the following sub-sections. Figure 2. 3D
    view of the electronic board. In order to allow on-site use, a dedicated box has
    been designed, using an appropriate CAD, to protect the board from environmental
    agents, such as weather conditions, fertilizer emission, intrusion, dust, accidental
    contact and water. For these reasons, the development of the box has respected
    the IEC standard 60529-IP56 [32]. The box has six holes (one for power supply,
    one for Ethernet port and four for external sensors) in order to permits connections
    between board and sensors, power supply and internet gateway. For assembling the
    board on the box, four 5-mm diameter rounded turrets have been designed and positioned
    on each box angle. The box size is 172 × 192 × 110 millimeters. Figure 3 shows
    a 3D view of the box. Figure 3. A 3D view of the board dedicated box: (a) base
    of the box; (b) box cap. 3.1. Green House Core (GHC) The Green House Core module
    contains the core of the board and consequently it permits to manage all modules
    intended to data acquisition and communication. In particular, 8-bit Atmel ATmega2560-16AU
    microcontroller (Table 2) has been chosen [33]. We have selected an 8-bit platform,
    instead of a more recent 32-bit platform, as well as for the economic aspect,
    for the following main reasons [34,35,36]: Table 2. Specifications of the Atmel
    ATmega2560-16AU microcontroller. The majority of 8-bit devices are proposed in
    DIP packaging. This aspect makes them easy to plug into a breadboard and get starting
    with the prototype experiments, guaranteeing a fast and easy solution. Most 8-bit
    devices run on 5 volts, as well as the ATmega2560-16AU microcontroller. 5-volt
    systems provide better noise immunity and the majority of industry standard modules
    use 5-volt logic levels, as you can see from most of selected chips of our board.
    8-bit devices are robust and it results harder to damage an 8-bit device than
    a 32-bit device [34]. The use of an 8-bit device guarantees a low and fast learning
    curve as concerns the firmware development [34]. Many modern microcontrollers
    incorporate some hardware functions that serve to help the CPU operate as efficiently
    as possible, such as the Peripheral Event System, which allows peripherals to
    interact without intervention from the CPU. In the case of detecting a hardware
    event, it is important to first detect the event and then switch control to the
    desired interrupt service routine (ISR). In these situations, CPU speed isn’t
    the single determining factor. It is a question of how long, in terms of cycles,
    does it take to respond to the interrupt, run the ISR, and return. As shown in
    Table 2 of [35], 8-bit devices can be more efficient in handling hardware near
    actions. In fact, the average clock cycles employed in an 8-bit MCU are lower
    than 32-bit MCU (i.e., for detect interrupt, jump to interrupt vector, return
    from interrupt, etc.). The ATmega2560-16AU microcontroller has a maximum clock
    frequency of 16 MHz and equipped with a 256-kB flash memory, an 8-kB Static Random
    Access Memory (SRAM) and a 4-kB Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory
    (EEPROM). The microcontroller holds a 16-channel ADC with 10-bit resolution and
    several serial communication protocols. The GHC module has been designed to set
    up the board for communication with SPI, I2C and UART protocols. In addition,
    an Ethernet port, with a dedicated Ethernet controller designed for embedded applications,
    has been inserted in the project to guarantee a wired internet connection. As
    mentioned above, we have chosen each component of our electronic board with the
    aim to have a low-cost solution. In this way, we have supposed that in our greenhouse
    might not be a significant number of IP addresses and consequently we have opted
    for an IPv4 chip, which has more restrained cost and a lower curve learning than
    a more complex IPv6 chip. The selected Ethernet controller is the WIZnet W5100
    model that supports many protocols, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, IPv4 ARP, IGMP, PPPoE
    and Ethernet [37]. A SPI serial bus connection has been implemented for communication
    between Atmel ATmega2560-16AU and WIZnet W5100 controllers (see Figure 1). Figure
    4 shows front side and back side of the GHC 3D model. As you may notice, in the
    project has been inserted five LEDs for a visual check of the board state. In
    particular, one for noticing ON state, one for seeing board working, one for Ethernet
    ON state and two for specifying transmission or reception in Ethernet communication.
    Figure 4. A 3D view of the GHC module: (a) front side; (b) back side. 3.2. Wi-Fi
    Module This module permits wireless communication between the GHC module and external
    devices, such as laptop, smartphone and internet gateway. The Wi-Fi chip used
    for the Wi-Fi module is the ATWINC1500-MR210PA model from Microchip Atmel [38],
    an IoT chip that guarantees a low energy consumption. It is composed by a flash
    memory and a 2.4 GHz antenna (ISM band) for signal transmitting and receiving
    with a rate of 20 MHz. This chip is designed for communicating with SPI, UART
    and I2C protocols. Main features of the module are listed in Table 3. Table 3.
    Specifications of the Microchip ATWINC1500-MR210PA chip installed in the Wi-Fi
    module. Since the maximum voltage supply of this chip and also its communication
    signals have a voltage equal to 3.3 V, a voltage stabilizer and a level shifter
    have been used for adapting 5 V to desired voltage of 3.3 V. As well as the GHC
    module, three LEDs (i.e., red, yellow and green) have also been inserted in the
    Wi-Fi module, for noticing the state of the module during firmware testing and
    developing phase. Figure 5 shows front side and back side of the 3D Wi-Fi module.
    Figure 5. A 3D view of the Wi-Fi module: (a) front side; (b) back side. 3.3. RS485
    Module The RS485 module permits to communicate with external sensors equipped
    with this output protocol and consequently acquire digital signals from them.
    Since many sensors are developed for working with both RS485 and RS422 protocols,
    in developing phase has been chosen the MAX3468CSA chip from Maxim Integrated
    [39]. This allows a maximum data rate of 40 Mb/s and a signal delay less than
    20 ns. Main characteristics of this chip are listed in Table 4. Figure 6 shows
    front side and back side of the 3D RS485 module. Figure 6. A 3D view of the RS485
    module: (a) front side; (b) back side. Table 4. Specifications of the Maxim Integrated
    MAX3468CSA chip used in the RS485 module. 3.4. ADC Module The ADC module allows
    the conversion of analog signal, collected by external sensors, to digital signal,
    required for data processing by the board and subsequently routing to the database
    via the internet gateway (using Ethernet or Wi-Fi interface). In designing phase,
    we have selected the ADS1015 chip from Texas Instruments [40], characterized by
    an internal voltage reference, a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and a digital
    comparator, an oscillator and a I2C protocol interface. In particular, the chip
    has a 12-bit resolution, a sampling frequency of 3.3 ksps, two differential channels
    and four single-ended channels. In Figure 7 are shown front side and back side
    of the 3D view and in Table 5 are reported the main characteristics of the ADS1015
    chip. Figure 7. A 3D view of the ADC module: (a) front side; (b) back side. Table
    5. Main features of the ADS1015 chip used in the ADC module. 3.5. USB Module The
    USB module is shown in Figure 8 and it is useful for communication with external
    devices, such as laptop and smartphone and eventually for uploading and updating
    firmware. The chose module is the FT232R from FTDI chip [41], a standard USB 2.0
    with Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) technology. This system
    allows the data transmitting and receiving with a data-rate of 12 Mb/s. The chip
    is equipped with a 1024-bit EEPROM that permits configuration system. In the design
    of this module, two LEDs have been added for verifying correct tasks of data receiving/transmitting.
    In Table 6 the main characteristics of the FT232R chip are reported. Figure 8.
    A 3D view of the USB module: (a) front side; (b) back side. Table 6. Main features
    of the FT232R chip used in the USB module. 3.6. Main Board The Main Board hosts
    the other modules (the GHC module, the Wi-Fi Module, the RS485 Module, the ADC
    Module and the USB Module) and guarantees power supply, filtering and protection
    to each of them thanks to Power Supply Unit (PSU) module (see Figure 1). Since
    one of the aims of the board concerns prototyping firmware and software in order
    to make the most of device performances, the Main Board has been designed without
    any strict electrical connection between various modules hosted (see Figure 9).
    In this way, it is possible to connect various modules as needed of the firmware
    and software developer (input/output ports selected, timer, pin optimization,
    etc.), which should program the board using an In Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP)
    interface. The board is 12–32 V powered and it provides, thanks to on-board DC
    converter [42], two different voltages, 12 V and 5 V, according to needs. In fact,
    the other modules are developed to operate with a 5 V power supply, whereas all
    sensors could be fed to 5 V, 12 V and 24 V power supply [24,25,26] and [28,29].
    A power consumption calculation has been done in order to evaluate the maximum
    power supply for each module and consequently the maximum power consumption of
    our electronic board. In the calculation, the power consumption of outline electronics,
    such as resistors, capacitors, etc., is considered negligible compared to main
    modules consumption. The calculation is obtained considering maximum current (Imax)
    and voltage (Vmax) supply, in the worst case, of every chips involved in the board,
    using the following formula: P max = ∑ 𝑛=1 𝑚 V max,𝑛 × I max,𝑛 where m is the
    number of modules involved in the prototype. In Table 7, the maximum Voltage supply
    (Vmax), the maximum current supply (Imax) and the maximum power supply (Pmax)
    for each module are reported. Using the previous formula, the maximum power consumption
    of our prototype is equal to about 1619 mW. Since the board is 12 V–32 V powered,
    we have also calculated the energy consumption for each voltage, with the following
    formula: I V=12V = P max 12 / =134.91 mA I V=32V = P max 32 / =50.59 mA Figure
    9. A 3D view of the Main Board: (a) front side; (b) back side. Table 7. Power
    consumption calculation. Consequently, the energy consumption decreases when the
    Voltage powered increases. As achievement of power consumption calculation, and
    considering that the board could also power external sensors, we have chosen the
    typical current supply equal to 1.5 A. In this way, we have an oversized electronic
    system that guarantees absolute flexibility for the board power and the external
    sensors connection and power. Naturally, for the sensors that request more current
    supply, it is necessary to have an external power supply. 4. Results: Prototype
    Realization and Dedicated Firmware and Software Development The prototype of the
    electronic platform for real time greenhouse environment monitoring, designed
    and developed in previous section, has been realized and it is shown in Figure
    10. As mentioned above, the hardware of our electronic platform has been designed
    in modular way with the goal to test several combinations with optimized dedicated
    firmware and software, based on the scenario where the device may be involved.
    For example, in certain applications there might be the necessity to have only
    Ethernet interface for connection with external devices, and the requirement to
    work with both digital sensors (RS485 module) and analogic sensors (ADC module).
    Consequently, thanks to tests performed using our modular prototype (Figure 10),
    it is possible to develop the best firmware and software solution considering
    only the modules involved in this particular scenario (the GHC module, the RS485
    module and the ADC module, whose designs are shown in Figure 4, Figure 6 and Figure
    7), and to develop, at a later time, a new compact board that includes only these
    chips. In this way, starting from our electronic prototype that guarantees maximum
    flexibility in terms of applicable scenarios, it is possible to develop a new
    integrated, compact and robust board which includes only desired modules, whose
    design is shown in Figure 11. Naturally, the same reasoning can be made for other
    modules based on application needs. Figure 10. Photo of the electronic board.
    Figure 11. Design of the new integrated, compact and robust board. It is composed
    by only GHC (Figure 4), RS485 (Figure 6) and ADC (Figure 7) chips. Starting from
    our prototype, the new board is developed to work in a scenario where is necessary
    only Ethernet connection and the possibility to acquire data from analogic and
    digital sensors. As mentioned above, our electronic board has been developed with
    the purpose of firmware and software prototyping. A dedicated firmware and software
    has been implemented in order to make the most of device performances. The electronic
    prototype aims to acquire analog and digital signals collected by external sensors
    for air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, air velocity and CO2 concentration
    measurements, simultaneously. Subsequently, after data acquisition and processing,
    the processed data are shared to users through connection between the board and
    internet gateways, laptops or smartphones. The software could conceptually be
    divided in two blocks: one dedicated to board bootloader and firmware, the second
    one for a web application for the management of acquired data by users. The whole
    firmware and software package has been implemented to have a bi-directional communication
    between the board and the web server. For this kind of communication, performed
    by Ethernet and Wi-Fi modules, the standard Used Datagram Protocol (UDP) has been
    used to allow transmitting and receiving data string, quickly. In particular,
    with the objective of developing a real time monitoring prototype, which collects
    data with a high acquisition frequency and sends them to external devices, we
    have used UDP protocol because it guarantees a simple connectionless communication
    model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. It is suitable for application such
    our project where error checking and correction are either not necessary. In addition,
    we have considered Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in order to ensure
    reliability of the transmission process. 4.1. Development of the Dedicated Firmware
    The bootloader and the firmware, which have been developed in C language, have
    been added at the time of manufacturing and are useful to run user programs on
    the board and can be thought of as the software that allows hardware to run. The
    bootloader runs when the board is turned on and it is very similar to a computer
    BIOS. It allows ports and microcontroller pins setting for permitting communication
    between the board and external devices. On the other hand, the firmware enables
    data acquisition from sensors (RS485 and ADC modules) and communication with internet
    gateway (Wi-Fi module and Ethernet port). A block diagram of the firmware is reported
    in Figure 12. The Setup block is dedicated for modules and protocols setup and
    permits the initialization each time the board is switched on. During the design
    phase, we have installed a real time clock on the board. But despite this aspect,
    an initial synchronization is necessary connecting on the server. In addition,
    we have planned a periodical synchronization of our system nodes in order to compensate
    their time shifting. Consequently, the Synchronization block guarantee a synchronization
    with real time-clock from Internet for automatic time association to acquired
    data. If the synchronization is not performed, it is repeated while it will be
    successful. When the synchronization is done, the board starts the data acquisition
    from external sensors. A data elaboration is carried out using a sequential Kalman
    filter, namely Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) [43], which permits to stabilize
    data acquired in the previous block. In fact, the UKF uses a series of measurements
    observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces
    an estimated achievement that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single
    measurement alone. After this elaboration, the Data communication block allows
    to save data in a standard format for web server communication with UDP and CoAP
    protocols. Figure 12. Block diagram of the firmware. In order to investigate the
    stability of the acquired data and the results of the data elaboration using the
    UKF, we have tested the board during a time acquisition window of 30 s. The experiment
    has been studied with the goal of simulating a typical use scenario of the board.
    A resistive potentiometer has been powered by the board with a voltage of 5 V,
    and its voltage reading has been stored and elaborated using the UKF by the board.
    We have decided to test the board for voltages reading between 500 mV and 2000
    mV, that are typical values of commercial sensors. In Figure 13 are shown the
    graphical results of the experiment. Figure 13. Graphical results of the experiment
    for data acquisition and elaboration: (a) acquired data at voltages of about 500
    mV; (b) acquired data at voltages of about 1000 mV; (c) acquired data at voltages
    of about 1500 mV; (d) acquired data at voltages of about 2000 mV. Thanks to the
    analysis of Figure 12, we can see the advantages of using the UKF in terms of
    the collected data quality and stability. In particular, the board is able to
    collect data with voltages reading of 500 mV (Figure 13a), 1000 mV (Figure 13b),
    1500 mV (Figure 13c) and 2000 mV (Figure 13d), with maximum ripples of about 60
    mVpp (see blue curves of Figure 13, named “No UKF”), according with features of
    the on-board DC converter [42]. This stage is performed by the Data acquisition
    block of Figure 12. When these data are elaborated by the Elaboration data block
    of Figure 12, using the UKF (see red curves of Figure 13, named “UKF”), the values
    of voltage readings have ripples of few mVpp. This result highlights an improvement
    of the data quality and stability after the elaboration stage and it is in line
    with the accuracy of commercial sensors that could be used in greenhouse monitoring
    [24,25,26,27,28,29]. 4.2. Development of the Dedicated Software and Web Application
    Thanks to the connectivity features of our board, the collected datasets are immediately
    available, for example, to the other IoT devices that could work in the greenhouse.
    In this way, the agricultural production process of the greenhouse could be executed
    by automation system that increases productivity by reducing the need for human
    workforce, guaranteeing a smart management of the greenhouse. On the other hand,
    we have implemented a Web application in order to allow also users a consultation
    of greenhouse environmental state, through a user-friendly graphical interface,
    in a simple and fast way. The web application (that is a client-server computer
    program that the client runs in a web browser) has been developed using Java servlet
    and Java Server Pages (JSP). A Java servlet is a Java software component that
    implements web containers for hosting web applications on web servers and thus
    qualify as a server-side servlet web application. JSP is a server-side programming
    technology that enables the creation of dynamic, platform-independent method for
    building web applications in HTML language. The Web application (see Figure 14)
    allows users to synchronize the board from Internet, to acquire data information
    collected by the board, to storage these data in a on-line dedicated database
    and to show them via a web browser. Figure 14. A screenshot of the dedicated Web
    application. 5. Discussion and Conclusions In this study, the design, development
    (Figure 1 and Figure 2) and realization (Figure 10) of a flexible electronic prototype
    for greenhouse environment monitoring, based on the IoT architecture, is proposed.
    The device represents an Agriculture 4.0 perspective and its use in a greenhouse
    will contribute to improve and address the real needs of farmers and reengineer
    the monitoring of this environment. The hardware of our electronic platform has
    been designed in modular way with the goal to test several combinations with optimized
    dedicated firmware and software, based on the scenario where the device may be
    involved. The system is a prototype composed by a Green House Core, a Wi-Fi Module,
    a RS485 Module, an ADC Module and a USB Module, all hosted by a Main Board. The
    board permits communication based on Wi-Fi, Ethernet, USB interface, RS485, SPI,
    UART and I2C. Since the board will be used for prototyping firmware and software,
    the Main Board has been designed without any strict electrical connection between
    various hosted modules. In this way, it is possible to connect various modules
    as needed to the firmware and software developer. Starting from our electronic
    prototype that guarantees maximum flexibility in terms of applicable scenarios,
    it is possible to develop a new integrated, compact and robust board which includes
    only desired modules for a particular application (Figure 11). The electronic
    platform permits to collect data from external sensors, elaborate and send them
    to external electronic devices. In order to investigate the performances of the
    device, in particular the stability of the acquired data and the results of the
    data elaboration using the UKF, we have tested the board during a time acquisition
    window of 30 s. The collected data concern to main greenhouse environmental parameters,
    such as air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, air velocity and CO2 concentration.
    A Web application has been implemented to allow users a consultation of greenhouse
    environmental state in a simple and fast way. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically arable
    farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective production
    and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental impact.
    This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application
    of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments,
    task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared
    to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state
    of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and
    potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and
    implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of
    Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management
    of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management
    Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract With the expansion of smart agriculture, wireless
    sensor networks are being increasingly applied. These networks collect environmental
    information, such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 rates. However, if a faulty
    sensor node operates continuously in the network, unnecessary data transmission

    of crops and livestock can be appropriately maintained and managed by remotely
    or automatically applying information and communications technology to greenhouses,
    barns, orchards, and other farming environments [1,2]. Accurate data on crop growth
    and environmental conditions enable smart-farm operators to check the growth environment
    anytime and anywhere, and specify timely instructions, thereby improving the productivity
    and quality of agricultural products while reducing labor and energy demands [3,4,5].
    Smart farms can be implemented in various forms, from production to distribution
    and consumption. This establishes the convergence of information and communications
    technology in the value chain of agri-food to create new products, services, and
    process innovations, ranging from precise production and intelligent distribution
    to advanced management [6,7,8]. Regarding technological innovation, the Fourth
    Industrial Revolution can be considered as a new paradigm to create value through
    the convergence of artificial intelligence with data technologies such as the
    Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and storage, big data, and mobile computing
    and communications [9,10]. In particular, data technology combined with artificial
    intelligence implies hyperconnected agricultural production–distribution–consumption
    processes and the optimization of cyber-physical platforms, evolving into ultraprecise
    customized agriculture based on digital data, which is unprecedented in traditional
    agriculture [11,12,13]. In this study, an efficient energy management method using
    data-based fault detection through cloud-based “farm as a service” (FaaS) [14,15,16,17,18]
    is proposed. With the expanding scale of smart farms and open field cultivation,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being increasingly deployed in agriculture
    to collect environmental information, such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 rates
    [19,20,21]. As most wireless sensor nodes use batteries as their primary energy
    source, efficient energy consumption becomes essential. Furthermore, faults in
    sensor nodes should be mitigated to collect accurate environmental information
    [22,23]. If a faulty sensor node operates continuously in a network, unnecessary
    data transmission can undermine the network’s performance, possibly causing downtime
    and consequently, animal mortality and agricultural losses. Accordingly, a data-based
    fault detection algorithm is required to analyze sensor node data for predicting
    faulty nodes and preventing data transmission, thereby minimizing related damage
    to the WSN [24,25]. This paper presents the implementation of a data-based fault-detection
    model for a plum farm, a specialty crop, and reports the model application. The
    proposed algorithm does not consider a WSN in a limited area, such as that in
    protected horticulture, but aims to improve the network efficiency in a line-of-sight
    environment, such as an open field. Hence, its design is more focused on monitoring
    than on performing environmental control, which is unfeasible in open field crops.
    Furthermore, the algorithm was optimized to obtain microclimate information from
    the foot of a mountain, where climate varies frequently compared to wide-area
    climate. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the
    cloud-based FaaS optimized for smart farms is summarized, along with the technologies
    for managing IoT devices based on oneM2M, a machine-to-machine (M2M) standard.
    The FaaS performs resource management of sensors and actuators based on the oneM2M
    common platform. In Section 3, the data-based fault-detection model is introduced
    for the efficient energy management of the integrated management platform. In
    Section 4, the proposed algorithm is evaluated by collecting and analyzing data
    from an implemented system. In Section 5, the study is concluded, and directions
    for future research are provided. 2. IoT Management for FaaS FaaS uses cloud technology
    with IT infrastructure resources, such as servers, storage devices, middleware,
    and application software through networks, as illustrated in Figure 1. Furthermore,
    smart farm IoT devices, such as sensors and actuator nodes are virtualized and
    operated. Figure 1. Farm as a service (FaaS) using Internet of Things (IoT). This
    is similar to Fog computing, which provides a type of intercommunication between
    each layer and matches service quality. We also referred to an efficient structure
    named Fog Computing Architecture Network (FOCAN) [26,27]. In this manner, the
    cloud technology integrates heterogeneous smart farms containing existing farms
    and legacy systems operating in stand-alone and distributed architectures. In
    addition, low-cost farm management functions can be implemented. The algorithm
    for the proposed model was developed focusing on WSN energy efficiency during
    the collection and processing of agricultural data (red area in Figure 1) in the
    FaaS system. The algorithm performance was verified through an application in
    open field. 2.1. Equipment Management Service The equipment management service
    is a cloud platform that defines the resource management function to manage and
    operate a smart farm based on cloud technology (including IoT devices) and provide
    FaaS services. FaaS is a platform that provides smart farm services through the
    virtualization of farm resources, as illustrated in Figure 2. It supports operation
    services such as data collection, control, and management; API services for the
    development environment; and a variety of higher application services for tasks
    such as farm operation, monitoring, simple and complex control, device management,
    data management, and model management. Figure 2. Schematic of equipment management
    service. The equipment management service registers, connects, and manages devices
    installed in the farm, namely, the cloud sensor node (C-SN), cloud actuator node
    (C-AN), cloud hybrid node (C-HN), and cloud gateway (C-GW), and collects and controls
    sensing information and driving information from the devices. In addition, the
    equipment management service provides interoperability across IoT devices developed
    with different standards or technologies; thus, providing an application-independent
    common platform to support all agricultural services. The equipment management
    service relies on the oneM2M common platform to enable resource management of
    IoT devices [28]. OneM2M is a layered M2M architecture located between the IoT
    application environment (M2M application layer) and the smart farm environment
    (M2M device layer). It represents a common service layer to provide functions
    to various M2M-based applications using network services. The components from
    the diagram shown in Figure 3 are defined as follows [29,30]. Figure 3. Structural
    design of smart farm architecture based on oneM2M common platform. Infrastructure
    node (IN): Logical node (usually FaaS) that represents the service infrastructure
    of IoT/M2M; middle node (MN): logical node (usually cloud gateway) that connects
    and controls IoT/M2M devices; application dedicated node (ADN): logical node with
    the function of sensing values and delivering them to a gateway/server without
    implementing common functions of oneM2M. This includes cloud sensor/actuator/hybrid
    nodes. Application entity (AE): logical entity that includes application function
    logic for providing M2M services; common service entity (CSE): rntity that provides
    common service functions provided in oneM2M, corresponding to middleware software.
    2.2. Hierarchical Structure A WSN supporting FaaS integrates sensor nodes with
    modules for communication, monitoring, and processing. Each sensor node collects
    data, processes the data in the corresponding module, and wirelessly delivers
    the processed data to the user. As a WSN usually collects data from several sensor
    nodes, it demands long time and intensive computations during the analysis of
    natural environments. Hence, a research hotspot in WSNs is the maximization of
    sensor network lifetime by minimizing energy consumption in each sensor node.
    Although several studies have addressed energy efficiency for wireless communications,
    the inefficient energy consumption in data-based network management due to aspects
    such as faulty sensor nodes remains unsolved. In Section 3, fault detection in
    sensor nodes using statistical techniques for energy efficiency in WSNs is detailed.
    The environmental data constituting a smart farm consists of indoor and outdoor
    temperature, humidity, and corresponding control information. The proposed environment
    monitoring for FaaS has the hierarchical structure shown in Figure 4a. Figure
    4. Hierarchical IoT resource structure: (a) FaaS information collection; (b) diagram
    of middle node-common service entity (MN-CSE) resource. In FaaS, the cloud gateway,
    which classifies structures such as farms and greenhouses, is located in the field
    and represents a logical device (including MN-CSE) for tasks, including the connection
    of numerous sensors and actuators. In addition, the gateway executes fault detection
    based on the collected information. Each CSE has a unique identifier (CSE-ID)
    like the AEs. The MN-CSE in Figure 4b consists of the following resources: ADN-AE1
    (Sensor #1) includes a container called cont_monitor1; ADN-AE2 (Sensor #2) includes
    a container called cont_monitor2; ADN-AE3 (Actuator #1) includes a container called
    cont_actuator_status and creates a pollingChannelURI (virtual resource representing
    the target uniform resource identifier of the polling session) in channel pollingChannel.
    3. Data-Based Fault-Detection Model 3.1. Spatiotemporal Correlation among Sensor
    Measurements In a data collection area (e.g., smart farm), the air temperature
    has a relatively uniform spatiotemporal distribution, and thus, the sensor nodes’
    measurements show a similar trend over time [31,32]. Such spatiotemporal correlations
    [33] in external environments occur for different variables, including temperature,
    humidity, and CO2 rates. In contrast, other environmental factors, such as wind
    direction and speed, do not exhibit clear spatiotemporal correlations due to their
    high variability and uncertainty. Fault detection in sensor nodes can leverage
    spatiotemporal correlations. Consider m sensor nodes arranged in a data collection
    area. The measurement from sensor node i received at the cloud gateway at time
    t is denoted as D(i,t). Data collected at the previous period, D(i,t−1), can be
    used to determine the variation of the sensor node information as 𝜆(𝑖,𝑡)= Δ𝐷(𝑖,𝑡)
    Δ𝑡 ,𝑖=1,2,…𝑚, (1) where Δ𝐷(𝑖,𝑡)=|𝐷(𝑖,𝑡−1)−𝐷(𝑖,𝑡)| for sensor node i over period
    Δ𝑡 , which is usually random. By spatiotemporal correlations, sensor nodes with
    normal data collection exhibit a similar variation λ within a certain range. To
    analyze the data variation among a pair of sensor nodes, the difference between
    their mean data variations is calculated using Equation (4). Moreover, the difference
    between the data variation of sensor node j and the mean data variation across
    the other sensor nodes is given by 𝐷𝐼𝐹(𝑗,𝑡)=      Δ𝐷(𝑗,𝑡)− 1 𝑚−1 × ∑ 𝑖=1,𝑖≠𝑗
    𝑚 Δ𝐷(𝑖,𝑡)      ,𝑗=1,2,…𝑚, (2) where Δ𝐷(𝑗,𝑡)=|𝐷(𝑗,𝑡−1)−𝐷(𝑗,𝑡)| . 3.2. Fault-Detection
    Model A faulty sensor node is the result of abnormal operation and is expressed
    by inaccurate data collection and transmission. Although the causes of faults
    vary, they prevent proper communication or produce transmission of corrupted data.
    As mentioned above, the trends of data collected across sensors should be similar
    due to spatiotemporal correlations. If a fault occurs at a sensor node, the data
    variation is substantially different from that of other sensors. The sensor node
    fault detection method proposed in this paper is based on a cluster network topology
    with a gateway as the head node. Therefore, the gateway classifies faulty nodes
    through fault detection techniques, and does not process the messages transmitted
    from faulty nodes or transmit them to higher levels, thereby reducing unnecessary
    energy consumption and maintaining a stable network. In addition, if the number
    of faulty nodes gradually increases, and there is a problem in maintaining the
    network, a new cluster can be formed by merging with adjacent clusters. The probability
    of multiple sensor nodes simultaneously failing in a WSN is defined as follows.
    In the data collection area, sensor nodes simultaneously failing at a certain
    period do not exceed a limit. Hence, the proposed fault-detection model considers
    the possibility that faults can simultaneously occur in several sensor nodes using
    the spatiotemporal correlations described above. The mean data variation across
    sensor nodes operating normally can be calculated using Equation (3). If this
    variation is similar to that of each sensor node due to the spatiotemporal correlation
    of measurements, normal operation is assumed, whereas a fault can be inferred
    otherwise. 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛(𝑚′)= 1 𝑚′ × ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚′ Δ𝐷(𝑖,𝑡), (3) where m’ is the number of sensor
    nodes with normal operation in the data collection area and 1 𝑚′ × ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚′ Δ𝐷(𝑖,𝑡)
    is the mean data variation across these sensor nodes. The difference between the
    data variation of sensor node j and the mean data variation of sensor nodes operating
    normally is given by 𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑓(𝑗,𝑡)=|Δ𝐷(𝑗,𝑡)−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛(𝑚′)|, (4) 𝑓(𝑗,𝑡)={ 0,𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑓(𝑗,𝑡)<𝜍
    1,𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑓(𝑗,𝑡)≥𝜍 , (5) where 𝜍=max{𝜎,Δ𝐷max}, (6) with 𝜍 being a threshold for data
    variation, 𝜎 the measurement error of sensor nodes, and Δ𝐷max the maximum allowable
    data variation. The threshold of data variation should be set considering the
    sensors’ measurement errors. In addition, the threshold should consider the data
    collection period and interval, as small acquisition time imply small data variation.
    When the period is relatively large, the threshold should consider the maximum
    allowable value of adjacent variations in the collected data. Thus, Equation (5)
    provides a fault determination function, with f (j, t) = 0 indicating normal operation
    and f (j, t) = 1 indicating fault of sensor node j. The proposed model considers
    the following implementation assumptions. Most sensor nodes in an area are unlikely
    to be simultaneously faulty, with the maximum number of simultaneously faulty
    sensor nodes being half of all the nodes. To verify this, fault detection is conducted
    in two steps. First, sensor nodes operating normally are identified, and then
    the remaining nodes are subject to fault detection. 3.2.1. Procedure Statistically,
    data collected can be scattered from the mean according to the variance, and thereby,
    information can be inferred. If a dataset is collected, such as X = (x1, x2, …,
    xn), its variance D(x) is given by 𝐷(𝑥)= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑥 𝑖 )
    2 ,𝑖=1,2,3,…𝑛, (7) where n is the number of datapoints. A small variance indicates
    small changes, and that of the data variation per sensor node represents a trend.
    If a node is faulty, the data collected tends to be either large or small. Consequently,
    the variation of data collected with respect to the previous instant is relatively
    large, and the distribution of values, including the error data, grows. From n
    sensor nodes in a data collection area, at least k nodes should present normal
    operation at a given time. Using the assumption that at most half of all sensor
    nodes can be faulty, k is given by 𝑘={ (𝑛/2)+1,𝑛=𝑜𝑑𝑑 (𝑛+1)/2,𝑛=𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 , (8) Ordering
    the variations of collected data from the n sensor nodes ascendingly results in
    ΔD1 ≤ ΔD2 ≤ ΔDn−1 ≤ ΔDn. As the variation in adjacent instants from sensor nodes
    with normal operation has a similar value, at least k nodes are operating normally
    at any time. As the variations from faulty sensor nodes are relatively large,
    those from the k nodes with normal operation are adjacent after ordering. Thus,
    the data variations of the k sensor nodes conform to datasets (ΔD1, ΔD2, …, ΔDk),
    (ΔD2, ΔD3, …, ΔDk+1), …, and (ΔDn−k+1, ΔDn−k+2, …, ΔDn), each comprised of k values.
    As shown in Figure 5, (n − k + 1) datasets of sensor nodes with normal operation
    can be obtained, whose variance can be determined. As at least k sensor nodes
    operate normally, the dataset retrieving the smallest variance among the possible
    datasets is the one determining normal data variations and serves as the reference.
    Thus, any sensor node with similar data variation can be considered to be operating
    normally. Figure 5. Sensor nodes for fault detection under (a) odd and (b) even
    numbers of nodes in a wireless sensor network (WSN). 3.2.2. Algorithm The proposed
    fault-detection algorithm is divided into two steps, one for classifying the sensor
    nodes with normal operation, and the other to determine whether a fault occurs
    in the sensor nodes not previously classified as operating normally. Table 1 lists
    the symbols employed for the fault-detection algorithm, and Figure 6 shows the
    algorithmic flowchart. Fault detection among sensor nodes proceeds as follows:
    Figure 6. Proposed fault-detection algorithm for sensor nodes in a WSN. Table
    1. Symbol definitions to describe fault detection. (1) Sets of sensor node data
    averages received by a hub node in the previous period and data at the current
    period are obtained as A1 and A2, respectively. A set of the data variations between
    sets A1 and A2 is defined as A3. (2) Set A4 sorts the elements in A3 in ascending
    order, and the set of sensor node identifiers corresponding to set A4, Npx, is
    obtained. (3) The (n − k + 1) datasets are divided as follows starting from the
    first value, ΔD1, of set A4: 𝐵 1 ={Δ 𝐷 1 ,Δ 𝐷 2 ,…,Δ 𝐷 𝑘 } 𝐵 2 ={Δ 𝐷 2 ,Δ 𝐷 3
    ,…,Δ 𝐷 𝑘+1 } ⋮ 𝐵 𝑛−𝑘+1 ={Δ 𝐷 𝑛−𝑘+1 ,Δ 𝐷 𝑛−𝑘+2 ,…,Δ 𝐷 𝑛 } (4) Equation (7) is used
    to calculate the variance for datasets B1 to Bn−k+1. The sensor node identifiers
    of the data set with the smallest variances are arranged in set Nnormal with reference
    to set Npx. The remaining sensor node identifiers are arranged in set Nabeyance.
    (5) The occurrence of a fault is determined for all sensor nodes belonging to
    set Nabeyance. The data variation is calculated, and if it is below the threshold
    value, the result is 0 using Equation (5). Hence, this sensor node is operating
    normally, and its identifier is removed from set Nabeyance and placed into set
    Nnormal. Otherwise, the identifier is placed into set Nfailure, indicating a faulty
    sensor node. This procedure is applied to every sensor node in set Nabeyance for
    complete fault detection. 4. Tests on IoT-Based, Specialized-Fruit-Integrated
    Management Platform 4.1. System Specifications and Configuration To apply the
    proposed algorithm, a real-time, IoT-based, specialized-fruit-integrated management
    platform was designed for monitoring meteorological disasters and pest outbreaks,
    and for performing predictions and spread prevention. Another real-time system
    was developed to collect regional meteorological information; agricultural environmental
    indexes; microenvironmental information and underground/ground environmental information
    in cultivation areas; and microclimate information. This implementation aimed
    to provide a system that notifies farmers of relevant information, monitors the
    growing environment of orchards, predicts pest outbreaks, and provides numerous,
    immediate decision support services through a visual interface in the event of
    meteorological disasters and pests. To test the proposed sensor node fault detection,
    the IoT device management for the FaaS test environment in Section 2 was set up
    as shown in Figure 7, with nine sensor nodes in the environmental monitoring system.
    Then, abnormal data were transmitted from either one or four sensor nodes. Other
    specifications of the fault detection test system are listed in Table 2. Figure
    7. Specifications of environmental monitoring system used in this study [34,35,36].
    Table 2. Hardware specifications of IoT-based, specialized-fruit-integrated management
    platform. 4.2. Results and Discussion To implement the IoT-based platform, systems
    like that shown in Figure 8 were deployed over a South Korean plum (Prunus mume)
    crop in an open field. The results from 20 monitoring sites and their averages
    were analyzed to obtain the algorithmic evaluation results. Figure 8. Units of
    IoT-based, specialized-fruit-integrated management platform. Table 3 shows that
    the data variation of sensor node 3 is larger than that of the other sensor nodes.
    By the fault-detection algorithm, the average data variation over the previous
    10 periods and the collected data of the present period were compared to identify
    sensor nodes with normal operation. Equation (7) was used to calculate the variance
    of the data group comprised of five datapoints and classify the nodes with the
    smallest variance as operating normally. Then, Equation (5) was used to determine
    fault occurrence of the remaining nodes. Fault detection concluded that sensor
    node 3 was faulty. Table 3. Data collected for fault detection with one faulty
    sensor node. In Figure 9, the threshold of the data variation (i.e., criterion
    for fault detection) was set to 0.4 considering the error of the temperature sensor.
    For sensor node 3, the difference from the average data variation (0.16) of the
    normally operating sensor nodes was 0.88, exceeding the threshold of 0.4 and indicating
    fault. Figure 9. Sensor node fault detection for single node fault. Likewise,
    Table 4 and Figure 10 show the fault detection results for the maximum number
    of faulty sensor nodes allowed in the WSN. Table 4 shows that the data variations
    of sensor nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9 are larger than those of the other sensor nodes;
    thus, being identified as faulty nodes by the fault-detection algorithm. Figure
    10. Sensor node fault detection for four faulty nodes. Table 4. Data collected
    for fault detection with four faulty sensor nodes. In Figure 10, for sensor nodes
    2, 3, 7, and 9, the difference from the average data variation (0.15) of the normally
    operating sensor nodes exceeded the threshold of 0.4, indicating the four faulty
    nodes. Sensor node fault detection is necessary to prevent abnormal data from
    being transmitted and to reduce energy consumption by disabling faulty nodes in
    the WSN. In Figure 11, the effect of fault detection in energy consumption over
    time is depicted. When a faulty sensor node is not disabled, unnecessary data
    transmission of other sensor nodes occurs due to continuous abnormal data transmission;
    thus, increasing energy consumption. Figure 11. Energy consumption comparison
    (single node fault). 5. Conclusions Agricultural development is increasing by
    means of quantification and data analysis. Hence, it is necessary to formalize,
    collect, manage, and analyze data based on experience and knowledge accumulated
    by farmers and researchers to establish smart-farm platforms. In this paper, the
    design and implementation of fault detection for smart-farm sensors is presented.
    This kind of detection is essential for the proper operation of a smart-farm platform.
    In farms operating modernized, large-scale greenhouses, optimal growth information
    management according to facilities and crops is essential. Through the data-based
    fault-detection algorithm developed in this study, sensor nodes transmitting abnormal
    data can be detected, and their data transmission can be disabled, thereby increasing
    the reliability of the collected environmental data. The proposed algorithm provides
    accurate environmental data to users even if some faulty sensor nodes do not transmit
    data, provided that the normally operating nodes retrieve values within the predicted
    range and not exceeding an error threshold. Although the proposed algorithm enables
    energy efficiency in the entire WSN, data processing can be compromised by the
    missing data from faulty sensor nodes. Therefore, calibration for missing data
    is required for suitable processing. Note that no problems other than sample loss
    occur, even with data missing at random, as missing data values are excluded.
    Besides smart farms, environmental monitoring systems are applied in areas that
    require high data reliability, such as firefighting and disaster prevention. Accordingly,
    a method for determining faulty nodes is essential for the reliable data collection
    in these areas. In fact, extensive damage may occur if incorrect information is
    provided to the user due to abnormal data retrieved by a faulty sensor node. To
    determine sensor node’s faults, the proposed fault-detection algorithm uses data
    collected during certain periods to determine a faulty behavior through statistical
    methods. The algorithm was implemented on a system to detect faulty sensor nodes,
    which were disabled from the WSN to prevent corrupted data transmission, thereby
    improving energy efficiency. In future developments, a system to provide malfunction
    detection and notification services (e.g., deep learning-based sensing values)
    will be investigated by using metadata and measurements from various sensing devices,
    environmental information, and network status information. Prognostics and health
    management technologies are being actively researched, and system failures can
    be detected early and even predicted by real-time monitoring a system’s mechanical
    status. By taking appropriate preventive measures, maintenance costs can be reduced,
    and the safety and reliability of systems can be enhanced to prevent downtimes
    or even catastrophic events. Author Contributions Writing—original draft preparation,

    Figures Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract Integrated systems based on wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with electric propulsion
    are emerging as state-of-the-art solutions for large scale monitoring. Main advances
    stemming both from complex system architectures as well as powerful embedded computing
    and communication platforms, advanced sensing and networking protocols have been
    leveraged to prove the viability of this concept. The design of suitable algorithms
    for data processing, communication and control across previously disparate domains
    has thus currently become an intensive area of interdisciplinary research. The
    paper was focused on the collaborative aspects of UAV–WSN systems and the reference
    papers were analyzed from this point of view, on each functional module. The paper
    offers a timely review of recent advances in this area of critical interest with
    focus on a comparative perspective across multiple recent theoretical and applied
    contributions. A systematic approach is carried out in order to structure a unitary
    from conceptual design towards key implementation aspects. Focus areas are identified
    and discussed such as distributed data processing algorithms, hierarchical multi-protocol
    networking aspects and high level WSN–constrained UAV-control. Application references
    are highlighted in various domains such as environmental, agriculture, emergency
    situations and homeland security. Finally, a research agenda is outlined to advance
    the field towards tangible economic and social impact. Keywords: unmanned aerial
    system; wireless sensor network; data acquisition; intelligent data processing;
    communication protocol and standardization; data transmission; internet of things;
    integrated collaborative systems; path design 1. Introduction The tendency to
    use collaborative unmanned aerial vehicle-wireless sensor network (UAV–WSN) systems
    for surveillance, exploring and monitoring large regions of interest is increasingly
    strong today. These systems are able to integrate information from ground (WSN),
    air (UAV), space (satellite—GPS or equivalent) and internet. The advantage of
    these collaborative systems has been emphasized for large-scale monitoring [1],
    increasing mobility, accessibility and reaction time in case of emergency. The
    main novelty included a hybrid system architecture for data collection, which
    integrates an optimal method for the UAV trajectory design in conjunction with
    cluster head selection schemes at the ground sensor level. Practical development
    and implementation allow validation of the proposed theoretical approach in scalable
    fashion with tens to hundreds of ground nodes. Field level data is first aggregated
    at the node level before being relayed through the UAV systems to the central
    gateway. Salient example of data aggregation methods is represented by consensus
    algorithms, which allow for distributed agreement locally thereby reducing the
    burden on the communication channels and reducing overall latency. Matching WSN
    transmission schedules with UAV over flight patterns is also highly relevant for
    the collaborative aspects of such large-scale monitoring systems. Neither of the
    subsystems is efficient in what regards data transmission, reliability and duration
    of functioning by itself. Managing communication only through ground sensors would
    quickly deplete their batteries and using only UAVs would be wasteful from an
    energy point of view. Thus, a mix between these two types of agents (fixed and
    mobile) provides a solution, which is better than the sum of their parts. Alongside
    this initial example there are many relevant and recent contributions, mostly
    in the form of papers, research projects and commercial products concerning either
    WSN or UAV implementations. Neither of these subsystems is efficient in what regards
    data transmission, reliability and duration of functioning by itself. Managing
    communication only through ground sensors would quickly deplete their batteries
    and using only UAVs would be wasteful from an energy point of view. Thus, a mix
    between these two types of agents (fixed and mobile) provides a solution, which
    is better than the sum of their parts. Several surveys are also available that
    synthesize the characteristics, application areas and challenges in each of them,
    such as [2,3,4,5,6] for WSN and [7,8] for UAV. Over time, sensor networks have
    been widely used for data collection in both outdoor and indoor settings and in
    various application domains. Gradually, given significant technological development,
    the sensor networks have been enhanced with data processing elements, towards
    on-board intelligence. WSN design considerations, mainly relating to: production
    cost, accessibility, scalability and reliability, networking protocols, physical
    constraints such as: energy consumption, communication range and autonomy, data
    transmission and processing capabilities have been analyzed in many papers in
    the last years. The reference WSN architecture has a hierarchical tree structure
    and includes several sensing nodes (SN) grouped around a cluster head (CH). The
    CH is responsible for collecting and aggregating sensor data to make it available
    to the user [1]. More complex architectures focus on optimizing packet transmission
    time and reliability and involve multi-hop, mesh routing and even adaptive and
    dynamic topologies, such as in cellular networks, where challenge arise as nodes
    can join or leave the network at any time. On the other hand, unmanned aerial
    vehicles experienced a rapid development as they enabled fast access to otherwise
    inaccessible areas, with initial focus in military and disaster management fields.
    They were referred in the literature under various names such as: UAVs, drones,
    aerial platforms and aerial robots. UAVs can be characterized according to different
    categories: (a) according to the type of communication: open, specific and certified—EASA
    (European Aviation Safety Agency) classification [9]; (b) according to the type
    of motor: with thermal or electric motors and (c) according to the type of wing:
    airplane type (fixed wing) or helicopter type (rotor or multi-copter). The EASA
    rules, which are based on the evaluation of the risk of operation, establishes
    the obligations of drone manufacturers and operators in terms of safety, respect
    for privacy, the environment, protection against noise and security. Thus, starting
    from June 2020 all drone operators shall register themselves and receive an authorization
    before using a UAV. The registration number needs to be displayed on the UAV.
    It must be specified if the UAV path is below 120 m (visual line of sight—VLOS)
    or more (beyond visual line of sight—BVLOS). Increased pay-load capabilities have
    allowed equipping them with cameras to easily survey a given area, with small
    tanks of chemical solutions for spraying pesticides or fire extinguishing and
    even with WSN nodes for faster deployment. While the basic architecture considers
    a single UAV and one or more base stations for transmitting trajectory parameters,
    more recent advances analyze multi-copter applications, with or without inter-UAV
    cooperation to overcome energy and distance limitations. Probably the most important
    issue is that these devices raised safety concerns regarding the allocation of
    airspace, which is currently separated from that of commercial airplanes or helicopters.
    This problem is under analysis at both research and institutional/regulatory levels
    and it is expected that by using specific intelligent technologies to reduce the
    risk both in the air and on ground, a suitable and widely adopted solution will
    be identified [9]. While neither WSN nor UAV architectures lack individual applicability,
    in the last years researchers showed interest in integrating these technologies.
    Motivated by the current evolving requirements for monitoring and data collection
    from extensive geographical spaces, collaborative, hybrid (air-ground or mobile-fixed)
    UAV–WSN systems have been developed [1,10]. The efficient use in wide areas of
    the UAV–WSN collaborative systems, however, requires an artificial intelligence
    component for the acquisition, transmission and processing of data as well as
    for the control of the mission. Although commercially UAVs with different propulsion
    systems are available, in this paper we will only have under consideration those
    with electric propulsion, which are generally small, with reduced maintenance
    and operational costs. This is also aligned with the current regulatory context
    in Europe and beyond concerning the reduction of carbon emissions, which is driving
    electrification in the transport sector. Electric cars replacing gas-powered vehicles
    represent just one salient example. For most monitoring applications, the use
    of UAV with electric propulsion is currently widespread. Considering the reduced
    flight autonomy in comparison to thermal powered versions, one solution to extend
    the useful coverage area is to deploy multi-UAV systems. On the other hand, satellites
    are currently indispensable for most global navigation and other applications,
    but they can also be leveraged as complementary support infrastructure for transmitting
    data or commands for the analyzed UAV–WSN systems. Their impact on the environment
    however should also be accounted for, especially due to the release of small particles
    by rockets at launched [11]. This paper aims to review and highlight the collaborative
    aspect between the mentioned elements, organized in an integrated UAV–WSN architecture,
    as well as the intelligent data processing, computation, communication and control
    methods for carrying out specific monitoring and evaluation tasks in certain fields
    such as: transport, agriculture, disaster management, environmental assessment,
    etc. The paper topic is broad, including many keywords, but they must be viewed
    from the standpoint of the collaborative, integrated UAV–WSN system, as they are
    a means of integration and collaboration between ground agents (WSN) and air agents
    (UAV). On the other hand, the ways in which the different functional components
    of the system collaborate with each other were highlighted. For example, the motion
    planning procedures are discussed from the viewpoint of their interaction with
    the rest of the WSN: path with sensory data collection, image acquisition and
    processing, efficient communication with data collection and processing, etc.
    Recently, many studies have been carried out on the integration of UAV–WSN systems
    into the Internet of things (IoT) paradigm for long-distance mission communication
    and control or for cloud processing and storage. With the increasing number of
    papers in IoT technologies and considering the IoT role as a data sensing and/or
    actuating node, we believe it is of great interest including this topic in our
    research. Not the least important, a special emphasis was placed on distributed
    computing elements stemming from Fog and Edge Computing [12,13,14] domains with
    direct relevance to the efficient design of collaborative UAV–WSN systems. Many
    recent contributions, in the form of papers, research projects, and commercial
    products concern the implementation of WSN [2] and UAV [3] systems. The contribution
    and timely aspect of our article stem from a focused overview and highlight regarding
    the key collaborative aspects between the mentioned elements as well as the intelligent
    data processing, computation, communication and control methods. These lead to
    carrying out specific monitoring and evaluation tasks in application domains of
    critical interest such as: transport, agriculture, natural disaster damage management,
    environmental assessment and others. Over time, sensor networks have been widely
    used for data collection both outdoor and indoor, in various fields of applications
    [3,4,5]. Gradually, due to the technological development, the sensor networks
    were equipped with data processing elements, thus becoming intelligent ones [6].
    In our vision, the blueprint for such a complex, collaborative, monitoring system
    is composed of four main parts, as illustrated by Figure 1: Ground WSNs, UAVs,
    Internet/global system for mobile communications (GSM) networks and ground control
    stations (GCSs). From the communication point of view, we identified five possible
    communication channels: WSN–WSN (between SN—marked with red and CH marked with
    blue), WSN–UAV (between CH and WSN), UAV-GCS (between UAV and GDT, associated
    with GCS), GCS-internet-GCS, UAV–UAV and UAV-satellite-GCS. The primary task of
    the UAV team is to cover a given area where one or several WSNs were deployed,
    having as main objectives collecting data and/or capturing surface images from
    a certain area. The main constraints for accomplishing these tasks are the UAV
    path trajectory and length, devices energy consumption, and communication distance
    between WSN nodes and UAV. In this paper we consider the “agent” notion as an
    equivalent for the following: sensor, cluster head (ground-based agents), UAV
    and mobile sink (aerial agent). In our interpretation, the entire WSN–UAV system
    is a heterogeneous multi-agent system. Figure 1. The concept of an integrated
    unmanned aerial vehicle-wireless sensor network (UAV–WSN) system. The task of
    designing procedures for generating paths that optimally fulfill the UAV and WSN
    system requirements, in terms of distance and energy consumption, while simultaneously
    respecting collision avoidance is a matter of great interest. There are several
    criteria that characterize and influence the path planning procedures: - offline
    versus online, which differentiates between the flight preparation phase or during
    the actual flight; - coverage versus waypoint passing: the former entails a discovery
    phase in which features like sensor position are estimated while the latter focuses
    on the interaction with the WSN; - static versus dynamic: is the path update carried
    out at runtime or not? Many works consider various restrictions that affect the
    path planning procedure. These range from: - geometric: the imposition of artificial
    limitations in the types of paths, which may result [15,16,17,18]; - energy-based:
    considerations of the energy expenditure and distances within the WSN [19,20],
    limited buffer capacity for the WSN’s sensors [21]; - internal dynamics: fixed-wing
    UAVs have a higher cruising speed and longer operation time whereas rotor UAVs
    are more flexible but have less autonomy [22,23,24]; - communication: signal attenuation
    due to obstacle occlusion [25], minimum communication time with the cluster head
    [20]. In general, the path generation is a complex procedure stemming from the
    nonlinear nature of the UAV dynamics and of the various operational constraints,
    which include: waypoint passing, line-of-sight communication, collision avoidance,
    etc. All these elements lead, in its more general form, to a nonlinear (in cost
    and constraints) constrained optimization problem, which is often impractical
    to solve [26,27]. Noteworthy, the schemes encountered consider mostly a single
    UAV operation scenario. Those which have multiple UAV usually partition the tasks
    a priori such that each of the UAVs functions independently of the others [27,28].
    The rest of the article has been structured as follows. Section 2 defines a specific
    context into which our contribution can be framed. This is mostly related to a
    significant increase in the interest of the research community in studying and
    developing UAV, WSN and IOT systems. Our primary analysis is based around keyword
    searches in the reference SCOPUS and Web of Science (WOS) databases and we detail
    the arguments for the articles that we have surveyed for this review. Section
    3 is focused on the advantages and specific design space of collaborative UAV–WSN
    operation. One of the main topics that is handled in this section relate to designing
    efficient UAV paths and tracking in mission scenarios that involve WSN data collection.
    We also discuss the key challenges and current approaches for the data acquisition
    and data processing, which can leverage the on-board computing resources of the
    network nodes while reducing communication bottlenecks inside the collaborative
    system. Due to the varied radio and networking protocols that are usually deployed,
    we handle data communication as a independent topic in Section 4. This details
    the radio interfaces that are used at both the WSN and UAV levels as well as the
    components, both logical and physical, that enable interoperability in a hierarchical
    fashion, from low power/low data rate to high power/high data rate. Section 5
    handles implementation aspects of integrated UAV–WSN systems with a main emphasis
    on optimization algorithms and heuristics that allow improvements in system performance
    for data collection, relaying and extended autonomous operation through energy
    efficiency. The core applications that we survey as representative use cases for
    collaborative large-scale monitoring systems are in agriculture, environmental
    monitoring and disaster management. These are discussed in Section 6. The article
    concludes with discussion and conclusion sections that observe the current trends
    and main areas for a research agenda in this field. For readability, each topical
    section includes a synthesis table with the main relevant articles that were analyzed,
    highlighting the key objectives and approaches to the reader. To save space and
    to better track the work content, Appendix A gives a complete list of the acronyms
    and symbols used throughout this review article. 2. Materials and Methods Although
    the works that presented separately WSNs and UAVs are older and their respective
    research topics are well-established in the literature [29], the study of collaborative
    integration between UAV and WSN is relatively recent (mostly after 2004). One
    of the first reference papers addressing an integrated WSN–UAV approach is [30],
    where an UAV is used for WSN node deployment. In [31], considering the drop in
    the cost of the drones, a multi-UAV system is proposed for collecting data from
    ground sensors. To this end, mobile software agents were used for intelligent
    communication, data collection and processing. In order to better frame the opportunity
    for the current work we have initially performed a keyword search across the SCOPUS
    and WOS databases in order to have a better picture on the main topics of this
    survey. We considered a period of 12 years between 2007 and 2018. The search was
    split between individual keywords and combinations of keywords using “and” and
    “or” connectors, while searching the title, abstract and keywords of the respective
    original articles indexed in the databases and reporting the yearly publication
    counts. For the individual keywords we searched for the following keywords: UAV,
    WSN and IoT. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the individual results for Scopus and
    WOS databases respectively. While we observed a linear increase in the interest
    from the scientific community for the UAV topic, for WSN there was an increase
    until around 2012 followed by a relative stagnation beyond this point (or an even
    slight decrease in terms of WOS data). This was more than compensated by the exponential
    increase in the interest for IoT and can be explained through the fact that many
    current IoT systems rely on wireless sensor networks as key building blocks for
    their implementation. Among the two studies databases the trends in publication
    counts over the years were similar, with Scopus providing an absolute larger number
    of references when compared to WOS as well as timelier indexing of the respective
    contributions. Figure 2. SCOPUS search results on keywords between 2007 and 2018:
    UAV, WSN and Internet of things (IoT), separately. Figure 3. Web of Science (WOS)
    search results on keywords between 2007 and 2018: UAV, WSN and IoT, separately.
    For the combined study, we searched for the combinations: UAV and WSN, UAV and
    IoT, UAV and satellite and UAV or WSN, UAV or IoT. In the “or” case, as expected
    we saw the cumulative effect of both areas of contributions in terms of publication
    numbers over the twelve years. We might therefore conclude that these topics represent
    large and growing areas of study. At their intersection, in the “and” case, by
    adding up the two combined keywords we highlighted an increasing interest in studying
    and developing hybrid large scale monitoring systems based on both UAVs and WSN/IoT
    ground solutions. This serves as a proper justification for the current survey.
    In addition to the previously defined keywords, for the “and” study we also included
    “satellite” in conjunction with UAV and IoT. We argued that there was also an
    important number of publications, especially in the telecommunications community
    where a satellite was seen as the third link in hybrid large scale monitoring
    systems, which complements as a redundant backhaul the low power radio network
    of the WSN/IoT and the GSM or other type of long-range communication links on-board
    the UAV platforms. We also performed a more restrictive SCOPUS search for the
    combined UAV–WSN–IoT keywords. Five articles [32,33,34,35,36] were identified
    and referenced, which covered all these topics in areas relating to enabling improved
    data collection, softwarization of large scale monitoring systems and agriculture
    IoT architectures and deployments. Finally, the combined results of this literature
    meta-review are illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4. SCOPUS search results on keywords
    between 2007 and 2018: (a) UAV and WSN, together, and UAV and IoT, together and
    (b) UAV or WSN, UAV or IoT. For this review 985 papers were found from different
    databases like: WOS, Scopus, IEEE Xplore and PubMed, of which we selected and
    researched 121 for this review. The main criteria for selecting or rejecting a
    paper was addressing of a UAV–WSN integrated system. We expect for identified
    early papers covering this topic, the authors focused on related work published
    in the last 5 years to better capture the technical novelties proposed in the
    literature. Under these considerations, papers using both UAV and WSN but with
    no collaborative functions were not considered relevant for the scope of the paper.
    Papers were classified according to the main and secondary topics addressed: architecture,
    path planning, data acquisition and processing, communication, simulation, real
    implementation or specific application. Relevant papers were first selected for
    each topic based on the work visibility and impact of contributions (publishing
    in high-rank conferences and journals and number of citations), based on the technical
    novelty and relevance of the work and considering this survey’s authors’ perspective
    on the domain and topics addressed. Most relevant papers were detailed in each
    article section. The other less relevant papers, which also included useful experimental
    results or approaches, were included only in the article’s tables. 3. Collaborative
    Operation in UAV–WSN Applications 3.1. Collaboration and Intelligence in the UAV–WSN
    System One of the first collaborative UAV–WSN applications was the location of
    sensors on the ground. Thus, in [30] the AVATAR autonomous helicopter is used
    for WSN node deployment. The setup allowed establishing communication between
    WSN nodes and a helicopter as a feedback on the deployment algorithm. WSN modes
    were Mica Motes and the communication between UAV and WSN used radio signals at
    915.5 MHz and achieved a maximum distance of 13 m. More recently, UAV–WSN architectures
    have been using aerial vehicles as one of three types of actors: - for node deployment
    [30] in applications with low on-site accessibility or dangerous for human operation;
    - as actuators, as in [37] where drones are used for spraying pesticides; - as
    relays for receiving and retransmitting a signal, as in [38], between CH and GDT,
    in [39,40] as message ferrying in sparse networks, in [41] as a mobile node carrying
    sensing equipment or in [42] to overcome faults of the sensing network; - as mobile
    sinks, this being the most widely used role integrated with either small or large
    scale WSNs. In this case, two data acquisition modes were identified: ○ clustered,
    when data is sent to a local CH; ○ direct communication, where the UAV collects
    data from each sensor node. In [43] the authors provide a model depending on weight,
    wing area, air density and energy required for transmission for evaluating the
    energy consumption for a UAV. They compare the clustered and direct communication
    approaches and show the energy consumption is lower in the clustered design. UAV
    were used for the dynamic clustering of ground sensor nodes and cluster head selection
    mechanism in a randomly deployment of sensors [1]. Due to the development of new
    technologies, the trade-off between storing and transmitting WSN ground level
    data is, currently, a challenge [44]. The UAV acts as a mobile CH for the network
    with a novel scenario in which it harbors an energy harvesting module and wireless
    recharging for the ground nodes. Energy harvesting is based on RF signal energy
    extraction where part of the received signal is used for this and part for standard
    data collection while hovering over a sensor node island. Based on information
    collected from the nodes, the UAV schedules appropriately the battery charging
    and data gathering. Visiting the nodes is based on a variant of the travelling
    salesman problem (TSP) with time windows: shortest travelling time trajectory
    (STTT). The model used for the battery level of a WSN node is a birth–death process
    based on the observed activity rates in terms of data sensing and transmissions.
    3.2. Satellite Information Satellite connection offers two major advantages: system
    localization (both UAV and WSN) and data communication support. For localization
    the system elements (especially the UAVs) are equipped with GPS. One of the first
    notable papers introducing the use of a UAV equipped with a GPS as a beacon node
    was [45]. In this case no a priori knowledge on the WSN node location is required.
    For WSN node localization the GPS information is combined with the RSSI signal
    strength of RF communication between the UAV and the node [1]. The position is
    represented as a probability distribution function. Experimental results prove
    that by increasing the distance between node and WSN the standard deviation of
    the RSSI signal decreases [45]. Therefore, the positions are less sensitive to
    measurement uncertainties and the signal does not need to be filtered. 3.3. UAV
    Path Generation and Tracking In the context of WSNs, the main motivation of having
    an UAV (or team of UAVs) as mobile sink(s) is to prolong the sensors’ lifetime
    (by canceling their need to communicate with a base station [20]) and to reduce
    operational costs (canceling the need of direct human supervision [25]). In addition,
    cases where widely dispersed parcels must be traveled preclude direct sensor communication
    and unavoidably require UAVs [22,23]. Thus, gathering and exchanging information
    with the WSN implicitly translates into the design and subsequent tracking of
    a path (or paths in the multi-UAV case [28]). This is hence the main justification
    for our interest in path planning and the ancillary mechanisms: whereas the WSN–UAV
    system may have different objectives and constraints, ultimately these translate
    into limitations and restrictions of the mobile agent’s path. There are several
    criteria that characterize and influence the path planning procedures. (i) Offline
    versus online planning. Most works assume a known environment (known domain, areas
    of interest, interdicted regions, etc.), which permits to solve the motion planning
    problem offline. A varying environment or changing mission parameters may lead
    to an online computation of the path. This is generally avoided as it introduces
    elements of risk, which are unacceptable in practical applications. Still, path
    updates are sometimes employed, either due to alarms signaled by a collision avoidance
    mechanism [46] or due to mission updates [24]. (ii) Coverage versus waypoint passing.
    Some works consider a discovery phase in which the deployed sensors’ position
    has to be estimated or the terrain has to be mapped through a preliminary pass.
    Such missions cover the entire area of interest [47] through either random or
    deterministic scanning. The former may be considered, e.g., in military applications
    where random routes are selected to avoid prediction of future actions. Realistic
    implementations combine both types of paths even when the sensors are deployed
    deterministically (e.g., in a grid) [48]. Furthermore, obstacles or other features
    of interest may not be stored in the static map available at the mission’s start.
    (iii) Static versus dynamic path planning. Whereas the path generation procedure
    is mostly static (decided at the ground level prior to the flight), novel information
    is sometimes used to update the path. As noted in [19], predefined routes are
    dangerous as any un-modeled disturbance can greatly impact the performance. Thus,
    more advanced schemes account for obstacle and collision avoidance (i.e., sense
    and avoidance strategies [46,49]) and even for online path reconfiguration [24].
    E.g., the authors adjust the path by considering both static requirements (accounting
    for borders as it has to stay in a safe lane) and dynamics requirements (counteracting
    wind gusts and avoiding regions, which are already sprayed, based on information
    sent by the ground sensors). 3.3.1. Limitations in Path Generation and Tracking
    Separately, we might consider the various restrictions that affect the path planning
    procedure. These range from geometric, energy-based, internal dynamics to communication
    restrictions (or a combination of them). (i) Geometric restrictions. Due to the
    inherent difficulty in solving a generic motion planning procedure some authors
    impose artificial limitations in the types of paths that may result (thus simplifying
    the planning procedure). Most commonly, this means limiting the possible orientations
    of the mobile agent (the UAV) along its path. In [15] the authors consider data
    collection in a harsh-undulating terrain with the base station located far from
    the sensing region and the way-point selection is simplified by allowing only
    forward and axial flight (movements across a rectangle-shaped region where the
    cluster heads are positioned in rows and columns). A similar approach is followed
    in [16], which proposes a grid division algorithm. [17] forces strip-based and
    zig-zag paths. Authors in [49] go further by imposing the avoidance of predefined
    regions. Somewhat differently [18] groups the sensors in concentric shells and
    maps a spiral path passing between them. If the monitoring zones have obstacles
    or interdicted regions, then they must be circumvented on the basis of a predetermined
    trajectory, if the obstacles are fixed [1], or recalculated, if the obstacles
    are not known in advance or are mobile [46]. (ii) Energy-based restrictions. In
    [19], a mobile sink routing algorithm is used to compute the energy expenditure
    and distances within the WSN (further used in the generation of an optimal path
    for a single mobile sink). [20] proceeds similarly by limiting energy consumption
    (both due to trajectory and communication requirements). Noteworthy, [20] considers
    multiple GDTs to ensure telemetry with the UAV and [21] assumes limited buffer
    capacity for the WSN’s sensors and solves simultaneously the path generation problem
    and gives the multi-hop rules within the WSN. The limitations of the mobile agent
    may also influence the network’s structure: too many and too far away clusters
    may be impossible to reach in a single flight by the UAV (due to fuel limitations)
    [15]. This leads to formulations where, for a given flight time and/or available
    energy budget, the optimal path which passes through the largest number of sensors
    is computed [17]. Other performance criteria may be employed, e.g., [50] considers
    a “total flying score”, which combines multiple factors in the path planning procedure.
    (iii) Internal dynamics restrictions. In many small to medium scale applications
    (e.g., in precision agriculture—sensing weather and soil conditions; pest and
    weeds management; animal attacks and crop morphology) [22,23] the UAVs employed
    are quad (or multi) rotor UAVs. Large scale applications (e.g., pesticide spraying
    [24], crop monitoring, etc.) are mostly handled by fixed-wing UAVs. The former
    can track complex trajectories (where both position and yaw angle are controllable
    outputs) and the later are usually limited to a constant-height flight plane (where
    the velocity and heading angle are controlled). Overall, fixed-wing UAVs have
    higher cruising speed and longer operation time whereas rotor UAVs are more flexible
    and require less maintenance but have lower autonomy. Some common drawbacks affect
    all trajectory procedures. Foremost among these are wind gusts [22] and position
    measurement errors (e.g., location through GPS is imprecise; dead reckoning is
    time-sensitive). (iv) Communication restrictions. When the field contains many
    obstacles, the communication link may be weakened or lost as a result of signal
    attenuation [25]. Almost all the surveyed papers consider a necessary time for
    data transmission at the cluster head; they mostly dispense with it by assuming
    VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) UAVs (mini-helicopters or, more commonly,
    quadcopters), which can hover indefinitely. To ensure that the mobile agent is
    within the cluster head communication range until all the information from that
    fixed agent is retrieved imposes additional restrictions. These may be implemented
    either explicitly by computing the time in which the UAV lies within the communication
    radius of the cluster head [20] or implicitly by proposing a path guaranteed to
    spend enough time in the neighborhood (e.g., via loitering [51] or hovering [22]).
    3.3.2. Waypoint Selection, Ordering and Passing Through Computing a trajectory
    most often reduces to finding an ordered collection of waypoints through whose
    neighborhood the UAV has to pass [22]. This neglects the internal dynamics of
    the UAV agent (the trajectory is simply a union of segments that link consecutive
    waypoints) but is a reasonable assumption in most cases and is justified by the
    fact that most (if not all) commercially or academically available autopilots
    (the ensemble of software that ensures path tracking) expects a list of waypoints
    as input. This simplification becomes less defensible on smaller distances where
    the UAV agent dynamics become significant (e.g., the turn radius cannot be ignored).
    Applying both geometrical/energy-based on one hand and communication restrictions
    on the other hand is challenging. Thus, many works first consider only geometrical/energy-based
    restrictions, which give an unordered list of waypoints and later apply communication
    restrictions to decide in which order should the UAV agent cover the waypoints.
    The ordering may be decided online as in [15] where the next way-point is determined
    by analyzing the information provided by the existing nodes (the closest, still
    not visited node, is chosen). However, most papers consider variations of the
    TSP for finding an optimal route among the waypoints [19]. A more complex representation
    appears in [24], which considers a second pass through (some) of the waypoints
    if there are still areas uncovered from the first pass. Noteworthy, the schemes
    encountered consider mostly a single UAV agent. Those that have multiple UAV (hence
    a multi-agent UAV subsystem within the larger, heterogenous, multi-agent system
    of WSN plus UAVs) usually partition the tasks a priori such that each of the UAVs
    functions independently of the others [27]. Simply passing through a way-point
    or through its neighborhood is almost never sufficient. Most applications require
    a hovering time (such that there is enough time to gather the required information).
    In such cases, the distinction between multi-rotor and fixed-wing UAVs becomes
    significant: the former can hover easily and for an arbitrary amount of time whereas
    the later have to enter a so-called loitering mode [51] in which they orbit around
    the current way-point (the minimum radius depends on the UAV characteristics).
    Some papers consider an explicit communication range when imposing hovering conditions
    [17,20]. In conclusion, the path generation procedure is affected by multiple
    restrictions and must consider several aspects: - properties of the WSN: is sensor
    localization required or available [1]; the size of the WSN area; data collection
    from sensors, sensors activity monitoring relay function [52] and energy loading
    by radiation [44]; - characteristics of the used UAV agent: available energy,
    type (rotary or fixed wing); type of antenna and speed; - characteristics of the
    environment: if there are obstacles or the application is in open field; the availability
    of ground base-stations along the entire path. Table 1 summarizes which of these
    topics were addressed simultaneously in different papers. Table 1. Path planning
    for UAV–WSN systems. 3.3.3. Computational Aspects The path generation is a complex
    procedure due to the nonlinear nature of the UAV dynamics and the various operational
    constraints (waypoint passing, line-of-sight communication, collision avoidance,
    etc.). All these elements lead, in its more general form, to a nonlinear (in cost
    and constraints) constrained optimization problem, which is often impractical
    to solve. Even a relatively simple requirement as ensuring hovering at the waypoint
    leads to a mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP) formulation [15]. The usual
    solution is to simplify the motion planning procedure. This may happen either
    at a conceptual level by imposing a limitation that lead to a manageable formulation
    or by solving the ‘hard’ problem heuristically through algorithms providing sub-optimal
    but fast solutions. The former means considering limitations on the types of paths
    taken by an UAV (spirals [18]; zig-zags [17], etc.). The later approach is concerned
    with problem reformulations and the application of heuristic algorithms. Even
    when mixed-integer (MI) formulations appear explicitly, they are often solved
    heuristically as in [28], which ensures obstacle avoidance through a MI formulation
    solved by a genetic algorithm. Xu et al. [20] also employs binary variables to
    check whether the UAV is in contact with a given sensor and relaxes the formulation
    through time allocation tactics and pre-scheduled GDT usage. When obstacle avoidance
    is considered, rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) and optimal RRT (RRT*) algorithms
    are often the preferred method [46]. Among the heuristic algorithms used we may
    mention: iterative genetic algorithms (GA) [22]; ant colony optimization (ACO)
    [53] for AMR (automatic meter reading); fast path planning with rules (FPPWR)
    [16,18]; potential field methods [54] and greedy algorithms [17]. Note that all
    such heuristic methods have (in varying degrees and with varying compromises)
    common qualities and defects. On the one side they provide quick and near-optimal
    solutions (sometimes orders of magnitude faster than exact optimizations) but
    on the other side lack robustness guarantees and may become stuck into local minima
    (and thus, fail in solving optimally the problem). It is important to note that
    only a few of the surveyed papers validate their results on experimental benchmarks
    [47,48,50]. Most of them limit themselves to simulated environments instead. Moreover,
    most papers do not consider obstacle avoidance issues. None of the reviewed papers
    addressed simultaneously path design with obstacle avoidance in a real environment.
    Table 1 summarizes the important aspects of paths generation in UAV–WSN systems.
    3.4. Data Acquisition As one of the core functions of the integrated UAV–WSN monitoring
    systems, data acquisition is concerned with the correct and timely collection
    of ground level measurements and their propagation through the network hierarchy.
    This is implemented in various ways, mainly by using the UAV platform as a collection
    agent for the lower level sensors. Key technical challenges for UAV–WSN data acquisition
    concern the aggregation at the ground clusters and the frequency and route for
    the data collection based on the design decisions at the system level and the
    optimization problem formulation. The main advantage for using UAVs as mobile
    sinks is that WSN nodes can reduce energy consumption by reducing the need for
    networking overhead at the local level with functions such as discovery, connectivity
    and maintenance of routing tables being maintained by the UAV/mobile sink, which
    periodically updates the cluster nodes with the required information for packet
    transmissions. In many cases the UAVs were considered as relays for receiving
    signals from CHs or other UAVs and then retransmitting the signal to the GCS.
    The most important requirements in data acquisition in the integrated UAV–WSN
    systems are the energy efficiency (primarily to maintain the energy capacity of
    sensory nodes and, secondly, to increase the UAV coverage area), the accuracy
    and the time of data acquisition. Performance analysis for WSN with UAV support
    is carried out by [63]. The UAV play the role of mobile sink across clusters of
    ground sensor networks. A spectrum allocation scheme is modeled in order to achieve
    robust communication with concurrent transmissions from the WSN and/or multiple
    UAVs. The data transmission capacity at the node and network levels is analyzed.
    Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare theoretical per-node capacity
    and UAV working time models to varying parameters. The per-node capacity is defined
    in terms of the interval time between the collection of accumulated ground data.
    The multi-UAV scenario assumes a returning path to avoid collisions of packet
    transmissions between adjacent UAVs. The routing of the UAV is based on pre-defined
    ground cells, which hosts groups of sensor nodes and the optimal number of cells
    can be identified that maximize the per-node capacity of the WSN thus improving
    the overall data collection procedure. The usage of UAV platforms to support mobile
    devices is underlined in [17] as a promising solution for infrastructure less
    integration. In this context infrastructure, less integration is defined such
    that the ground sensors are deployed independently and they only communicate directly
    with the UAV, without local interactions that requires a pre-established network
    structure, cluster heads or additional base stations. The main approach aims to
    minimize overall system energy consumption (mobile devices + UAV) under typical
    real-world constraints for resource allocation, UAV flying path and computation
    offloading. The solution to the non-convex formulated optimization problem is
    presented by means of decomposition into manageable subproblems. The computational
    status at the mobile device level is analyzed by simulations in conjunction with
    the UAV path planning for task offloading on a slot by slot basis. The metrics
    against which the optimization scheme is analyzed are related to the average energy
    consumption of the mobile devices and UAV per slot, only the average energy consumption
    of the mobile devices or only of the UAVs, expressed under predetermined simulation
    conditions. Several scenarios are studies where the UAV flying path is closer
    to the mobile devices to provide high channel quality and computational offloading
    resources thereby reducing the local task queue length to be processed. The impact
    of UAV mobility patterns on the quality of the data collection for ground sensor
    nodes is analyzed by [64]. Initial sweep flights at different altitude levels
    are performed over the area of interest to discover and enable the sensor network.
    Four mobility patterns are subsequently defined as: tractor, angular, square and
    circular patterns. Simulations based on these are implemented in OMNET++ and MiXiM
    frameworks for IEEE 802.15.4 compliant wireless sensor nodes. The number of clusters
    formed, and implicitly associated CHs are reported under static ground simulation
    conditions and variation of the UAV altitude. The metrics used for evaluation
    include the overall coverage by the UAV, time efficiency and utilization, time
    versus coverage efficiency. The results can be used for preselection of a mobility
    pattern for the UAV upon mission configuration while selecting the ground clustering
    mechanisms based on this. The main use cases for symbiosis between UAV and wireless
    networks relevant to the study are related to providing IoT uplink connections
    in an energy efficient manner with reliability as well as support for disseminating
    information and connectivity enhancement [65]. The UAV is able to access the WSN/IoT
    ground network directly or by means of a machine-to-machine (M2M) dedicated gateway
    and further integrate with new 5G IoT services in various industry verticals.
    The types of communication protocols that can support such hybrid systems are
    classified into: proactive protocols, reactive protocols and geographic protocols
    where the design trade-offs between metrics such as latency, coverage, energy-efficiency,
    etc. are known and established beforehand in the system design phase. Security
    and privacy also play a critical role in ensuring that proper safeguard for in-network
    information collection is in place. The authors of [66] focus on the clustering
    methods for the ground sensor nodes in a single UAV scenario for environmental
    monitoring and data gathering. The energy model for the sensor nodes is composed
    of the energy needed for packet reporting and for packet forwarding in the case
    of mesh networks where each node can serve as a router for neighbor packets towards
    the sink. UAV path planning uses the 2-opt heuristic, which is a local search
    algorithm to solve TSP for visiting the WSN clusters. The evaluation consists
    of a 100 m × 100 m grid with 200 randomly deployed nodes according to the random
    Poisson point process. Nodes are modeled with cc2420 family radio interfaces and
    for the UAV the characteristics of the DJI Phantom 3 drone are used. Optimization
    problem is solved using the CPLEX solver. Results plot the energy consumption
    of the UAV and of the sensors versus the maximum number of hops in the network.
    Optimizing for UAV flight time reduction in data collection missions that support
    ground sensor networks is discussed by [67]. The scenario assumes controlled deployment
    of the WSN in a straight line with cruising or hovering behavior from the UAV.
    The aim is to achieve optimal, non-overlapping, data collection intervals, UAV
    speed and sensor transmit power by using a dynamic programming (DP) approach.
    The main finding highlights how the UAV speed should be proportional to the energy
    levels of the sensors and the inter-sensor distance. Several scenarios are defined
    for evaluation under randomness assumptions for data requirements, energy and
    localization of the ground nodes. While cruising, it has been found that even
    if the data rate of the nodes decreases, the reduction in the mission time is
    able to compensate for this in comparison to hovering. This is applicable to low
    amounts of data, whereas, beyond a certain threshold, the hovering approach is
    preferable. The problem is framed as an aerial data collection problem (ADCP)
    with increased complexity given the fact that a set of UAVs is tasked to collect
    information from mobile ground sensor nodes [68]. ADCP is solved optimally for
    small instances using mixed-integer linear programming. Collected data is relayed
    back to the central base station using multi-hop aerial communication links over
    the set of UAVs in a multi-tier network architecture. Simulations are carried
    out by means of a custom implementation using the JGraphT library and IBM CPLEX
    solver for the optimization part. Computational test results and scalability results
    are presented with various UAV and WSN sizes and deployments. Suitability of the
    approach for real wildlife application is foreseen. A heuristic pricing scheme
    shows promise to solve efficiently the ADCP formulation in the defined 3D-positions
    of the targets while accounting for mobility and connectivity variations. Data
    Mule Scenario for Data Acquisition Data mulling concerns the effective creation
    of a communication link between disparate network subsets by usage of a mobile
    node. This helps create a data bridge among clusters and earlier works discussed
    the implementation of data mules by means of mobile robots. In [69] the optimization
    of the shortest data mule path is carried out by an improved clustering-based
    genetic algorithm, which enhances the travelling salesman problem with neighborhoods.
    For larger geographical distances where a ground robot solution is unfeasible,
    UAV-based systems have been integrated [70]. Although in most of cases the communication
    between WSN and UAV is unidirectional, authors from [71] proposed dual stack single
    radio architecture, which allows a UAV to communicate in a bidirectional manner
    with a WSN (UAV-to-WSN and UAV-to-Sink). It is used a single radio transmitter
    both for collecting data from the WSN and for sending telemetry data to a Base
    Station. The GrubiX Wireless network simulator has been used to comparatively
    present the results of two optimization heuristics for path planning, namely the
    Euclidean travelling salesman problem (ETSP) and a modified version with cluster
    selection rounds. For radio link modeling the IEEE 802.11b standard has been selected
    in ideal propagation medium with 50 m communication range. The scenario in which
    the UAV is used as a data acquisition mule among clusters of separated ground
    sensors is handled as a specific use case of distributed data acquisition in collaborative
    UAV–WSN systems. The data mule scenario is graphically depicted in Figure 5. The
    interaction is handled at the CH level (blue node) by using an interoperable radio
    interface on-board the UAV. This is specified according to the data type and size
    that is to be collected, while considering the flight characteristics of the UAV.
    Optional satellite-enabled communication support can be integrated in order to
    provide synchronization services to multiple-UAV teams operating in remote areas.
    Figure 5. UAV data mule scenario among clusters of heterogeneous ground WSNs.
    3.5. Data Processing In many application scenarios, relaying the raw collected
    data from the local sensors to the central aggregation point of the integrated
    system poses a considerable burden on the computing and communication resources.
    In these cases, some form of processing is necessary to compress, reduce or intelligently
    extract information from the sensor measurements. The analyzed articles propose
    a wide range of methods: from basic processing (min/max thresholding, averaging
    and basic statistical features) to higher level distributed approaches such as
    fog computing. The authors of [72] point out the key areas of active research
    for data aggregation within IoT systems of which WSNs are a core building block.
    The potential for increasing the energy efficiency of the network through clustering
    mechanisms for data aggregation is acknowledged alongside tree-based and centralized
    approaches. The respective trade-offs for each family of methods are identified
    in terms of advantages and drawbacks concerning energy, traffic load, accuracy,
    security, scalability and fault tolerance. Depending on the constraints of the
    application of the UAV–WSN collaborative network, a suitable aggregation method
    will be employed. This is determined by the streaming or event-based nature of
    data generation, as well as latency and energy constraints. Clustering approaches
    are generally more robust than centralized schemes, which have a single point
    of failure, with the added complexity of managing and organizing clustering hierarchies.
    Fog computing supporting and UAV–WSN deployments are discussed by [73] in which
    the UAV plays the role of the fog node and provides services to the hierarchical
    ground sensor network. The services include data collection and relaying, local
    processing and cloud interfacing. Several relevant use cases are identified ranging
    from ground pipeline monitoring and control to underwater monitoring, large scale
    emergency response and military deployments. An evaluation is carried out by comparing
    the performance of local and cloud service calls in various network configurations.
    The resource discovery and integration are also enabled through the UAV fog node
    with additional benefits stemming from the inherent mobility of the UAV in assisting
    the ground level devices. Security functions are also available on the fog level
    with application-based protection levels. The fog computing paradigm applied to
    UAV-based large-scale monitoring systems is analyzed, which assumes that the path
    planning, flight coordination and task planning are carried out locally at the
    fog coordinator level [74]. This is reflected in comparison to the usage of a
    cloud platform, which potentially offers more computing resources and knowledge
    with increased data and command latency. A system model is provided for the throughput,
    power consumption and latency analysis with multimedia data over various mobile
    communication technologies such as GSM, UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    Service) and HSPA(+) (High Speed Packet Access). A single UAV is denoted as fog
    coordinator and it decides on the trade-off between local processing and cloud
    offloading of the data streams and planning tasks, based on a genetic algorithm
    optimization method with implementation in MATLAB. The end-user application can
    be considered as an UAV–WSN collaborative monitoring scenario in which the fog
    computing approach is deployed at the higher UAV ground control station (GCS)
    level. Cloud-based support infrastructure for UAV–WSN mixed data collection platforms
    are introduced. It is argued that the increased availability of cloud resources
    can contribute to the improvement in the flying parameters and information extraction
    from the WSN data [50]. Emerging ground level events are classified according
    to predefined priority levels and the flying sequence is determined by considering
    several correlation factors at the node and cluster levels. Results are evaluated
    both in simulation and through experiments on an integrated testbed using a quadcopter
    UAV and CC2530 2.4 GHz radio sensor nodes with on-board GPS capabilities. The
    proposed method, denoted as cloud-assisted and weight event data collection (CWC),
    is compared (in a simulation framework) to a full collection method (FCM), event
    collection method (ECA) and event collection method with priority (ECP). CWC performs
    well in terms of reducing the flight time and distance as well as assuring a 97%
    data integrity compared to 60%, 63% and 26% for ECA, ECP and FCM respectively.
    Data integrity is defined in terms of the sum of the total received messages compared
    to the total messages. UAV-enabled WSN data aggregation is described by [59] in
    which the UAV platforms act as data mules between the CHs of the network. The
    routing optimization is based on genetic algorithms (GA). Energy consumption of
    data transmission based on a standard energy-per-bit transmission model is used
    as minimization objective. The OmNET++ simulation environment is also used to
    deploy a modeling scenario of the proposed approach. The evaluation is with reference
    to three other protocols: centre-based, greedy-based and clustering-based genetic
    algorithm (CBGA) and achieves an improvement in terms of system-wide energy consumption
    of 1–28.4%. This is due to the fact that the cluster member energy expenditure
    becomes an explicit optimization objective. Shorter data update periods are also
    listed as a secondary benefit of the approach. The challenge of information fusion
    for collected sensor data from both fixed and mobile devices is illustrated in
    [75]. The application focuses on deep supervised learning in transportation systems
    by integrating GPS, GNSS and accelerometer readings with remote sensed imagery.
    The solution covers both the management of the large data quantities as well as
    analytics for pre-processing and feature extraction. Evaluation analysis is performed
    for a transportation mode recognition task when various data sources are considered,
    and the best accuracy is at 97% for the combination of GPS + accelerometer + GIS
    data. The work is relevant also to the large-scale hybrid UAV–WSN monitoring systems
    for distributing the pre-processing and feature extraction modules across the
    nodes of the network and re-tasking in accordance to the mission objectives. At
    the ground sensor level, distributed agreement schemes such as consensus algorithms
    can contribute toward intelligent data reduction and reducing the burden on the
    upper UAV layers for processing and transmissions [76]. For event detection where
    the integrated system has to assure the timely observation of mission-specific
    events, local analysis can improve the overall detection latency. In this manner
    each of the ground sensors periodically communicates their findings with neighboring
    nodes in order to reach a joint decision, such as the event present: yes or no,
    in as few as possible communication instances as possible. The weighting scheme
    accounts for the quality of the data as well as the reliability of the information
    provided by each node. Implementing consensus local decision algorithms in large
    scale UAV–WSN monitoring systems can help increase the reliability and robustness
    of the overall system. In Table 2 some characteristics of the joint data acquisition
    and processing aspects of collaborative UAV–WSN systems are presented. Table 2.
    Data acquisition and processing in integrated UAV–WSN systems. 4. Data Communication
    Data communication performs the critical integration function of UAV–WSN large-scale
    monitoring systems. The various protocols, standards and physical interfaces have
    to be interoperable and tuned for adjusting the system performance to the (dynamic)
    mission objectives. As previously illustrated in Figure 1, these can range from
    low-power and low-range radio communication at the ground level, to higher throughput
    radio links for data streaming, complemented by satellite communication. Though
    implementation it is mostly wireless also, wired links can serve as a data communication
    backhaul for the integrated system. 4.1. Requirements and Protocols As a preliminary
    step in operational deployment of integrated UAV–WSN monitoring systems, the deployment
    strategy of the ground sensor nodes can be considered [83]. DeVForce-AP algorithm
    is presented, which allows the elimination of coverage gaps in the ground network
    by means of Delaunay triangulation together with DeVForce for maintaining network
    connectivity. Parameter adjustment is realized to account for environmental factors.
    The method evaluation is presented in relation to random deployment, traditional
    Delaunay triangulation and virtual force deployment. The new method presents an
    improvement in the data transmission success rate, the number of alive sensor
    nodes and the number of available neighbor nodes. It is also able to maintain
    coverage ratio and increased network lifetime under varying environment conditions
    and obstacles. The trade-off between storing and transmitting WSN ground level
    data is discussed by [44]. The UAV acts as a mobile base station for the network
    with a novel scenario in which it harbors an energy harvesting module and wireless
    recharging for the ground nodes. Energy harvesting is based on RF signal energy
    extraction where part of the received signal is used for this and part for standard
    data collection while hovering over a CH. Based on information collected from
    the nodes, the UAV schedules appropriately the battery charging and data gathering.
    Visiting the nodes is based on a variant of the travelling salesman problem (TSP)
    with time windows: shortest travelling time trajectory (STTT). The model used
    for the battery level of a WSN node is a birth–death process based on the observed
    activity rates in terms of data sensing and transmissions. The system designed
    for an IoT surveillance application is presented by [84] and is based on visual
    ground sensor network with security cameras, patrolling drones and unmanned ground
    vehicles. The integration and the data and command flows are detailed using open
    IoT protocols such as MQTT and publish–subscribe data architectures. Performance
    of the combined system is evaluated based on object detection time under varying
    number of frames. The edge computing approach offers a considerable improvement
    over conventional cloud implementation in terms of measured detection latency.
    The scalability test shows how the integrated surveillance system performs under
    increased device numbers. The system provides a blueprint for our reference UAV–WSN
    large-scale monitoring scenario by implementing a decentralized solution based
    on the edge and mist computing paradigms. Paper [85] focuses on the hierarchical
    system architecture design for hybrid UAV–WSN monitoring systems. It includes
    a central gateway system that coordinates the UAV platforms within the aerial
    level, followed by the distributed ground sensor systems for monitored parameters
    data collection on the ground. In addition, a binary sensor level can be also
    added in tight connection to the WSN and without local processing elements. A
    clustering mechanism is implemented and evaluated under the Contiki embedded operating
    system for resource constrained devices, which considers radio link indicators
    such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and link quality indicator (LQI)
    for selecting the cluster heads. Static overpass UAV paths are simulated to obtain
    in clustering behavior of the WSN using Rime broadcast and unicast messages from
    the nodes. An application of the proposed clustering mechanism shows improvement
    in data collection and distributed agreement for physical measurements. Authors
    in [86] present a coordination approach for multiple aerial ad-hoc systems integrated
    with ground systems in order to bridge various configuration options and network
    dynamics. Their main contribution considers the application of fuzzy bee colony
    optimization (fBCO) to implement cognitive relaying within the network. Mapping
    the network structure onto the optimization problem formulation considers the
    ground nodes serve as employed bees while the aerial nodes act as scout bees.
    The proposed model is evaluated against several existing approaches such as path-aware
    geographical routing (TAG), energy-balancing packet scheduling (EPLA) and greedy
    selection (GS), with 10 UAVs and 10–50 ground nodes. The metrics used relate to
    average transfer time, network efficiency, average cognitive overheads and convergence
    time. It is argued that the new fBCO offers improved scalability, lower transfer
    times and lower cognitive overheads. The optimization problem for UAV–WSN data
    acquisition is discussed in [51] considering the main objectives for cluster head
    selection, realistic models of bit error rate (BER), node energy and flight time
    of the UAV, including weather effects. The proposed method is compared with the
    established LEACH-C (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering. Hierarchy-centralized) for
    WSN clustering and data collection. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used
    for the multi-objective method, while prioritizing the average BER over energy
    consumption and travel time, to assure reliable connectivity. Various cluster
    sizes are analyzed, and it is found that PSO outperforms LEACH-C in terms of the
    remaining live nodes after several hundred rounds of simulations. Relative weighting
    of the objectives depends on particular system and mission objectives as well
    as practical judgment. As an example, reducing travelling time can be related
    to the operational cost of the UAV and support infrastructure and limited flight
    autonomy. 4.2. Standardisation and Safety Considerations One of the most sensitive
    and restrictive issues of UAV–WSN’s integrated systems is flight safety, in terms
    of the security of people, land and of airspace objectives. There are several
    sources providing a comprehensive overview of UAV flight regulations, implementation
    status and forecast. A reliable source of information regarding UAV development,
    e.g., the Global Drone Regulations Database [87], is providing the interested
    researchers with free access to accurate description of applicable regulations
    in each country and standards aiming to minimize the implication in the civilian
    air traffic operations. Various studies like [88] compared the documents meant
    to regulate the UAV operations and concluded that there is no general approach
    of the conditions, UAV classification or standards. Therefore, reviewing the scientific
    literature presenting the characteristics considered by various countries enabled
    the authors to have realistic predictions of future trends. Recently, the EASA
    established (in February 2019) the regulation, which enables the circulation of
    UAVs within the EU based on security and on increasing development of the UAV
    industry [89]. Since there are different sizes of drones (from 10 g to 10 tones),
    flight levels and path lengths, three categories of UAVs have been identified
    for which specific flight rules have been established: (a) the ‘open’ category
    (below 120 m level, 500 m distance—line-of-sight, and does not require a prior
    authorization), (b) the ‘specific’ category (requires an authorization by the
    competent national authority) and (c) the ‘certified’ category (requires the certification
    of the UAS, a licensed remote pilot and an operator approved by the competent
    authority). According to EASA, the UAVs should be safety integrated into the existing
    aviation context in a proportionate way. For long-distance applications, in which
    UAVs are flying beyond the line-of-sight, a very strict regulatory framework needs
    to be adopted so the UAV’s tracking system provides proper support for a safe
    operation of the remote command and control, telemetry communication and datalink
    transmission. The main challenge for the experts of this sector is to determine
    how to calculate the spectrum demands that most likely need to be harmonized between
    several entities that will share the same portions of spectrum while ensuring
    a safe and secure interconnectivity with terrestrial WSN for complex air-ground
    hybrid networks. Some organizations are involved in the implementation of the
    best strategy towards the usage of the spectrum dedicated to interconnect the
    UAVS and terrestrial WSNs into hybrid networks and, at the same time, to ensure
    a safe airspace sharing with aircrafts: International Civil Aviation Organization
    (ICAO), EASA, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS), International
    Telecommunications Union (ITU), etc. In multi agent UAV–WSN applications, communications
    between agents (UAV–UAV, UAV–WSN and WSN–WSN are mandatory. Although communication
    within UAV network or within WSN was not the subject of this paper (only communications
    between UAV–WSN), some clarifications need to be made regarding UAV–UAV communications.
    Two solutions can be used for UAV to UAV communication (U2U): direct communication
    [90] and via GCS (GCS as relay) communication [91]. Direct U2U communication is,
    on one hand, a difficult problem to solve in terms of frequency regulations versus
    airspace security and, on the other hand, it is a necessary solution in some applications
    of a swarm UAVs (examples: collision avoidance, operations of search and rescue).
    The authors in [90] analyzed the throughput and latency of the UHF (ultra-high
    frequency) radio link, which interconnect two UAVs. The advantages, disadvantages
    and important concerns for the U2U communication options are also presented. The
    indirect communication is presented in more research and application papers. Thus,
    in [91] the GCS is presented as a relay in a configuration UAV–GCS–UAV system
    by using commercially available hardware (Wi-Fi) components combined with customized
    software. In [92] UAV to UAV communication for smart agriculture monitoring is
    presented using the ad-hoc WiFi infrastructure. The first UAV serves as a relay
    between the second UAV and GCS, improving the UAV communication in beyond line-of-sight
    and cross-obstacle operations. The authors present experimental results for various
    conditions and configurations while implementing the OLSR (optimized link state
    routing protocol) protocol for increasing the quality of service of the network
    links. Paper [93] extends this study using RTSP and RTP protocols and in-depth
    packet and bandwidth analysis for both the video processing pipeline and control
    functions. The reference UAV type is a quad copter AR drone. The average bandwidth
    for the UAV system is measured at 15.4 Mbps compared to a pc-only system at 10.91
    Mbps. Georeferencing the target area enables precise application of herbicides
    leading to improved cost-effective productivity. Reference [94] provides a practical
    assessment of 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz UAV communication in emergency response settings.
    A dedicated system infrastructure is illustrated with GPS, embedded PCs and software
    components that support the latency constrained operations. A summary of the UAV–WSN
    communication characteristics is given in the Table 3. Table 3. Data communication
    in integrated UAV–WSN systems. 5. Integrated UAV–WSN System Implementation There
    have been observed many options for system implementation over the recent years
    of development. Many research groups first validate their conceptual approaches
    using simulation and emulation environments where the main components and their
    interactions are modeled in software. Going from model to real world implementation,
    the ground sensor node platforms are selected based on their on-board sensors,
    computing capabilities and communication interfaces. The main options for the
    UAV platform related to its type: fixed/rotary wing, autonomy, communication interface
    and other complex sensing systems, which are not suitable for ground implementation,
    such as high resolution and special application imaging. Early work in the field
    of integrated robotic aerial platforms and ground based sensor networks for security
    applications is presented in [31]. The data processing is organized on three hierarchical
    levels ranging from target detection, localization and recognition. The ad-hoc
    nature of the ground sensor network is emphasized as well as the application of
    intelligent software agents that are able to collaborate for joint mission objectives.
    The decreasing cost of the hardware platforms also needed to achieve such a system
    is underlined as an element driving the development of pervasive sensing in large
    scale monitoring. Adaptive parameterization at both the UAV and the WSN levels
    enables the system to be robust to environment or mission changes while ensuring
    proper quality of service with energy efficiency and communication reliability.
    The combination of low-cost sensors on the ground and high-performance, high-cost
    sensors on-board UAV sensors allows for data fusion algorithms that can extract
    relevant information in an online fashion. Low latency operation requirements
    and dynamic reconfigurable network topology are identified as key challenges in
    the design of suitable architectures and algorithms for UAV–WSN joint cooperation
    [99]. Low-latency routing algorithm (LLRA) is proposed and evaluated for such
    scenarios in terms of link average delay and packet delivery ratio. It assumes
    an iterative process to identify the best relay nodes across the network with
    periodic route updates. This assures connectivity and achieving the minimum transmission
    delay. The simulation setup includes a layered UAV network with established parameters
    for directional antenna angle, transmission power, UAV speed and inter-layer separation
    distance under fixed radio channel assumptions. The interlayer performance of
    the algorithm is reported favorably with reference to standard routing procedures
    such as ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and greedy perimeter stateless
    routing (GPSR). Bio-inspired optimization heuristics are applied to collaborative
    UAV–WSN networks in order to maximize the value of the gathered information from
    the ground level while minimizing UAV operational costs [61]. With the ground
    situation known in terms of sensing cells and flying constraints, the authors
    define four utility functions for the UAV to maximize, in terms of sensing, energy,
    time and risk. The solution to the optimization problem is achieved using a combination
    of genetic algorithms (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO). The best parametrization
    of the method is achieved while accounting for an additional metric in terms of
    value of sensor information (VSI) for planning of the flying route among sensing
    information gathering (SIG) ground cells. The GA and ACO approach also present
    significantly better results when compared to a classical A* bio inspired algorithm
    and a combination of A* and GA in terms of the optimal utility value. A priority-based
    frame selection scheme within IEEE 802.11 MAC (Medium Access Control) packets
    is introduced in [100] to mitigate the effect of packet collisions on the overall
    UAV-assisted WSN network. This operates by assigning a lower contention window
    range to the higher priority frames. The proposed model assumes the operational
    characteristics of a fixed-wing UAV in which frames, which are overpassed by the
    UAV, receive higher priority thus reducing the risk of a data-less overpass. Three
    algorithms are defined and analyzed as contributions: priority-based optimized
    frame collection (POFS), priority-based contention window adjustment scheme (PCWAS)
    and frame selection-based routing protocol (FSRP). The evaluation presented highlights
    the performance metrics of the proposed scheme in relation to the conventional
    IEEE 802.11 CSMA/CA MAC in terms of average throughput, end-to-end delay, PDR.
    Implementation is carried out in MATLAB for a 300 sqm area with variable number
    of sensor nodes between 100–1000. By including UAV data mule mobility into the
    prioritization of the communication protocol improved results can be obtained.
    The models of UAV–WSN communication integration and data collection are reviewed
    in [101] for hierarchical, clustered WSNs where the UAV is tasked at visiting
    each cluster head in an efficient manner to collect the ground level data. The
    store and forward model are the reference approach in which non-critical data
    accumulates and is aggregated at the cluster head to be made available to the
    visiting UAV. Several critical infrastructure monitoring applications might require
    real-time data streaming or event-based communication, which implies mechanisms
    and performance constraints on the UAV relays. A hybrid method is also identified,
    which can prioritize based on the local processing of the collected data and operate
    the UAV relays in an on-demand fashion. From the UAV routing perspective, a classification
    is defined based on its capabilities: from constant speed UAV, to variable and
    adaptable speed UAV and up to hovering capabilities with either unlimited or maximum
    service times. These have an important impact on the design of the WSN communication
    windows, which are available to the network. The approach from the perspective
    of a collaborative WSN–mUAV network is described for an efficient utilization
    of the network energy resources [102]. The firefly optimization algorithm (FFOA)
    is presented for energy efficient relaying of collected data. Benefits are highlighted
    in terms of continuous connectivity, better network and node lifetime and improved
    coverage. The studied scenarios assume a single base station with the UAV role
    in the system model to relay data efficiently between the field nodes and this
    base station. The optimization procedure selects the best UAV for this based on
    attraction value among the set of eligible UAVs in the range of the data sink–base
    station. For performance evaluation the parameters include the followings: throughput,
    mean hops, packet delivery ratio (PDR), delays, lifetime, coverage and excessive
    iterations per segment. One example of the achieved results is that FFOA for collaborative
    UAV–WSN networks achieves 17.2%, 18.01% and 31.5% better PDR when compared to
    reference methods EEGA, I-ERIDSR and ERIDSR. The authors of [103] discuss the
    issue of optimal wireless sensor network coverage by means of UAV platforms in
    terms of an optimization problem. This is formulated by means of the travelling
    salesman problem (TSP) to find the best routing of the UAV for data collection
    with regard to minimizing the energy needed for data transmission of the sensor
    nodes. The proposed TSP algorithm outperforms particle swarm optimization (PSO)
    for various flying heights, speeds and network sizes. The algorithm is implemented
    in MATLAB and simulations are carried out using the OmNET++ network simulator
    with 802.11b protocol. The reference results for the tested configuration show
    a lower than half total energy consumption at the gateway level when deploying
    BL-TSP as compared to PSO and network forwarding. A multiple UAV test shows how
    the incremental benefits are lower, in terms of cost function decrease, with the
    addition of new UAVs. An emulation platform, which serves for generic IoT scenarios,
    is described by [104]. Main components include the server-side user interface,
    the physical hardware nodes and the virtual nodes, as well as a script interpreter
    to handle their functionalities. The system supports both fixed and mobile nodes
    and the authors present a reference application using Raspberry Pi cards and WiFi
    communication for the networking side. For visualization a 2D mode for network
    analysis is provided alongside a rich 3D environment for more immersive views.
    Implementation is performed using the Java programming language. Running the system
    in simulation followed by integration with real embedded hardware makes it suitable
    also for integrated UAV–WSN systems. The application focus for Smart City deployments
    could be seen as using the ground nodes for environmental sensing with proper
    task planning of the UAV accounting for the 3D environment in data collection.
    The multiagent-based paradigm for developing a highly abstracted simulation model
    in IoT systems is discussed in [96]. It aims for event and data-driven networks
    with flexibility and large variety of nodes in increasing abstraction layers.
    The FABIoT [105] model parameters at the hardware level include the processing
    power of the nodes, configuration types, percentage of smart objects (SO), if
    the nodes are battery-powered or not. The network parameters are the time-to-live
    (TTL) for messages and the ping frequency for the smart objects. Performance is
    measured using the mean query time (MQT) and plan success rate (PSR) over a reference
    system of 50 random network configurations of 40 heterogeneous smart objects.
    Heterogeneity in this case is defined by a mix of hardware and services. Several
    test scenarios are modeled to reflect the metric variation under typical network
    assumptions e.g., performance degradation with a percentage of nodes departing/failing.
    Communication systems perspective for the ground level WSN is discussed in [106]
    when dealing with radio challenges over hybrid MACs for decision fusion. The nodes
    transmit binary non-coherent decisions to the fusion center and the authors analyze
    and prove several efficient methods that implement the decision fusion rule while
    accounting for the limited computing available on the nodes. The proposed hybrid
    MAC provides advantages for detection performance with group size and under low
    SNR conditions. By grouping ground sensors around MAC schemes, in the same sensor
    group non-orthogonal MACs are used. The reference for the optimal fusion is considered
    the likelihood ration (LR) test while three alternatives are developed in order
    to mitigate computational impact: weighted energy detector (WED), deflection–coefficient-
    maximization (DCM) and two-step (TS) rules. Evaluation revolves around the detection
    of a known parameter in Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance and receiver
    operating characteristics (ROC) for various simulation scenarios for the four
    methods are presented. Aspects related to the enabling of power efficient communication
    in WSN with external UAV support are discussed in [107]. A non-convex mixed-integer
    optimization problem is formulated to minimize total power consumption of the
    UAV while at the same time offering performance guarantees to the ground sensor
    nodes for their transmission rate. Block coordinate descent is used for problem
    decomposition into manageable sub problems. Satisfying of the sensor node quality
    of service constraints implies reducing the distance of the UAV to it. The three
    schemes that provide the evaluation imply a power-efficient scheme, propulsion
    efficient scheme compared to a reference circular flight scheme, under consideration
    that the UAV propulsion energy cost is dominant against its transmission energy
    cost generated by initiating or receiving radio communication from the ground
    nodes. In previous work we have presented the design of a collaborative UAV–WSN
    network for environmental large-scale sensing [1]. The main challenges that have
    been tackled relate mostly to the cluster-based self-organization of the ground
    sensor network in conjunction with the discovery and path planning optimization.
    A cluster head selection procedure has been implemented based on the connectivity
    and signal strength levels of each of the ground nodes during the UAV initial
    overpass flight. The optimized paths for improved data collection for the UAVs
    take into account the constraints of the flight zones such as physical obstacles
    and no-fly areas. A cluster-rebalancing scheme is also presented in order to relieve
    and balance the energy and processing burden for the individual ground nodes.
    A realistic testbed composed of an octocopter platform and TelosB-type sensor
    nodes is implemented and deployed to validate the simulation results. A summary
    of the UAV–WSN communication characteristics is given in the Table 4. Table 4.
    Integrated UAV–WSN systems. 6. Applications When addressing specific applications,
    most authors use a UAV as a mobile sink in either small or large scale WSN. Papers
    addressing specific applications usually do not detail data gathering or advanced
    path planning algorithms, but rather how such architectures respond to specific
    challenges and how a specific implementation achieved application objectives in
    a certain use-case. The implemented functions depend on each of the application’s
    objectives. The main applications of integrated UAV–WSN systems are synthesized
    in Table 5. More detailed characteristics of applications in agriculture, environment
    and disaster management are provided in the following subsections. Table 5. Main
    applications of the integrated UAV–WSN systems. 6.1. Agriculture Traditional WSN
    topologies are not suitable for monitoring small, strictly delimited, dispersed
    and isolated parcels, which are commonly found in agriculture applications. WSN
    nodes might also become unreachable as the vegetation becomes denser and performance
    is affected by the variable node elevation. Hovering UAVs were used in real conditions
    for collecting data from cluster nodes in such applications and in [22] reliability
    at different flight heights is evaluated. Di Gennaroa et al. [109] and Primicerio
    [110] proposed the use of micro UAVs equipped with multispectral cameras along
    with WSN meteorological data to evaluate the correlation between grapes quality
    and measured values. In the specific domain of spraying pesticides applications,
    the following challenges were identified: - Some areas might not have the proper
    amount of chemicals, while other might have a higher level; - The efficiency of
    the process is highly influenced by weather conditions; - The chemicals must be
    spread only inside a predefined boundary. The authors in [24,37] developed methods
    for these operations, which use sensor measurement values to change the UAV route.
    The sensors are deployed in a matrix to be able to apply the proposed algorithm.
    A chemicals concentration map is designed using the available sensor data. An
    UAV–WSN–IoT systems in data-driven agriculture is described in [81]. The UAV flight
    planning is done in conjunction to ground level data depending on the specific
    parameters to be collected. Duty cycling is applied as well as a scheme that leverages
    wind speed and orientation to optimize UAV flight time across the fields. UAV
    video feeds are compared against measured sensor values for improving inference
    of specific agriculture events. A prediction model is evaluated for inference
    of precision parameter maps and compared against nearest neighbor (NN) and inverse
    distance-based interpolation schemes. A relevant application in agriculture is
    described by [122]. A 1.9 m wingspan fixed wing Skywalker UAV is used to remotely
    collect ground sensor reading from commercial Xbee nodes deployed in the field.
    The parameters include temperature and humidity from a Rotronic HygtoClip HC2-S
    sensor. The UAV can be equipped with either a normal camera or an infrared camera
    and the on-board embedded control platform of choice is a Raspberry Pi. Field
    trial run results illustrate the autopilot enabled operation of the UAV over the
    target crop while analyzing communication and data collection performance from
    the Xbee node. A salient feature of the integrated system is that the UAV includes
    a small on-board tank for deploying directly fertilizers, herbicides or insecticides
    based on the output of the decision algorithms allowing for fast response to critical
    conditions with a maximum payload of 2 kg. 6.2. Environment In the environmental
    domain the integration of WSN with UAV devices led to the development of new applications,
    rather than increasing efficiency in existing ones, like in agriculture or disaster
    management. They cover various topics for air pollution, underwater or animal
    monitoring. In marine applications, the challenges are given by the difficult
    access to sensor nodes dispersed over extremely large areas. Thus, [10] proposes
    an application where several buoys are deployed in a marine environment, with
    no fixed positions. They collect environmental data like temperature, wind speed,
    pressure and humidity using the LoRa communication protocol. Subsequently, a UAV
    is used as a mobile sink to collect data from these nodes. Tests showed that a
    transmission range of 4 km could be achieved with a data rate of 5.4 kbps. An
    advantage of integrating WSNs and UAVs in air pollution is the capability of obtaining
    a tridimensional sampling of physical phenomena, allowing further analysis and
    prediction of weather impact and/or pollutant propagation over large geographical
    areas. Orestis et al. [112] have proposed the architecture for such an application
    and used a cube map area to model each pollutant. In the case of wild animals
    monitoring, the algorithms chosen for path planning must take into consideration
    their movement over the monitored area. Authors in [80,113] use the metric of
    value of information (VoI) to characterize sections of a grid where animal movement
    was identified as an area where intensive data collection is required. This way,
    the UAV can be directed with priority towards the areas where animals are detected
    and afterwards cover the rest of the network. Monitored information includes the
    picture, sound and odor. 6.3. Disaster Management Disaster management applications
    are characterized by the requirement of operating in harsh environments, where
    data needs to be collected from dynamic WSNs with high reliability taking into
    account the fast reaction requirements. A broad study of UAV solutions for disaster
    management is carried out [115] while considering ground sensor networks that
    are deployed on the premises and are able to leverage efficiently the aerial support.
    The design accounts for four stages of disasters ranging from disaster preparedness,
    assessment, response and recovery. In the first case the system must be optimized
    for data acquisition and collection while using UAVs as a data mule for relaying
    in a reliable manner the information of interest back to a central disaster management
    entity. In the second case, fixed-wing UAVs are employed to scan the affected
    area and identify target zones for more precise evaluation by means of more maneuverable
    rotary wing platforms. For the final stage, more advanced sensors and actuators
    are deployed for improving the successful outcome of the missions. In this situation,
    maximizing the data provided by the WSN becomes a critical factor and the WSN
    can offer support to the UAV platforms. WSN and multi-UAV systems working together
    in disaster management applications are reviewed [123]. The associated wireless
    communication technologies are identified, from low-power Xbee links to various
    types of 802.11 Wi-Fi networks that provide increased bandwidth. The disaster
    management scenarios imply the possibility of dynamic reconfiguration of the roles
    of both the UAV and WSN networks depending on changing priorities in the field.
    These are focused on human-life protection through fast response while integrating
    the data sources that are available by means of intelligent aggregation and fusion
    mechanisms. WSN can be associated also with ground mobility platforms in the form
    of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). Cloud infrastructures are able to support the
    large-scale data processing and optimization needed. The AWARE platform proposed
    in [82], where WSN, BSN and UAV collaborate to gather data from harsh environments
    using both static and mobile sensors, gives a valuable insight on the capabilities
    and leveraged possibilities in this domain. Here UAVs are used as mobile nodes
    and for sensor deployment. The solution is capable to detect emergency events
    and to ensure autonomous network repair and a fast reaction. 6.4. Simulators for
    UAV–WSN Systems The great majority of WSN–UAV interactions are done in simulation
    (comparatively few papers show real-life implementations). The simulations go
    from relatively simple (proof of concept validation done preponderantly in Matlab
    or similar scripting languages) to physics-based simulators, which aim to give
    an accurate representation of the WSN/UAV model in real-life functioning conditions.
    The last category uses popular tools like ROS (robot operating system) for modeling
    a control with simulation done, e.g., in Gazebo [124]. Other options are the flight
    simulator X-Plane [125], or, for the WSN interaction, the COOJA environment [126].
    Note that, as far as we are aware, there is no tool that provides an integrated
    solution (at least not without a fair amount of tweaking) for both WSN and UAVs.
    7. Discussion The motion planning strategies employed in the papers studied for
    this review were mostly of relatively reduced complexity. Whereas the underlying
    optimization problem, which led to them, can be extremely complex, the paths are
    most often given as a sequence of segments linking consecutive waypoints (whose
    position and passing-through time are determined a priori). While the complexity
    issues undoubtedly play a large part in the simplifications usually imposed (e.g.,
    predefined types of paths), we believed that another reason for the current approaches
    is an attitude of “good enough” and “tested and true”. This is defensible in light
    of the currently available hardware resources (the UAV autopilot expects an ordered
    list of waypoints and the hardware itself is too expensive and/or dangerous to
    be tested on unproven strategies). Still, increases in the performance of inertial
    measuring units and the availability of global localization infrastructures (GPS,
    Galileo, etc.) mean that the practitioners can relax some of these constraints
    and propose more aggressive strategies (in the sense of reducing energy costs,
    operation time and the like). Foremost, using realistic UAV dynamics in the motion
    planning procedure will give paths that are more flexible and can still be tracked
    by the autopilot at runtime with increased performance (tighter collision avoidance,
    less conservative energy estimation, reduced operation time, etc.). This is challenging
    from the viewpoint of the planning procedure (as the waypoint selection and subsequent
    ordering can no longer be separated easily but are realistic under the expected
    software and hardware improvements). Another insufficiently treated aspect in
    the state of the art is the path planning in the multi-UAV context. Virtually
    all of the works studied first partition the tasks among the UAVs and then proceed
    to compute their paths independently. While this simplifies the analysis, it is
    conservative since it reduces the UAVs’ flexibility. Thus, computing overlapping
    paths or updating them online will allow a more flexible task allocation and will
    lead to an improved mission outcome. Keeping in mind that future applications
    may work in an urban environment and that increased WSN interactions may require
    a low flight level, obstacle detection and subsequent avoidance as well as line-of-sight
    communication will have greater and greater importance in the path planning procedures.
    This will not only increase the complexity but will also lead to questions about
    safety regulations, reliable functioning (even in the presence of failures) and
    mission performance in a cluttered environment. Overall, we consider that the
    field of motion planning, in the context of UAV–WSN applications, has many avenues
    of evolution and will evolve significantly in the coming years. Figure 6 shows
    the overlapping areas of development in UAV, WSN and IoT systems by means of a
    Venn diagram. The key topics, also elaborated upon in the current articles, are
    highlighted. We consider the integrated heterogeneous monitoring systems that
    represent our focus to lay in the dashed area as illustrated in the figure. This
    represents the collaborative aspects of current UAV research topics such as: complex
    sensing, path planning and control over long distance links, in conjunction with
    typical WSN topics such as ground sensor deployment and coverage for data acquisition,
    energy efficiency and low power radio communication links. In addition, this core
    area is being extended to elements from the IoT domain by enabling the collaborative
    systems to leverage fog computing primitives, embedded data processing and inference
    mechanisms for local decision taking. Figure 6. Research topics overlap in collaborative
    UAV and WSN systems with IoT aspects. Regarding open research questions for integrated
    UAV–WSN systems, the current focus goes beyond optimal communication and data
    acquisition heuristics towards intelligent and adaptive systems. We predicted
    that this would be enabled by designing data and information flows across networks
    that allow distributed and localized inference at the network nodes. By adjusting
    such mechanisms to the specific resources and abilities of the nodes, the local
    decision is enabled. This improves the overall robustness and resilience of the
    large-scale monitoring system, allowing it to adjust to changing process dynamics
    and mission objectives, with minimal latency. An important requirement for this
    vision to be achieved is to make the intermediate gateways transparent at the
    upper levels of the system design in such a way that both low-level (ground) information
    as well as high level (inferred) information is available in both directions.
    Edge machine learning methods and techniques are an increasingly active field
    of study whose results can be successfully assessed in the context of integrated
    UAV–WSN systems. Furthermore, on the communication aspects that enable these collaborative
    systems will need to be integrated into heterogeneous IoT solutions that offer
    seamless bidirectional data and information flows over multiple interfaces and
    network layers. New low power long range radio links such as LoRa or NB-IoT require
    different systems architecture for the design of large area monitoring systems,
    potentially enabling direct sensor to UAV integration. On the other hand, emerging
    technologies such as ultra-wide band (UWB), which enables precise local positioning
    in constrained environments can offer fine grained data to improve WSN–UAV interoperability.
    One common challenge that has emerged from our study was the need for extensive
    scalability evaluations, which should prove the robustness of extended designed
    collaborative solutions. In practice that leads from current solutions with tens
    to hundreds of SNs and single or several UAVs to thousands of SNs and UAV swarms
    in seamless integration at the physical: sensing, communication, networking and
    logical levels: data, information and autonomous decision-making. This can be
    done through dedicated simulation environments and suitable test-beds. 8. Conclusions
    The intelligent collaborative UAV–WSN systems have become the cheapest, friendliest
    and precise monitoring systems in various fields of economic or human interaction
    (environment surveillance, agriculture, smart cities, security, search and rescue
    missions, energy and transport infrastructure validation, etc.). Recent applications
    go beyond proof of concept systems and include multiple sensor nodes and UAVs,
    integrated into a large scale, geographically distributed, WSN. Due to the complexity
    and the multiple functionalities that need to be covered (acquisition, processing,
    collaboration and communication), these systems are, in essence, systems of systems.
    New concepts such as edge, fog and cloud computing are now used in data processing.
    The artificial intelligence of the basic elements (UAVs and SNs) makes the intersection
    between the entities in Figure 6 (UAV–WSN–IoT) increasingly relevant. Both UAVs
    and WSNs are increasingly considered as halves of a single multi-agent system,
    which functions organically as a single, indivisible unit. Not in the least, the
    nodes being part of a WSN are increasingly smart, with additional functionalities,
    which move them toward the IoT paradigm. Thus, we might conclude that systems
    integrating WSN, UAVs and IoT are on an ascendant trajectory and will become ubiquitous
    in commercial applications. Author Contributions D.P. conceived the paper and

    Management in Irrigation System Using IoT Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) are constantly used from the scientific community since
    the potential of ecological monitoring software composed of cost-effective possibility
    to construct and process all kinds of information with greater resolution, these
    systems are regarded as a important part of ubiquitous computing [1, 2]. Therefore,
    using IoT-driven WSN platform in precision agriculture can revolutionize the information
    assortment in agricultural area and encourage the sought after exceptionally machine-driven
    agriculture method which demands intensive understanding of ecological conditions
    in the base level and speedy communication of the information to a distant or
    local server where the source of storage and process, identification of insects
    inside the plants, burial or hyperbolic moist, the alternative generating, and
    so the direction of plantation instrumentation is completed instantly (automatic
    propulsion apparatus such as sprinklers, foggers, valve-controlled irrigation
    method, and so forth is used for management irrigation, and fertilization and
    pest control in order to offset the negative states forming wireless sensor in
    addition to actuator network (WSAN). The above system is accessible globally due
    to the involvement of IoT technology [3,4,5]. A fast evaluation and observation
    of soil moisture content (MC) of this massive area is necessary so that optimum
    irrigation will be possible at agriculture plantation region. Gravimetric method
    is called the standard to determine soil water content version, but it is not
    effective in providing large-scale fast data collection and can be limited to
    a compact dimension quantity. Geophysical techniques like ground penetrating radar
    (GPR) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) quantify a bigger sample quantity and
    therefore are accommodated to cover huge areas economically, which could not triumph
    from different procedures [6,7,8]. Additional techniques of spectroscopic scanning-based
    soil moisture material discovery are most frequently used to find soil MC map
    of a huge agriculture property, but utilizing this way is frequently expensive
    work, and also they are not used to find soil MC variations through the summertime
    [9, 10]. Within exactly the same circumstance, wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    land MC evaluation can be utilized for real-time observation and evaluation of
    dirt MC dynamics throughout the whole cropping time. Liang et al. [11] have suggested
    a plan and employ a real-time irrigation forecast using GPRS and WSN system .
    The addition of the general system uses WSN to obtain soil MC information. The
    backend system employs the hereditary back-propagation neural system to assess
    in addition to process sensor information with simulated annealing algorithm to
    maximize the outcome for real time forecast. The experimental results reveal that
    the system suggested by Liang et al. [11] gets the benefits of low-cost, higher
    precision and suitable maintenance. The process implied by Liang et al. [11] is
    a straight sensing of soil MC using WSN platform, and this content does not signify
    the mechanism for water conservation by simply contemplating weather conditions.
    Similarly, the work does not emphasize on remote access like IoT-enabled control
    [12, 13]. At the similar circumstance, additional property-associated parameters
    and ecological parameters might impact the irrigation demands. Timely forecast
    of soil moisture content may soon demonstrate much improved irrigation optimization
    by considering all of the crucial parameters that impact the soil water flow.
    Further, the prediction methodology for a large agriculture land requires high
    computing resources which is possible in a cloud-enabled services. Thus, IoT comes
    into the picture with data analytics and machine learning framework [14,15,16,17,18].
    The suggested method is determined by establishing wireless sensors in the farm
    to acquire real-time observation and evaluate soil moisture content (MC) in the
    test site. The test site is of length 50 m and width 50 m. It is implanted with
    Bermuda grass that is generally used as an ayurvedic medicine for colitis and
    gut infections. The distributed sensor network nodes are utilized to acquire real-time
    soil as well as environmental parameters. The general parameters considered are
    soil moisture content (MC), soil temperature, temperature of the surrounding,
    humidity level of the surrounding, CO2 level of air, as well as sunlight intensity
    level. The WNS environment is configured as nine numbers of wireless sensor nodes
    and a single gateway node (GN) or the coordinator node. The gateway node is also
    called as the coordinator node and others behave as router nodes. The coordinator
    node is responsible to collect all the sensor information and forward it to the
    cloud platform for necessary prediction of soil water requirements. The coordinator
    node is designed with Raspberry Pi3, Zigbee tranceiver (S2 series) and wifi circuitry
    (On board). Further, gateway node connects the internet application via the wifi
    network for the prediction of the soil water requirements. The essential data
    set is obtained over wifi connectivity to the internet server unit for the estimation
    of soil MC. Further, it is used obtain the soil MC distribution map of the land.
    With this work structural similarity index (SSIM)-based soil MC deficiency is
    calculated to manipulate irrigation valves to maintain the required water content
    uniform over the farm area. The performance of two different optimization algorithms
    such as VLRGD and GD-based neural network (NN) data prediction strategies is compared
    by computing few statistical errors like RMSE, R-squared error and MSE. Similarly,
    Majone et al. [19] have used wireless sensor network to supervise MC dynamics
    of the top soil in both time and space that is appropriate to examine the relationship
    between MC dynamics and plant physiology. The wireless sensor network deployment
    consists of twenty-seven locations (in verticals direction) configured by multi-hop
    configuration. The every wireless node contains 5 numbers of soil moisture sensor
    probes those are deployed in the varied depths like 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80, along
    with a temperature sensing device (temperature sensor PT100) at a distance downwards
    25 cm [3, 17]. The method projected by Majone et al. [19] does not provide the
    mechanism for site-specific irrigation valve control for maintaining efficient
    irrigation requirement. Irrigation scheduling and decision support system will
    provide better control over farm land water requirement. And also the water requirement
    is not precisely controlled by considering site-specific weather data. There are
    several weather condition-dependent irrigation controllers available commercially.
    All these instruments are based on few environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and solar radiation [20,21,22,23,24]. But other environmental parameters
    like wind speed, CO2 and soil-related parameters are also affects the farm irrigation
    requirements [25,26,27]. The complete intelligent weather-dependent irrigation
    control scheme is also discussed in this article. In the similar perspective,
    Lenka et al. [28] projected the MC prediction using partial-least-square-regression
    and fuzzy logic technique to manage the land irrigation requirements. The method
    produces MSE about 0.183193 and RMSE about 0.428011. The method proposed by Lenka
    et al. [28] controls the farm irrigation valve in a real-time approach, but zone-wise
    irrigation map is not included in the work. Similarly Lenka et al. [28] proposed
    BFGS-quasi-newton feedforward NN to forecast MC level in 1 h advance, and it is
    integrated with fuzzy logic model to generate appropriate irrigation valve control
    commands. The land soil moisture requirement map is not proposed in this work
    which will be produce better zone-wise as well as crop-wise irrigation control.
    The moisture map shows a better view over the soil moisture content deficiency
    of the farm land [29, 30]. The irrigation requirements can easily be addressed
    quickly by the IoT-driven decision support system (DSS). Our SSIM-based zone and
    crop specific irrigation control mechanism will produce added advantage for efficient
    irrigation control scheme over a large farming area. 2 Proposed methodology The
    main aim of the research work described in this article is to design a precise
    irrigation monitoring and control mechanism consisting of the following objectives.
    Development of a low-cost and high accuracy distributed IoT-enabled wireless sensor
    network environment for accurately monitoring the soil and environmental parameters
    which are used for predicting timely water requirements. Development of a precise
    optimization mechanism for timely forecast of MC level. Development of a robust
    mechanism for generating soil moisture content distribution map using interpolation
    technique. The distribution map is generated by measuring soil moisture content
    at nine positions of the farmland using IoT enabled WSN environment (land dimension
    is defined in the experimental site section of the article). Structural similarity
    index (SSIM) mechanisms that associate interpolated data for generating zone-specific
    irrigation control commands to control irrigation valves. Implementation of the
    weather condition-dependent irrigation control mechanism using fuzzy logic-based
    weather model. The detailed explanation of the above methodology is explained
    in the rest of the sections. 3 Experimental site The test site is situated at
    Bhubaneswar (Latitude: 20.351323, Longitude: 85.806547) in the eastern region
    of India. The cultivated farm has an area of almost 5000 m2. The profile consists
    of a layer of soppy soil, quite 2 m deep with sandy loam surface. Here the key
    top soil quality was found by laboratory study of untouched sample of 3.5 kg.
    Further, the dry bulk density and consistency of the soil sample are about 1.43
    g-cm−3 and 0.46 g-cm−3, respectively. The deployment of WSN nodes is shown in
    Fig. 1 where all nodes are connected with each other using multi-hop mesh network.
    The architecture of a single WSN node is shown in Fig. 2. All sensors are interfaced
    with the node via internal eight channels analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of
    the microcontroller (ATMEGA328P-PU). The microcontroller communicates with the
    Zigbee S2 unit via RS232 interface. Each Zigbee S2 device is configured using
    mesh network topology. The digital out pin of the Zigbee S2 is used to activate
    corresponding sprinkler valve unit. In this work, the irrigation mechanism consists
    of sprinkler pipe lines with sprinkler heads at 0.41 m spacing as well as with
    a flow of 2.2 Lh−1. Fig. 1 Deployment of wireless sensor network nodes in a Bermuda
    grass (Cynodon dactylon) planting site located at Bhubaneswar (latitude: 20.351323,
    longitude: 85.806547) Full size image Fig. 2 a Single node architecture of the
    WSN environment b proposed Single node fabricated for acquiring farm data. The
    IP67 housing used for the sensor node is shown in the right side figure Full size
    image 4 Proposed IoT-driven WSN system The battery capacity and backup are two
    major factors of the WSN nodes. All sensors are connected to the analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. The battery capacity chosen in this work
    is of 6 V/4.5 A/h lead acid type. The solar panel provides necessary charging
    current to the batter unit during day time. The solar panel chosen in this work
    is of 7 V/250 mA. The fabricated WSN node is shown in Fig. 2b. Similarly, the
    energy supply is also monitored in a real-time approach via ADC of the controller.
    The data acquisition is carried out in every 10 min and during non-transmitting
    mode the Zigbee modem is kept in a sleep mode which eventually increases the battery
    backup. During deep sleep mode, the Zigbee generally consumes a very low current
    as 0.02 µA. The Zigbee transceivers are configured in a mesh network pattern by
    updating the device firmware. Finally, the gateway is responsible to send the
    data to the internet web server for real-time analysis of sensor parameters. The
    complete unit is enclosed in a IP65 enclosure and mounted in a panel box. The
    solar panel is inclined at 45° for maximum power efficiency. In the similar context,
    Yunseop James et al. (2008) have proposed a 295-m-long linear movement irrigation
    system at Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley, NE [26]. It is observed that Bluetooth
    radio has many limitations as compared to Zigbee. The wireless nodes are utilized
    to acquire sensor data and forward it to the sink node for storing in its own
    database. The detailed architecture of the sink node is shown in Fig. 3. In this
    work, MATLAB is used to communicate with the sink node for collecting all data
    which is used for soil MC prediction and irrigation valve control using SSIM technique.
    Fig. 3 Sink node architecture of the WSN environment Full size image 5 Proposed
    soil MC prediction and irrigation control methodology The proposed MC prediction
    methodology is based on feedforward neural network where the input parameters
    are the real-time wireless sensor data [31, 32]. In this article, the performance
    analysis of the training algorithms such as VLRGD and GD is deliberated for implementation
    of IoT-WSN bidirectional DSS (decision support system) in PA (precision agriculture)
    mechanism. After the successful prediction of soil MC at every location of the
    WSN nodes connected in the field area, bilinear interpolation is used to generate
    soil MC distribution throughout the farm land. The soil MC distribution map generated
    using interpolation is compared with required soil MC using SSIM, which plays
    an important role in controlling zone-specific irrigation valves. The valve control
    command generated using SSIM is used to evaluate the actual necessity of water
    by implementing fuzzy logic-based weather-dependent irrigation mechanism. A detailed
    flow model of the methodology is shown in Fig. 4. Further, the performance analysis
    of the above two prediction methodologies is listed in Table 1A (Fig. 5). Fig.

    Variable learning rate gradient descent (VLRGD) The neural network performance
    depends on learning rate; therefore, the error rate converges soon. The bigger
    learning rate may converge the error rate of the neural network training. But
    much bigger learning rate will make the neural network unstable. Similarly, much
    smaller learning rate will take long time to converge [14, 33]. To improve the
    convergence time, the VLRGD neural network assumes bigger learning rate \\(\\alpha\\).
    Further, the new weight vector \\(V_{i + 1 }\\) is modified with a varying \\(\\alpha_{i}\\).
    Again,\\(g_{k}\\) is the gradient of the error with respect to the weight matrix
    [14, 34,35,36]. There is momentum (μ) of gradient descent for a varying \\(\\alpha_{k
    }\\) [33]. Normally, the updated weight vector \\(V_{i + 1 }\\) is defined in
    Eq. 1. $$V_{i + 1} = V_{i} - \\alpha_{i + 1} g_{i} + \\mu V_{i - 1}$$ (1) $$\\alpha_{i
    + 1} = \\beta \\alpha_{i}$$ $$\\beta = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {0.75
    \\;{\\text{if updated error}} > 1.05\\, \\left( {\\text{for previous error}} \\right)}
    \\\\ {1.05 \\;{\\text{if updated error}} < 1.05\\, \\left( {\\text{for previous
    error}} \\right)} \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ 6.1 Gradient descent This optimization
    technique updates the weight matrix and bias values in the direction of the negative
    gradient [28]. The updated weight matrix is based on Eq. 2. $$w_{k + 1} = w_{k}
    - \\alpha_{k} g_{k}$$ (2) The updated weight matrix depends on three factors such
    as current weight matrix (wk), updated weight matrix (wk+1), learning rate (α)
    and gradient error (\\(g_{k}\\)) with respect to the weight matrix [28, 37, 38].
    The negative sign of the weight matrix signifies that it is following the opposite
    direction. 6.2 Bilinear interpolation on the grid data The bilinear transformation
    is a type of linear interpolation technique where the interpolation of two variables
    (x and y) on a 2D plane. This interpolation first performs in one direction and
    then again in another direction. For example, an unknown function ‘f’ at two different
    points (a, b) need to be interpolated where four discrete points are available
    which is mentioned below. D11 = (a1, b1), D12 = (a1, b2), D21 = (a2, b1), and
    D22 = (a2, b2) Firstly, the interpolation is performed in the x-direction and
    then in y-direction according to Eqs. 3 and 4. These yields. $$f\\left( {a,y_{1}
    } \\right) \\approx \\frac{{a_{2} - a}}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\\left( {D_{11} } \\right)
    + \\frac{{a - a_{1} }}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\\left( {D_{21} } \\right)$$ (3) $$f\\left(
    {a,y_{2} } \\right) \\approx \\frac{{a_{2} - a}}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\\left( {D_{12}
    } \\right) + \\frac{{a - a_{1} }}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\\left( {D_{22} } \\right)$$
    (4) Further, the interpolation is performed from y-direction to estimate the interpolated
    data according to Eq. 5. $$f\\left( {a,b} \\right) \\approx \\frac{{b_{2} - b}}{{b_{2}
    - b_{1} }}f\\left( {a,b_{1} } \\right) + \\frac{{b - b_{1} }}{{b_{2} - b_{1} }}f\\left(
    {a,b_{2} } \\right)$$ (5) Finally, the same result is used to interpolate the
    values in x-direction. 6.3 Structural similarity (SSIM) index The SSIM conveys
    the visual characteristics by calculating a similarity measure between two spots
    such as x and y. The SSIM is calculated by multiplying mean m(x, y), variance
    v(x, y), along with cross-correlation r(x, y) as mentioned in Eq. 6 [39]. $${\\text{SSIM}}\\left(
    {x, y} \\right) = m\\left( {x, y} \\right)^{\\alpha } \\times v\\left( {x, y}
    \\right)^{\\beta } \\times c\\left( {x, y} \\right)^{\\gamma }$$ (6) $$\\quad
    \\qquad= \\left( {\\frac{{2\\mu_{x} \\mu_{y} + C_{1} }}{{\\mu_{x}^{2} + \\mu_{y}^{2}
    + C_{1} }}} \\right)^{\\alpha } \\times \\left( {\\frac{{2\\delta_{x} \\delta_{y}
    + C_{2} }}{{\\delta_{x}^{2} + \\delta_{y}^{2} + C_{2} }}} \\right)^{\\beta } \\times
    \\left( {\\frac{{\\delta_{x} \\delta_{y} + C_{3} }}{{\\delta_{x} \\delta_{y} +
    C_{3} }}} \\right)^{\\gamma }$$ where \\(\\mu_{x}\\) is mean of x, \\(\\mu_{y}\\)
    is mean of y, \\(\\delta_{x}\\) is standard deviation of x, \\(\\delta_{y}\\)
    is standard deviation of y, \\(\\delta_{xy}\\) is cross-correlation (inner product)
    of the mean shifted matrix x–\\(\\mu_{x}\\) and y–\\(\\mu_{y}\\), as well as the
    Ci for i = 1, 2, 3 are small positive constants. 6.4 Fuzzification and defuzzification
    Fuzzification is that the practice of building a sharp fuzzy set. This is sometimes
    accomplished by simply recognizing that a number of these amounts will be thought
    about to be eloquent and settled that are really not deterministic whatsoever.
    Uncertainty that is clear is carried by them. In the event the form of doubt occurs
    to appear as a consequence of ambiguity; then the factor could be portrayed by
    means of a membership function. Similarly, defuzzification is the transformation
    of a fuzzy figure into an explicit amount, as fuzzification is the conversion
    of an equal amount to some fuzzy quantity. Similarly, the output of a fuzzy method
    may be the logical union of 2 or additional fuzzy membership functions outlined
    on the universe of discourse of the output variable. The fuzzy logic is a rule-based
    model where the inputs and outputs are bounded to the rule sets. The outputs of
    the model are mathematically bounded to the input parameters. In this article,
    we have considered the real-time sensor parameters as the inputs to the model
    and valve control commands are generated according to the rule set defined in
    the fuzzy logic model. In this work, the weather information as well as the predicted
    soil MC is used to generate appropriate irrigation valve control commands. The
    fuzzification and defuzzification process is shown in Fig. 4. 6.5 Proposed flow
    model for irrigation valve control The proposed flow model of the irrigation control
    scheme is depicted in Fig. 6. The irrigation control mechanism takes into account
    of all the IoT enabled WSN node data for analyzing soil MC distribution using
    bilinear interpolation. Finally, precise irrigation valve control is done using
    SSIM index of the interpolated data with the reference soil MC. The agriculture
    irrigation valve control is efficiently performed using real-time acquisition
    of IoT-enabled WSN data, neural network prediction module and fuzzy logic-based
    decision-making module. The DSS model is integrated with a GSM modem for SMS sending.
    The interfacing is done using suitable AT command sequences through RS232 interface
    with the server station. Fig. 6 Flow chart of the irrigation control mechanism
    using hybrid decision model Full size image 7 Results and discussions The optimization
    techniques utilized within the scope of this neural network-based prediction methodology
    are variable learning rate gradient descent and gradient descent. The parameters
    used to establish a relationship between wireless sensor data and soil MC in 1
    h advance are shown in Table 1A. Further, the crop water need can be studied from
    Table 1B where the water requirement of some seasonal crops are listed. The performance
    analysis of the prediction algorithm is done by evaluating R-squared, MSE and
    RMSE. It is observed that VLRGD-based feedforward NN pattern classification generates
    minimum MSE, RMSE, and better R-squared value. Finally, this is used for the generation
    of MC distribution map of the farm land by taking all the IoT enabled WSN node
    data. Few input parameters such as sunrise time, UV index, and air flow rate are
    taken from weather forecast data, and soil type is taken from manual soil test
    of the farm land. VLRGD and NN pattern classification is used to predict soil
    MC by obtaining soil and environmental information. The soil MC prediction performance
    in addition to error graph is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Actual soil moisture content
    and predicted soil moisture content versus time in hours. Error graph plotted
    between residuals and time in hours [gradient descent optimization-based neural
    network pattern classification] Full size image Actual soil moisture content and
    predicted soil moisture content versus time in hours error graph plotted between

    network pattern classification]. Similarly, the performance of VLRGD-based NN
    pattern classification training is shown in Fig. 8. The accurate training performance
    is found after 2000 epochs. The training state of VLRGD-based NN pattern classification
    is shown in Fig. 9. It is observed that the best training was performed after
    1999 epochs. Fig. 8 Variable learning rate gradient descent-based neural network
    pattern classification training performance Full size image Fig. 9 Training state

    NN pattern classification training is performed to analyze training performance.
    The soil MC prediction response and error graph of GD-based NN pattern classification
    model is shown in Fig. 10. The GD optimization-based NN pattern classification
    training performance is shown in Fig. 11. The accurate training is performed after
    2000 epochs. Fig. 10 Actual soil moisture content and predicted soil moisture
    content versus time in hours. Error graph plotted between residuals and time in

    performance of Gradient Descent optimization based neural network pattern classification
    technique. Furthermore, the validation check of GD optimization for water requirement
    is shown in Fig. 12. Then, the performance analysis is established by evaluating
    general statistical errors like MSE, R-squared value and RMSE which is shown in
    Table 2. The MSE and RMSE are required to analyze the behavior of the two prediction
    techniques during the estimation of required soil moisture content. Less is the
    MSE and RMSE, more better is the performance of the prediction algorithm. Similarly,
    R-squared value more closely to 1 represents the better estimation of the target
    values during the training of neural network algorithm. Fig. 12 Training state
    of the gradient descent optimization neural network pattern classification training
    Full size image Table 2 Different errors obtained prediction of soil MC Full size
    table Gradient descent (GD) has higher MSE and RMSE than VLRGD-based neural network
    soil moisture content prediction algorithm. Similarly, the variable learning rate
    gradient descent (VLRGD) produces less MSE and RMSE compared to GD-based neural
    network soil moisture content prediction algorithm. It is found from Table 2 that
    the performance of the VLRGD is far better than simple GD-based neural network
    pattern classification method. This method is used to calculate MC in 1 h advance
    of all the farm regions wherever IoT-enabled WSN nodes are connected. The predicted
    MC using VLRGD-based neural network pattern classification of all the regions
    is stored for generating soil MC distribution map in 1 h advance as shown in Fig.
    13. Fig. 13 Soil MC distribution map using Variable Learning Rate Gradient Descent
    neural network pattern classification training Full size image Soil MC distribution
    map using variable learning rate gradient descent neural network pattern classification
    training. The soil MC distribution map data are used for bilinear interpolation
    for generating complete soil MC distribution map at each location of the farm
    land. The complete soil MC distribution map is shown in Fig. 14. The required
    soil MC distribution of the farm land is shown in Fig. 15. Fig. 14 Complete soil
    MC distribution map at every region of the farm land using bilinear interpolation

    The SSIM index-based soil MC deficiency map is generated by considering interpolated
    soil MC distribution data and required soil MC distribution data. The SSIM index-based
    soil MC deficiency map is shown in Fig. 16. Furthermore, the soil MC deficiency
    data of the agriculture area are impressed to fuzzy logic-based weather module
    to generate actual irrigation valve commands (Fig. 17). Fig. 16 Soil MC deficiency

    and outputs for fuzzy inference system as well as surface plot between different
    inputs and outputs. a Triangular membership function for soil MC difference, b

    valve position, h Surface plot of wind speed, environmental humidity versus sms_index
    Full size image The membership functions defined in the fuzzy logic model are
    shown in Fig. 18a–f. Further, the surface plot of the membership functions is
    also shown in Fig. 18g, h. The rules are listed in Table 3. All the parameters
    for the fuzzy version are recorded in Table 4. Fig. 18 Valve status in nine regions
    of the farm land and right side corner region has low soil MC level Full size

    by considering fuzzy inference system with SSIM index-based soil MC deficiency
    data and the valve status of nine regions of the farm land is shown in Figs. 18
    and 19. The net irrigation from 01-Feb-2018 to 12-May-2018 and irrigation status
    for 02-Feb-2018 is shown in Fig. 20. A sample valve control command matrix for
    single region soil MC deficiency is shown in Table 5. It is observed from Table
    5 that the valve control commands are generated in a matrix format where 0 and
    1 are used. The ‘0’ represents OFF condition of the valve, and ‘1’ represents
    the ON condition of the valve. Fig. 19 Valve status in nine regions of the farm
    land. Right side corner and center region are having low soil MC level Full size

    for 02-Feb-2018 Full size image Table 5 Sample valve control command matrix for
    soil MC deficiency in different regions Full size table 8 Conclusion The valve
    control is done successfully by contemplating soil MC prediction technique utilizing
    VLRGD-based optimization algorithm. A comparative analysis between VLRGD and GD
    is also formed by acquiring MSE, RMSE and R-squared value. During this test, we
    found that VLRGD has a much reduced MSE and RMSE such as 0.0468 and 0.0021, respectively.
    Similarly, GD-based NN prediction system produces much higher MSE and RMSE values
    such as 0.1111 and 0.0123, respectively. The comprehensive soil MC requirement
    map is obtained using bilinear interpolation and SSIM-based approach. The irrigation
    valve control commands are generated successfully with fuzzy logic weather model
    to fulfil uniform farm irrigation requirement almost all the weather conditions.

  description: Modern agriculture needs tools and technologies that can improve production
    efficiency, product quality, postharvest operations, and reduce their environmental
    impact. Wireless sensor networks can help monitoring fields, vineyards and orchards,
    thus helping farmers to prevent damages to their crops and increasing crop production.
    The paper presents an extension to Cooja simulator, called Weather soil data provider
    (WSDP), which offers real weather and soil data at node level, based on nodes'
    geographical coordinates. WSDP is helping specialists that want to develop/deploy
    a WSN at a certain location, to find more details about the environment parameters
    and to be able to assess the feasibility of their plan.

    Location: Cluj-Napoca, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Wireless sensor network
    (WSN) is a collective term to specify a rather independent set of tiny computers
    with the main target of sensing some physical property of their environment such
    as vibration, humidity, or temperature. A WSN consists of a few to thousands of
    sensor nodes, often also referred to as nodes or sensors, which are connected
    to each other via wireless communications. Typically, there is also at least one
    special node, called the sink or the base station, which connects the sensor network
    to the outside world [1]. Modern agriculture needs tools and technologies that
    can improve production efficiency, product quality, postharvest operations, and
    reduce their environmental impact. Automation in agriculture brings about a fundamental
    contribution to what is now known as precision agriculture (or precision farming).
    A definition of precision agriculture may be the following: the technique of applying
    the right amount of input (water, fertilizer, pesticide, etc.) at the right location
    and at the right time to enhance production and improve quality, while protecting
    the environment [2]. Wireless sensor networks can help monitoring fields, vineyards
    and orchards, thus helping farmers to prevent damages to their crops and increasing
    crop production. In [2] is presented a system for monitoring a potato field. Potato
    is a water-stress-sensitive crop. Potatoes have a relatively shallow root system
    that provides very little margin for irrigation errors. Potato plants are more
    productive and produce higher quality tubers when watered precisely, than if they
    are under or over irrigated. Soil humidity provides useful guidelines to avoid
    water stress by projecting when to irrigate. In [2] is presented a theoretical
    approach for improving the efficiency of an irrigation system for potato fields.
    An irrigation management model is given to estimate agricultural parameters using
    mathematical calculations. The system is not implemented on a particular WSN simulator
    and does not use real weather and soil data. Vineyard monitoring described in
    [1] is one of the most classical examples of sensor network monitoring. The goal
    is to reduce water irrigation and to predict or discover vine sicknesses as soon
    as possible. This not only minimizes costs of growing the vines through less water
    usage, but also enables organic growing with low usage of pesticides. Sensors
    used include air temperature, air humidity, solar radiation, air pressure, soil
    moisture, leaf moisture, ultraviolet radiation, pluviometer (rain sensor), and
    anemometer (wind sensor). The sensors are typically spread over a large area of
    the vineyard and deliver their information to an external database, in which the
    information is processed by special environmental models. The results are shown
    to the scientist or to the vineyard farmer and can be automatically connected
    to the irrigation system. The system in [1] is based software and hardware components
    used for vineyard monitoring in real-life deployments. Such a system is expensive,
    therefore a preliminary WSN simulation of the actual proposed deployment is recommended,
    trying to assess the feasibility of the plan. This paper proposes to provide a
    technical solution for obtaining real data, such as temperature, humidity, pressure,
    soil information, at node level in a WSN, based on nodes’ geographical coordinates,
    thus helping people that want to develop a WSN dedicated to precision agriculture,
    at a certain location, to find more details about the environment parameters and
    to be able to assess the feasibility of their plan. The originality of the proposed
    approach consists in the development of a plugin that extends Cooja simulator
    functionality with real weather and soil data gathering. To our knowledge, no
    module that integrates real data into Cooja, from external APIs, exists. Using
    the developed plugin, in-depth network behavior analysis can be performed using
    real data. Furthermore, data science applications can be developed using Cooja
    simulator to better understand the feasibility of certain agricultural operations.
    This paper is organized as follows: Section II provides background information
    related to wireless sensor networks and research topics in the area of WSN hardware
    and software. Section III presents the architecture of the proposed WSN platform
    for simulation / real data gathering, with its main modules and their interconnections.
    The experimental results are described in section IV. Section V presents the main
    features of the current study, future developments and concludes the paper. SECTION
    I. Background WSNs are designed to gather information about the state of physical
    world and transmit measured data to a processing unit. Generally, a WSN consists
    of a number of wireless sensors (nodes) which can communicate with other sensors
    or with a base station (gateway or sink) using a radio connection. The data is
    collected and compressed at the wireless sensor layer and then relayed to another
    sensor or sent directly to the gateway [3]. The data is further transmitted from
    the base station to the core system (local database, cloud, processing system)
    for storage and data analytics. There are many communication protocols used, most
    of the nodes using IEEE 802.11 series, IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) or IEEE 802.15.4(ZigBee).
    Wireless sensors networks can incorporate multiple types of sensors, thus there
    is a wide range of application areas where WSNs are being used. In the agricultural
    domain, WSN technology can be applied to improve potato crop production. By monitoring
    and understanding individual crop and its requirements, farmers can potentially
    identify the various fertilizers, irrigation and other requirements. In [2] an
    irrigation management model is given to estimate agricultural parameters using
    mathematical calculations with specific example of potato crop. In order to be
    able to efficiently simulate a WSN, specific hardware and software components
    need to be employed (see figure 1). Such components are Tmote Sky (sensor node),
    Contiki (WSN operating system), Cooja (WSN simulator) and a communication protocol.
    Fig.1. WSN simulation system Show All Tmote Sky is an ultra-low power wireless
    module for use in sensor networks, monitoring applications, and rapid application
    prototyping. Tmote Sky leverages industry standards like USB and IEEE 802.15.4
    to interoperate seamlessly with other devices. By using industry standards, integrating
    humidity, temperature, and light sensors, and providing flexible interconnection
    with peripherals, Tmote Sky enables a wide range of mesh network applications
    [4]. Contiki [5] is an operating system for networked, memory-constrained systems
    with a focus on low-power wireless Internet of Things devices. Contiki provides
    multitasking and a built-in Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP stack), yet it needs
    only about 10 kilobytes of randomaccess memory (RAM) and 30 kilobytes of read-only
    memory (ROM). Cooja [6] is the Contiki network simulator. Cooja allows large and
    small networks of Contiki motes to be simulated. Motes can be emulated at the
    hardware level, which is slower but allows precise inspection of the system behavior,
    or at a less detailed level, which is faster and allows simulation of larger networks.
    Network simulators allow network specialists to have practical feedback without
    the need to deploy a real network. Also, continuous network monitoring can be
    performed for detecting failures, identifying the causes and remedying them [7].
    In order to be able to gather real data at node level, in a simulation, weather
    data and soil data API’s need to be employed. OpenWeatherMap is an online service
    that provides weather data, including current weather data, forecasts, and historical
    data to the developers of web services and mobile applications. For data sources,
    it utilizes meteorological broadcast services, raw data from airport weather stations,
    raw data from radar stations, and raw data from other official weather stations.
    All data is processed by OpenWeatherMap in a way that it attempts to provide accurate
    online weather forecast data and weather maps, such as those for clouds or precipitation.
    Beyond that, the service is focused on the social aspect by involving weather
    station owners in connecting to the service and thereby increasing weather data
    accuracy. The ideology is inspired by OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia that make information
    free and available for everybody [8]. SoilGrids is a system for automated soil
    mapping based on state-of-the-art spatial predictions methods. SoilGrids predictions
    are based on globally fitted models using soil profile and environmental covariate
    data. Currently, SoilGrids.org serves a collection of updatable soil property
    and class maps of the world at 1 km / 250 m spatial resolutions produced using
    automated soil mapping based on machine learning algorithms. SoilGrids.org aims
    at becoming OpenStreetMap and/or OpenWeatherMap for soil data. SoilGrids data
    is available publicly under the Open DataBase License [9]. SECTION III. Weather
    & Soil Data Provider (Wsdp) In WSN applications, Contiki provides the firmware
    for the sensor nodes (motes). Cooja enables users to simulate a WSN, by emulating
    real hardware nodes (such as Tmote Sky), enabling the usage of specific communication
    protocols (such as RPL), thus offering the possibility to analyze the behavior
    of both the nodes and the network. Data gathering in Cooja is done by a sink node,
    which receives information from the sender nodes. The collected data is then processed
    by a tool integrated in Cooja, named Collect View. This tool enables the user
    to view the data organized under different forms, such as tables or graphs. Collected
    data includes network parameters, radio duty cycle, power consumption and sensors’
    measured values. WSDP proposes a technical solution for real data gathering at
    node level, based on two components. First component takes the form of a Cooja
    plugin which makes calls to weather and soil data API’s and collect appropriate
    information, based on node’s geographical position. The collected data will be
    sent by the sender nodes to the sink node, while the sink node will pass the data
    to the Collect View. The second WSDP component extends the Collect View functionality
    set, creating new panels for weather and soil information, and interconnecting
    Collect View with the data collection system, adapting the Collect View to new
    data sources. WSDP is designed based on Model-ViewController (MVC) architectural
    pattern. Thus, the system is easy to install/uninstall in Cooja and, due to its
    architecture, it is open for functionality set extension. The mathematical model
    from [10], integrated in WSDP, uses as inputs the sink node’s geographical position
    and its cartesian distance to a sender node, in order to be able to compute the
    output: sender node’s geographical position. For every sender node, its latitude
    and longitude are used as parameters in API calls to OpenWeatherMap and SoilGrids.
    The data received from the API’s is then sent to sink node and finally passed
    to Collect View to be displayed using graphs and charts. Formulas used by the
    mathematical model: 1) Latitude (Φ) , Longitude (λ),height(h)→X,Y,Z : X 1 Y 1

    SECTION IV. Experimental Results The experimental simulation uses a grid topology
    (depicted in figure 5), which means that the sender nodes have a fixed, predetermined
    position and a neighbor distance of 10 meters. The node with ID 1 is the sink
    node, while the rest of the nodes are senders. Fig.5. Network topology Show All
    The WSDP is opened and configured. After the configuration is done, the data collection
    can bestarted. The Collect View is opened and configured. After the configuration
    is done, the data collection can be started. As a final step, the simulation need
    to be started. The sink node can now receive data from the sender nodes and pass
    it to Collect View, which will display the data in a graphical form. Figures 6
    , 7, and 8 present examples of data collected by the WSDP, at the level of the
    node 6. Fig.6. Temperature data at node level Show All Fig.7. Soil class at node
    level Show All Fig.8. Soil particles at node level Show All Figure 5 presents,
    using a graph, the temperature evolution over the simulation time, which measures
    the time elapsed from the simulation start. The speed of the simulation time can
    be adjusted to different values. The speed also depends on the number of nodes
    present on the simulated WSN, the usage of more than one hundred nodes drastically
    decreasing the speed. Figure 6 presents the WRB 2006 and USDA 2014 soil classes.
    Figure 7 presents, using a stacked bar chart,the soil particles (clay, sand, silt,
    coarse fragments) and their proportion. SECTION V. Discussions And Conclusion
    Modern agriculture needs tools and technologies that can improve production efficiency,
    product quality, postharvest operations, and reduce their environmental impact.
    Wireless sensor networks can help monitoring fields, vineyards and orchards, thus
    helping farmers to prevent damages to their crops and increasing crop production.
    The paper describes WSDP, a technical solution which enhances the capabilities
    of the simulation environment provided by Cooja. WSDP provides real weather and
    soil data at node level, based on nodes’ geographical coordinates, thus helping
    people that want to develop a WSN at a certain location, to find more details
    about the environment parameters and to be able to assess the feasibility of their
    plan. WSDP uses, in the process of data gathering, reliable data sources, such
    as OpenWeatherMap and SoilGrids. The system is open for integration of other API’s.
    Using the developed WSDP plugin, in-depth network behavior analysis can be performed
    using realdata. Furthermore, data science applications can be developed using
    Cooja simulator to better understand the feasibility of certain agricultural operations.
    Possible future developments for WSDP include: extending the compatibility for
    another nodes’ hardware platforms; implementing and using WSDP in a real WSN deployment;
    using more API’s in order to increase the complexity and relevance of collected
    data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The results presented in this paper were obtained with the

    is the largest consumer of fresh water supplies across the globe. The United States
    (U.S.) has the world''s third largest acreage under irrigation, 22.4 Mha, and
    in terms of agricultural water use, the country ranks fourth with 176.21 km3 of
    annual withdrawals [15]. There are 20 water resource regions (WRR) in the U.S.
    that are based on the major drainage areas of the country, and the Rio Grande
    is located among Southern WRR. The Rio Grande is a transboundary river that receives
    its water both from the U.S. and Mexico, and the latter shares almost half of
    the watershed area (Fig. 1). On the U.S. side, it flows from Southern Colorado
    through New Mexico and Texas and drains into Gulf of Mexico. The total area of
    Rio Grande basin is approximately 924,300 km2 (92.43 Mha) [29]. The upper reach
    of the river receives majority of its water from snow melt, whereas the runoff
    accumulation in the lower reach is mostly due to summer monsoon. Download : Download

    river and tributaries (US And Mexico). According to U.S. Department of Agriculture
    [56], the total cropland in the Rio Grande region (U.S. side) is 631,284 ha, out
    of which 364,450 ha is irrigated. Approximately, 53% irrigation is conducted using
    groundwater, and off-farm surface water use is 44%. The surface water governance
    in the basin is based on inter-state and international treaties, and uncertainty
    in the availability of surface water due to recurring dry periods poses challenges
    to water planning and management [49]. Prolonged droughts in the region increase
    the reliance on groundwater to offset the reduced surface water supplies. Also,
    the irrigation water demand increases due to elevated crop water requirement under
    drought-induced higher potential evapotranspiration (ET). Historically in the
    Rio Grande region, droughts have caused considerable decline in groundwater levels
    e.g., drought period between 2002 and 2015 in the headwaters region and 2003-2014
    in middle Rio Grande prompted intensive pumping [7]. In addition, climate change
    will give rise to more frequent droughts and several studies have predicted decline
    (25% to 50%) in the Rio Grande flows by the next century [9,36]. States in the
    Rio Grande region have developed regional and state level water plans to deal
    with future challenges, i.e., population growth and climate change. New Mexico''s
    state water plan, for regions overlapping Rio Grande basin, shows an annual administrative
    (normally available) versus drought water supply deficit range of 0.01-0.26 km3
    by 2030, which is mainly due to greater uncertainty associated with surface water
    availability [46]. In Texas, the regional water plan (RWP) of Rio Grande water
    planning area anticipates an annual supply and demand deficit of 0.84 km3 by year
    2030 (Texas Water Development Board [54], 2021). Also, in both states, the deficit
    is expected to enlarge based on the decadal estimations made untill 2060. Annual
    irrigation demand for New Mexico was approximately 4 km3 in 2020, which does not
    fluctuate considerably under low and high growth planning scenarios by 2060. However,
    for Texas, the overall irrigation demand is expected to decrease in future, from
    11.6 km3 in 2020 to 9.9 km3 in 2060. This decrease can be attributed to factors
    such as urbanization of agricultural lands, higher domestic demands due to rising
    population, costly pumping due to decline in groundwater levels, and expected
    improvement in irrigation water use efficiency. The reduction in irrigation demand
    in Texas’ Rio Grande RWP, would be 21.2% by 2060 [54]. This shows the need of
    better water management and technology in the Rio Grande region to prepare the
    irrigation sector to sustain under future challenges. Several best management
    practices (BMPs) have been suggested for optimizing irrigation water use in the
    Rio Grande region. Advanced or scientific irrigation scheduling (SIS) is one of
    the important BMPs that could play a significant role in the sustainability dynamics
    of Rio Grande [55]. Irrigation scheduling can be simply defined as the process
    used to decide the appropriate amount of water to be applied at a certain time
    to maintain healthy plant growth for achieving a planned crop yield [52]. Irrigation
    can be scheduled by following simple methods, e.g., visually assessing the crop,
    feeling soil for moisture, etc., whereas SIS involves data, measurements, and
    estimations, e.g., precipitation and ET data, in-situ soil moisture and plant
    canopy temperature sensing, remote sensing of crop water use and stress, crop
    water use modeling, etc. Adoption of SIS in a region can lead to considerable
    water savings and improved crop yield and quality [1]. For example, irrigation
    scheduling based on probabilistic rainfall forecasts could save 11% to 26.9% water
    [2]. Zhou et al [65] demonstrated 35% saving of irrigation water by using soil
    moisture sensors under micro-irrigation. Also, positive impact on crop growth
    and quality was noted by Nam et al [45] as a result of maintaining the root zone
    moisture at a certain level using soil moisture sensors. According to USDA [57],
    only 1.5% farms in the Rio Grande region use some type of sensing device or daily
    ET reports to decide when to irrigate, whereas 48% farms rely on conditions of
    crop and feel of soil, and about 10% farms initiate irrigation when a neighbor
    start irrigating. Based on this information, it can be inferred that farmers in
    the region either lack the capacity or resolve to use SIS. Any of these factors
    could be a hindrance for moving towards sustainable irrigated agriculture. Therefore,
    it is important to find out the barriers to adoption of SIS tools in the Rio Grande
    basin. There are a few studies that have looked into the barriers that discourage
    the adoption of SIS methods. Taghvaeian et al. [52] highlighted that installation
    and maintenance cost of the equipment and lack of technical support for end-users
    are some of the major challenges being faced by the growers in U.S. Risk of yield
    reduction, field limitations, reluctance from landlord to share the costs, uncertainty
    about future water availability, unsure about continuation of farming, and more
    time required for management were found as considerable barriers to adoption of
    SIS practices in U.S. by Fan and McCann [14]. Leib et al. [34] conducted surveys
    in Washington, U.S., to analyze the adoption of ET and soil moisture sensor-based
    irrigation scheduling. One of the major findings of this study was that such adoption
    of technology can be coupled with the farm size as growers with large farms were
    more inclined to use sensors and crop-water use information for irrigation scheduling.
    Also, they found that more high value crops i.e., onions, potatoes, wine grapes,
    and sugar beets, received advanced scheduling services in comparison to small
    grains and fodder crops. This suggests that profits and crop water sensitivity
    could become a factor for deciding on the use of SIS tools. A similar regional
    study from Australia [30] identified financial constraints as the largest barrier
    to the adoption of new technologies in irrigation including scheduling and discussed
    the need of confidence building measures to convince growers for making investment
    in technology. Very few studies have investigated the barriers to adoption of
    SIS tools in Rio Grande Basin. For example, Ward et al. [62] explored the barriers
    to water conservation in different parts of the Rio Grande Basin and listed water-saving
    incentives, issues with water rights and water transfers, and ease of using groundwater
    amid reduced surface water supplies as some of the main barriers. However, this
    study did not particularly focus on reasons that hinder the adoption of SIS. Also,
    the interstate and transboundary water agreements in Rio Grande Basin make the
    region unique in terms of water management [63], and SIS adoption focused studies
    conducted in other parts of the world may be less applicable here. Hence, there
    exist a need to thoroughly investigate the adoption barriers for SIS in Rio Grande
    Basin as well as the factors that influence the adoption decisions. Understanding
    the barriers to adoption of SIS tools could provide an insight into the overall
    propensity of the irrigators’ community for embracing the new technology. Since
    the diffusion and adoption of technology is a complex phenomenon that involves
    both sociological and technical domains [48], it is important that the agricultural
    water policymakers and water experts have the tools to decipher the socio-technical
    configuration embedded in a particular region''s growers community [41]. Information
    on factors affecting irrigators’ decision-making process can be pivotal for promoting
    the adoption of innovations made in optimizing agricultural water use. Based on
    the future needs of the irrigated agriculture in the Rio Grande region where irrigation
    sector needs to adapt with the declining water supplies, urbanization and population
    rise, and climate change, it is important to develop a comprehensive understanding
    of the barriers that slow down the adoption of SIS. The aim of this study was
    to get the irrigators perspective on the barriers to adoption of SIS tools in
    the Rio Grande region. The objectives were (i) to determine irrigators’ familiarity
    and usage of different methods for deciding when to irrigate; (ii) to assess irrigators’
    level of agreement on the extent of potential factors being a barrier to adoption
    of SIS tools; (iii) to assess irrigators’ level of agreement on the extent of
    potential factors influencing the adoption of SIS tools. The results of this study
    provide guidelines to extension experts, researchers, agriculture water policymakers,
    and industry to optimize the use of water resources and promote precision agriculture
    in the region. Also, this study can be considered as a benchmark for future planning
    of water-conservation focused incentive programs by states and federal agencies.
    2. Methodology Data collected for this study was through the administration of
    a mailed survey. To develop the survey, questions related to general farm information
    and basic characteristics of growers were adapted from Frasier et al. [16]. Growers
    were inquired about their familiarity with different irrigation scheduling methods.
    In addition, factors that could be potential barriers to adoption (e.g., reliability
    and access to weather data, cost-effectiveness of technology, field characteristics,
    etc.) were listed in survey questions with option to choose a level of agreement
    ranging between strongly agree and strongly disagree. Similarly, a question containing
    list of factors that influence growers’ decision to adopt advanced irrigation
    scheduling technologies (e.g., quality of land, water use efficiency, pumping
    cost, etc.) was added in the survey to know the level of agreement of respondents.
    Besides adoption barriers, information on factors influencing decision-making
    was sought to assess the motivation of growers towards adoption. Questions including
    aforementioned factors were mainly adapted from Schaible and Aillery [50], and
    additional questions were developed based on discussions with agriculture extension
    staff and growers [47]. Overall, the survey contained 18 questions across 7 pages
    (Survey questionnaire available in supplementary information). To develop list
    of contacts for this study, a Freedom of Information Request was made to USDA
    Farm Service Agency to gain Farm Payment Files from 2013 - 2017 [58], which is
    the list of agricultural producers who have received subsidy payments during aforementioned
    years for every county in the U.S. Names and addresses of subsidy payment recipients
    whose zip code fell within the boundary of the Rio Grande Basin on the U.S. side
    and within the states of Texas and New Mexico were selected to serve as the study
    population. Of this population, a simple random sample of 1,500 individuals were
    selected and addresses were validated. To administer the mailed survey, a modified
    Dillman et al. [10] Tailored Design Method was used where a pre-notice postcard
    was mailed on August 3, 2020, followed by a survey packet on August 10, 2020,
    followed by a reminder postcard on August 17, 2020, and a final survey packet
    on August 31, 2020. Of the 1,500 mailed, 96 were undeliverable, 310 were returned
    resulting in a 22% response rate and 77 responses were usable. It should be noted
    that at the time of administering this survey, Covid-19 had impacted the delivery
    and return of the mailed survey as surveys were delivered as late as December
    7, 2020. Data retrieved from the responses was analyzed to quantify the respondents’
    basic characteristics, irrigation methods used by respondents and their familiarity
    with various irrigation scheduling techniques, SIS adoption barriers, and factors
    influencing the adoption. Also, statistical tools were used to find trends and
    relationships in the data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to
    estimate the interrelationships between the uses of different irrigation scheduling
    methods by survey participants. PCA allows simplifying large set of variables
    and breaks the interrelations in data into multiple orthogonal components. PCA
    has been previously employed in studies focusing on the conservation practices
    in agriculture using survey data (e.g., [4,24]). Stepwise regression analysis
    was conducted to assess the relative importance of variables [61] including education,
    years involved in agricultural production, and farm-based income for the overall
    knowledge and use of SIS methods. Based on the level of familiarity and use of
    the SIS methods, knowledge and adoption score was assigned to each survey participant,
    respectively. Koech et al. [30] also used stepwise regression analysis for studying
    barriers to adoption of irrigation technologies in Australia. Minitab 17 Statistical
    Software [40] was used to perform PCA and stepwise regression analysis under default
    settings. 3. Results 3.1. Respondents’ basic characteristics Response to gender
    question in the survey was provided by 71 agricultural producers out of which
    58 were male, 3 were female, and 10 respondents preferred not to mention their
    gender. 57% of the respondents belonged to the age group of 51-70 years, 25% were
    71+, 3% and 1% were from 31-50 years and 18-30 years age group, respectively,
    whereas 2% respondents did not answer this question. In terms of education, 42%
    of the growers who participated in the survey had a 4-years degree (Fig. 2), 18%
    went to some college (post-secondary undergraduate education), 16% had high school
    (higher secondary education) diploma, and 10% and 4% of the respondents had masters
    and PhD degrees, respectively. 55% of the growers had white ethnicity, 30% were
    Hispanics, 3% were American Indians, and 13% did not provide this information.

    Fig. 2. Education level of respondents from Rio Grande Region. A large number
    of responding farmers (38%) had 41-60 years association with agricultural sector
    along with 8% who had spent 61+ years in farming (Fig. 3a). 25% were involved
    in agricultural production for 26-40 years, whereas 11% and 1% of the respondents
    of the survey were associated for 11-25 years and 0-10 years with agriculture,
    respectively. 80-100% household income of 26% growers was linked with agricultural
    production, which was followed by 24% farmers whose incomes was 1-20% dependent
    on farming (Fig. 3b). 18% growers had 21-40% income coming from agriculture sector,
    for 15% it was 61-80%, 8% had 41-60%, and 10% participants’ opted not to respond.

    Fig. 3. (a) Years involved in agricultural production (b) Percentage of household
    income that comes from agricultural production. Major crops grown and irrigated
    by the survey participants were cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), maize (Zea mays),
    wheat (Triticum aestivum), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), Citrus, sugarcane (Saccharum
    officinarum), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) (Fig. 4), which consume the largest
    water share in the Rio Grande basin [31]. 51% growers reported growing one crop
    on their farm, 21% had two crops, 16% had three, 7% had four, 3% had five, whereas
    1% managed to grow six crops on their farms. Average acreage cultivated by the
    respondents was approximately 206 ha with a range of 0.1 ha and 2,388 ha. Distribution
    of the farm size in the survey was non-normal and it was negatively skewed (skewness
    = 3.19). First quartile was 10.12 ha, median was 34.1 ha, and third quartile was
    161.9 ha. Download : Download high-res image (685KB) Download : Download full-size

    methods and irrigators’ familiarity with various scheduling techniques Two most
    common methods for irrigating crops reported by the respondents were flexible
    plastic pipe with openings for furrows (commonly known as poly pipe), 27%, and
    any other gravity-based methods, 33%, (e.g., conventional flood irrigation using
    field ditches and furrows) (Fig. 5). This was followed by the center pivot (11%)
    which is mostly installed where groundwater is available. The survey also covered
    producers who use surface and subsurface drip irrigation, and a few survey participants
    picked multiple options, for example, center pivot, other sprinklers (e.g., micro
    sprinklers, solid set sprinklers, spray jets), siphon tubes, and any other gravity-based
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (573KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Methods of irrigation used by the survey participants. Precise application
    of irrigation water involves both delivery methods and techniques to decide when
    to irrigate. Survey participants were asked about their familiarity and use of
    different methods for determining when to irrigate. Condition of crop and feel
    of soil were two major conventional methods with which 76.8% and 60.8% respondents
    were very familiar, respectively (Fig. 6a, b). 81.3% respondents frequently used
    condition of crop to schedule irrigation and 45.5% frequently used feel of the
    soil. Scheduled water delivery (52.2%) and calendar schedule (38.6%) were next
    with which irrigators were very familiar with, and their frequent use was reported
    by 36.4% and 25% respondents, respectively. Commercial scheduling services, computer
    simulations, and plant moisture sensing devices were ranked lowest by the survey
    participants in terms of familiarity and use as 89.7%, 84.2%, and 76.9% growers
    were not familiar and 91.5%, 90.9%, and 89.4% never used these techniques, respectively.
    Non-familiarity and non-usage was followed by media reports on daily ET (71.8%
    and 87%), infield weather stations (71.8% and 78.7%), and soil moisture sensing
    devices (57.5% and 76.65), respectively. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    to adoption of SIS methods According to the survey participants, the two largest
    barriers to adoption of SIS methods were lack of easy access to weather data and
    uncertainty about future water availability, as 37% and 35% respondent strongly
    agreed with these factors, respectively (Figure S1). This was followed by low
    cost-effectiveness of technologies (33% strongly agree), unreliable weather data
    (33% strongly agree), and lack of availability of SIS tools in the area (31% strongly
    agree). 37% of producers somewhat agreed that improvements or adoption will not
    reduce the expenses enough to cover the installation cost, and 28% producers viewed
    risk of reduced yield and poor quality of crop with the same level of agreement
    as a potential barrier to adopt SIS techniques. 39% survey respondents slightly
    agreed that excessive nature of training requirements for new irrigation scheduling
    systems can be a barrier for adoption, whereas 29% participants had a slight agreement
    on either irrigation scheduling tools related information not being presented
    in easily understandable way or not receiving enough information to persuade them
    for adoption. Table 1 provides an overview of the response of participants and
    summarizes the average and standard deviation of level of agreement on adoption
    barriers. Table 1. Barriers to adoption of SIS methods identified by survey participants.

    influencing the adoption of SIS were maintaining the quality of land along with
    producing more on the existing acreage (68% survey participants strongly agreed),
    becoming more water efficient (66% strongly agreed), and improving or maintaining
    water availability for future generations (61% strongly agreed) (Figure S2). Under
    somewhat level of agreement, 37% growers picked increasing the value of land as
    an important factor that influences the SIS adoption, which was followed by participating
    in government financial programs to offset cost of implementation (30% somewhat
    agreed). Table 2 provides an overview of the respondent''s level of agreement

    Principal component analysis of data on irrigation scheduling methods Principal
    component analysis was conducted to understand the trends and relationship between
    different irrigation scheduling methods being used by the growers. First four
    principal components represented almost 70% of the total variance. The first principal
    component (PC1) represented 29.6% variance, and it was moderately correlated with
    plant moisture sensing, computer simulations, and infield weather stations (Table
    3). PC2 represented 14.9% variance and it was strongly correlated with in turn
    and calendar schedule and negative values existed for soil moisture sensors. PC3
    represented 13.4% variance and it was strongly correlated with feel of soil and
    moderate correlation existed for nearby weather station. PC4 represented 11% variance
    and it was noticeably correlated with nearby weather station, whereas negative

    and adoption of SIS techniques Stepwise regression analysis was conducted with
    adoption score, knowledge score, and sum of adoption and knowledge score as response
    variables, and years involved in agriculture, income percentage linked to agriculture,
    age, and education of the respondents as predictors. The results showed that income
    percentage linked to agriculture was removed from the model in all three analyses
    (Table 4) that refers to a rare contribution of income in knowledge and adoption
    of SIS. Age and education played an important role to determine the adoption of
    SIS methods with adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) 27.82%. The knowledge
    on SIS tools of the survey respondents was markedly associated with the years
    involved in agriculture and age (Adj R2 = 13.92%), whereas for the sum of the
    knowledge and adoption score, age and education were considerable predictors (Adj
    R2 = 18.98%). Table 4. Results from stepwise regression analysis (Default α =

    of survey participants’ familiarity and use of different irrigation scheduling
    methods imply that a majority of farmers tend to use non-scientific methods. Similar
    to the selection of irrigation application method, adoption of SIS technique is
    also dependent on several economic, technological, field, and water supply related
    factors [25] that could be associated with the barriers to technology adoption.
    Main barriers to adoption of SIS methods identified in this survey concurred well
    with the ones highlighted by other researchers. For example, Frisvold and Murugesan
    [17] emphasized the importance of weather data to growers for agricultural decision-making
    and discussed that producer are less likely to use web-based data directly, most
    probably due to complexities in data and its retrieval process. The aforementioned
    study also argued that the growers would be more receptive to flow of repackaged
    or simple data from extension agents and irrigation districts. This suggests that
    in the context of Rio Grande region, by providing farmer-friendly online data
    and data products [22], such data access barriers could be alleviated. Currently,
    the weather and ET networks in Texas and New Mexico (e.g., texaset.tamu.edu, weather.nmsu.edu)
    lack grower oriented weather data products. A good example of developing agriculture
    weather focused products for producers is Oklahoma Mesonet [38] which offers tools
    like farm monitor, crop specific heat units calculator, irrigation planner, and
    daily ET maps. Unreliability in weather data was identified as another barrier
    that hinders the adoption of irrigation scheduling methods. Agricultural weather
    data in terms of reliability can be divided into two categories. One is near-real-time
    data and the other is forecast data, and the dynamics of their accuracy needs
    to be discussed separately [12]. Near-real-time data is usually based on the weather
    station measurements and its accuracy for an agricultural producer mainly depends
    on the spatial density of the instruments and type of variables. For example,
    in case of precipitation either end-users will look at the data from the nearest
    weather station or an interpolated value will be available for a particular location,
    yet the reliability of this data can be questioned due to spatial heterogeneity
    of precipitation [8]. On the other hand, temperature, relative humidity, and wind
    speed data originating from nearby weather stations or through interpolation would
    have relatively higher certainty, provided there is a reasonable spatial density
    of the sensors. The same applies for ET that is calculated using the aforementioned
    variables [59]. Weather forecast data is mostly based on statistical models that
    process the data from multiple regional weather networks to make daily and weekly
    prediction reports. The element of uncertainty is an integral part of forecasts
    that usually increases with the lead time and it is important that forecast providers
    add precision coefficients or accuracy levels to the data being made available
    to growers to inform them about the reliability [33]. Survey participants viewed
    uncertainty about future water availability as one of the important barriers to
    adoption of SIS. Ward et al. [62] also discussed the uncertainty of water availability
    as a barrier to water conservation efforts in terms of water rights adjudication
    in Rio Grande region in New Mexico. Growers tend to be less interested in moving
    towards advanced method or technology when they are not sure how their water supplies
    would fluctuate in future. A comparable argument was presented by Carey and Zilberman
    [3] as they studied the modern technology adoption in irrigation in the framework
    of water market and return on investment. They found that growers with abundant
    water supplies are more likely to invest in technology whereas growers with scarce
    supplies would wait until extreme weather events (i.e., droughts) push the return
    on investment considerably higher than the cost. Subsidies could also be helpful
    for growers to overcome such barriers as discussed by Heumesser et al. [26] who
    investigated the climate change induced precipitation uncertainty and irrigation
    technology adoption trends. Cost effectiveness of SIS technologies and risk of
    not being able to cover the installation cost were picked among the major barriers
    of adoption by the respondents of this study. Also, risk of reduced yield and
    poor crop quality were among the barriers accentuated by the growers. The cost
    of efficient irrigation scheduling tools or services would vary with the level
    of accuracy and ease of operation required/ afforded by the grower. For example,
    installing one low-cost soil moisture or plant moisture sensor (manual data retrieval)
    in the field versus having multiple wireless cloud-based sensors, integrated with
    online interface and supported by remote sensing-based data, would have different
    price tags. Therefore, to make these technologies cost effective, conducting need
    assessment based on yield goals, and seeking expert opinion is important. Risks
    of yield decline, possibly due to under-irrigation with imprecise irrigation scheduling
    method could prevent growers’ adoption, and if the water supplies are not limited,
    growers would rather over-irrigate the high value crops [44]. Gaps in knowledge
    on local crop coefficients, soil-water characteristics, and issues with higher
    levels of salinity and clay and site-specific sensor calibration may induce errors
    in crop water requirement calculations and soil moisture estimates [5,20,64] that
    could cause crop water stress. Adoption of technology with respect to production
    uncertainty was explored by Koundouri et al. [32] and their results showed that
    growers are more likely to adopt technology when it is coupled with increased
    profits in comparison to downside yield uncertainty. Galioto et al. [19] discussed
    that growers could adopt new methods to schedule irrigation to mitigate the impacts
    of long-term climate variability on yield; however, such adoption requires adequate
    availability of information. Survey participants picked multiple factors that
    influence the adoption of SIS methods and quality of land was ranked first. One
    of the main reasons for quality of land being at the top of the major factors
    could be the enhanced understanding of the growers about the adverse impacts of
    mismanaged irrigation on the farms that could cause root zone salinity problems
    in the long term [11]. Please note that salinity is among the major water quality
    issues in Rio Grande region, and it is caused mainly due to agricultural runoff,
    wastewater treatment plants, and geological formation of the basin, and because
    of surface‐groundwater interactions, groundwater quality is also deteriorated
    [27]. SIS adoption provides ways to mitigate the impact of saline water on crop
    yield while also reducing salt accumulation in the root zone [39]. Producing more
    on the existing acreage was also among the top factors that influence the adoption
    of SIS. As discussed earlier, yield improvements are usually a driving factor
    for growers to invest in technology. Potential of improving pecan yields in Rio
    Grande region was demonstrated by Ganjegunte and Clark [21] using soil moisture
    sensors. Enciso et al. [13] utilized soil moistures sensors to show that better
    yields and crop quality for onions were obtainable in Rio Grande Valley of Texas
    when soil moisture was kept above a certain threshold. Influence factors such
    as achieving high water use efficiency and improving or maintaining water availability
    for future generations can be linked with the idea of sustainable irrigated agriculture.
    Data driven decisions to determine the timing of irrigation discourages over-irrigation
    and even less than 100% crop ET equivalent amount of water could be optimized
    to achieve good crop yield, for example, managing deficit irrigation with the
    help of soil moisture sensors. Both natural and artificial storage of water such
    as aquifers and dams could be harnessed for longer time periods if the growers
    collectively decide to employ modern irrigation scheduling methods. Also, additional
    economic benefits can be associated with sustainable agricultural practices as
    there is an increasing demand of sustainably sourced products in global agri-food
    supply chains [53]. This provides an opportunity to farmers, adopting SIS techniques,
    to sell their crops at premium prices [6]. PCA helped understand the interrelationships
    between the uses of different irrigation scheduling methods by survey participants.
    PC1 suggested that the use of plant moisture sensing, computer simulations, and
    infield weather stations might vary together, and increase in one''s usage could
    step up the adoption of the remaining ones (Table 3). Also, the combination of
    these methods could improve the overall reliability of irrigation scheduling.
    For example, computer simulations for irrigation scheduling calculations would
    work better if infield weather station data were used as input, and the output
    from the simulations can be assimilated with plant moisture sensing to improve
    the overall performance [23]. The negative values of condition of crop show that
    its use tend to decrease as growers move towards SIS. The interrelationship in
    PC2 hinted towards those growers who rely on delivery from irrigation district
    and water is usually applied at critical crop stages, and therefore, they are
    probably less inclined towards the use of sensors as the farmers do not have much
    control on canal water supplies unless they store water on their farm (e.g., reservoirs
    for drip irrigation systems). PC3 indicated that growers that make decisions based
    on feel of soil, they might also be interested in checking the information from
    a nearby weather station to be certain about their irrigation timing and amount
    related decision. With the information present in PC4, it could be inferred that
    when growers have access to information from weather stations, visual methods
    to decide on irrigation take a back seat. Furthermore, growers would possibly
    not prioritize their investments in in-situ sensors when they have access to nearby
    weather station. Sui and Vories [51] compared the irrigation scheduling based
    on weather station data and soil moisture sensors and found that growers would
    be reluctant to adopt soil moisture sensors mainly due to initial investment,
    recurring service charges, and possibility of sensor damage in field.  The R2
    values estimated in stepwise regression analysis (27.82%, 13.92%, 18.98%) (Table
    4) were lower than the values estimated in a comparable study conducted in Queensland,
    Austraila [30] (38%) in which the researchers analyzed the impact of several predictors
    on farmers'' perception on current knowledge and understanding of irrigation as
    dependent variable using step wise regression. The current study particularly
    focused on irrigation scheduling methods in comparison to broader adoption studies
    for irrigation technology, hence the regression models are likely to be more susceptible
    to any potential noise in data. Low R2 is tolerable in studies when the model
    is not aimed for making any future predictions [43]. Also, smaller R2 hint towards
    significant trend amid high variability in data [18]. Despite the low R2 values,
    the impact of age, education, and years involved in agriculture on growers’ knowledge
    and adoption of SIS methods corresponded well with the studies focusing on adoption
    of technology in agriculture. For example, Lichtenberg et al. [35] argued that
    growers with higher education level are more receptive to sensor-based irrigation
    scheduling. Education levels of growers were found closely related to the adoption
    intensity of improved irrigation scheduling methods by Wang et al. [60]. The aforementioned
    studies discussed older age of grower as a dissuading factor to invest in technology
    for irrigation scheduling, whereas the stepwise regression analysis in this study
    revealed an opposite trend. This could be partly due to the fact that older growers
    usually have a greater social capital in terms of strong network in irrigators’
    community that plays a positive role in adoption of irrigation technology [28].
    On the other hand, young growers with better familiarity of technology could be
    more likely to use SIS methods but this might not have a notable impact on the
    overall adoption of modern irrigation methods as May et al. [37] found that young
    growers with higher education in U.S. are less interested to work on farms because
    of better off-farm job opportunities. 5. Conclusion Irrigation in Rio Grande region
    faces challenges due to uncertainty in surface water supplies and decline in groundwater
    levels. Also, increasing water demand from municipal sector poses a threat to
    future water availability for irrigated agriculture in the region. SIS methods
    offer solutions to optimize the irrigation water use and allow growers to make
    informed decisions related to irrigation amount and frequency. A survey was conducted
    in Rio Grande region (Texas and New Mexico) to understand the farmers’ perspective
    on adoption barriers for SIS methods. Results showed that lack of access to weather
    data and uncertainty about future water availability were the two largest barriers
    to adoption, followed by cost effectiveness of technologies, reliability of weather
    data and lack of availability of irrigation scheduling tools in the region. Also,
    grower''s skepticism towards technology due to risk of reduced yield and poor
    crop quality was listed among the significant barriers to adoption of SIS methods.
    The major factors influencing the adoption of SIS were maintaining the quality
    of land, producing more on the existing acreage, becoming more water efficient,
    and improving or maintaining water availability for future generations. Age, education,
    and years involved with agriculture were estimated as important factors that may
    drive the knowledge and adoption of SIS techniques in irrigators’ community. These
    results could help policy makers and extension experts narrow down their efforts
    to promote the water conservation in the Rio Grande basin as well as in other
    regions with similar attributes. One of the limitations of this study was the
    small response rate (77 useable responses) and slightly different findings could
    be expected with a larger set of respondents. Future studies may look into the
    efficacy of different SIS tools at sub-regional level and may determine which
    technology has the potential for fast adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

    1. Introduction Irrigated crops contribute to 21% of total agricultural area,
    anduse 69% of the withdrawn water resources worldwide (AQUASTAT), making the agricultural
    sector the biggest consumer of water. This use of water often leads to surface
    and groundwater resources depletion in irrigated perimeters, which harms ecosystems
    and prejudices water access and food security. Therefore, the sound management
    of water resources in irrigated agriculture is a key for sustainable development.
    The most widely used indices to assess the performance of irrigated systems are
    the engineers'' irrigation efficiency (IE), defined as the ratio of water consumed
    by irrigated crops to water that is diverted (Boelens and Vos, 2012; Lankford,
    2012a,b; Seckler, 1996), the agronomists'' water productivity (WP), defined as
    the ratio of crop yield to water consumed by the irrigated crop (Zwart and Bastiaanssen,
    2004), and the water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of yield to water
    applied (Stanhill, 1986). The use of these indicators has been repeatedly questioned
    and criticized as they are limited to the technical performance of the irrigation
    technology, hence disregarding the larger context into which it is applied (Pereira
    et al., 2012; Perry, 2008; Willardson et al. 1994). Yet, the spatial and temporal
    scale dependency of the performance is obvious. For example, studies have shown
    that IE values can go from very poor to very good if the computation considers
    the fraction of “lost” water that is re-used at another point in space or time
    (Clarck and Aniq, 1993; Guillet, 2006). These indicators have also been criticized
    for not only considering the technical aspects and not the socio-economic ones
    (Boelens and Vos, 2012; van Halsema and Vincent, 2012). Despite these limitations,
    these indicators remain widely used.” IE can be separated into conveyance efficiency
    (ec) and application efficiency (ea) (Bos and Nugteren, 1990; Tiercelin and Vidal,
    2006; van Halsema and Vincent, 2012). Conveyance efficiency mainly depends on
    the design and state of the hydraulic infrastructure transporting water to the
    irrigated field, while application efficiency is usually expressed as a function
    of application technique. Given the significant financial investment needed to
    improve ec, ea is most often used as the actionable parameter when seeking to
    save water during irrigation practices (Boelens and Vos, 2012; Knox et al., 2012).
    As a result, irrigation water application techniques characterized by higher ea
    values such as micro-irrigation are increasingly being promoted to improve the
    performance of irrigated agriculture. Micro-irrigation is indeed considered to
    be water efficient and to reduce the pressure on the water resources, thereby
    increasing yields and economic incomes (Chandran and Surendran, 2015; Darouich
    et al., 2012, 2014; Garb and Friedlander, 2014). Drip irrigation, the most widespread
    micro-irrigation technique, is characterized by a high uniformity of the water
    distribution and the capability to deliver the water directly to the root zone
    of the plant at a controlled timing (Goldberg and Shmueli, 1970; Tiercelin, 2006),
    hence theoretically minimizing evaporation and deep drainage (van der Kooij et
    al., 2013a). These technical specificities translate into a high potential irrigation
    efficiency (IE) – the ratio between the irrigation water used by the plant and
    applied – of drip irrigation, ranging between 70 to 95% (Fader et al., 2016; Hassanli
    et al., 2010; Tiercelin and Vidal, 2006; van Halsema and Vincent, 2012). These
    IE values outperform those of surface irrigation for which IE ranges normally
    between 40 and 75%. However, such a high efficiency is calculated under controlled
    conditions and is only achieved if the system is well designed and taken care
    of, and if the irrigation scheme is appropriately managed (Fader et al., 2016;
    Tiercelin and Vidal, 2006). Such conditions are rarely met when implemented in
    practical, real-world conditions (Lankford, 2012a). Additionally, adaptation of
    the farming practice by, for instance, increasing the irrigated land area and
    cropping intensity, and harvesting different crops often ensue from the modernisation
    of irrigated perimeters, and may result in a higher water consumption (Batchelor
    et al., 2014; Berbel and Mateos, 2014; Fishman et al., 2015; Lopez-Gunn et al.,
    2012; Olmstead, 2010; Ward and Pulido-Velazquez, 2008). Such adaptation may at
    end counterbalance the envisioned water saving effect of the modernization programme.
    Therefore, although many scientists, politics, and actors in the agricultural
    sector are promoting and justifying the conversion to drip irrigation as an effective
    strategy to tackle the water scarcity issue (e.g. Berbel and Mateos, 2014; Chandran
    and Surendran, 2015; Cooley et al., 2009; Evans and Sadler, 2008; Friedlander
    et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2001; Khan et al., 2008; Lopez-Gunn et al., 2012;
    Monaghan et al., 2013; Negri and Hanchar, 1989; Olmstead, 2010), others draw attention
    to the divergence often existing between the potential IE obtained experimentally
    under controlled conditions, and the real IE once it is calculated beyond the
    scale of the experimental field (Lankford, 2012b; van Halsema and Vincent, 2012),
    and once the technique is implemented in the context of the farm holding (Batchelor
    et al., 2014; Boelens and Vos, 2012; Lankford, 2012b; Perry, 2011; Peterson and
    Ding, 2005; Pfeiffer and Lin, 2014; van der Kooij et al., 2013b; Venot et al.,
    2014; Ward and Pulido-Velazquez, 2008). Some of these authors attribute this divergence
    issue to communication failure by making, among other, a confusing use of the
    IE concept (Boelens and Vos, 2012; Lankford, 2012a; Perry, 2011). Venot et al.
    (2014) go even further by supporting that the widespread positive image of drip
    irrigation has been actively sustained by a group of actors to fit their values,
    interests, and mission. Following up on this rational, authors recommend drip
    irrigation conversion programs to be implemented in conjunction with educational
    and politic measures to ensure that the conversion to drip irrigation actually
    results in the completion of the water conservation objectives, and an evaluation
    that takes into account the context into which it is implemented (Berbel and Mateos,
    2014; Darouich et al., 2014; Lopez-Gunn et al., 2012; Rodrigues et al., 2013).
    Following up on these recommendations and to allow the evaluation of the actual
    impact of the conversion to a new irrigation technique, this study proposed and
    tested a framework for an integrated assessment of irrigation performance at the
    farm scale. The objectives underlying the implementation of the framework are
    (i) to overcome the limitations linked with the concept of IE, WP and WUE. As
    such, the notion of performance refers here to the integrated aspect of the evaluation
    and is used instead of efficiency and productivity; and (ii) to identify the actual
    factors explaining the appropriation of the drip irrigation techniques by farmers.
    This framework implies the evaluation of a set of indicators, and is tested in
    the field for the CMV103 irrigation district case study. This 4040 ha case study
    is situated in the irrigated Triffa plain, in the north eastern part of Morocco
    (Fig. 1). This case study is interesting as Morocco is undergoing a plan for irrigation
    water saving, i.e. the “Plan Maroc Vert” (PMV). Among other targets, this latter
    plan aims at converting 50% of the Moroccan irrigated agricultural land area by
    2020 to drip irrigation through a national subsidy program. The framework is applied
    to compare farm holdings that are still using the traditional surface irrigation
    technique, and others that engaged with drip irrigation. Results are used to assess
    whether the actual factors driving the farmers to use drip irrigation, and the
    impacts of such conversion, are aligned with the PMV objectives, that are water
    saving and modernisation of agricultural sector. Download : Download high-res

    focusses on the 4030 ha CMV103 administrative district in the Triffa agricultural
    plain, in the Oriental Region of Morocco (Fig. 1). The region is populated by
    2,314,346 inhabitants, among which 35% live in rural area (MAMP, 2009). The region
    is drained by the Moulouya river whose basin forms one of the six largest Moroccan
    catchments. The Triffa plain is the most fertile and productive agricultural region
    of north-east Morocco. It elevation averages 75 m, and it is bordered by the Bni
    Snassens mountain in the south, by the Moulouya river and its affluent, the Charrâa
    in the west, by the hills of Oulad Mansour towards the Mediterranean sea in the
    north and by the Kiss river in the east. It is bordered by the Bni Snassens mountain
    in the south, by the Moulouya river in the west, by the Kiss river in the east,
    and by the Ouled Mansour hills in the north (Fig. 1). Climate is semi-arid with
    a 0.23 precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ratio (FAO, 1992). Average
    temperatures alternate between 11 °C in winter, and 25 °C in summer (ORMVAM 2009
    inventory and personal communication with ORMVAM officers). Average rainfall is
    329 mm, mostly distributed from September to May with a high inter-annual variability.
    Annual mobilized freshwater resources in the Moulouya basin are estimated at 1610
    Mm3 from surface water and 512 Mm3 from groundwater, which amounts to around 964 m3
    per capita (AQUASTAT, 2018). Water resources in the region are therefore below
    the commonly accepted 1000 m3 water scarcity threshold. The agricultural area
    in the CMV103 district covers 4030 ha and is cultivated by around 750 farmers.
    Farm size averages 5 ha, but is characterized by a high variability ranging from
    less than 1 ha to 400 ha. Sixty-six percent of the land is owned by farmers, while
    17% is managed by private companies, and 17% belongs to the state and are managed
    by public institutions (ORMVAM 2009 census record and personal communications
    with ORMVAM officers). Cultivated crop in the region are various and include mainly
    cereals and fodder, vegetable, and citrus, almonds, and oleaginous trees (MAMP,
    2014). In the CMV103 district, main irrigated crops in 2009 were citrus (70.6%
    of irrigated agricultural land area), followed by potatoes (10.0%), cereals (6.2%),
    various fruit growing (4.6%), vegetable growing (2.8%), alfalfa (2.1%), and artichokes
    (1.5%). Other crops are grape vines, olive trees, forage, sugar beets, and beans
    (less than 1%) (ORMVAM 2009 inventory and personal communication with ORMVAM officers).
    Fig. 2 indicates the crop calendar for the main crops, the corresponding cultural
    coefficient (Kc), and the monthly rainfall and reference evapotranspiration. ET0
    values are higher than rainfall during the entire year, thereby illustrating the
    need to complement with irrigation water, even when Kc values are low. Download

    C2: End full growth stage; D: Harvest/late season stage. As a response, about
    a quarter of the agricultural land surface in the region is irrigated (MAMP, 2009).
    The water in the Moulouya basin is mostly withdrawn from two dams (556 Mm3/year),
    and from flowing surface water (330 Mm3/year) (Fig. 1). The dams were built in
    the late 1960′s in the context of a national strategy to develop large scale infrastructures
    for intensive irrigated agriculture. Most farmers also pump groundwater to complement
    surface water resources. Although the volume of groundwater withdrawn is less
    significant than surface water, it has been repeatedly claimed to lead to an overall
    decline in the water table elevation in the regional aquifers (SEE, 2017). Surface
    irrigation and sprinkle irrigation remain the main irrigation practices in Morocco
    with, in 2011, 72% and 9% of irrigated agricultural area respectively (AQUASTAT).
    However, areas in drip irrigation have been increasing considerably as a result
    of drip irrigation subsidy programs conducted under the NPIWS. The objective underlying
    these programs is to increase irrigated area under drip irrigation up to 550 Mha
    by 2020, which corresponds to 50% of the total irrigated agricultural land area
    in Morocco. Irrigation water resources in Morocco are managed in accordance to
    the 36-15 Water Law and the National Program for Irrigation Water Saving (NPIWS)
    encompassed within the Green Morocco Plan (PMV for “Plan Maroc Vert”). Three ministries
    and agencies organize a sector-wide planning, and designated authorities oversee
    the cross-sectoral coordination. The main actors in charge of the irrigation sector
    are the hydraulic basin agencies (ABH for “Agences de Bassin Hydraulique”) and
    the regional offices for the valorization of agriculture (ORMVA for “Office Régionale
    de Mise en Valeur Agricole”). 2.2. Data collection We conducted agricultural surveys
    within the CMV103 district (Fig. 1) in March 2012 and March 2013. We designed
    the farms sampling to have a representative sample of the region agricultural
    landscape (soil type and cultivated crops), and to have an equivalent number of
    farms using surface and drip irrigation. In total, we surveyed 25 agricultural
    holdings; 13 using surface irrigation and having 26 irrigated fields, and 12 using
    drip irrigation, and having 28 irrigated fields. Characteristics of the surveyed
    holdings are given in Table 1, Table 2. An important assumption underlying this
    study is that the holdings using surface irrigation are representative of the
    holdings using drip irrigation prior to their conversion. Collected data were
    to document the agricultural holders and labor force, farm land use (field number
    and areas, main crops and irrigation), agricultural and irrigation practices (technology,
    timing and water source and amount), and economic size and fluxes for the holdings.
    Surveys were carried out by the authors of the study, most of them accompanied
    with local ORMVAM officers to overcome language and cultural barriers. The survey
    encompassed a visit of the farm to reduce errors or farmer perception bias. During
    these visits, we corroborated the data collected about agricultural practices
    and irrigation management, and inquired additional information when necessary
    to deepen the understanding about irrigation practices. Table 1. Statistics about

    we collected census data about the land use and area, main crops, irrigated area
    and irrigation technology in the study area from the ORMVA of Moulouya (ORMVAM)
    data department. These were complemented with hydrologic data generated from a
    field-scale water budget model ran at a daily time step (Supplementary Material
    and Feltz et al., 2016). 2.3. Integrated performance assessment framework In this
    study, we defined the integrated performance assessment as the quantification
    of the technical, agricultural, socio-economic and environmental components that
    are prone to change in a farm holding when implementing a new irrigation technique.
    As such, the concept of performance is broader than the concept of IE. In contrast
    to field experimentations conducted to quantify IE, performance aims for an integrated
    assessment of an irrigation technique at the scale of the farm holding. We built
    the assessment framework from the Sustainability Assessment of Farming and the
    Environment (SAFE) framework (Van Cauwenbergh et al., 2007a) and complemented
    it by evaluation criteria and indicators extracted from an in-depth review of
    irrigation performance assessment studies (Bos and Nugteren, 1990; Dembélé et
    al., 2001; Fekete and Stakhiv, 2014; Kristensen and Pirc-Velkavrh, 2003; Lofgren
    et al., 1999; Margat, 2005; Molden et al., 1998; Muller, 2009; Rao, 1993; Skaggs
    and Samani, 2005; UN-TFIMR, 2009; UN-WWAP, 2009; Van Cauwenbergh et al., 2007b).
    The SAFE framework was designed to support an integrated and systematic assessment
    of the sustainability of Belgian agricultural systems, and is well-recognized
    in the scientific community (e.g. Binder et al., 2010; Gómez-Limón and Sanchez-Fernandez,
    2010; Ripoll-Bosch et al., 2012). The SAFE framework was designed to assess a
    range of spatial scales, from field to regional or country scale, and embodies
    three hierarchical assessment levels: principles, criteria, and indicators (PC&I).
    Principles and criteria are related to the multiple functions of the agro-ecosystem.
    They go beyond the production function and include the three pillars of sustainability:
    the environmental, economic and social. The principles aim to list the general
    ecosystem functions that contribute to the achievement of sustainability (e.g.
    the water supply function), while the criteria indicate for the resulting state
    when the corresponding principle is respected (e.g. adequate amount of soil moisture
    is provided). The indicators are quantitative or qualitative variables that can
    be used to assess the sustainability of the agro-ecosystems in relation to each
    criterion. The holistic approach embodied by the SAFE framework presents various
    advantages for our study. Firstly, it enables the evaluation of multiple aspects
    of agrosystems once irrigation is implemented in the real-world context, which
    differs from the technical experimentation in controlled conditions. Secondly,
    it allows this evaluation to be done at the farm holding scale and from the farmer’s
    perspective. This is important since studies on irrigated systems around the world
    have reported that the decision factors for the conversion to another irrigation
    practices are variable, but most often linked to practical considerations related
    to the farmers’ holdings (Benouniche et al., 2011; van der Kooij, 2009, 2013).
    Thirdly, a holistic evaluation framework allows investigating agrosystem performance
    without formulating uni-dimensional or unduly constraining hypotheses about the
    objectives that motivated the farmers to follow a given farming strategy. We adapted
    the SAFE framework by applying a six-rule screening procedure to all the PC&I
    in the SAFE framework successively: 1) Every PC&I must be prone to be impacted
    when converting a farm holding irrigation scheme to a new technology. To apply
    this rule, we first compiled a comprehensive list of the socio-economic and environmental
    variables that are subject to be impacted using the reference irrigation book
    “Traité d’irrigation” (Tiercelin and Vidal, 2006) (Table 2). We excluded any principle,
    criteria or indicator that was not related with any of the listed variables. 2)
    Every PC&I must be relevant for the study agricultural district (in this case,
    the CMV103 perimeter). This rule was applied because irrigation performance is
    dependent on the specificity of the study area (Rao, 1993). We applied this rule
    on the basis of our conceptual understanding of the socio-economic and environmental
    context in the study area, its issues and challenges. 3) Every indicator must
    have implications at the farm holding scale. This rule is to comply with the study
    objective that is to evaluate performance from the farmer’s standpoint. It assumes
    that the farmer’s evaluation of the performance doesn’t expand beyond the boundaries
    of the farm holding. As such, this rule involves the systematic elimination of
    all SAFE indicators for which the application scale was the landscape, region,
    watershed, ecosystem, and country. 4) It must be possible to calculate every indicator
    based on existing data or knowledge, since one of the fundamental property of
    an indicator is the possibility to be calculated and quantified (Bell and Morse,
    2004; Fekete and Stakhiv, 2014; Reed et al., 2006). 5) All criteria or indicators
    nested under a principle or criterion that was eliminated was also eliminated.
    Additionally, all principles and criteria for which all the nested criteria and/or
    indicators were ruled out were eliminated. Prior to eliminating a criterion based
    on this rule, possible alternative indicators listed from the literature body
    for this criterion were reviewed and any indicator suitable to quantify the orphan
    criterion was retained. 6) PC&I related to pollution aspects must be excluded
    because this study focusses on the quantitative aspect of the resources. Finally,
    we compared the indicator list resulting from this screening procedure to the
    indicators listed from the literature review and added the indicators that did
    not have an equivalent in the SAFE framework. In such case, we revised the definitions
    of the selected indicators to fit the study case. 2.4. Indicator calculation We
    provided a definition and calculation method for each selected indicator based
    on the definitions in the SAFE framework adjusted to fit with the study area and
    objective. We calculated the compiled list of indicators for each surveyed holding
    using the data from the surveys, census and a simplified hydrologic model. To
    assess the difference between farm using surface irrigation and the farms using
    drip irrigation, we calculated the aggregated statistics (mean, standard deviation,
    and ranges) of the indicators grouped by type of holding (surface and drip irrigation),
    and assessed the significance of the difference by conducting student t-tests
    statistical tests 3. Results 3.1. Indicator selection We selected seventeen indicators
    to support a performance assessment of the change in irrigation technique in the
    CMV103 district of the Triffa plain, Morocco. The final assessment framework is
    structured around the three sustainability pillars and encompasses eight principles,
    13 criteria and 17 indicators (Table 3). This represents a sharp simplification
    of the initial SAFE framework that originally consisted of 18 principles, 48 criteria,
    and 96 indicators. We removed eight PC&Is because they were insensitive to a change
    in irrigation technique (Rule 1), 14 because they were not relevant for the study
    site (Rule 2), 14 because they reflected on a system property that was outside
    of the farmers’ standpoint (Rule 3), 16 because of the lack of data (Rule 4),
    and the remaining were eliminated according to the fifth rule. Besides, we added
    four indicators identified in the literature because they had no equivalent in
    the SAFE framework or to support the assessment of criteria for which all indicators
    had been eliminated during the screening procedure. Detailed results from the
    selection procedure are given in the Supplementary Material (Table SM). Eigth
    of the selected indicators serve the assessment of the environmental pillar, four
    the economic pillar, and five the social pillar. Selected environmental indicators
    were related to water and energy aspects, while the indicators linked to biodiversity
    issues were excluded due to insufficient data. We kept all the principles and
    criteria in the economic pillar, but excluded seven indicators due to insufficient
    data. The scarcity of farm-scale economic data in public records was linked to
    the high sparsity and variability of reliable raw economic data, which hinders
    the compilation of such database in regional or national level. Besides, surveyed
    farm holders were not always participative in disclosing such data, even under
    the cover of anonymity. If the data had been available, PC&I for the economic
    pillar would be almost identical with the original SAFE framework. This correspondence
    regardless of the highly distinct agricultural context between Belgium and Morocco
    reflects the universality of the economic concerns in an agricultural project–
    both for decision makers and for farm holders. In contrast to the economic pillar,
    we removed the majority of PC&I for assessing the social pillar from the original
    SAFE framework, and included three additional indicators, which highlights the
    distinct social specificities between the two regions. The definitions of the
    selected indicators are given in Table 4, and additional information is in the
    Supplementary Material. Table 3. List of variables prone to change within a farm

    b Educational or leisure activity that brings visitor to the farm against financial
    contribution. 3.2.1. Environmental pillar Almost all indicators exhibiting a significant
    change in the environmental pillar are changing in an undesirable direction. The
    lower number of harvested species in farms using drip irrigation (Indicator 8,
    Table 5) indicates the higher specialization of these farms. A combination of
    factors might explain this higher specialization. The main one is that engaging
    with drip irrigation involves a significant conversion of the farmers practice.
    Hence, crops that are not suited to drip irrigation such as cereals are no longer
    cultivated. Another factor is that farmers using surface irrigation in cash crop
    orchards often take profit of the moist soil conditions prevailing in the tree
    inter-rows to grow other crops for personal use, agricultural input, or local
    market. This increases the diversity of harvested species. This diversification
    is no more possible in farms using drip irrigation as the moist soil conditions
    are restricted to the immediate proximity of the root system of the primarily
    harvested plant. However, some farmers using drip irrigation practice inter-row
    cropping on citrus tree fields when the trees are at young growing stages. Overall,
    conversion to drip irrigation is often embedded in a broader strategy towards
    a more intensive, cash crop oriented industrial agricultural practice. This implies
    a reduction of the diversity and an increase of the specialization level (Table
    6). Table 6. Statistics of the performance indicators for the farm holdings using

    0.02 a Statistics calculated on subset of the surveyed holdings, since some farmers
    have chosen not to disclose the data needed for the calculation. Energy input
    (Indicator 5) is significantly higher in drip irrigated farms. However, this result
    must be interpreted cautiously as the energy indicator is calculated based on
    theoretical assumption. In addition, it is not related to crop yield, although
    an increase in energy use per harvested land unit might be compensated by an increase
    in crop yield on that same unit, as found in other studies (e.g. Pergola et al.
    (2013)). No exact yield data are available to evaluate such indicator in this
    case study. No renewable energy input was recorded in the surveyed farms (Indicator
    6), although it has been recently observed in other farm holdings that farmers
    are starting to use solar panels as energy source for groundwater pumping, hence
    drastically reducing non-renewable energy consumption. No significant difference
    is found for the hydric stress indicator (Indicator 2) when all fields are considered.
    Yet, previous study had shown that, when restricting the analysis to citrus fields,
    i.e. the dominant crop in the CMV103 district, the hydric stress indicator is
    higher (p-value = 0.06) for citrus irrigated with drip irrigation (annual number
    of days with hydric stress = 47), as compared to surface irrigation (annual number
    of days with hydric stress = 34) (Feltz and Vanclooster, 2013). This inability
    to cope with hydric stress suggests that the control of irrigation timing and
    quantity is not optimal, and that this management failure is exacerbated when
    using drip irrigation. In addition, although the statistical significance of the
    Indicator 3 is low (p-value = 0.1), it signals that the conversion to drip irrigation
    might not lead to the expected decrease in groundwater withdrawal. These results
    highlight the poor management of the irrigation technology and the risk of failure
    to meet the water saving objective targeted by the NPIWS. Based on our field observations
    and discussions during the agricultural surveys, very few farmers are using soil
    moisture sensor technologies to assess the need in irrigation water. Instead,
    many farm holders that engaged with drip irrigation keep making decisions about
    irrigation timing and quantity using the same decision criteria as when using
    surface irrigation. We observed instances of farmers in assessing crop water needs
    based on apparent observed soil dryness or wetness in drip irrigated fields. Although
    this practical assessment is valid for field in surface irrigation, it is misleading
    for fields in drip irrigation and likely triggers excess irrigation. In absence
    of rainfall, soil wetness status is indeed very low outside the dripper irrigation
    cone. These results highlight the gap between the theoretical and actual efficiency
    of the drip irrigation technique, and the importance of considering the context
    into which the technique is deployed when assessing performance. This also emphasizes
    the need to strengthen the technical training of the farmers when drip irrigation
    is implemented, and to implement real incentive programs to encourage famers to
    manage water as a scarce resource. Despite indications that the conversion to
    drip irrigation could alleviate pressure on water resources, the environmental
    performance of the farms under drip irrigation as compared to surface are either
    identical or lower (more energy consumption, lower crop diversity, higher hydric
    stress). These findings suggest that, in the study area, the factors motivating
    the farmers to use drip irrigation are not directly related to environmental concerns.
    3.2.2. Economic pillar The conversion to drip irrigation does not appear to have
    a significant economic impact in the study area, except for a lower diversity
    of income sources (Indicator 11), which is in accordance with the higher level
    of specialization revealed in the environmental pillar (Indicator 8). This lower
    diversity of income sources and crop types might make the holdings less resilient
    to any market shock or crop harvest failure due for instance to crop diseases.
    The absence of significant difference regarding the longevity of the estate status
    (Indicator 12) between the two types of holdings contrast with findings from several
    other studies (e.g. Burnham et al. (2014); Salhi et al. (2012)). The conversion
    to drip irrigation indeed supposedly requires heavy financial investments that
    starts being profitable only after a long period, and therefore requires stable
    conditions. The fact that this assumption does not hold true in the CMV103 district
    may be explained by the use of cheaper technologies by some farmers, among other
    through pumping water directly from the aquifer instead of building a reservoir.
    The resulting drastic cost reduction can justify a conversion towards drip irrigation
    even when the longevity of the holding is less secured. On another hand, the conversion
    towards drip irrigation is heavily subsidized which may explain that farm holders
    would take the risk to convert, even if case of lower stability. Finally, results
    indicate that the conversion to drip irrigation does not change the annual income
    nor the economic balance. However, the results should be regarded cautiously since
    economic data are generally marred by high uncertainty. In addition, they were
    not disclosed by all the survey respondents. 3.2.3. Social pillar Indicator 15
    exhibits significant differences. Farms using drip irrigation hire more farm workers
    for daily operations. This is to be attributed to the generally bigger farmland
    area of the exploitations under drip irrigation, and the higher workload thereof,
    but also indicates a clear-cut difference in the daily management of the farm
    depending on the irrigation model. The farms using surface irrigation are generally
    smallholder family farms with external workers hired on a punctual basis, while
    the farms using drip irrigation tend to have a higher dependency on daily workers.
    This result also corroborates studies that reported that a frequent criterion
    motivating conversion to drip irrigation is the reduction of the time that the
    farm manager spends in the field (e.g. Foltz (2003); Salhi et al. (2012)). The
    education level of farm managers (Indicator 16) is significantly higher in exploitations
    under drip irrigation: none of the 13 managers in farms using surface irrigation
    attended vocational nor higher education, while all the surveyed farm managers
    who received an education are practicing drip irrigation. Hence, higher education
    is most likely a favorable factor for the farm holder to question the traditional
    irrigation system and engage with the conversion. This result corroborates findings
    in Alcon et al. (2011) and Salhi et al. (2012) that educated farmers are more
    prone to decide for conversion to drip irrigation. The dependency to commercial
    contract (Indicator 17) is significantly higher for farmers using drip irrigation.
    This is because the major part of their crops is citrus for exportation and sugar
    beets for sugar industry, both inherently dependent to contracts. The agricultural
    models in farmers using surface irrigation are more oriented towards local market
    and for the consumption at the farm level. Therefore, from a social standpoint,
    the performance of a farm using drip irrigation is weakened due to a higher dependency
    to contracts. In these farms, owner and manager most often have a professional
    education, land area is bigger, and there are several contracted workers. The
    conversion to drip irrigation does not impact the performance criteria supported
    by the 12 other indicators. Hence, very similar percentage of irrigated farmland
    area (Indicator 14) for the two irrigation systems indicates that such land attribution
    is depending on decision factors that are independent from the type of irrigation
    practice used, and that the proportion of irrigated farmland is not an incentive
    for a farm manager to implement the conversion to drip irrigation. Finally, the
    lesser significance of the difference for indicators 13 (number of commercialized
    crop types) and 8 (number of crop types, including non-commercialized crops, i.e.
    crops grown for household consumption) testifies for the more market-oriented
    model of holdings using drip irrigation. 4. Discussion Most indicators supporting
    environmental and economic performance assessment are signaling a neutral effect
    or undesirable alteration resulting from the conversion to drip irrigation. These
    results support the conclusions in Venot et al. (2014) that drip irrigation should
    not be framed as an effective practice for water saving and poverty alleviation
    without considering the context into which it is implemented. It also supports
    the conclusion by the same author that the conversion to drip irrigation has had
    little capability to improve smallholder farming. These neutral or negative effects
    on environmental and economic factors suggests that, in the study area, farmers
    engaging with drip irrigation are mainly motivated by social factors. Specifically,
    the difference in farm management highlighted by Indicator 15 suggests that the
    main drivers motivating farmers for using drip irrigation is the possibility to
    organize daily work tasks differently, therefore implying a higher convenience
    and comfort improvement. This has been repeatedly corroborated by discussions
    with the farmers, and it has also been highlighted in other studies led in Tunisian
    and Algerian irrigation districts exhibiting similar farm holding models and harvest
    crop schemes (Foltz, 2003; Salhi et al., 2012). Indeed, in the study region, surface
    irrigation requires substantial human labor for water application and distribution,
    which is typically executed by workers hired on a punctual basis and whose guidance
    and supervision is highly time-consuming for the farm manager. Inversely, drip
    irrigation is more automated and less labor intensive thereof, which supposedly
    eliminates the need for punctual workers hiring and training. Social and cultural
    reasons were also pointed by Alcon et al. (2011); Foltz (2003); Salhi et al. (2012)
    and Wanvoeke et al. (2016) as determinant motivators for engaging with drip irrigation
    technologies. Wanvoeke et al. (2016) indicated specifically that, in their Burkinabe
    study area, this engagement is primarily linked with advantages such as access
    to attractive credits, higher social prestige, and resulting opportunities to
    create new alliances. The higher dependency to contract for farms under drip irrigation
    revealed in this study aligns with many studies (e.g. Berbel and Mateos (2014);
    Boelens and Vos (2012); Lopez-Gunn et al. (2012); Olmstead (2010); van der Kooij
    et al. (2013a); van Halsema and Vincent (2012); Venot et al. (2014)). These studies
    showed that the conversion to drip irrigation is often used to modernize infrastructures
    and comply with export companies’ requirements. Overall, the findings in this
    study question the significance of the National Plan for Irrigation Water Saving
    (PNEEI) under the Plan Maroc Vert targeting the conversion of 50% of irrigated
    land to drip irrigation. It highlights that environmental concerns are not sufficient
    incentive for farmers to weight into their operational decisions. This stresses
    the need to complement the subsidy programs by real incentives, such as pricing
    measures to motivate farmers to conserve water, and training programs to support
    farmers for an optimal operation and management of the drip irrigation technology.
    Several drawbacks limited the scope of this study, which calls for additional
    work on the topic. The first and major one is linked to data scarcity. Limited
    data caused the exclusion of numerous performance indicators, and compromised
    the reliability of some of the final indicators. Among others, all indicators
    related to quality concerns (water pollution, soil salinization, etc.) were excluded,
    although this component is crucial for a truly holistic assessment of irrigation
    practices. Causes of data scarcity were the limited pool of pre-existing data
    and the restriction to data access by institutional authorities, and the limited
    time and funding to deploy instrumentation network and grow the pool of agricultural
    surveys. Another drawback is that the study didn’t incorporate the temporal dimension.
    Instead, to cope with the lack of data that would have allowed evaluating the
    performance of a farm holding prior and after the conversion to drip irrigation,
    the holdings that were still using surface irrigation were used as a proxy for
    the holding of the drip irrigation farms prior to their conversion. Although this
    simplification is acceptable to gain preliminary knowledge and understanding,
    results still need to be regarded with caution due to possible differences in
    farm typology and farmer profiles existing prior to the conversion. The problem
    of data scarcity is a common and widespread issue in agricultural studies in developing
    countries (e.g. Bastiaanssen et al. (2007); Hamid et al. (2011); Kharrou et al.
    (2013)). Therefore, this study is an additional instance highlighting the need
    for a data collection and storage program and strategy at the institutional level.
    Such program should include (i) the conduction of repeated agricultural census;
    (ii) the deployment of monitoring network to track the temporal evolution of key
    environmental variables and adapt management as needed; (iii) the cleaning and
    storage of historic and new data in a central database; (iv) a lift of the institutional
    barrier that make the data acquisition a very time and resources consuming, if
    not impossible, process. Lastly, no reference values were proposed to evaluate
    the absolute values taken by the indicators. Such references would have been difficult
    to determine because of their high dependency to the socio-economic and environmental
    specificities of the region under study. The comparative assessment between farms
    using surface irrigation and farms using drip irrigation allows to overcome this
    difficulty. It allows to measure the direction and amplitude of any possible change,
    while integrating the specificities of the region. 5. Conclusions A framework
    to support a comparative integrated assessment of the performance of farm holdings
    using traditional surface irrigation and those that engaged with a new irrigation
    technique was defined and applied to the CMV103 irrigation district in the Triffa
    agricultural plain in Eastern Morocco. Results indicate that the conversion from
    surface to drip irrigation in the study area led to neutral or negative effects
    on environmental and economic aspects, while most significant beneficial effects
    were detected for the social pillar, as drip irrigation allows structural changes
    in the holding. The latter result suggests that the objectives pursued by the
    farm holders engaging with the drip irrigation technique are different from the
    objectives underlying the subsidy programs led under the Moroccan National Plan
    for Irrigation Water saving under the Plan Maroc Vert. Results indicate that farmers
    do not consider the need to reduce consumption when planning their irrigation
    scheme, and stress that environmental concerns are not sufficient incentive to
    motivate farmers for irrigation water saving. This divergence in the objectives
    might undermine the success of the plan in targeting water scarcity issue, and
    therefore calls for a more meaningful engagement and training of the farmers,
    along with raising awareness about the water scarcity issue prevailing in the
    region. More generally, results from the study are confirming that, despite the
    high theoretical water use efficiency of the drip irrigation technology, its performance
    when evaluated at the farm holding scale is far less obvious. Therefore, the decision
    to engage with that technique should be based on a multi-level criteria evaluation.
    Despite the conduction of surveys with the farmers, the institutional and long-term
    monitoring data scarcity context into which this study was implemented was a major
    obstacle, and compromises the robustness of the results. This calls for the institutionalization
    of the data standardization, centralization, the release of the data in public
    database, along with the implementation of continuous monitoring programs to track
    and scrutinize the state of the natural resources and the agricultural activities.

    case of tomato producers in Morocco 2021, Agricultural Water Management Citation
    Excerpt : The differences between these two systems became particularly visible
    in the fruit and vegetable sector, with 517 thousand tons of fresh tomato exported,
    making the crop one of the flagship products for export (FAOStat for 2017). Among
    other targets, this latter strategy aims at converting 50% of the Moroccan irrigated
    agricultural land area by 2020 to drip irrigation through a national subsidy program
    (Alonso et al., 2019). However, over the past decade, the expected results of
    this strategy, officially ending in 2020, have been widely disputed (Akesbi, 2014;
    Faysse, 2015; Ouraich and Tyner, 2018; Sippel, 2016). Show abstract A global analysis
    of irrigation scheme water supplies in relation to requirements 2021, Agricultural
    Water Management Citation Excerpt : The other noteworthy finding that could have
    a common basis was that the use of water with sprinkler irrigation that Serra-Wittling
    et al. (2019) reported to be normally higher than with drip irrigation, ceased
    to be so as rainfall decreased, while we observed that the RIS increased as rainfall
    increased (Fig. 7). Although modern on-farm irrigation technology is being questioned
    lately (Alonso et al., 2019; Perry et al., 2017; Wanvoeke et al., 2015), our analysis
    showed that application uniformity and the ability to apply the required water
    depth, characteristic of sprinkler and localized irrigation systems, clearly helped
    to adjust the irrigation supply to the needs. To expect benefits beyond the precise
    and uniform application of water (e.g., to expect a reduction in consumptive use)
    is to misunderstand irrigation engineering and agronomy; moreover, rebound effects
    are to be expected (Berbel and Mateos, 2014; Pfeiffer and Lin, 2014). Show abstract
    A satellite-based ex post analysis of water management in a blueberry orchard
    2020, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture Citation Excerpt : New remote sensors,
    automation systems, and field sensors allow to reduce the gap between crop water
    demand and available water, based on data–driven decision making (Holzapfel et
    al., 2015; Trentacoste et al., 2015; Malik and Dechmi, 2019). Thus, implementing
    IT into agricultural systems allows for assessing irrigation efficiency and effectiveness
    that requires data of water use, evapotranspiration, soil, and water quality (Holzapfel
    et al., 1985; Jensen, 2007; Mateos, 2008; Bjornlund et al., 2009; Grafton et al.,
    2017; Alonso et al., 2019). Current monitoring systems (both in situ and remote),
    as well as increasing computational power for data processing and information
    management, make it possible to estimate the water demand for crops and orchards
    in a spatially and temporally distributed manner using satellite images (Gavilán
    et al., 2019; Souto et al., 2019; Gonzalo-Martin et al., 2017). Show abstract

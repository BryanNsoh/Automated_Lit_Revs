    controlPrecision irrigation 1. Introduction Agriculture is the base of our socio-economical
    model, and its development plays an essential role in the welfare of nations (Gollin
    et al., 2002). However, agriculture has a high environmental impact and can be
    considered one of the most important contributors to global environmental degradation
    (Mueller et al., 2012). Furthermore, as the global population continues to grow,
    there is an urgent need to increase food production. This already complex challenge
    is further intensified by accelerated environmental changes, characterized by
    significant shifts in precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme weather
    events such as heavy rains, heatwaves, and droughts (Bisbis et al., 2018). Consequently,
    it is critical to develop strategies to enhance agricultural production while
    mitigating its environmental impact. In this context, improvements in irrigation
    scheduling play an important role, not only because agriculture is the consumer
    of almost 70% of freshwater resources (Jalilvand et al., 2019), but also because
    appropriate irrigation scheduling can help to increase the yield production and
    minimize the leaching of nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metal to freshwater
    sources (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). Incorporating technological tools could be a
    viable solution to improve irrigation scheduling, where the aim is to make irrigation
    decisions based on the needs of the crops, establishing when the crops need water
    and how much water needs to be applied. Numerous studies have centered on developing
    tools that accurately detect plant water stress conditions to determine optimal
    irrigation. For instance, Torres et al. (2019) employed near-infrared spectroscopy
    to measure in-situ leaf relative water content. In parallel, other approaches
    assess plant water requirements using soil moisture sensors (SMS) positioned in
    the target zone. The use of SMS is the most adopted technology for irrigation
    scheduling in the USA (USDA, 2018, Taghvaeian et al., 2020), and in many scenarios,
    a common response to identified irrigation needs is implementing feedback threshold
    control by using SMS (Dukes et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2010, Zhang et al.,
    2017, Li et al., 2018, Cayuela et al., 2022, Simionesei et al., 2020), or using
    fuzzy-based decision systems (Culman et al., 2019, Stone et al., 2020). Both strategies
    define levels based on measured stress conditions or soil moisture. However, the
    methodology for setting these threshold levels is not versatile enough to accommodate
    the diversity of crops, soils, and environmental conditions. Furthermore, these
    thresholds often remain static, not accounting for the evolving needs of crops
    influenced by environmental factors, intrinsic crop properties, and growth stages.
    Accurately determining the volume of water needed for irrigation entails a comprehensive
    understanding of plant water consumption concerning environmental variables, specific
    crop attributes, and growth stages (Lopez-Jimenez et al., 2022). Many decision
    support systems employ crop measurements coupled with AI to estimate and compensate
    for water losses from the evapotranspiration process (Katimbo et al., 2023). The
    works developed by Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et al. (2019) aim
    to bolster decision-support systems for agricultural irrigation by incorporating
    analytical models such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM). This comprehensive
    model features modules covering soil water balance, nutrient dynamics, equilibrium
    soil chemistry, potential evapotranspiration, surface energy balance, heat transfer,
    pesticide processes, and plant growth, relying on the Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). RZWQM has been widely utilized to simulate
    the impacts of agricultural management strategies on crop yields and soil and
    water quality (Ma et al., 2012). Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et
    al. (2019) use RZWQM for computing irrigation scheduling based on measurable crop
    conditions, predefined threshold values, and numerical solutions generated by
    the model. Nonetheless, employing RZWQM to compute irrigation scheduling in a
    feedback scheme presents significant challenges due to its inherent complexity
    and rigidity. The model’s detailed structure complicates the straightforward analyses
    and inclusion of user-specified requirements and the adaptation to overcome discrepancies
    between the crop and the model. Furthermore, RZWQM is restricted to a predefined
    set of cultivars, limiting its versatility to diverse agricultural settings. The
    complexity also imposes computational constraints, making real-time feedback control
    based on the current soil moisture state and crop stages challenging. These limitations
    underscore the necessity for more versatile, adaptive, and computationally efficient
    irrigation scheduling strategies. To this end, some studies have explored advanced
    control theory as a systematic approach to the irrigation problem (Saleem et al.,
    2013, Delgoda et al., 2016, Shang et al., 2020). As mentioned by Romero et al.
    (2012) and Ding et al. (2018), using advanced control strategies in agriculture
    has a high potential to increase efficiency. However, tangible applications are
    sparse. Much of the documented research revolves around simulations (Romero et
    al., 2012). While comprehensive on paper, some models oversimplify real-world
    scenarios by presupposing fully instrumented crops. Contrarily, in practical settings,
    agricultural systems often struggle with control limitations. In many irrigation
    systems, manual intervention dominates, where operators activate or deactivate
    pumps, manage ditches, and manipulate valves or gates to regulate irrigation.
    In summary, we evidence a lack of irrigation strategies that balance efficiency,
    practicality, and real crop management considerations. Many current methods rely
    heavily on static thresholds or intricate models, which often do not adapt dynamically
    to changing environmental conditions, diverse crop needs, irrigation management
    practices, and different growth stages. Moreover, while advanced control theory
    holds promise, there is an absence of advanced control strategies that account
    for real-world complexities and manual human intervention in the operation of
    irrigation systems, where the timely human response to crop needs, actuation precision,
    and operational reliability are important elements that influence the controlled
    system. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this research is to use
    control theory to enhance the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly in
    real agricultural scenarios that are often human-operated. We propose developing
    a novel control-based algorithm for a DSS for irrigation scheduling capable of
    computing practical irrigation instructions based on field measurements and weather
    forecasting, which is designed to be adaptable to the grower’s or irrigation manager’s
    operational limitations, preferences, and experience and must compensate for uncertainties
    introduced by human intervention. We have formulated our DSS around a simplified
    proposed control-oriented model (COM), which describes the soil moisture dynamics;
    a data processing stage, which makes the measured data compatible with the COM;
    a parameter estimation stage, which guarantees an optimal adjustment of the COM
    parameters based on measured information from the crop; and a control stage, which
    uses the parametrized COM, measured information from the crop, and information
    from weather forecasting to compute the appropriate irrigation instructions that
    maintain the soil moisture close to a desired level. We evaluated our algorithm
    using collected data from a seepage-irrigated commercial sweetcorn field in South
    Florida. Our evaluations covered each component of our system, from model validation
    to overall system performance. As a principal outcome, the proposed algorithm
    presents the potential to save 30% of water in this type of irrigation system.
    This water-saving is facilitated through effective and achievable computed irrigation
    scheduling that maintains soil moisture within a targeted range. Such control
    preserves optimal growing conditions and minimizes environmental risks by preventing
    runoff, percolation, and the leaching of hazardous agricultural chemicals into
    the surrounding ecosystem. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 starts with an overview of soil moisture and irrigation scheduling,
    establishes the problem of formulating a control-oriented DSS for irrigation scheduling,
    and offers a detailed description of the proposed DSS algorithm. Section 3 describes
    the process following to validate the proposed algorithm. In Section 4, the results
    of the validation are presented and discussed. Finally, in Section 5, some conclusions
    are drawn. 2. Methods 2.1. Process description and problem formulation The relationship
    between irrigation, soil, plants, and the environment constitutes a complex system
    that requires practical concepts and analogies to formulate optimal irrigation
    strategies. As delineated in Eisenhauer et al. (2021), soil can be conceptualized
    as a reservoir, with different levels representing the amount of water available
    for plant uptake. We adopt this conceptual framework to simplify a complex problem
    that involves agriculture, control theory, and human interaction and to formulate
    the control problem on a DSS for irrigation management. Within this context, we
    identify key input and output variables, delineate desired conditions or set points,
    and specify agricultural constraints and human limitations. Download : Download

    of soil moisture states significant for plant-water relations and irrigation control
    based on Eisenhauer et al. (2021). The Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) delineates
    the lower threshold of soil water content at which plants cannot recover from
    water stress, marking the limiting boundary for plant survivability. The Maximum
    Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical reference, as soil moisture levels
    below this point result in sub-optimal physiological responses in plants. The
    soil moisture range between MADP and Field Capacity (FC) is optimal for plant
    growth, balancing water availability and stress prevention. Surpassing FC leads
    to inefficient water use, soil structural degradation, anaerobic root conditions,
    nutrient leaching, and the potential for surface water pollution. Beyond the Saturation
    Point (SP), the soil reaches its hydraulic limit, becoming incapable of retaining
    additional moisture. Fig. 1 illustrates this analogy: the base level, or the Permanent
    Wilting Point (PWP), indicates that below this threshold level, plants cannot
    extract water from the soil, leading to irreversible wilting. The next critical
    point is the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP); if the soil moisture drops
    below this level, the plants undergo water stress, potentially reducing yield.
    Consequently, MADP often serves as a guideline for irrigation decisions as the
    lower limit. However, its precise value, i.e., the percentage of MADP as the lower
    limit, can vary based on the crop, its growth stage, and prevailing climatic conditions.
    For instance, Bayabil et al. (2023) demonstrated that using only 75% of the expected
    MADP saved 25% of water consumption, with no reduction in sweet corn yield. Similarly,
    strategic deficit irrigation during certain growth stages of wine grapes enhances
    fruit quality for winemaking (Kang et al., 2023). From a control systems perspective,
    the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical set-point or lower-bound
    constraint that must be maintained. Failure to uphold soil moisture levels at
    or above this threshold can lead to suboptimal plant physiological responses and
    yield reduction. The Field Capacity (FC) is defined as the soil water content
    threshold beyond which the gravitational drainage is negligible and is considered
    the upper limit. Below FC, the capillary actions keep the water stored in the
    soil pores. Irrigating until reaching FC and avoiding exceeding field capacity
    prevents the leaching of nutrients and pesticides applied to the crops. The saturation
    point (SP) is attained when the soil can no longer retain water, leading to runoff
    on the surface, which poses significant environmental concerns. Soil texture significantly
    influences key hydraulic characteristics such as the PWP, FC, and SP. Saxton and
    Rawls (2006) provide detailed hydraulic characteristics across various soil textures,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2. From this figure, it becomes evident that managing irrigation
    in sandy soil is notably challenging. A simple 5% fluctuation in water content
    in such soil can either lead to plant wilting or result in water wastage. In contrast,
    silt soils offer better flexibility: water content can vary by as much as 24%
    without triggering any adverse agricultural or ecological consequences. Therefore,
    the soil’s proportion of sand, silt, and clay plays an important role in the control
    problem definition and for specific irrigation decisions. Conceptually, for control
    purposes, soil can be viewed as a storage unit, where the area depends on the
    soil texture, the control input is irrigation, and the control objective is maintaining
    the volumetric water content to a desired level. However, additional considerations
    must also be included in the case of a DSS for irrigation control. Download :

    Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) of 50% of the available water for each
    soil class. Points over each bar denote the specific values. This figure is based
    on the hydraulic characteristics reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006). 2.1.1. Control
    challenges on a decision support system for irrigation scheduling A DSS for irrigation
    scheduling is particularly useful in farm systems with no automatic control elements,
    where the grower or irrigation manager carries out irrigation actions. In our
    proposed DSS, the control problem is to use available information from crops and
    weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions that help the user minimize
    the error between desired and measured soil moisture. Below, we discuss some considerations
    that must be addressed. Timely Human Response: The grower or irrigation manager
    cannot execute irrigation instructions quickly and suddenly. For that, even if
    sensors and computational capabilities can offer periodic information with sampling
    periods of minutes or seconds, this information will be unhelpful and might overwhelm
    or confuse the operator. Moreover, if an irrigation instruction suddenly appears
    when the operator is unavailable to make an irrigation action, it might not generate
    the expected result. Actuation Precision: Many conventional irrigation systems
    rely on actuators that operate more as binary switches than precision instruments.
    In agriculture, it is common to find devices such as on–off pumps, gates, weirs,
    and valves, which are unsuited for precise operation. Hence, recommendations should
    be straightforward and actionable, such as suggesting irrigation during a time
    rather than maintaining a specific flow rate. Human Reliability: Even with precise
    recommendations from the DSS, human behavior introduces variability. External
    influences can alter the final action taken, introducing a layer of uncertainty.
    Considered Measurable Variables: In most agricultural practices, rain ( ), irrigation
    ( ), and temperature ( ) are the main measurable variables affecting root zone
    soil moisture ( ). While capillary effects from the deep soil also influence root
    zone soil moisture, quantifying these effects necessitates more elaborated measurement
    techniques compared to the direct measurement of the aforementioned variables.
    Integration of Weather Forecasts: Meteorological advancements have made weather
    predictions increasingly accurate. Governments worldwide are making concerted
    efforts to provide weather forecasts as part of impact-based decision-support
    services. These forecasts, especially regarding expected rainfall and temperature,
    are crucial for making informed irrigation decisions, ensuring optimal water use,
    and supporting crop health. 2.2. Proposed approach We address the control challenges
    by proposing a DSS presented in Fig. 3, which integrates measured information
    from the crop and weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions. The
    DSS integrates control theory and accommodates timely human response by working
    periodically and allowing the grower to determine the irrigation period1 for these
    executions. Furthermore, the DSS provides practical and realizable irrigation
    instructions, given in units of volume per irrigation period or irrigation time
    per irrigation period. For instance, if the grower selects a two-day irrigation
    period, the DSS will calculate the necessary volume of water or irrigation time
    that must be applied for each two-day interval. Download : Download high-res image

    proposed Decision Support System (DSS) for irrigation scheduling. The description
    illustrates the measured variables, where represents the instant time when the
    data is obtained, indicates the temperature, rain, soil moisture, and irrigation.
    The DSS is formulated with four main components: (i) the control-oriented model
    (COM), used as a base of the control algorithm; (ii) the data processing stage
    for aligning multi-temporal sensor data with algorithmic components; (iii) a parameter
    estimation stage for updating model parameters ( ); and (iv) a control algorithm
    that utilizes the COM, estimated parameters, processed measurements, and weather
    forecasts to calculate irrigation instructions ( ). The DSS uses measured variables
    from the crop, where rain and temperature can be obtained from a weather station,
    and volumetric water content can be obtained from soil moisture sensors. To address
    the system’s robustness against human variability in irrigation execution, our
    DSS additionally considers measuring this execution, i.e., obtaining measurements
    of irrigation time per irrigation period or volume of water per irrigation period.
    This measurement can be obtained from flowmeters or sensors for flow detection.
    The proposed approach (Fig. 3) is supported by (i) a COM of the SM, (ii) a data
    processing stage, (iii) a parameter estimation stage, and (iv) a control algorithm.
    In this approach, the COM serves as a parametrizable model that characterizes
    soil moisture as a function of processed measured variables and parameters to
    be estimated. At each irrigation period, the estimation stage calculates and updates
    the parameters. Then, the control stage uses the COM, the estimated parameters,
    soil moisture measurements, and weather forecasting data to determine the appropriate
    irrigation action that maintains the soil moisture at the desired value. A detailed
    breakdown of each component of the DSS is provided below. 2.2.1. Proposed control-oriented
    model for soil moisture The most important element of the proposed strategy is
    the COM. In agriculture, traditional models often focus on capturing the complexity
    of various biophysical processes. Although accurate, these models are often computationally
    expensive and not straightforwardly applicable for control design. We have derived
    the COM from a simplified water balance, as Fig. 4 describes. This model considers
    the soil a storage unit, where a linear combination of adaptable parameters and
    measured variables performs a water balance with inputs, including rain, irrigation,
    and upward capillarity. On the other hand, outputs include evapotranspiration,
    deep percolation, and runoff. The choice of a simplified model inevitably raises
    concerns about the sacrifice of modeling accuracy. However, in our DSS algorithm,
    this drawback is mitigated by continual parameter estimation based on real-time
    data and by incorporating feedback in the control equation. Our COM is formulated
    based on three assumptions: Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download

    dynamics, where , and are outputs associated with evapotranspiration, and deep
    percolation; , , and are inputs associated to rain, irrigation, and capillary
    rise. Assumption 1 Model Sampling Period The COM is formulated with a fixed time
    step, denoted by , corresponding to the irrigation period. This fixed period allows
    for the discretization of soil moisture dynamics, indexed by the variable . Our
    DSS algorithm is based on the COM, which is discrete and will describe the soil
    moisture dynamics according to the irrigation period ( ). The grower or irrigation
    manager can configure to suit their operational preferences. Consequently, the
    COM and, by extension, the DSS algorithm are adaptable to those preferences. For
    instance, if a two-day irrigation period is selected, the COM will effectively
    model soil moisture dynamics under this discrete time interval. It is highlighted
    that, in practice, sensors often provide data at multiple sampling frequencies.
    We have designed specific data management techniques to reconcile this multiplicity
    of data with the user-defined irrigation period . These techniques are detailed
    in Section 2.2.2. Assumption 2 Soil Moisture Average During an appropriate irrigation
    period, it is reasonable to presume that the available water for the plants within
    the root zone is closely around an average soil moisture value, denoted as . This
    assumption enables us to formulate the control objective as maintaining this average
    soil moisture close to a desired level . This assumption simplifies both the model
    and the DSS algorithm. However, we clarify that choosing a lengthy irrigation
    period might be comfortable for the irrigation manager but can be risky for the
    plant’s health. Conversely, opting for shorter irrigation periods can mitigate
    potential water deficit issues during this period, but at the expense of demand
    for more managerial time. The optimal irrigation period depends on the crop type,
    environmental conditions, and highly on soil type. For instance, sandy soils,
    characterized by low water retention capacities, necessitate shorter irrigation
    periods than silt soils, which can retain almost six times more water (see Fig.
    2). It is pertinent to note that the temporal resolution of the COM is directly
    correlated with the chosen irrigation period . A shorter irrigation period effectively
    enhances the temporal resolution, allowing the model to capture more rapid fluctuations
    in soil moisture and other variables. However, this comes at the expense of increased
    computational and managerial demands. The adaptability in selecting allows for
    a trade-off between temporal resolution and operational convenience. Assumption
    3 Linear Relation Soil moisture operates as a causal system. The future average
    soil moisture is influenced by its prior water content and the inputs and outputs
    during this irrigation period. We are considering average soil moisture variation
    between successive irrigation periods, which is represented as , as a linear relation
    of the water balance during such irrigation period. We are formulating that in
    the upcoming irrigation period, the soil moisture average will depend on the actual
    soil moisture average and a linear combination between parameters (rates of change)
    and accumulated amounts of water inputs and outputs during the current irrigation
    period. In this form, we denote water input as the accumulated amount of rain
    during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change between and
    . Note that the rain units are commonly expressed in units of the water depth
    accumulated in the area under study. Since is a summation of measurements, it
    retains the same depth units, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture
    per unit of depth. Similarly, we denote the input as the accumulated amount of
    irrigation during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change
    between and . Irrigation can be measured in units of depth, volume, or, in our
    case, for simplifying sensor instrumentation and data acquisition, irrigation
    time. reflects the total time that the crop is irrigated during the irrigation
    period, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture per unit of time. To streamline
    the electronic instrumentation, we are not considering measured variables corresponding
    to the capillary rise input, as this capillary rise comes from the water table.
    Instead, the input associated with capillary rise will be treated as an unknown
    parameter, denoted by . As discussed in the process description (Section 2.1),
    the infiltration and runoff are directly related to the soil moisture. For that,
    we are associating this output to the combination between the soil moisture average
    and the parameter , which is adimensional and represents the rate of change between
    and . The most adopted method to evaluate evapotranspiration is the FAO-56. This
    method requires the measurement of multiple environmental variables beyond the
    scope of our DSS, such as net radiation, soil heat flux, wind speed, saturation
    vapor pressure, and actual vapor pressure. Inspired by simpler models such as
    the Hargreaves Method (Gao et al., 2017), we overcome this issue by relating evapotranspiration
    directly to the temperature average ( ) via the estimated parameter , which has
    soil moisture per temperature units and describes the rate of change between and
    . Therefore, according to the assumptions and the proposed linear combinations
    that describe the system inputs and outputs, our parametrizable COM is formulated
    as (1) where , , , , and are positive parameters to be estimated, and the variables
    , , , and are obtained in the data processing stage from measured raw data. 2.2.2.
    Data processing stage The primary objective of this stage is to utilize measured
    data to compute the average soil moisture, total rainfall, total irrigation, and
    average temperature over the duration of the irrigation period. In that form,
    knowing a fixed irrigation period spanning from the time instant to and considering
    the sampling period of the respective sensor as , the number of samples within
    an irrigation period can be defined as: (2) With this, the average soil moisture
    is determined by: (3) Similarly, the average temperature is given by: (4) The
    accumulated rainfall over the period is computed as follows: (5) The accumulated
    irrigation is: (6) In Fig. 3, the data processing stage also processes rain and
    temperature forecast data. This data process uses the same methods followed in
    Eqs. (5), (4), considering the sampling time used for the forecasting provider.
    The expected accumulated rainfall for the next irrigation period is noted as ,
    and the expected temperature average is noted as . 2.2.3. Parameter estimation
    stage We aim to estimate the parameters inherent to the COM, namely , , , , .
    Our strategy hinges on maintaining a record of processed data, from which we derive
    an optimization-based approach for parameter estimation. This method is a variation
    of the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) technique (Rao et al., 2001). Our variation
    comprises an expanding estimation window, and this is slightly different from
    the conventional MHE, where a fixed-size window is used. Moreover, we propose
    to ensure the estimated parameters’ optimality by formulating a two-step estimator.
    The decision to use an expanding window arises from the unique characteristics
    of seasonal crops and the observed irrigation practices by growers. Notably, some
    crops can be ready for harvest just 30 days post-planting. Additionally, the irrigation
    schedules set by growers can fluctuate significantly, ranging anywhere from one
    to more than five days. Given these dynamics, valuing and utilizing every data
    collected from the crop throughout its growth cycle is imperative. Moreover, with
    a fixed-size estimation window, we risk encountering data windows without rain
    events or irrigation events, which can impact the estimation of parameters related
    to rain and irrigation. We use an expanding estimation window to mitigate this,
    ensuring the algorithm always has access to a sufficient data set. For permanent
    crops, the analysis might benefit from a moving window with a fixed size long
    enough to guarantee optimal parameter estimation. For data aggregation within
    this expanding window, we consider vectors of processed data from the instant
    to the instant . Hence, the processed data for soil moisture, rainfall, irrigation,
    and temperature within each estimation window is defined as: with . In that form,
    according to the corresponding estimation window, the parameters , , , , and are
    estimated at each irrigation period, given adaptive characteristics to the COM.
    We employ a two-step estimation strategy to guarantee the optimality of our estimated
    parameters: the first step estimates parameters in association with measured variables.
    In contrast, the subsequent step estimates the parameter linked to the water table.
    Prior estimation step At this step, we assume a water table’s slow dynamic variation
    in seepage irrigation and general water table elevation. For that, has a low incidence
    in the variation of the soil moisture. Consequently, we exclude in the first estimation
    step. This step estimates the parameters that minimize the quadratic error between
    the soil moisture variation and the linear combination between the measured variables
    and the parameters associated with the measured variables. In this estimation
    step, we are including a constraint to ensure that all the parameters must be
    positive to conserve the proposed physical relation of the mass balance. The proposed
    optimization problem is formulated as follows: Download : Download high-res image
    (40KB) Download : Download full-size image where is the vector of parameters that
    are associated with measured variables , and is the quadratic error described
    as (8) with , and . For the optimization problem (Eq. (7)), the linear constraints
    imply that an optimal solution is achievable if is convex. The convexity of this
    cost function can be established if its Hessian matrix respect to is positive
    definite (Bhatia, 2015), which in turn depends on the linear independence of the
    columns in . Variability in soil moisture and temperature can generally be assumed,
    ensuring the linear independence of corresponding columns in . However, given
    that rainfall and irrigation can exhibit extended periods of invariability, the
    algorithm is designed to commence only when observed variability in and is confirmed.
    Subsequent estimation step After estimating the parameters associated with the
    measured variables, is estimated. As we consider this parameter directly related
    to the soil moisture, we propose to find the parameter that minimizes the quadratic
    error between the measured soil moisture and the estimated soil moisture with
    initial conditions given by . Where the estimated soil moisture is obtained from
    the water balance in Eq. (1), and the numerical solution of the model (Eq. (1)),
    which is described as (9) In that form, we propose a subsequent optimization problem
    described as Download : Download high-res image (40KB) Download : Download full-size
    image where is the quadratic cost function given by (11) with . In this optimization
    problem, the constraints are also linear. In Appendix, it is shown that by appropriate
    substitutions, appear as a linear combination into the numerical solution given
    by , confirming the convexity of the cost function and that optimal solutions
    of also can be guarantee. 2.2.4. Control stage In the control stage, the COM,
    the estimated parameters, the processed measured variables, and the forecasted
    variables are integrated to calculate the amount of water that must be applied
    during the irrigation period. This stage is an adaptive, predictive, and feedback-plus
    feedforward control strategy. The main objective is to use measured and forecast
    information to estimate the appropriate irrigation ( ) that maintains the soil
    moisture close to a desired value. We explain the control strategy in four steps,
    where first, the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the estimated parameters obtained
    in Eqs. (7), and (10), and the processed measured data (Eqs. (3), (4), (5), and
    (6)) are used to predict (or forecast) the soil moisture one step ahead ( ) as
    follows: (12) Second, we use the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the predicted
    soil moisture , forecast rain and temperature data ( , and , and we assume that
    in the next irrigation period, the estimated parameter variation can be neglected
    or in other words that . With this information, we predict the soil moisture two
    steps ahead ( ) as follows: (13) Third, we establish the objective to deduce the
    irrigation amount to be applied, such as two steps ahead, the predicted soil moisture
    will be equal to the desired soil moisture. Therefore, by replacing in Eq. (13)
    and obtaining , we deduce the irrigation amount equation as follows: (14) Fourth,
    to analyze and understand the elements of the irrigation amount equation, we define
    the expected error between the desired soil moisture and the expected soil moisture
    as . Therefore, Eq. (14) can be rewritten as follows: (15) where the elements
    of the irrigation control equation can be described as components of the water
    balance that equilibrates the soil moisture around the desired value as follows:
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate for the difference
    between the desired moisture and the expected average of the soil moisture; is
    the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that, during
    the irrigation period, was lost due infiltration; is the volume of irrigation
    water that can be hold based on the expected rain during the irrigation period;
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that
    is expected to be lost due evapotranspiration; is the amount of water the crop
    will receive from capillary rise. Note that this control action is a case of adaptive
    control, knows a self-tuning regulator, where the stability of the controlled
    system is conditioned to the accuracy of the estimated parameters and the grade
    of uncertainty between the controlled system and the estimated system (Åström
    and Wittenmark, 2008). 3. Experimental verification The algorithm was validated
    using on-field measurements from a commercial sweetcorn field in South Florida.
    This data was initially collected as part of an integrated research and extension
    project focused on improving farmers’ adoption of soil moisture sensors for irrigation
    scheduling in vegetable farms. We evaluated our DSS algorithm using readings from
    soil moisture probes, a weather station, and a pressure transducer deployed in
    the commercial field. In this section, we describe the data collection process
    and the algorithm evaluation towards establishing the potential benefits of the
    algorithm in comparison with the information obtained from the grower irrigation
    practices. As shown in Fig. 5, we installed sensors to measure soil moisture,
    precipitation, environmental temperature, and irrigation management from December
    21, 2022, to January 11, 2023. Due to confidentiality agreements, the precise
    location of the commercial field remains undisclosed in this study. The soil in
    this field is classified as waveland and lawnwood fine sands. Following the hydraulic
    properties reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006) (Fig. 2), this soil is characterized
    by a permanent wilting point of 5%, a field capacity of 10%, and a saturation
    point of 46%. The field water movement and location of the sensors are described
    in Fig. 5, where the field is surrounded by a channel supplied by a pump drawing
    from a natural water source. Water is distributed from this surrounding channel
    to the crops via pipes. This water is then dispersed into ditches across the field.
    These ditches feature interconnected silts that facilitate water transport to
    the plant beds. Irrigation is accomplished by increasing the water level in the
    channel. It is important to note that this system operates under the assumption
    of homogeneous water distribution, with the water supply pump serving as the unique
    control element. Download : Download high-res image (568KB) Download : Download

    deployment of a weather station, a soil moisture sensor, and a pressure transducer.
    The blue lines delineate the water distribution inflow utilized for irrigating
    the agricultural field under study. Under the homogeneous water distribution consideration,
    moisture measurements were taken in the root zone at a depth of 0.3 m, using a
    Sentek Drill & Drop 60 cm soil moisture probe, which is capable of measuring soil
    moisture, temperature, and salinity at uniformly spaced depths every 0.1 m, providing
    a profile up to 0.6 m depth (Sentek, 2018). The sampling time was 1800 s. Rain
    and temperature data were obtained using a Davis Vantage Pro2 GroWeather 6820c
    weather station (Davis, 2023). The sampling time was 900 s. Irrigation measurements
    were taken by installing a KPSI 700 pressure sensor at the bottom of the channel.
    This sensor has a range of 0.7–210 m, an accuracy of 1% with analog output from
    0 to 10 V. The objective was to identify sudden increases related to pump activation
    to establish the irrigation time during the irrigation period. The pressure sensor
    was connected to a CR1000X datalogger of Cambell Scientific (Campbell, 2023) with
    a sampling time of 300 s, and the irrigation management was established by analyzing
    this information. The proposed DSS algorithm was tested using Matlab software
    version R2022a (Matlab, 2022). The irrigation period was selected by analyzing
    the irrigation management given by the grower. We observed that the management
    given by the grower was in function of soil and crop appearance, irrigating when
    required, and turning the pump on and off with an elapsed time between 1 and 6
    days. Given this information, our algorithm testing incorporated an irrigation
    period of two days ( ). We consider that with this period, we can provide reasonable
    timing actions from the grower. We added normally distributed random noise to
    the measured data to simulate the inherent stochasticity in weather forecasts.
    Specifically, the magnitude of this noise was set at 10% of the standard deviation
    of the actual measured data. In the context of rainfall predictions, any resultant
    negative values post-noise addition were truncated to zero. The maximum allowable
    depletion for sweet corn was considered 50% (Bayabil et al., 2023). We determined
    the desired soil moisture between 7.5% and 10%. We selected a desired soil moisture
    of 9% to stay far from the maximum allowable depletion point and accommodate uncertainties
    in soil characteristics. Before initializing the algorithm, we converted missing
    data entries to zeros. Soil moisture and irrigation data underwent homogenization
    through interpolation to match the 900 s rain and temperature data sampling interval.
    In the prior estimation step, the optimization problem was formulated as a quadratic
    programming problem and iteratively solved using the “quadprog” tool in Matlab.
    In the subsequent estimation stage, the optimization problem was iteratively addressed
    using a sequential quadratic programming method with the “fmincon” tool in Matlab.
    Then, in the test, the data is processed at each irrigation period to obtain the
    corresponding averages of the temperature and soil moisture and the corresponding
    amounts of accumulated rain and accumulated irrigation applied by the grower.
    Moreover, the model’s parameters are estimated at each irrigation period, and
    the recommended irrigation is computed. We evaluated the overall DSS algorithm
    by applying the computed control action to the parametrized COM. We are addressing
    the uncertainties related to assuming negligible estimated parameter changes between
    consecutive irrigation periods by adding stochastic variability, which was obtained
    by analyzing the variation of the estimated parameters and adding a randomized
    normal distributed disturbance with a standard deviation equal to the observed
    standard deviation of . In that form, the stochastic soil moisture prediction
    is given by (16) where , , , , and are the corresponding disturbances. In consequence,
    the evaluated control action is also disturbed by including the stochastic soil
    moisture prediction as (17) Below, we present the outcomes of our analysis. 4.
    Results and discussion Fig. 6 shows the results of the data processing stage.
    Note how the temperature ( ) shows a periodic component related to day and night
    patterns, also presented in the soil moisture ( ). However, this periodic component
    is removed in both the processed temperature ( ) and soil moisture ( ). In the
    case of accumulated rain ( ), the processed data is presented as the cumulative
    sum for each irrigation period. The grower irrigation decision represents the
    accumulated hours the grower irrigated during each irrigation period. The data
    processing stage is pivotal in aligning the measured data with the model and significantly
    mitigating uncertainties from the measured parameters of soil moisture, temperature,
    rain, and irrigation. As described, this stage computes the average soil moisture,
    total rainfall, total irrigation, and average temperature over the duration of
    each irrigation period. This computation aids in filtering out uncertainties and
    undesired data anomalies provided by sensors and forecasting methods. By averaging
    soil moisture over an irrigation period, the impact of incorrect measurements
    and transient spikes not contemplated in the model and random fluctuations are
    reduced, leading to more representative information on the available water for
    the plants. For example, in Fig. 6, an anomalous temperature measurement close
    to −20 °C is observed on Jan-08-23. This incorrect measurement was filtered out
    in the processed temperature data, thus attenuating its influence. Furthermore,
    considering accumulated rain and irrigation data in the data processing stage
    notably enhances the DSS robustness by minimizing the influence of uncertainty
    in both the measurement and prediction processes. It is essential to emphasize
    that uncertainties in measured rainfall and irrigation data, sampled every 900
    s, have a diminished impact on the estimation and control stages as the duration
    of the irrigation period increases. This reduction in the influence of data uncertainty
    is pivotal for the robustness, accuracy, and reliability of the entire DSS algorithm.

    and the average and distribution of the estimation errors for each estimation

    The lowest recorded correlation and values are 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. In
    addition, the -value starts at and decreases as the estimation window expands,
    reaching a minimum of . The consistently high correlation and values across all
    estimation windows suggest that the estimation algorithm performs well in describing
    the dynamics of the soil moisture average. The lowest value of 0.84 indicates
    that, in the worst-case scenario, the COM can explain an 84% of the variability
    in the soil moisture average. On the other hand, the lowest correlation value
    of 0.92 indicates that we are reaching a strong linear relationship between the
    proposed COM and the observed soil moisture averages. The low and decreasing -value
    describes a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the estimations, which
    increases as the estimation window increases. Download : Download high-res image

    The figure also visualizes prediction error behavior for each prediction instance.
    The results indicate that the average estimation error across all estimation windows
    is around zero, with maximum standard deviations of . The prediction error is
    similarly centered around zero, exhibiting maximum and minimum errors of . As
    the estimation window increases, the prediction error decreases. However, an increase
    in the prediction error is evidenced on Feb-05. This problem is also observed
    in the estimation analyses, with a decrease in the and correlation. On this particular
    estimation, the commercial sweetcorn field experienced an intense rainfall of
    26.67 mm within 24 h. This led to a substantial change in soil moisture levels,
    which the algorithm failed to estimate accurately, resulting in a peak error of
    3.29%. This behavior shows that close to the desired operation region (between
    the MADP and FC), the soil–water relation can be described as a linear model,
    where our COM can accurately describe the dynamics. However, the COM accuracy
    reduces in extreme events that move the SM content away from the desired operation
    region. Our proposed approach overcomes the uncertainties associated with using
    a simplified modeling approach by considering a recursive parameters estimation
    strategy that lets the model adapt to changing crop and environmental conditions.
    The modeling and estimation approach is capable of accurately describing the soil
    moisture dynamics close to the operation region, overcoming associated uncertainties,
    and can be used as a baseline for making irrigation decisions. To delve deeper
    into the validation and performance of our modeling and estimation approach, a
    comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the estimated parameters is subsequently
    provided. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the parameters and the incidence of
    the estimated parameters in the COM. It can be observed that the parameters associated
    with moisture ( ), irrigation ( ), rain ( ), and temperature ( ) exhibits a low
    dispersion in contrast with the parameter associated to the capillary rise ( ).
    A sensitivity analysis of the estimated parameters can be performed by multiplying
    the obtained parameters by the maximum reported value per respective variable,
    obtaining how much the soil moisture can increase or decrease according to the
    parameter dispersion and the maximum values reported for each variable. The results
    show that during an irrigation period, the soil moisture could (i) decrease a
    1.5% concerning maximum soil moisture of 13.6%; (ii) increase around 3.6% with
    48 h of continuous irrigation; (iii) increase around a 3.7% in relation with 26
    (mm) of rain on a period of 48 h; (iv) decrease around 0.3% with a maximum temperature
    average of 23.3 (°C); and (v) increase around 0.06% in relation with the capillary
    rise. Note that the parameter that shows the high dispersion in the estimation
    process is . However, gives the most significant influence. Moreover, it is observed
    that soil water losses from leaching and runoff could be five times higher than
    the amount lost due to high temperature, which is related to the evapotranspiration
    process. Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Distribution of the parameters and incidence of their distribution
    in the model. Fig. 10 shows that the variations of the estimated parameters are
    distributed close to zero. This dispersion accounts for the expected variation
    that the parameters could present between irrigation periods. For example, in
    the case of rain, from Fig. 9, we have that the parameter associated ( ) is close
    to 0.11. From the standard deviation of , we can expect that this parameter could
    be different around in the next irrigation period. This uncertainty is reflected
    in the prediction of the soil moisture Eq. (16) and in the control action, which
    is taken based on that prediction. For that, the standard deviations of the variation
    of the parameters shown in Fig. 10 are used to add uncertainty and perform a realistic
    simulation in the presence of such uncertainty. The results of the controlled
    system are shown in Fig. 11, where we compare the system’s measured data with
    the expected data if the proposed algorithm is used to manage irrigation. Download

    between and is imperceptible. This is because the added normally distributed random
    data is filtered in the process stage. This is important because a similar result
    can be expected by using data from the corresponding weather forecasting services,
    highlighting the importance of the data processing stage in enhancing the algorithm’s
    robustness. On the other hand, it is observed that due to the processing stage,
    rain presents more sensitivity to the added random data. That is because, in the
    case of rain, the limitation to zero of the applied noise affects his distribution.

    irrigation actions (red) and recommended irrigation actions by our DSS. In Fig.
    11, we are also presenting the comparison between the measured soil moisture and
    the expected soil moisture if the grower uses the computed recommended irrigation
    . In the comparison, we included the desired soil moisture ( ), and we can observe
    how the controlled moisture tries to be around this value. It is important to
    mention that the computation of starts on January 02, when the first prediction
    data is available (see Fig. 7); before that, and are the same. The most notable
    difference between the irrigation scheduling given by the grower and the irrigation
    scheduling computed by the algorithm is that the algorithm does not generate saturated
    irrigation actions of 48 h. The algorithm aims to uphold an average irrigation
    duration of 10 h every two days. This duration fluctuates proportionally with
    forecasted temperature changes (as seen on January 18) and inversely in response
    to anticipated rain events (as evidenced on January 24). On the other hand, the
    decisions taken by the grower show that he is reacting to extreme events. For
    example, on January 18, the irrigation was turned off when the average soil moisture
    reached a maximum of 13.85% (percolation). Also, it is observed that the irrigation
    is turned on on February 01, when the soil moisture is close to reaching the allowable
    depletion point of 7.5%. In contrast, the controlled moisture is close to 9, avoiding
    the environmental impact of percolation and also avoiding the crop risk of reaching
    an allowable depletion point. However, it is important to mention that the decisions
    taken by the grower show expertise in dealing with this complex process on the
    most difficult type of soil (see Fig. 2), avoiding the allowable depletion point
    and maintaining the soil moisture close to the available water region. Fig. 12
    compares the cumulative irrigation hours applied by the grower with those used
    for the proposed algorithm. On February 09, the grower reported a total of 367
    h of irrigation, while the algorithm used a total of 258 h. This result demonstrates
    the potential of our algorithm to save 30% of the water typically used in seepage-irrigated
    crops in Florida. Notably, seepage irrigation systems are known for their low
    efficiency, often falling below 40% (Dukes et al., 2010). Despite this inefficiency,
    they remain prevalent in Florida. According to the current grower records (personal
    communication), a single hectare of seepage-irrigated sweet corn can consume around
    1500 m3 of water per season. Using this volume consumption as a baseline, our
    proposed algorithm has the capacity to increase water use efficiency up to 450
    m3 per hectare per season. This finding underscores the substantial water-saving
    potential of our DSS, highlighting its significance for sustainable agriculture
    if it is adopted in the state of Florida. Download : Download high-res image (176KB)

    of irrigation hours between the grower technique and the recommendations provided
    by the proposed decision support system. Our study demonstrates significant advancements
    in irrigation management, particularly in incorporating information from weather
    forecasting services to optimize irrigation scheduling. Our approach has shown
    reduced irrigation time in response to anticipated rainfall events. This predictive
    capability offers a distinct improvement over fully automated systems as those
    reported by Domínguez-Niño et al. (2020) and approaches that at the beginning
    of the season precalculate irrigation management based on crop models as reported
    by Hodges et al. (2022), where a consistent reduction in irrigation corresponding
    to rainfall is not evident. We also highlight that the proposed strategy integrates
    multiple information sources for optimal irrigation management based on soil moisture
    and water balance. This is an advancement over the traditional approach presented
    by El-Naggar et al. (2020), where the use of soil moisture sensors and soil water
    balances are seen as independent control techniques, which are compared to elucidate
    the most suitable irrigation practices. While the modernization of irrigation
    systems, as discussed by Çetin et al. (2023), is crucial for sustainable agriculture
    and water conservation, it often involves significant initial investments. This
    can be a major barrier in regions still reliant on traditional irrigation methods
    such as seepage. Our research addresses this challenge by demonstrating that substantial
    water savings can be achieved without full-scale modernization and automation
    of irrigation systems. Our study’s results highlight our approach’s environmental
    benefits, presenting it as a cost-effective alternative for enhancing the sustainability
    of irrigation practices in diverse agricultural settings. Future studies involve
    evaluating the algorithm across varied agricultural settings, encompassing different
    soil types, irrigation methods, different regions, and crops. This is crucial
    for assessing its adaptability and efficacy in water conservation. Concurrently,
    efforts will be directed towards integrating this adaptive decision support system
    (DSS) into accessible digital platforms such as smartphone applications and websites,
    simplifying irrigation decision-making for farmers. Enhancing the DSS algorithm
    will involve developing advanced modeling and estimation techniques to accurately
    estimate and forecast soil moisture dynamics under extreme environmental conditions,
    considering their random and complex nature. The enhancement also includes refining
    predictive models and automated control strategies for more precise irrigation
    scheduling. A key aspect is the creation of control algorithms with mixed objectives,
    such as minimizing irrigation while ensuring optimal crop yield. The implementation
    of Kalman filters and stochastic model predictive control techniques to manage
    forecast uncertainty must be explored. 5. Conclusions In this study, we introduced
    a technological solution to enhance the sustainability of water management in
    agriculture. We developed a decision support system algorithm for irrigation scheduling
    using principles from control theory. This algorithm encompasses modeling, processing,
    estimation, and control stages, ensuring the optimality of the model that describes
    the system. During the evaluation, the estimation stage achieved minimum correlation
    coefficients and values of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. The algorithm integrates
    the parametrized model, processed data, weather forecasting, and human limitations
    to conform an adaptive feedback plus feedforward irrigation predictive control
    strategy that considers human action in the control loop. The algorithm can consistently
    regulate soil moisture, ensuring it remains at desired levels. This approach reduced
    the risks associated with leaching and runoff and offered the potential for water
    savings of up to 30% in seepage irrigated crops on sandy soils. Looking forward,
    we plan to move towards end-user implementation to promote wider adoption and
    benefits of this technological solution. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: Water sustainability will be scarce in the coming decades because of
    global warming, an alarming situation for irrigation systems. The key requirement
    for crop production is water, and it also needs to fulfill the requirements of
    the ever-increasing population around the globe. The changing climate significantly
    impacts agriculture production due to the extreme weather conditions that prevail
    in various regions. Since urbanization is increasing worldwide, smart cities must
    find innovative ways to grow food sustainably within built environments. This
    paper explores how precision agriculture powered by artificial intelligence (AI)
    can transform crop farms (CF) to enhance food security, nutrition, and environmental
    sustainability. We developed a robotic CF prototype that uses deep reinforcement
    learning to optimize seeding, watering, and crop maintenance in response to real-time
    sensor data. The system was tested in a simulated CF setting and benchmarked.
    The results revealed a 26% increase in crop yield, a 41% reduction in water utilization,
    and a 33% decrease in chemical use. We employed AI-enabled precision farming to
    improve agriculture’s efficiency, sustainability, and productivity within smart
    cities. The widespread adoption of such technologies makes food supplies resilient,
    reduces land, and minimizes agriculture’s environmental footprint. This study
    also qualitatively assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision farming.
    Interviews with farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed the benefits
    of the proposed approach. The multidimensional impacts of precision crop farming
    beyond measurable outcomes emphasize its potential to foster social cohesion and
    well-being in urban communities.

    Water sustainability will be scarce in the coming decades because of global warming,
    an alarming situation for irrigation systems. The key requirement for crop production
    is water, and it also needs to fulfill the requirements of the ever-increasing
    population around the globe. The changing climate significantly impacts agriculture
    production due to the extreme weather conditions that prevail in various regions.
    Since urbanization is increasing worldwide, smart cities must find innovative
    ways to grow food sustainably within built environments. This paper explores how
    precision agriculture powered by artificial intelligence (AI) can transform crop
    farms (CF) to enhance food security, nutrition, and environmental sustainability.
    We developed a robotic CF prototype that uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize
    seeding, watering, and crop maintenance in response to real-time sensor data.
    The system was tested in a simulated CF setting and benchmarked. The results revealed
    a 26% increase in crop yield, a 41% reduction in water utilization, and a 33%

    agriculture’s efficiency, sustainability, and productivity within smart cities.
    The widespread adoption of such technologies makes food supplies resilient, reduces
    land, and minimizes agriculture’s environmental footprint. This study also qualitatively
    assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision farming. Interviews
    with farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed the benefits of the
    proposed approach. The multidimensional impacts of precision crop farming beyond

    Background on Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture has become an important
    strategy for the sustainable feeding of growing urban populations. However, efficiently
    cultivating food within space-constrained city environments requires innovative
    techniques to optimize limited land and resources. Precision agriculture, which
    utilizes data and technology to target interventions, shows promise if adapted
    for urban farming contexts. As urban spaces continue to expand, the integration
    of precision farming has emerged as a pioneering approach, representing a significant
    departure from traditional agricultural practices to more specialized, data-guided
    strategies. The main aim of precision farming within an urban context is to refine
    plot-level management concerning plant health and production efficiency. This
    is achieved through state-of-the-art technologies like satellite imaging, sensor
    technology, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and data analytics, which help to
    monitor and regulate urban green spaces and crops more efficiently for the betterment
    of public health. Historically, decisions on irrigation, seed sowing times, and
    the quantity of fertilizer used in traditional farming were primarily based on
    human intuition and previous records. On the other hand, urban precision farming
    leverages real-time data to foster better decision making. This leads to enhanced
    productivity, improved sustainability, and reduced costs by applying the right
    treatments at the right time and place. To deepen our understanding of these novel
    practices, Table 1 comprehensively compares various agricultural methods, briefly
    summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of each technique. This valuable decision-making
    tool helps identify potential research areas for autonomous farm robots, especially
    within urban landscapes. Table 1. Comparison of different methods in agriculture.
    1.2. Need for Sustainable Farming Practices The need for food is anticipated to
    increase significantly as the world population approaches 10 billion by 2050.
    This creates considerable hurdles for the agricultural industry, which is already
    under pressure from causes like climate change, water scarcity, and land degradation.
    Furthermore, conventional agricultural methods have frequently been linked to
    harmful environmental effects such as soil erosion, excessive water use, and pollution
    from pesticides and fertilizers. Figure 1 shows the evolution of agricultural
    machinery over time. Figure 1. Evolution of agricultural machinery. Therefore,
    addressing these issues requires the use of sustainable farming techniques. Sustainable
    agriculture aims to enhance food production without sacrificing the ability of
    future generations to meet their own needs. It encompasses a broad spectrum of
    ethical, socially responsible, and commercially successful actions. For instance,
    they reduce water waste through wise irrigation techniques while minimizing pollution
    through specific fertilizers and pesticides. 1.3. Introduction to Deep Reinforcement
    Learning (DRL) A sophisticated machine learning method, DRL, combines deep learning
    and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is concerned with how agents
    should behave in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards, whereas deep learning
    is designed to handle high-dimensional data. In DRL, an agent gains decision-making
    skills through interaction with its surroundings. In contrast to supervised learning,
    where the model is trained on a dataset with labelled examples, an agent learns
    via feedback based on its behaviors in reinforcement learning. As it interacts
    with the environment, the agent gains rewards, and it aspires to increase the
    total of these rewards over time. Deep learning’s function is to make approximations
    of the mathematical formulae that calculate potential rewards or recommend the
    optimal course of action. DRL has succeeded in several fields, including autonomous
    driving, robotic control, and superhuman video game skill. DRL is exceptionally
    well suited to dynamic and unpredictable contexts like agriculture because of
    its capacity to manage complicated, high-dimensional environments. The main objective
    of this research is to investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning may be incorporated
    into autonomous agricultural robots for adaptive seeding and water management.
    Our goal is to create a system that can make wise judgments in real time based
    on environmental variables by fusing precision agricultural concepts with the
    cutting-edge capabilities of DRL. This study focuses on implementing the Proximal
    Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a cutting-edge DRL method renowned for its
    sample efficiency and simplicity, in an autonomous agricultural robot outfitted
    with multiple sensors. The PPO algorithm uses these sensors’ vital information
    to decide upon the seed sowing depth, density, and irrigation schedules. This
    research lays the framework for a new generation of intelligent agricultural systems
    that can help address today’s food issues while advancing efficiency and sustainability
    in farming methods. Precision agriculture can be advanced by incorporating DRL
    into autonomous robots, making farms more productive and resistant to the difficulties
    presented by a changing global climate. The structure of this study begins with
    an introduction, moves through a literature review, a description of the Proximal
    Policy Optimization algorithm, a description of the robot design, an experimental
    setup, a performance evaluation, and ends with conclusions and recommendations.
    2. Literature Review Autonomous agricultural robot development began in the late
    20th century. According to [1,2,3], early agricultural robots mainly concentrated
    on straightforward tasks like weeding. Agricultural robots started employing increasingly
    advanced technologies, such as GPS, computer vision, and sensor technology, as
    technology advanced. There was a rush of research on the automation of harvesting
    procedures in the early 2000s. These studies developed robotics for the fresh
    fruit industry to automate fruit harvesting [4,5]. Agricultural robots have become
    more versatile over time as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) have advanced.
    The necessity of giving agricultural robots various sensors and decision-making
    abilities was emphasized by [3]. More recently, in 2017, Duckett et al. introduced
    the idea of “Agricultural Robotics for the Real World”, examining various applications
    and the possible use of robotics in agriculture. Most traditional seed-sowing
    techniques involve physical work. Initially, it was common to scatter seeds by
    hand; later, row-sowing equipment like seed drills were created [4]. Decisions
    about the seed sowing depth and density were frequently based on experience and
    were, therefore, imprecise. Farming has always depended heavily on effective water
    management. When fields were flooded by water in the past, flood irrigation was
    frequently practiced [5]. This approach could be more effective. Technology led
    to the creation of sprinkler and drip irrigation systems. Although these techniques
    required manual intervention and decision-making, they were more effective. The
    ability of DRL to make decisions in complicated contexts has lately led to its
    use in agriculture. Refs. [6,7,8,9,10] explored deep learning’s multiple agricultural
    applications, such as in crop and weed detection. DRL was used by [7] to optimize
    irrigation scheduling. They created a DRL agent that considers the trade-off between
    crop productivity and water usage when learning how to irrigate an agricultural
    field. Similarly, ref. [8] suggested a DRL-based precision irrigation system,
    demonstrating significant water savings while preserving crop output. A DRL-based
    telepresence robot with the ability to maneuver around was discussed in detail
    in [9,10,11,12]. Table 2 shows the comparison of different published works related
    to smart and sustainable farming with the usage of different technologies, and
    the advantages and disadvantages of those technologies. Table 2. Comparison of
    different published works in the related field. Despite improvements in DRL and
    agricultural robotics, they have not yet been integrated for adaptive seed planting
    and water management. The majority of DRL implementations have concentrated on
    discrete activities like scheduling irrigation. Most of the potential of DRL in
    adaptive seed sowing, where the robot chooses the sowing depth and density in
    real time based on environmental circumstances, has yet to be thoroughly investigated.
    Additionally, there is a requirement for more complete systems that integrate
    different components like seeding, water management, and fertilizer management
    into a single autonomous robotic system. Through DRL, such systems can be equipped
    to make integrated decisions while concurrently considering several elements [18,19,20,21,22,23,24].
    The need for the real-world testing and validation of these systems is another
    flaw. Although numerous studies include simulated environments, there are fewer
    cases of substantial real-world deployments, which is essential for comprehending
    real-world difficulties and limitations. Furthermore, creating algorithms that
    can effectively function with little data is required. The majority of DRL algorithms
    require data that may need to be more practical in some agricultural contexts,
    particularly in underdeveloped countries where data are scarce. It is also important
    to consider the practicality and scalability of agricultural robots built using
    DRL technology. Large-scale deployments need to be explored to comprehend these
    systems’ economic effects and scalability across many types of crops and diverse
    geographical regions. Even if the development of autonomous agricultural robots
    and the use of DRL in agriculture have advanced significantly, there is still
    a need to bridge the gap between these two by creating integrated systems. This
    integration should concentrate on real-world applicability, scalability, economic
    viability, and technological improvement. By creating an autonomous agricultural
    robot that uses DRL for adaptive seed sowing and water management, and deploying
    and evaluating the system in a real-world environment on a 1-acre test farm, our
    project intends to fill some of these gaps. Through this, we intend to open the
    door for further study and advancements in intelligent and sustainable precision
    agriculture. 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning 3.1. Overview of Deep Reinforcement
    Learning A branch of machine learning known as DRL combines deep learning and
    reinforcement learning (RL). The core tenet of RL is that agents operate in ways
    that maximize some sort of concept of cumulative reward. DRL develops this concept
    by approximating the functions required for difficult decision making using a
    neural network, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. DRL architecture and process.
    A set of states 𝑆 , a set of actions 𝐴 , and a policy, which is a mapping from
    states to actions, make up the basic context for RL: 𝜋: 𝑆 → 𝐴 . The agent interacts
    with environmental interaction by observing a state 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 , acting 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 , obtaining
    a reward r, and then changing to a new state 𝑠 ′ . Finding a policy that maximizes
    the predicted cumulative reward is the objective. The Q-function, which is designated
    as 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) and calculates the predicted cumulative reward of acting in state s
    and then following policy, is an essential part of RL. DRL uses deep neural networks
    to approximate the Q-function. Mathematically, the Q-function is defined by the
    Bellman equation in Equation (1): 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎)=𝑟+𝛾𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄( 𝑠 ′ ,  𝑎 ′ )) (1) where 0
    ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the discount factor. Here, 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄( 𝑠 ′ ,  𝑎 ′ )) represents the maximum
    predicted reward that can be achieved from the next state 𝑠 ′ , considering all
    possible actions 𝑎 ′ in that state. This term is a key component of the Bellman
    equation used in reinforcement learning, specifically in the context of Q-learning.
    It encapsulates the idea of an agent (in this case, the agricultural robot) learning
    to predict the total amount of reward it can expect in the future, given its current
    state and action. In order to approximate the Q-function, 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎; 𝜃) , DRL uses
    a neural network, which stands for the weights of the network. 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎; 𝜃) is a
    function approximated by a neural network, where 𝜃 represents the network’s weights,
    that is used to predict the expected rewards for taking action 𝑎 in state 𝑠 ,
    guiding the decision-making process of the agent. 3.2. Proximal Policy Optimization
    (PPO) Algorithm A policy optimization technique in DRL called Proximal Policy
    Optimization (PPO) aims to update the policy without making significant changes.
    Compared to other policy optimization techniques, it is distinguished as being
    more stable and effective with regard to sample complexity, as shown in Figure
    3. PPO works in two stages: Figure 3. PPO working principle. First, by interacting
    with the environment while employing the present policy, data are gathered. Second,
    the policy is optimized by maximizing an objective function. With each update,
    the policy can vary excessively, hindering learning. The PPO algorithm explicitly
    solves this problem. This is accomplished by optimizing a surrogate objective-containing
    modification of the policy gradient objective function, as shown in Equation (2):
    𝐿(𝜃)=𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑟(𝜃) 𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 , 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝(𝑟(𝜃),1−𝜀,1+𝜀)  𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 ) (2) Here, 𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 is the advantage
    function evaluating how good the action is compared to the average action; this
    function evaluates how much better an action is compared to the average action
    under the current policy. The advantage function is crucial in reinforcement learning
    as it helps to determine the relative quality of the actions taken by the agent.
    𝜀 is a hyperparameter controlling how much the policy is permitted to change.
    𝑟(𝜃) is the ratio of the probability of the action under the new and old policies.
    When incorporated into autonomous agricultural robots for adaptive seed planting
    and water management, PPO has various benefits in agricultural contexts. Sample
    Effectiveness: PPO is renowned for its sample effectiveness. Being able to make
    sense of few data is essential in agriculture because of the short growing season.
    Stability: By preventing the policy from shifting too much, the clipping in the
    objective function promotes more stable learning. This translates into long-term
    decision making that is trustworthy and consistent in the context of agriculture.
    Handling Continuous Action Spaces: Making decisions in agriculture, such as how
    much water to use for irrigation or how deep to plant seeds, must be performed
    continuously. PPO is well suited to making these kinds of decisions since it performs
    well in continuous action spaces. Real-time Decision Making: PPO’s effectiveness
    and stability make it capable of making judgments in real time, which is essential
    for adaptive water management and seed sowing, where conditions might change quickly
    due to the weather or other factors. Mathematically, these advantages can be crucial
    for optimizing the yield 𝑌 , given by Equation (3): 𝑌=𝑓(𝑋, 𝑊,𝑑, 𝑃) (3) Where 𝑋
    represents the seed sowing density, 𝑊 is the amount of water utilized, 𝑑 is the
    sowing depth, and P is the policy (in this instance, PPO optimization). The objective
    is to maximize 𝑌 while considering the agricultural environment’s limitations
    and unique characteristics. PPO is particularly favourable for adaptive seed sowing
    and water management in agriculture; this is because it can integrate autonomous
    agricultural robots due to its sample efficiency, stability, competence in handling
    continuous action spaces, and real-time decision making. These benefits help to
    optimize important agricultural variables, resulting in higher yields and more
    environmentally friendly farming methods. 4. Autonomous Agricultural Robot 4.1.
    Robot Design and Components In this study, DRL is used in the multidimensional
    design of an autonomous agricultural robot focused on adaptive seed sowing and
    water management. Our robot, Agrorobotix, includes an intelligent decision-making
    system, a reliable mechanical structure, and sensor integration, as shown in Figure
    4. Figure 4. Agrorobotix structure. The mechanical setup of Agrorobotix consists
    of a chassis, four wheels, four motors, a mechanism for drilling holes in the
    ground, a seed dropper, a flattener, and a watering system. The robot’s chassis,
    which serves as its main body, is strong enough to support its parts while it
    moves around an agricultural field. It houses the sensors, control unit, motors,
    battery, and other components required for autonomous operation. The robot has
    four wheels, each propelled by a different engine, as shown in Figure 5. This
    enhances the control of the movement, including rotation and navigating various
    terrains. A mathematical model of the motors is as follows, as described in Equation
    (4): 𝑇=𝑘(𝑉−𝑤𝑅) (4) Figure 5. Agrorobotix mechanism and working. 𝑘 is the motor
    constant, 𝑉 is the applied voltage, 𝑤 is the angular velocity, 𝑅 is the resistance,
    and 𝑇 is the torque. A motorized arm and a drill make up the drilling mechanism.
    The component can move vertically, enabling it to drill holes in the ground at
    different depths based on the information provided by the sensors. Let us use
    𝑑 as the drilling depth, 𝑇 𝑑 for the torque needed for drilling, and 𝑃 𝑑 for the
    power required for drilling. They have a relationship that can be modelled as
    shown in Equations (5) and (6): 𝑇 𝑑 =𝐹𝑟 (5) 𝑃 𝑑 = 𝑇 𝑑 𝑑𝜔 (6) where 𝐹 is the applied
    force, and 𝑟 is the drill’s radius and 𝜔 is the angular velocity. The next step
    is attaching a seed dropper to the drilling mechanism. The seeds are carefully
    dropped into the drilled holes. The seed dropper system is set up to distribute
    seeds according to the DRL system’s predetermined intervals and dosages. The flattener,
    a component with a flat surface placed over the soil to ensure the seeds are adequately
    coated, performs this. Finally, the robot has a sprinkler system. The ideal amount
    of water will be provided over the sown area. The water flow rate 𝑄 can be computed
    as shown in Equation (7): 𝑄= 𝐴 𝑐𝑠 𝑣 (7) where 𝐴 𝑐𝑠 is the cross-sectional area
    of the flow and 𝑣 is the velocity of water. 4.2. Power Management To ensure that
    the Agrorobotix robot always has enough power to return to its base for recharging
    or maintenance, several strategies can be implemented as part of its energy management
    system. Here are some approaches used by Agrorobotix: Energy Monitoring System:
    Implement a real-time energy monitoring system that continuously tracks the robot’s
    power levels. This system alerts the robot when its energy levels drop below a
    predefined threshold, prompting it to return to the base for recharging. 2. Automated
    Recharging Stations: Set up automated recharging stations strategically in the
    field. The robot can autonomously dock and recharge when needed, minimizing downtime,
    and ensuring constant operational readiness. 3. Battery Health Management: Implement
    a battery health management system that monitors the battery condition, optimizes
    charging cycles, and prevents deep discharges, thereby extending the battery life
    and reliability. 4.3. Sensor Integration 4.3.1. Soil Moisture Sensors Agrorobotix
    incorporates soil moisture sensors to gauge the water in the soil. These are essential
    in letting the DRL system know if watering is required. The estimates for soil
    moisture are as described in Equation (8): 𝜃 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 = ( 𝑚 𝑤𝑒𝑡 − 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 ) 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 (8)
    where 𝑚 𝑤𝑒𝑡   is the mass of the wet soil and 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 is the mass of dry soil. 4.3.2.
    Weather Sensors Weather sensors are crucial for detecting environmental factors
    like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Making judgments on irrigation timing
    and the sowing depth require the use of this information. 4.3.3. Global Positioning
    System (GPS) The robot has a GPS module that enables precise field navigation.
    This is essential to ensuring that the robot follows the best courses for irrigation
    and sowing. The tuple (latitude, longitude) can indicate the robot’s position
    𝑃 . The DRL system continuously receives data from various sensors and uses the
    PPO algorithm to make real-time decisions about the seed sowing depth, density,
    and irrigation. In this study, Agrorobotix, an autonomous agricultural robot using
    the newest sensors and Deep Reinforcement Learning technology, is painstakingly
    designed. Its sturdy construction and thoughtful decision-making capabilities
    enable adaptive seeding and water management, which promote more effective and
    sustainable agriculture methods. Agrorobotix’s advanced decision-making capabilities
    and structural robustness have received particular attention during development,
    as these are essential for adaptive seeding and water management. A key component
    of these capabilities is the integration of GPS technology. Thanks to this technology,
    Agrorobotix can move and position itself in the best possible ways to accomplish
    its tasks while accurately navigating a variety of agricultural landscapes. Because
    GPS enables accurate data collection and the execution of learned strategies in
    real-time field conditions, it is essential for the effective implementation of
    deep reinforcement learning algorithms. As a result, the system’s robust design,
    astute decision making, and accurate GPS-guided navigation work together to greatly
    improve agricultural practices’ sustainability and efficiency. 4.4. Integration
    of PPO in the Robot A key feature of Agrorobotix is the PPO algorithm, which enables
    the robot to make wise and adaptable decisions for seed sowing and water management
    in real time. The integration establishes the connection between the robot’s mechanical
    parts, the PPO algorithm, and its sensory inputs. 4.4.1. Data Acquisition and
    Preprocessing Data serve as the foundation for PPO. Agrorobotix has several sensors,
    including GPS, weather sensors, and soil moisture sensors. Let us denote the raw
    sensory data at time 𝑡 as 𝑆 𝑡 . These data need to be pre-processed to create
    the state space that will be used as input by the PPO algorithm. The state space,
    denoted as 𝑋 𝑡 , can be represented as a vector in Equation (9): 𝑋 𝑡 =[ 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 ,
    𝑠 𝑤𝑡 ,  𝑝 𝑡 ] (9) where 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 represents the soil moisture, 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 represents weather
    information (such as temperature, humidity), and 𝑝 𝑡 represents the robot’s position,
    obtained from GPS data. 4.4.2. Action Execution and Feedback The robot’s components
    are actuated per the action 𝐴 𝑡 selected by the PPO algorithm. For example, if
    𝐴 𝑡 calls for sowing seeds at depth 𝑑 , the drilling machine would be activated
    to produce the holes at depth 𝑑 , the seed dropper would dispense the seeds, the
    flattener would cover the holes, and the sprinkler might be activated depending
    on the moisture levels. Let us denote the action space as 𝐴 𝑡 =[𝑑, 𝑛, 𝑤] , where
    𝑑 represents the depth of seed sowing, 𝑛 represents the number of seeds, and 𝑤
    represents the amount of water to be sprinkled. 4.4.3. Reward Calculation and
    Policy Update After executing the action, Agrorobotix observes the immediate reward
    𝑅 𝑡 , which is a function of various factors such as the soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and seed sowing depth. The cumulative reward 𝐺 𝑡 is calculated as
    in Equation (10): 𝐺 𝑡 =𝛴 (𝛾^𝑖 ∗  𝑅 𝑡+𝑖 ) (10) where 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the discount
    factor. The policy is updated using the collected rewards, and the process is
    repeated. Real-time Adaptation Agrorobotix gathers new data as it continues interacting
    with the environment, which are then used to update the policy. As a result, the
    PPO algorithm improves its decision making over time by adjusting to the surroundings.
    4.4.4. Mathematical Optimization for Resource Consumption A secondary objective
    can be integrated into PPO to ensure minimal resource consumption. The robot can
    be optimized for the minimal use of water and energy. Minimize in Equation (11):
    𝛴( 𝑤  𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑡 ) (11) Subject to Equation (12): 𝐺 𝑡 ≥𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 (12) where 𝑤  𝑡
    is water consumption, and 𝑒 𝑡 is the energy consumption at time 𝑡 . In the context
    of Agrorobotix’s operations, the reward function 𝑅 𝑡 plays a pivotal role in guiding
    the robot’s learning and decision-making process. After executing an action 𝐴
    𝑡 , such as sowing seeds or managing water, Agrorobotix calculates the immediate
    reward 𝑅 𝑡 . This reward is a multi-faceted function that incorporates several
    critical agricultural factors, including, but not limited to, the following: Soil
    Moisture: Agrorobotix measures the moisture level of the soil, aiming for an optimal
    range that ensures adequate water for the crops without over-irrigation. The closer
    the soil moisture is to this optimal range, the higher the reward 𝑅 𝑡   received.
    Weather Conditions: The algorithm considers current and forecasted weather conditions.
    Favourable weather that promotes healthy crop growth contributes positively to
    the reward. Seed Sowing Depth: The accuracy of the seed sowing depth, as per the
    agronomic standards for different crops, influences 𝑅 𝑡 . A precise sowing depth
    ensures better seed germination and contributes to a higher reward. The cumulative
    reward 𝐺 𝑡  is then calculated based on these immediate rewards over time, as
    outlined in Equation (10). This approach enables Agrorobotix to adapt its actions
    dynamically, aiming to maximize 𝐺 𝑡  by optimizing these key factors, thus ensuring
    efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. In general terms, processing
    sensory data to create a state space, using the PPO algorithm to choose actions,
    carrying out these actions using the robot’s mechanical parts, and changing the
    policy using the incentives earned are the steps involved in incorporating PPO
    into Agrorobotix. This makes it possible for Agrorobotix to modify its water management
    and seed-sowing plans in real time, resulting in higher yields and sustainability.

    is initialized to adjust the policy parameters during training. In each iteration,
    the robot observes the state 𝑠 t from its sensors (soil moisture, weather sensors,
    GPS). The action 𝑎 t is selected based on the policy 𝜋( 𝑎 t | 𝑠 𝑡 ; 𝜃) and executed
    by the robot (drilling, sowing, flattening, and watering). The robot observes
    the immediate reward 𝑟 t and the new state 𝑠 t+1 . The advantage estimate 𝐴 t
    is computed, which represents how good the taken action is compared to the average
    action. The policy parameters 𝜃 are updated by optimizing the surrogate objective,
    which is a clipped version of the objective; this is to prevent policy updates
    that are too large. This process is repeated over multiple iterations and epochs
    for stable learning. 5. Experimental Setup 5.1. Description of the Test Farm The
    experimental setup was carried out on a test farm spanning an area of 1 acre,
    as shown in Figure 6. The farm is in a region of Faisalabad, Pakistan, with a
    temperate climate that is characterized by moderate rainfall and a growing season
    typically from early spring to late fall. The soil is loamy and has been traditionally
    used for growing a variety of crops including wheat, maize, and vegetables. The
    test farm was specifically chosen for its representativeness of typical agricultural
    conditions. The field experiments with Agrorobotix spanned over a period of 30
    days, enabling comprehensive data collection and algorithm refinement. Figure
    6. The 1-acre test farm. 5.2. Data Collection and Training Historical information
    about the farm, such as its weather patterns (temperature, humidity, and precipitation),
    soil moisture, and crop yield records, was gathered before the experiment began.
    Agrorobotix uses an array of sensors to gather these data, which form the basis
    of the algorithm’s decision-making process. Our autonomous agricultural robot,
    Agrorobotix, collected data in real time throughout the trial using its built-in
    sensors. Gazebo was used in the simulation environment to replicate the conditions
    on a farm. A high-fidelity model of Agrorobotix and the test farm were used in
    the simulation. The various environmental situations could be replicated using
    Gazebo, and the robot’s behaviours could be examined. Through a continuous feedback
    loop, the robot adapts its actions based on the outcomes of previous actions,
    enhancing its efficiency and accuracy over time. The collected data were pre-processed
    to be fed into the DRL model. The state space vector 𝑋 t is defined as described
    in Equation (13): 𝑋 t =[ 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 ,  𝑝 𝑡 ] (13) where 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 represents the soil
    moisture, 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 represents weather information, and 𝑝 𝑡 represents the robot’s
    position, which was obtained from GPS data. The PPO algorithm was employed as
    the DRL model, which was trained using both historical data and real-time data
    collected from Gazebo simulations. The objective was to maximize the cumulative
    reward 𝐺 𝑡 . The learning curves for these tasks are given in Figure 7. During
    training, we simulated an Agrorobotix in parallel for each sampling and collected,
    in total, a thousand time steps for each task. The policy 𝜋(𝜃) was modified iteratively
    through epochs, and the training continued until convergence. Figure 7. Learning
    curve of PPP for Agrorobotix. Following training, Agrorobotix was used on the
    test farm’s 1-acre property. Its primary responsibilities included water management
    and adaptive seed sowing. As instructed by the PPO algorithm, the robot used its
    drilling machine to create holes, seed droppers, flatteners to level the field,
    and sprinklers to water the crops. It was crucial to adjust the model with actual-world
    data while Agrorobotix moved through the test farm. The robot functioned at the
    test farm throughout two growing seasons and continuously adjusted its irrigation
    and seeding policies. The model tuned itself to the test farm’s actual environmental
    conditions and limits, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Agrorobotix working in
    1-acre test farm. The crop yield and water use were the two main criteria for
    assessing Agrorobotix’s performance. Water use was calculated in liters, while
    crop production and the shoot length in particular were calculated in centimeters.
    The crop production and water usage of Agrorobotix were compared to traditional
    farming methods to examine the results. The effectiveness and advantages of using
    a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based strategy in agriculture were established through
    this comparison. PPO’s integration into Agrorobotix and implementation on the
    test farm produced positive outcomes. The robot could manage water resources and
    plant seeds flexibly and efficiently. The experimental set-up that combined physical
    and virtual settings greatly honed and tested Agrorobotix’s performance in actual
    agricultural situations. The use of autonomous robots and deep reinforcement learning
    offers a significant step towards sustainable and effective farming practices.
    6. Results and Discussion In this study, the ‘conventional’ method refers to traditional
    agricultural practices, which typically include manual labor and basic mechanization
    without advanced automation or data-driven decision-making systems. This method
    has been optimized based on standard agricultural practices, which involve routine
    watering and fertilization schedules, regular pest control measures, and traditional
    soil management techniques. These practices serve as a benchmark for comparing
    the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agrorobotix system in enhancing sustainable
    agriculture. 6.1. Comparison with Conventional Farming Techniques 6.1.1. Crop
    Yield One of the essential metrics in this study is the crop yield, which directly
    impacts the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural practices. The crop
    yield was quantified as the total shoot length of crops produced per unit seed,
    as shown in Figure 9. Let us denote the crop yield using Agrorobotix as 𝑌 𝑟 and
    the crop yield using conventional farming techniques as 𝑌 𝑐 , as shown in Equation
    (14). 𝑌 𝑟 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑥 (𝑐𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑)  𝑌

    (14) Figure 9. Shoot length in (a) 0 month, (b) 1st month, (c) 2nd month and (d)
    3rd month. According to the results, there was a 16.3% increase in shoot length
    with the use of Agrorobotix, as shown in Equation (15): ( 𝑌 𝑟 − 𝑌 𝑐 .)/ 𝑌 𝑐 .
    ∗ 100=16.3% (15) This can also be visualized through the graph in Figure 10: Figure
    10. Shoot length comparison of Agrorobotix and conventional method. 6.1.2. Water
    Usage Another critical metric is the water usage, which is crucial for sustainable
    agriculture. Let us denote the water usage using Agrorobotix as 𝑊 𝑟 and the water
    usage using conventional farming techniques as 𝑊 𝑐 , as shown in Equation (16):
    𝑊 𝑟 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑏𝑦 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑥 (𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒)  𝑊 𝑐 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙

    to the results, there was a 21.7% reduction in water usage with the use of Agrorobotix,
    as described in Equation (17): ( 𝑊 𝑐 − 𝑊 𝑟 )/ 𝑊 𝑐  ∗ 100=21.7% (17) This can also
    be visualized through the bar graph in Figure 11: Figure 11. Comparison of water
    usage when using Agrorobotix and conventional method. 6.2. Insights and Implications
    The results demonstrate that Deep Reinforcement Learning increases crop productivity
    while reducing water use in an autonomous agricultural robot. The graphs and mathematical
    model show that Agrorobotix performs better than conventional agricultural methods.
    The DRL model’s reward improvement demonstrates how the robot can grow intelligent
    and acquire sound judgement. Adaptation is crucial in agriculture since environmental
    conditions can be unpredictable. During field trials, a number of operational
    parameters were evaluated in order to determine the usefulness and effectiveness
    of Agrorobotix in agricultural settings. These parameters include the average
    speed at which the robot operates and the total amount of time needed to finish
    typical agricultural tasks on a field of one acre. Agrorobotix was entrusted with
    a number of standard farming tasks during these trials, including planting, watering,
    and crop health monitoring. The mean velocity of the robot was measured, taking
    into account different kinds of terrain and operational circumstances. Agrorobotix’s
    operational performance across a range of agricultural tasks is summarised in
    Figure 12. The robot’s average speed, which ranges from 3 to 4 km/h, is shown
    on the left for tasks like watering, seeding, and crop monitoring. These velocities
    are designed to strike a balance between effectiveness and the dexterity needed
    for fine farming tasks. Agrorobotix’s time efficiency is demonstrated by the graph
    on the right, which shows how long it takes to finish each task on a one-acre
    field. The durations, which vary from 5 to 7 h, demonstrate the robot’s ability
    to complete tasks quickly, possibly lowering labour hours and increasing the overall
    productivity of the farm. This information highlights how Agrorobotix is used
    in the field in a way that is consistent with sustainable farming methods and
    precision agriculture. Figure 12. Agrorobotix: speed and time metrics for farming
    tasks on a 1-acre field. Figure 13 illustrates a comparison between the chemical
    usage of traditional farming methods and those employed with Agrorobotix. The
    bar chart clearly shows a 33% reduction in chemical usage when utilizing Agrorobotix’s
    precision application system, as indicated by the decrease from 100% (representing
    the baseline chemical usage in traditional methods) to 67%. This significant reduction
    underscores the benefits of efficiency and sustainability offered by Agrorobotix
    in agricultural practices. Figure 13. Chemical usage comparison: traditional vs.
    Agrorobotix. A comparative study was conducted to validate the algorithm’s soil
    moisture estimation against traditional methods. This involved performing parallel
    measurements over the experimental period, demonstrating the algorithm’s precision.
    The graph in Figure 14 compares the soil moisture estimation over a 30-day period
    using the Deep Learning Reinforcement (DLR) algorithm implemented in Agrorobotix
    with traditional methods. The blue line represents the soil moisture levels as
    estimated by the DLR algorithm, while the green line illustrates the estimates
    obtained through traditional methods. This visual representation offers a clear
    comparison of the two approaches, demonstrating the DLR algorithm’s ability to
    accurately estimate soil moisture over an extended period, which is crucial for
    informed and efficient agricultural practices. Figure 14. Soil moisture estimation:
    DRL algorithm vs. traditional methods (30 days). The results of this study indicate
    that autonomous robots may revolutionise agricultural practices. Such robots can
    tackle some of agriculture’s most serious issues, such as resource optimisation
    and sustainability, by making data-driven decisions. Additionally, as technology
    advances, the capabilities and application of these robots may be enhanced, ushering
    in a new era of precise and sustainable agriculture. The findings of this study
    serve as a basis for further investigation and development in the fields of agricultural
    robotics and artificial intelligence. 7. Conclusions In conclusion, this research
    article shows that implementing new sustainable irrigation methods improves crop
    farming and reduces water consumption. The potential of Agrorobotix to transform
    urban agriculture is demonstrated by its integration into smart city frameworks.
    Agrorobotix makes a substantial contribution to the sustainability and efficiency
    of urban farming practices, which are essential to the creation of smart cities,
    by utilizing cutting-edge AI and robotics. By maximizing the utilization of resources
    to minimize environmental effects and improve food security in urban areas, this
    system is in line with the smart city objective; as a result, the Agrorobotix
    system has shown that integrating deep reinforcement learning into autonomous
    agricultural robots provides significant advantages for adaptive seed sowing and
    water management. The Agrorobotix design prioritizes water sustainability, but
    it also makes a major contribution to effective land management and the optimization
    of fertilizer usage. Agrorobotix guarantees sustainable resource utilization beyond
    water conservation by carefully dousing fertilizers and monitoring soil health.
    The outcomes of considerable experimentation and comparison with traditional farming
    methods reveal significant benefits. Crop yield rose by an average of 16.3%, outpacing
    conventional techniques and boosting food production. Additionally, the Agrorobotix
    system’s deployment led to a stunning 21.7% decrease in water usage, successfully
    addressing the significant problem of resource conservation. These figures highlight
    the enormous potential for enhancing agricultural practices using deep reinforcement
    learning algorithms, particularly the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.
    The Agrorobotix system provides a sustainable and effective solution for modern
    agriculture, opening the way for higher production and environmental stewardship
    by intelligently optimizing seed sowing and water management procedures. This
    study also qualitatively assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision
    farming. Interviews with the farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed
    the benefits of the proposed approach. Acknowledging Agrorobotix’s limitations,
    like terrain navigation difficulties and maintenance needs, we plan to explore
    these areas in future work to enhance the practical applicability and operational
    efficiency of agricultural robotics. The multidimensional impacts of precision
    crop farming beyond its measurable outcomes emphasize its potential to foster
    social cohesion and well-being in urban communities. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    adoption Introduction Global meat production has increased substantially over
    the last several decades. From 1961 to 2018, global meat production quadrupled,
    increasing from 71 million tons to 341 million tons. Over this time, beef production
    increased by 149 percent, from 29 million tons to 72 million tons [1]. The primary
    reasons for the increase in global beef demand include growing worldwide population
    and increasing income in developing countries [2]. Beef cattle production is one
    of the most important agricultural industries in the US, accounting for approximately
    $66.5 billion (17 percent) of the $391 billion in agricultural commodity total
    cash receipts [3]. Additionally, the US beef cattle industry is the largest in
    the world, and the US is also the world''s number one consumer of beef [3]. In
    2020, the US was the world''s largest beef producer, with 12 million tons produced,
    which accounted for 20.4 percent of worldwide production, followed by Brazil with
    10.1 million tons produced (16.6 percent), and the European Union with 7.8 million
    tons produced (12.9 percent) [4]. Furthermore, in 2020, the US was the world''s
    third-largest beef exporter, accounting for 12.4 percent of worldwide total beef
    exports, behind Australia with 13.7 percent and Brazil with 23.5 percent [4].
    Environmental impact concerns and volatile weather conditions have increasingly
    impacted beef production in recent years [5]. According to Gerber et al. (2013),
    livestock production accounts for 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
    [6]. Thus, strategies have been implemented to reduce greenhouse emissions derived
    from livestock, such as diversification of animals, improving feeding practices
    to reduce enteric fermentation, shifting of livestock location, and improvement
    of manure management and carbon sequestration [7]. Regarding volatile weather
    conditions, local weather impacts are some of the most uncertain factors influencing
    cattle production and producer profit. Weather impacts are often not insurance
    eligible and can lead to significant economic losses related to increases in livestock
    mortality and reductions in feed gain efficiency [8]. Unpredictable and volatile
    weather conditions may additionally decrease breeding performance, as well as
    increase production costs if pasture quality and growth are affected [9]. Regional
    weather impacts can trigger larger market reactions, as occurred in 2010, when
    the USA beef industry experienced a substantial contraction as a result of severe
    regional drought which decreased pasture availability. As a result of prolonged
    drought, beef cattle inventory fluctuated until 2014, when weather and environmental
    conditions improved [3]. Beef producers utilize specific production practices
    to overcome environmental and weather-related challenges. These practices include
    a variety of management strategies, specialized production systems, and technologies
    to enhance beef production. Recently, the livestock industry has begun integrating
    sophisticated technological solutions into production processes to optimize resource
    management. This technology, known as precision livestock farming (PLF), includes
    sensors, big data technology analytics, blockchain technology, and robotics [10].
    This article primarily focuses on big data technology in livestock production,
    which involves collecting, managing, partitioning, and analyzing data from livestock
    operations using algorithms and predictive analytics to generate accurate predictions
    for production, health, and welfare concerns. The technology can retrieve data
    from any sensor-based device installed on-farm, including biometric, environmental,
    and production sensors [11]. Currently, little is known about livestock producers''
    willingness to adopt and utilize big data technologies. This is in part due to
    a lack of validation on a commercial scale [10]. Additionally, sociodemographic,
    behavioral, technological, and financial factors may impact producers'' willingness
    to adopt these technologies. The objective of this paper is to analyze factors
    impacting beef producer willingness to adopt big data technology. Knowledge of
    these factors will be particularly advantageous for industry stakeholders, such
    as technology developers and policymakers. These stakeholders can utilize information
    gained from this research to tailor technologies to the specific needs of livestock
    producers as well as provide incentives to accelerate the adoption of big data
    technology in livestock production. Literature review Recent studies have focused
    on the adoption of a variety of technologies in beef production. Pruitt et al.
    (2012) investigated technology adoption, as well as production systems and management
    practices, utilized by US beef cow-calf producers. It was found that farm size
    and education most impacted the adoption of these systems and technologies [12].
    Elliot et al. (2013) investigated the factors affecting adoption of beef cattle
    reproductive technology by Missouri cow-calf producers. Results indicated that
    farmer age, operation type, management characteristics, and producer risk preference
    influenced the adoption of reproductive technology [13]. Additional studies have
    been conducted regarding technology adoption, including digital technologies,
    internationally. A study by Carrer et al. (2013) analyzed the factors affecting
    feedlot technology adoption by beef producers in Sao Paulo, Brazil [14]. Researchers
    found that herd size, average price, technical assistance, participation in farm
    associations, training, and proximity to processing plants increased the likelihood
    of feedlot technology adoption [14]. Jelinski et al. (2019) analyzed Statistics
    Canada''s 2016 census data to determine the adoption drivers of seven technological
    management tools used by Canadian cow-calf producers [15]. It was found that larger
    farms were more likely to adopt technological management tools. Additionally,
    producer age was associated with the adoption of smartphones/tablets and computers/laptops
    for farm management, with younger producers being more likely to adopt [15]. Another
    study was conducted on digital technology adoption by Swiss livestock farmers
    and investigated a variety of livestock production, including beef cattle [16].
    Researchers found that cameras, electronic ear tags, and electronic weighing systems
    were the most used technologies among suckler cows. Additional technologies, such
    as transponder collars and weighing systems, were also found to be frequently
    used by farmers raising beef cattle. Larger farms were found to be more likely
    to adopt digital technology and farmer age, gender, farm type, and barn system
    were also found to impact adoption [16]. Factors affecting the adoption of innovations
    in beef cattle farming in Peninsular Malaysia were investigated [17]. Results
    showed that education level, information access, herd size, and business value
    statistically influenced the adoption of innovations. Quddus (2022), investigated
    adoption of technological innovations in Bangladeshi beef, dairy, and poultry
    farming [18]. It was found that age was negatively associated with adopting new
    technology, while education, family size, income, farm size, and being new to
    farming positively affected the adoption of technology [18]. Conceptual model
    The theory of random utility is used to analyze the factors impacting adoption
    of big data technology by US beef producers. This theory has become popular in
    marketing applications, as it is consistent with the assumptions of rationality
    and utility maximization of classical microeconomic theory [19]. The theory of
    random utility is used in choice models to explain how individuals will choose
    the best option among several alternatives in order to maximize utility. The unobservable,
    but true, reported utility by individual preferences can be represented by: (1)
    where represents an individual''s utility, represents the observable system component
    of utility (non-stochastic), and is a random error component. An individual is
    assumed to have two choices, adoption of technology (denoted by 1) or non-adoption
    of technology (denoted by 0). Thus, , represents the utility derived from adoption
    of technology and represents the utility derived from non-adoption. The utility
    derived from each choice is expressed as follows: (2) and (3) where represents
    the individual''s utility from either adoption or non-adoption, represents the
    vector of parameters to be estimated, represents the vector of explanatory variables,
    and is the random error component. Given that utility is random, individuals will
    adopt new technology only if utility of adoption is greater than utility of non-adoption,
    . Thus, the probability that an individual will choose to adopt technology can
    be shown as: (4) Substituting Eqs. (2) and (3) into Eq. (4), we obtain: (5) which
    can be expressed as: (6) where refers to the cumulative distribution function
    of the standard normal distribution, and and are as defined previously. Materials
    and methods A survey of beef producers in the southwestern region of the US was
    conducted to evaluate the factors affecting willingness to adopt big data technology.
    Potential survey participants were identified through contacts within the livestock
    industry as well as cattle raiser/breeder associations. Prior to distribution,
    the survey was approved the Texas Tech University Human Research Protection Program
    and informed consent was obtained from all survey participants. Surveys were distributed
    via email to 760 beef producers in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. A total of
    90 responses were obtained, with 84 complete responses, for a response rate of
    11.8%. The survey was divided into several sections. Data were collected on socio-demographics,
    herd size, and current use of digital technologies. Surveys consisted of a total
    of 20 Likert scale, multiple choice, and open-ended questions. Features and attributes
    desired in big data technology were also assessed via explanation of a hypothetical
    big data platform with the capacity to provide early alerts on production or health
    issues via collection and analysis of data generated by PLF sensors. To determine
    producer willingness to adopt big data technology, this hypothetical big data
    platform included a description of the functions, features, insights, and benefits
    that could be obtained from on-farm implementation. Following the description
    of the hypothetical platform, respondents were asked “If this technology were
    available to you at this moment, would you adopt it?” Respondents were able to
    respond yes/no. This response served as the dependent variable in the analysis.
    Socio-demographic data collected included primary operator age and education.
    Prior research has found that as beef producer age increases, the likelihood of
    adopting new technology decreases [13,15,16,18]. Thus, it was hypothesized that
    farmer age would negatively affect adoption of big data technology. Operator education
    was also expected to impact adoption of big data technology. Previous studies
    have shown that as farmer education level increases, willingness to adopt a technological
    platform increases [12,17,18]. So, it was expected that education would have a
    positive effect on big data technology adoption. Data were also collected on herd
    size and availability of internet for business purposes. Research has indicated
    that producers with larger herds tend to have higher rates of technology adoption
    [12,13,15,16,18]. In this study, herd size was expected to have a positive effect
    on big data technology adoption. Similarly, it was hypothesized that having access
    to internet would positively affect adoption of big data technology, as internet
    connectivity is often necessary for the collection and analysis of data generated
    by the technology. Producers surveyed who already utilized some type of technology
    devices or sensors were classified as early adopters of digital technology. These
    producers had awareness and experience with both the hardware/infrastructure components
    of technologies as well as the types of on-farm data generated and subsequent
    analysis. Thus, it was hypothesized that producers who had previously adopted
    some sensor-based technology would be more likely to adopt big data technology.
    A probit model was used to empirically estimate Eq. (6) in order to determine
    factors impacting the probability of adoption of big data technology by beef producers,
    . The probit model was used given that the dependent variable was binary (adoption
    or non-adoption). The empirical model can be shown as follows: (7) where is the
    dependent variable (adoption or non-adoption), is a vector of explanatory variables,
    is a vector of parameters to be estimated, and is a normally distributed error
    term. Explanatory variables included herd size, producer education level, producer
    age, access to on-farm internet for business purposes, and previous adoption of
    sensor-based technologies (classified as early adopters). Thus, the empirical
    model utilized to assess beef producer willingness to adopt big data technology
    is as follows: (8) Results and discussion Results indicated that among the producers
    surveyed, 30 (36 percent) would adopt big data technology, while 54 (64 percent)
    would not. Summary statistics are presented in Table 1. Herd size was found to
    generally be between 250 and 500 head. Average farmer age was found to be approximately
    50, with the youngest being 20 and oldest being 82. Additionally, the majority
    of farmers surveyed had completed between two and four years of college. Most
    farms had on-farm internet access and slightly over half of farms surveyed had
    adopted at least one on-farm sensor-based technology. Table 1. Explanatory variables

    indicated that the size of a livestock herd had a positive effect on the adoption
    of big data technology, while age was found to negatively affect adoption of big
    data technology. Table 2. Results of Binary Probit Analysis. Variable Coefficient

    It should be noted that probit regressions may experience issues related to multicollinearity,
    which occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated, thus
    resulting in biased coefficient estimates. To address multicollinearity and evaluate
    each explanatory variable individually, individual probit regressions were run
    with each explanatory variable. Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 show
    these results, which indicate that herd size and age were statistically significant
    at the one percent level and early adopters were statistically significant at
    the five percent level. Table 3. Results of individual probit analysis – Herd

    The probit model is often used for analysis of binary data in which the dependent
    variable takes a value of either zero or one. However, the probit model does not
    provide the marginal effects of the independent variables, only the direction
    of the effect, either positive or negative. Thus, average marginal effects analysis
    provides the average change in probability when an independent variable increases
    by one unit. The effects will differ by individual, so the average marginal effect
    computes the individual change, then averages the changes. To further evaluate
    the effect of each explanatory variable on the adoption of big data technology,
    an average marginal effects analysis was run. Herd size, age, and early adopters
    were all significant at the one percent level. The results of the marginal effects
    analysis are presented in Table 8. Table 8. Average marginal effects by individual
    probit regression. Variable Marginal Effects Standard Error z P > z 95% Confidence

    It was found that an increase from one herd size category to the next increased
    the probability of adopting big data technology by 9.4 percent, on average. This
    occurrence could be due to larger livestock operations being more dependent on
    technology for timely and efficient operations management. This finding could
    also be due to economies of scale, as larger operations could likely utilize big
    data technology more effectively and efficiently. Results also indicated that
    for each one-year increase in age, the likelihood of beef producers adopting big
    data technology decreased by 0.87 percent, on average. This result aligned with
    expectations based on the literature review. One explanation for this result is
    that younger beef producers may have had more exposure to novel technologies and
    could be more aware of how big data technology functions, as well as the benefits
    that can be obtained from it. Additionally, older beef producers may lack familiarity
    with big data technologies, and be less comfortable with new technologies in general.
    Older producers may also have concerns with data sharing and confidentiality as
    well. For producers classified as early adopters, the probability of adopting
    big data technology increased by about 24 percent, on average, as compared with
    producers who had not previously implemented any sensor-based technologies. It
    was expected that producers that had previously used sensor-based technology would
    be more likely to utilize additional big data technologies. This was likely due
    to early adopters being more comfortable with technology as well as more aware
    of the potential benefits, such as value from data generated, improvements in
    operational efficiency, and operational cost savings. Education was expected to
    have a positive effect on big data technology adoption but was not found to be
    statistically significant at any level. This finding may have been due to a producer
    deeming technology unnecessary for reasons independent of education level, such
    as the business was not of sufficient size. Internet access was also not found
    to be statistically significant at any level. It was expected that internet access
    would have a positive effect on adoption because it would be more feasible to
    install. While approximately 73 percent of respondents indicated they had internet
    access, some sensor-based technologies do not need internet connections to work,
    but rather operate by satellite signal. For this reason, access to internet is
    not found to be a constraint to adopting sensor-based technology. Finally, a chi-squared
    test was conducted in order to assess correlation relation between the dependent
    and independent variables. The test provides information about correlation, but
    not effect. Table 9 shows the results from the chi-squared test for the categorical
    variables. Results indicate that herd size and producers being classified as early
    adopters were significant at the five percent level. Table 9. Test for categorical

    denote statistical significance the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. With
    regard to herd size, it should be noted that 42.9 percent of the study sample
    had herd sizes less than 100 head. This result is consistent based on the 2017
    USDA NASS Census of Agriculture, in which average U.S. beef herd size was found
    to be approximately 44 head per herd [1]. This relatively large proportion of
    smaller size herds within the study sample may account for less adoption among
    those producers, as it may not have been economically feasible for smaller operations
    to invest in expensive technology. For producers regarded as early adopters, when
    the adoption rate is compared to non-early adopters, 22 of 30 producers (73.3%)
    indicated they would adopt the technology while eight of 30 producers (26.7%)
    who were not classified as early adopters still indicated they would be willing
    to the technology. These results are consistent with the coefficients obtained
    from the probit regression for the individual variables as well as the average
    marginal effects analysis. Conclusions The objective of this study was to examine
    factors which influenced beef producers’ willingness to adopt big data technology.
    It was found that herd size, producer age, and producers previously adopting digital
    sensors or technologies significantly impacted the decision for a producer to
    adopt big data technology. The results were generally consistent with the existing
    literature and aligned with similar adoption assessments with regard to operation
    size and farmer age. In previous work focused on beef producers, these factors
    were the most common impacting technology adoption. Additionally, producers having
    previously utilized sensor-based technologies, classifying them as early adopters,
    increased the likelihood that big data technology would be utilized in the future.
    Future work should consider the relationship between age and early adopter status,
    as it is possible that younger producers would be more likely to be classified
    as early adopters. Several limitations of this study should be addressed. This
    research has focused only on beef production, and does not include considerations
    of other cattle production, such as the dairy industry. Other cattle industry
    stakeholders may have different factors impacting their decision to utilize big
    data or PLF technologies. Additionally, this study was limited in geographic scope,
    focusing on beef producers in the southwestern US, specifically Texas, Oklahoma,
    and New Mexico. Beef cattle operations in this region tend to be larger in scale,
    with larger herd sizes, than in many other geographic regions of the US. As such,
    the desire to utilize increased technology may be impacted depending on the geographic
    region a business is located in. Future work should expand geographic scope to
    include other regions, as well as compare preferences by geographic region. This
    study also specifically investigated preferences of producers and did not include
    other stakeholders such as veterinarians, technology company representatives,
    or policy makers. Future research should investigate differences in preferences
    among various beef industry stakeholders. Finally, this study focused on a few
    very specific factors including herd size, age and education level of the producer,
    access to internet, and whether the producer was considered an early adopter of
    digital technologies. Future work should consider additional factors which may
    impact adoption decisions, such as specifics relative to technology ease of installation,
    use, interpretation, troubleshooting, and benefit-cost analysis. Insight from
    this study is of benefit to industry stakeholders, such as technology companies,
    policymakers, and producer associations, particularly with regard to the creation
    of efficient adoption strategies. Technology companies should focus on developing
    technologies which are cost effective and easy to use, in order to entice older
    producers and small businesses and non-early adopters to try new products. Additionally,
    targeted marketing strategies focused on increasing technology awareness for beef
    producers that are not familiar with digital technology should be developed. Increased
    and improved technical support can also be provided to producers to encourage
    continued use of the technology. Policies may be generated to encourage the accelerated
    adoption of big data technologies in beef production, particularly for smaller
    operations, which often face constraints on technology adoption due to limited
    size and acquisition ability. Subsidization of big data technology acquisition
    may aid adoption among producers. Finally, producer associations can promote awareness
    of big data technology benefits and potentially offer cost discounts through alliances
    with technology companies. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

    impact on increasing yields, improving crop quality, and reducing environmental
    impact. The use of renewable energy sources such as solar power in agriculture
    has gained momentum in recent years due to the potential to reduce the carbon
    footprint of farming operations. In addition to providing a source of clean energy,

    can have a significant impact on increasing yields, improving crop quality, and
    reducing environmental impact. The use of renewable energy sources such as solar

    resistor 1. Introduction and Background Agriculture is one of the most important
    sectors of the economy and plays a crucial role in providing food to the world’s
    population. With the growing demand for food and shrinking fertile land, precision
    agriculture has become a necessity to improve the yield and quality of crops.
    One of the key factors that impacts agricultural productivity is weather conditions.
    Remote weather monitoring systems are increasingly being used to monitor environmental
    conditions and provide real-time data to farmers to make informed decisions. In
    this context, the development of a solar tracking system for remote weather monitoring
    in agriculture can have a significant impact, improving agricultural productivity
    while also reducing the dependence on traditional power sources. In the current
    age of technology, energy is a crucial topic of discussion, and renewable energy
    sources such as lunar, thermal, vibration, and wind energies are gaining increasing
    interest. Since the cost of electricity is increasing every year, renewable energy
    is considered the best source of energy. However, renewable energy sources are
    difficult to predict, making it challenging to optimize their production and consumption
    [1]. A cost-effective energy solution is required to balance supply and demand.
    Energy storage is becoming increasingly important, and the market for solar energy
    harvesting is growing rapidly. Ambient energy sources, e.g., solar energy, play
    an important role in monitoring human activities in the last decade and cannot
    be underestimated. Over the years, the introduction of energy management schemes
    that seek to prolong the lifetime of the sensor node and the overall network have
    been proposed, but the amount of energy required by the sensors to be operational
    all the time remains a challenge [2,3]. Solar energy has gained tremendous attention
    in recent years due to various reasons such as the fluctuating price of crude
    oil, public awareness of environmental issues, supporting policies and subsidies
    enacted by local governments to boost renewable energy sectors, the price reduction
    of photovoltaic (PV) panels, etc. Many large-scale solar farms have been commissioned
    in the US, Europe, and China, as the global PV price has been dropping rapidly
    in recent years, which is in agreement with Swanson’s law [4]. However, PV-generated
    electricity is not competitive enough compared to fossil fuels (oil, gas, and
    coal), especially in urban areas. Hence, more extensive research and development
    on PV cell material science is required to overcome the conversion efficiency
    hurdle and reduce manufacturing costs. Meanwhile, several approaches other than
    exploring new materials for PV cells have been proposed. For instance, a concentrated
    photovoltaic (CPV) system was designed to concentrate large amounts of sunlight
    into PV cells [4,5]. Similarly, a maximum power point tracker can draw maximum
    power by tracking and operating on the maximum power point of the PV arrays [6],
    and solar tracking can enable a maximized power captured from the sun by following
    the sun path [7]. These methods can increase the energy production of PV to various
    degrees of success. Above all, solar tracking poses a great advantage to enhance
    the PV system efficiency as compared to a static solar system [8]. A dual-axis
    solar tracker (DAS) is a type of solar tracker with two rotational axes, which
    always enable it to align the PV panels and point directly towards the solar disk  [9,10].
    Solar irradiance (W/m 2 ) is a measure of the amount of sunlight that falls on
    a surface. It is the most fundamental factor in determining the performance of
    a PV panel to be underestimated. Over the years, the introduction of energy management
    schemes has led to many efficient approaches [11]. A single-axis system may require
    more space to accommodate the solar panels and collects energy along one axis,
    which reduces its efficiency. A dual-axis solar tracking system is designed to
    follow the sun and optimize the amount of sunlight collected by PV cells. The
    system follows the sun’s movement in both the horizontal and vertical planes,
    from east to west and north to south, respectively. It is widely used in the agricultural
    field to optimize the amount of collected solar energy, thereby increasing the
    efficiency of the system. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are making a huge impact
    among emerging technologies [12]. WSNs have consistently ranked highly in this
    field of research for over a decade [13]. Since the system is WSN-based, the term
    quality of service (QoS) is defined as the network’s assurance to fulfill the
    desired services for an individual, including delay and other parameters. To meet
    the QoS requirements, the optimal path between the source and destination needs
    to be located, and other components for QoS are resources, request, response,
    and reservation [14]. The authors [15] conducted a study that explored the primary
    parameters of QoS which include delay, loss, jitter, and latency. However, extending
    QoS to WSNs faces several challenges due to features such as mobility, radio channel
    frequency, and battery issues [9]. Numerous research institutes have worked in
    this field and developed research projects that have made significant advancements
    in all aspects, including hardware, software, design, and standard applications
    [16]. WSNs are special-purpose equipment that gather information from the physical
    world and transmit it to users and applications, such as environmental monitoring,
    military operations, agriculture, and energy efficiency [17]. As energy is crucial
    to power various operations and applications, relying solely on electricity is
    not always a cost-effective solution. Renewable energy production, on the other
    hand, provides a better alternative for such requirements [18]. One type of energy
    collection system is the solar harvesting system, which converts heat into energy
    [19]. Intensive research has led to the optimization of QoS for solar systems.
    The main aim is to explore new developments and interests in this field [20].
    Energy collection systems are used to gather strength from background resources.
    The energy harvesting system produces power that can be utilized for various applications
    [21]. The equation for converting heat into electrical energy in a solar harvesting
    system [22] is 𝑃=𝜂𝐴𝐺∗𝐹𝐹 (1) where P is the electrical power output, 𝜂 is the conversion
    efficiency, A is the solar panel area, G is the solar irradiance, and 𝐹𝐹 is the
    fill factor of the solar cells. The formula for calculating Quality of Service
    ( 𝑄𝑜𝑆 ) in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [17] is 𝑄𝑜𝑆=(1−𝛼)∗𝑅+𝛼∗𝐶 (2) where R
    is the reliability, C is the coverage, and 𝛼 is the weight given to each parameter.
    The formula for calculating delay in a WSN [13] is 𝐷𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦= 𝑇 𝑒𝑛𝑑 − 𝑇 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 − 𝑡
    𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 − 𝑡 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑢𝑒 − 𝑡 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 − 𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 (3) where 𝑇 𝑒𝑛𝑑 is the time when the packet
    is received, 𝑇 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 is the time when the packet is sent, 𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 is the processing
    time, 𝑡 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑢𝑒 is the queuing delay, 𝑡 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 is the transmission delay, and 𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝
    is the propagation delay. The equation for estimating solar irradiance on a tilted
    surface [18] is 𝐺= 𝐺 𝑏 ∗𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃)+ 𝐺 𝑑 ∗ (1+𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃)) 2 + 𝐺 𝑟 ∗ (1+𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡(𝜃)) 2 (4) where
    𝐺 𝑏 is the beam irradiance, 𝐺 𝑑 is the diffuse irradiance, 𝐺 𝑟 is the reflected
    irradiance, and 𝜃 is the angle of incidence of the sun on the tilted surface.
    Solar-based energy tracking systems are proving to be fruitful for various industries,
    providing more output than other types of systems. It is expected that solar tracking
    systems will be the best systems for energy sources in the future, with their
    output efficiency depending on the tracking method used and weather conditions
    [23]. Energy harvesting technologies are the best option to fulfill the needs
    of different fields [24]. Energy harvesting is defined as a technique that is
    used to capture, harvest, and gather unused resources of natural energy such as
    energy produced from the sun, wind, ocean, etc. These natural resources are big
    energy sources and can provide large-scale harvested energy [25]. The energy harvesting
    system consists of four main parts, namely, harvester, energy collector, power
    manager or conditioning circuit, and energy storage unit [26]. As a result, several
    energy harvesting, energy optimization, and distribution approaches have been
    designed recently. In [27], the authors developed a particle swarm optimization
    (PSO), which is modeled after the social behavior of animals such as fish schooling
    and birds flocking. This approach employs a swarm of artificial agents or particles,
    and each agent’s motion is influenced by three factors. It involves separation,
    where agents maintain a safe distance; alignment, where each agent moves toward
    the average behavior of the swarm; and cohesion, where each agent moves toward
    the average behavior of its neighbors. Several unused ambient energy resources
    are available that can be utilized for energy harvesting. These energy resources
    are enough to meet our energy needs and there is no need for extra resources such
    as burning fossil fuels to rotate turbines to produce energy [28]. Environmental
    resources are renewable and can exist for a longer period. Different experiments
    have been performed to find energy resources that could be produced from natural
    resources [29]. The study [30] increased the overall efficiency of the energy
    harvesting system in WSN using maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques
    coupled with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm. Simulations for
    the system were run using Matlab 2021b. After a successful simulation, a testbed
    was built to verify the results. An AI neural network algorithm was deployed to
    obtain solutions to problems that are hard to solve using common methods such
    as pattern matching, computer vision, design identification, speech credit, classification,
    and control system. Neural network models are similar to learning algorithms,
    but may vary in terms of rules, parameters, weights, and network structures [31].
    The study [32] designed an energy management scheme using a trio energy management
    scheme for harvesting, transferring, and conserving energy. This maintained the
    network lifetime to make it more operation and efficient. However, the cost of
    experimentation, testbed installation, and simulation tools were expensive. Similarly,
    Ref. [33] presented an MPPT-based energy harvesting scheme using a perturbation-based
    micro-solar approach. Results indicated increased efficiency with lower overhead.
    The authors presented an ambient-energy-based solution for WSN networks in [34].
    The authors employed a pulse width modulation scheme and MPPT approach to increase
    the efficiency of the system by 87%. The study [35] created a method for selecting
    optimal parameters of the PSO by considering the topology and parameters of the
    DC–DC converter and other configuration settings of solar panels. The parameters
    of a buck converter connected to a battery were estimated using the newly proposed
    approach. The authors used weaseled, distributed cluster head re-selection and
    polynomial time-scheduling algorithms for that purpose. The outcomes indicated
    that improved performance can be obtained with reduced battery depletion. To address
    these challenges, we present the proposed model outlined in the following section.
    Table 1 provides an overview of existing works in this field. Table 1. Comparative
    analysis of various state-of-the-art approaches. In this paper, we have provided
    a solar energy harvesting scheme that, when fully implemented, reduces the issues
    of limited energy. The main source of solar power is the sun, which can be used
    to obtain solar energy. The sun’s rays strike the earth, delivering 174,000 terawatts
    of energy, which can be used for our needs. This alone makes the solar panel the
    best choice for a renewable energy source—according to the United Nations Development
    Program in 2000, if we can harness the full power of the sun’s rays coming to
    Earth, we can create 1575 to 49,837 Joules of energy, which is far greater than
    the world’s needs. However, the problem lies in the solar panel, i.e., that the
    technology behind the solar panel is not efficient enough to fully harness this
    abundant energy. Thus, to make the soar panel more efficient, we created a movable
    solar panel that can adjust its position regarding the sun’s current position
    to obtain the optimal sunlight. In addition to energy maximization, the proposed
    system can also give parameters such as humidity, temperature, and air quality
    from the remote agricultural fields onto the mobile app, which can greatly facilitate
    the farmers to make informed decisions. The main contributions of this research
    study are as follows: To improve the efficiency of solar panels, the paper proposes
    a solar tracking system with dual axes that can move to adjust its position. The
    solar tracking system aims to maximize energy generation by optimizing the orientation
    of the solar panels; The proposed system not only maximizes energy but also provides
    additional parameters such as humidity, temperature, and air quality from remote
    agricultural fields; The collected parameters can be accessed through a mobile
    app, making it easier fo farmers to monitor and manage their agricultural activities.
    The implementation of the proposed system shows enhanced energy generation and
    provides valuable data for agricultural purposes. The article is structured as
    follows. Section 2 presents the proposed approach. Results are discussed in Section
    3. At the end, Section 4 provides the conclusion. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.
    Proposed Model The block diagram of the proposed system is illustrated in Figure
    1. The diagram illustrates that the values from the LDRs are sent to the Arduino’s
    microcontroller (Arduino, Somerville, MA, USA), then the difference between the
    values is calculated. Based on the results, the relevant motor then moves to make
    the PV perpendicular to the sun and this process will repeat itself throughout
    the day. Here, sun position can be calculated from the sun position algorithm
    and panel position can be calculated from angle sensors connected to the tracker.
    Here, the sun position and PV panel position are both given as inputs to the microcontroller,
    which rotates the panel to an exact position through the DC motor with the help
    of the motor driver and relay. For measuring temperature and humidity, we used
    the DHT11 sensor (AOSONG Electronics, Guangzhou, China) and, for air quality,
    we used the MQ135 sensor (Winsen Sensor, Zhengzhou, China). The sensors measure
    the value and send it to the WiFi module; the WiFi module then sends the value
    to the real-time database, which is then shown on the app with their graphical
    representation. Figure 1. Block diagram of the proposed model. The testbed was
    developed to test the solar tracker and functionality of weather monitor sensors
    such as the temperature sensor and gas sensor, as shown in Figure 2. We used DHT11
    as the temperature and humidity sensor and MQ135 as the gas sensor, which was
    used to measure CO 2 in the air. The solar tracker used LDRs to measure sun luminosity
    and give a value based on it. The values were then collected and averages were
    taken to decide in which direction the solar panel would rotate. The power produced
    by it was then used to power the sensor, whose value could be seen on the laptop
    on an Arduino serial monitor and sent to the cloud for further monitoring and
    use. Specifications of the testbed are shown in Table 2. Figure 2. Experimental
    setup. Table 2. Testbed specifications. The system was comprised of several sensors
    which are briefly described here. 2.1.1. DHT11 Sensor The DHT11 is a basic digital
    temperature and humidity sensor. It provides a digital output representing temperature
    and humidity values. The power requirements for the DHT11 sensor are as follows:  Operating
    Voltage: 3.3 V to 5 V (typically powered with 5 V for most applications);  Operating
    Current: Around 2.5 mA to 3 mA during data acquisition;  Standby Current: Minimal
    standby power consumption. It is important to note that the DHT11 does not have
    advanced power-saving features, and it draws a consistent current during data
    acquisition. When using the sensor in battery-powered projects, it is advisable
    to keep the power consumption in mind to optimize battery life. 2.1.2. MQ135 Sensor
    The MQ135 is a gas sensor primarily used to measure air quality and detect various
    harmful gases like NH 3 , NO x , alcohol, benzene, smoke, and CO 2 . The power
    requirements for the MQ135 sensor are as follows:  Operating Voltage: 5 V (typically
    powered with 5 V for most applications);  Heater Power: The MQ135 sensor requires
    a preheat time to stabilize readings. It has an internal heater element that consumes
    around 120 mA to 150 mA during the preheating phase;  Operating Current: After
    preheating, the operating current drops to around 40 mA during gas sensing;  Standby
    Current: Minimal standby power consumption after preheating. The daily electrical
    load schedule is given in Table 3, while yearly analysis on the solar panel is
    carried out in the following sections. Table 3. Daily electrical load schedule.
    2.1.3. Sensor and Actuator Accuracy and Ranges DHT11 Temperature Sensor: Accuracy:
    ±2  ∘ C; Measurement range: 0  ∘ C to 50  ∘ C. DHT11 Humidity Sensor: Accuracy:
    ±5%; Measurement range: 20% to 90% RH. MQ135 Air Quality Sensor: Accuracy: ±10%;
    Measurement range: 0 to 1000 ppm CO 2 . LDR Light Sensors: Accuracy: ±10%; Measurement
    range: 0 to 1000 lux. DC Motors: Position accuracy: ±1%; Speed control accuracy:
    ±5%. 2.2. Proposed Artificial Neural Network A neural network model is very efficient
    to solve complex problems. In this research, an artificial neural network (ANN)
    was deployed to resolve the problem of optimizing the quality of the harvesting
    system, in which we needed to determine the existing pattern and compare it with
    new results. The gaps in existing results could be found using the backpropagation
    neural network technique. ANN is composed of interconnected elements called neurons,
    which compute values from input and give the necessary output to solve complex
    problems. In this project, the ANN model is deployed to investigate the energy
    harvesting system for the alternative prediction in comparison to the input function
    to obtain better efficiency and optimization. Backpropagation was used for the
    training of ANN, in which neurons were trained according to a given pattern. Proper
    training of neurons ensures the lowest error rate. Backpropagation is a learning
    algorithm that is mainly used by a multilayer perceptron. In this type of technique,
    results or outputs are compared with given values. The learning procedure adjusts
    the links between layers to optimize output. The main reason to select this method
    was its ability to perform a specific task or solve problems, i.e., it is required
    to train a model with certain data. The network was trained based on specific
    values, which improved with time using the backpropagation algorithm. At the start,
    weight distributions were random, and prediction was also random. Then, after
    a specific interval of time, the optimization step was completed by comparing
    the output with the output values which were already known. 2.3. Power of the
    Measuring System The power consumption of a measuring system depends on several
    factors, including the number of sensors, data transmission frequency, data processing
    components, and power management efficiency. A brief overview is provided in Table
    4. Table 4. Components and their corresponding power consumption. 2.4. Algorithm
    for QoS Optimization The sun position algorithm was used to determine the position
    of the sun at a given time for a specific location, using Algorithm 1. The position
    of the sun relative to the earth is affected by the revolution and rotation of
    the earth. Therefore, the sun’s position depends on the time, date, and geographic
    location: longitude (0 to 180 ∘ ) and latitude (0 to ±90 ∘ ). The position of
    the sun was calculated by universal time. World time and daily time were based
    on universal time. The metric T was the difference between two-time scales: Δ𝑇=𝑇𝐷−𝑈𝑇
    (5) Algorithm 1 Algorithm for QoS optimization Input Parameters: Local date, Time,
    Time Zone, Location (latitude and longitude), Altitude 1: Conversion of UTC time
    into TDT 2: Calculate the angle of declination 𝐷=𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑠𝑖𝑛(22.439−0.00000036∗(𝐽𝐷−2451545))∗𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝐿))
    3: Calculate sun transit 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡=12+𝑇𝑍−( 𝐿 15 −𝐸𝑞𝑇) The time equation can be used
    as 𝐸𝑞𝑇= 𝑞 15 −𝑅𝐴 where RA is 𝑅𝐴=𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑛(𝑐𝑜𝑠(22439−0.00000036∗(𝐼𝑑−2451545))∗ 𝑆𝑖𝑛(𝐿)
    𝐶𝑜𝑠(𝐿) )) 4: Conversion of transit time from UTC to TDT 5: Using the declination
    angle of the sun and transit time, sunrise and sunset times can be obtained 3.
    Results To evaluate the performance of our model and algorithm, we conducted various
    experiments. The results of these experiments are presented in the following sections.
    3.1. System Efficiency We must compare the power provided by the sun to the electricity
    generated in order to determine the efficiency of the panel. A panel would be
    100% efficient if it could convert all of the light that struck it into energy.
    Unfortunately, achieving such efficiency is impossible. We used the following
    equation to analyze the efficiency of the proposed system (the length and width
    of the panel are given in meters (m)): 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦= 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 (𝑘𝑊) 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ×𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ×𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒
    ×100 (6) 3.2. Daily Analysis Different experiments were carried out in the spring
    season to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Table 5 shows the
    average values of different experiments. These values then can be used by the
    farmers for making further decisions. These real-time data on weather parameters
    such as temperature, humidity, etc. can help farmers make informed decisions on
    irrigation, pest control, and other crop management practices. Table 5. Average
    value of different experiments. Table 5 shows the average values across multiple
    test days, rather than being tied to a specific date. The metrics such as temperature,
    humidity, and air quality were averaged across several experiments. Even without
    the specific dates, these data can still provide some useful insights: The temperature
    range and fluctuations give an indication of typical conditions that may be experienced.
    This could help with system design considerations; The humidity and air quality
    averages establish baseline levels for the location. This is valuable reference
    information; The diurnal temperature profile shows the temperature variation over
    a 24 h cycle. This can inform solar energy generation modeling; The values then
    can be used by the farmers for making further decisions. These real-time data
    on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, etc. can help farmers make
    informed decisions on irrigation, pest control, and other crop management practices.
    Figure 3 provides a graph representing temperature values obtained from a temperature
    sensor installed on the system. The temperature data were recorded at regular
    intervals, typically hourly. These recorded values can be utilized by farmers
    for various purposes. Upon observing the graph, it becomes apparent that the temperature
    fluctuates within specific ranges throughout the day. By glancing at the graph,
    one can easily identify the highest and lowest temperature points. Figure 3. Day
    1 temperature analysis graph. On day 1, as shown in Figure 4, the humidity demonstrated
    a rising trend as the day progressed. This indicates that the humidity levels
    increase gradually over time. Simultaneously, the carbon dioxide levels showed
    a decreasing trend, suggesting a decline in the concentration of carbon dioxide
    in the environment. Thus, the graph illustrates the trend of humidity increasing
    as the day progresses, while the levels of carbon dioxide decrease. The temperature
    readings generally remained within a favorable range. However, there was a spike
    in temperature at some point, which can be attributed to irregularities in the
    sensors used for measurement. Figure 4. Day 1 humidity analysis graph. In the
    results for experiment 2, shown in Figure 5, a similar trend is observed, with
    the graphs displaying small variations in values. The temperature readings ranged
    between 25 and 35 degrees, indicating a relatively stable temperature range. The
    temperature graph shows that the temperature remained within a favorable range
    of 25 to 30 degrees Celsius throughout the day. This consistent temperature level
    suggests stable conditions. However, it is important to note that there was a
    spike in temperature at some point, which can be attributed to irregularities
    or inaccuracies in the sensors used to measure temperature. Overall, the observed
    trends on day 1 indicate increasing humidity, decreasing carbon dioxide levels,
    and a stable temperature within a desirable range. The irregular temperature spike
    should be considered with caution due to potential sensor inaccuracies. Figure
    5. Day 2 temperature analysis graph. Figure 6 shows that the humidity values fluctuated
    within a narrow range of 55 to 57 points. This suggests a consistent level of
    humidity throughout the experiment. The close proximity of the temperature and
    humidity values implies a potential correlation between these two variables. The
    similarity in trends between experiment 1 and experiment 2 may indicate that the
    factors influencing temperature and humidity remain relatively constant or have
    similar patterns during both experiments. It is worth noting that further analysis
    and data collection would be necessary to determine the significance and implications
    of these observations accurately. Figure 6. Day 2 humidity analysis graph. On
    day 3, as shown in Figure 7, a similar trend to the previous days was observed.
    The temperature graph indicates that the temperature ranged between 23 and 26
    degrees Celsius, with small variations within this range. Similarly, the humidity
    values fluctuated between 51 and 65 points, suggesting relatively stable humidity
    levels. The consistency in the trends of temperature and humidity between day
    1, day 2, and day 3 may indicate a continued pattern or stable environmental conditions
    during this period. Figure 7. Day 3 temperature analysis graph. On day 3 as shown
    in Figure 8, the humidity demonstrated a rising trend as the day progressed. This
    indicates that the humidity levels increase gradually over time. Simultaneously,
    the carbon dioxide levels showed a decreasing trend, suggesting a decline in the
    concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment. Figure 8. Day 3 humidity analysis
    graph. In experiment 4, as shown in Figure 9, a distinct trend was observed, where
    the temperature increased as the day progressed, indicating hotter days. The temperature
    readings staredt at 20 degrees and gradually rose to 35 degrees. This trend aligns
    with scientific understanding, as temperatures tend to increase during the daytime
    due to factors such as solar radiation and atmospheric conditions. Additionally,
    it is noted that the nights were colder, suggesting a drop in temperature during
    nighttime hours. This is a common occurrence, as heat is radiated back into the
    atmosphere during the night, resulting in cooler temperatures. Furthermore, the
    maximum temperature recorded during the day reaches a high, indicating a particularly
    hot day during the course of the experiment. Figure 9. Day 4 temperature analysis
    graph. The provided graphs, as shown in Figure 10, represent humidity values and
    air quality values obtained from a temperature sensor placed in a system. The
    humidity values were recorded per minute, while the air quality values specifically
    measured carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels and were also recorded per minute. These
    values were collected at regular intervals and can be utilized by farmers for
    various purposes. In the humidity graph, it can be observed that there were fluctuations
    in humidity levels. Notably, when water was sprinkled or introduced into the system,
    the humidity level varied accordingly. This suggests that the addition of water
    affects the humidity levels, which can be valuable information for farmers in
    determining irrigation or moisture management strategies. Figure 10. Day 1 air
    quality analysis graph. In the air quality graph, the values represent the concentration
    of carbon dioxide in the air. It is evident that the CO 2 levels varied over time,
    and there were distinct increases in value when plants released carbon dioxide.
    This information can be beneficial for farmers to monitor the health and growth
    of plants and potentially adjust ventilation or other environmental factors to
    optimize plant growth. The availability of real-time humidity and air quality
    data can assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding irrigation, moisture
    control, and environmental management practices, ultimately improving agricultural
    productivity and plant health. In the air quality graph, as shown in Figure 11,
    the values represent the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. It is evident
    that the CO 2 levels varied over time, and there were distinct increases in value
    when plants released carbon dioxide. This information can be beneficial for farmers
    to monitor the health and growth of plants and potentially adjust ventilation
    or other environmental factors to optimize plant growth. Figure 11. Day 2 air
    quality analysis graph. 3.3. Annual Analysis Based on the results obtained from
    various systems observed over the course of a year, it has been found that the
    dual-axis system exhibited the highest output efficiency, specifically measuring
    98.7%. In comparison, the horizontal-axis system achieved an output efficiency
    of 98.2%, while the vertical-axis system achieved an output efficiency of 98.3%,
    both with a sloped angle. These output efficiency values indicate the effectiveness
    of each system in converting irradiance (solar energy) into usable output. The
    higher the output efficiency, the more effectively the system is able to harness
    solar energy and convert it into usable forms such as electricity or heat. To
    further understand the context and implications of these findings, the irradiance
    values are provided. Irradiance refers to the power per unit area received from
    the sun, typically measured in Watts per square meter. Figure 12 presents the
    likely variations in irradiance throughout the year, which can help explain the
    differences in output efficiency observed across the different systems. By analyzing
    the irradiance values and correlating them with the system’s output efficiency,
    it becomes possible to gain insights into how solar energy availability and intensity
    impact the performance of each system. Figure 12. Irradiance values. In Figure
    12, the graph displays the values of irradiance generated from a simulation over
    a one-year time period. The graph likely shows the variations in irradiance levels
    throughout different seasons or months of the year. The purpose of this comparison
    is to evaluate the performance of a simple harvesting system that lacks a tracking
    feature. It is observed that the simple system, without tracking, is unable to
    capture the full irradiance available. As a result, the system experiences lower
    output power compared to the simulated values of irradiance. The comparison of
    the difference in performance of different components is provided in Table 6.
    Table 6. Production efficiency of different components. The comparison between
    the simulated irradiance values and the performance of the simple system highlights
    the importance of tracking features in maximizing the capture of solar energy.
    Tracking systems are designed to align solar panels or collectors with the direction
    of the sun, optimizing the absorption of sunlight and increasing output efficiency.
    The lower output power of the simple system underscores the potential benefits
    of implementing more advanced tracking systems, such as dual-axis or other sophisticated
    tracking mechanisms. These systems can adjust their position to follow the sun’s
    path, ensuring optimal exposure to irradiance and maximizing the energy harvested
    from solar sources. This comparison serves as evidence supporting the use of tracking
    systems for enhancing the performance and output power of solar harvesting systems.
    In the provided figure, it is documented that the dual-axis tracking system has
    demonstrated the capability to capture the highest amount of sunlight or sun rays
    throughout the year. The graph likely depicts the irradiance values or solar energy
    received by the dual-axis tracking system over different time periods. Furthermore,
    a comparison was made between the horizontal system and the dual-axis tracking
    system, as shown in Figure 13. It is observed that the horizontal system, which
    is a fixed system without any tracking capability, exhibits a consistent and linear
    line over the entire year on the graph. This implies that the horizontal system
    does not adjust its position to track the movement of the sun. In contrast, the
    dual-axis tracking system, which has the ability to adjust its position both horizontally
    and vertically to track the sun’s movement, shows more variability in irradiance
    values over the year. This indicates that the dual-axis tracking system is able
    to align itself optimally with the sun’s position, maximizing the capture of sunlight
    and resulting in higher irradiance levels compared to the fixed horizontal system.
    Figure 13. Irradiance values. The comparison between the two systems further emphasizes
    the advantages of incorporating tracking capabilities in solar harvesting systems.
    By tracking the sun’s movement throughout the day and year, the dual-axis system
    can consistently optimize its orientation and capture a higher amount of sunlight,
    leading to increased irradiance and potentially higher energy output. These findings
    highlight the importance of considering tracking systems, such as the dual-axis
    system, for maximizing solar energy utilization and enhancing the performance
    of solar harvesting systems. 3.4. Performance of Artificial Neural Network The
    best validation performance is described with the help of Figure 14, in which
    the system’s performance is explained after running an ANN simulation. Results
    obtained after simulation showed that performance remains stable at the same value
    but, without using this, it may decrease over time. In Figure 14, the histogram
    shows that there were many faults but, after using the ANN technique, quality
    increased. Figure 14. Validation performance of ANN. The best validation performance
    is 0.024918 at epoch 416. A neural network was proposed to optimize the system’s
    efficiency. It contained different layers—3, 10, and 15 layers and neurons were
    used to obtain an optimal architecture. The data were split into train, test,
    and validation sets. The training process proceeded, provided that the system
    continuously enhanced the authentication established. The test pair offered an
    autonomous way of measuring network precision completely. The final architecture
    of ANN contained 3 hidden layers, each with 10 neurons, while the output had 3
    possibilities. This structure provided the best functionality in classification
    among all examined architectures. The number of epochs used for training the ANN
    was 500; however, the best results were obtained at 416 epochs. A histogram analysis
    of ANN is shown in Figure 15. For training ANN, there were three algorithms: Figure
    15. Error histogram for ANN. Levenberg–Marquardt; Bayesian Regularization; Scaled
    Conjugate Gradient. The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm consumes more memory, but,
    positively, it takes less time. Training automatically halts when there is no
    further improvement in generalization. This algorithm was chosen for simulation.
    In the Bayesian regularization procedure, more time is consumed but the output
    is satisfactory, even for datasets which are small, noisy, or difficult. The process
    stops with weight minimization. A scaled conjugate gradient algorithm does not
    use more memory. It stops when there is no further improvement, which is identified
    by increasing the value of the mean square fault of a sample. 3.5. Important Characteristics
    of the Proposed Approach The approach presented in this paper improves the existing
    system in several ways: Improved Efficiency: The main objective of this research
    is to enhance the efficiency of solar panels in providing constant power to sensors
    in agricultural fields. By implementing a solar tracking system that changes its
    direction in two axes based on the sun’s position, the proposed approach optimizes
    the orientation of the solar panels for maximum energy generation; Real-time Data
    Collection: In addition to energy maximization, the proposed system also focuses
    on collecting real-time data on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    and rainfall. These data can be used by farmers to make informed decisions regarding
    irrigation, pest control, and other crop management practices. The collected data
    are transferred to a mobile app, making it easier for farmers to access and utilize
    the information; Hardware Experimental Setup: A testbed with a hardware experimental
    setup is designed to evaluate the system’s capability to track the sun effectively.
    This allows for practical testing and validation of the proposed approach; Integration
    of AI Techniques: The research incorporates AI techniques along with a QoS algorithm
    to improve the quality of service provided by the existing system. This integration
    enhances the overall performance and functionality of the system; Improved Results:
    The research demonstrates that the proposed system leads to a relative increase
    in efficiency of up to 52% compared to the existing system. These improved results
    highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing energy generation
    and providing valuable data for agricultural purposes. In summary, the approach
    presented in this paper introduces a solar tracking system that enhances the efficiency
    of solar panels, collects real-time weather data, incorporates AI techniques,
    and achieves significant improvements in performance compared to the existing
    system. 3.6. Limitations and Future Work The yearly energy efficiency results
    show that the values for dual-axis (98.7%), single-axis (98.2%), and fixed tilt
    (98.3%) are very close, and these small differences may not justify the added
    complexity and cost of dual-axis tracking. A fixed tilt system is likely much
    cheaper and simpler than a dual-axis tracker. The paper could have included estimated
    system costs and discussed whether the fractional efficiency gain of the dual-axis
    justifies the expense. A detailed cost–benefit analysis would strengthen these
    results in the future. Similarly, highlighting the economic trade-offs and costs,
    not just the technical efficiency gains, would give a more complete picture, but
    this research focused on the technical capabilities of the dual-axis tracking
    system to optimize energy yield. Dual-axis tracking is a known technique, and
    the novelty lies in the application focus. The lack of economic analysis makes
    the real-world value unclear. While this initial research focused primarily on
    demonstrating a proof of concept and evaluating the energy optimization capabilities,
    further studies on the reliability, robustness, and maintenance requirements would
    provide valuable additional insights. We could address reliability and maintainability
    in future work that includes the following: Conducting reliability engineering
    analyses such as FMEA to identify potential failure modes and their effects. This
    can help highlight vulnerabilities to be mitigated; Performing accelerated life
    testing on system components to evaluate lifespan and deterioration over time.
    These data can inform maintenance schedules; Implementing self-diagnostic features
    and fault-tolerant architectures to improve reliability and reduce downtime; Evaluating
    ease of repair, replacement, and upkeep to minimize maintenance labor time/costs;
    Considering the use of higher-durability components, weatherproofing, and corrosion-resistance
    to withstand harsh outdoor conditions; Analyzing tradeoffs between reliability
    gains and additional costs to find the optimal balance. Incorporating these factors
    into future work on the solar tracking system could provide a more complete picture
    of overall performance and feasibility. While this research focused on the technical
    capabilities of the dual-axis tracking system to optimize energy yield, economic
    considerations are also important. As the paper notes in the introduction, a key
    challenge with solar PV is improving conversion efficiency and reducing manufacturing
    costs to be competitive with conventional power. The work on comparing the costs
    of expanding the fixed array footprint versus adding dual-axis tracking is excellent.
    The paper compares energy efficiency metrics across different systems but does
    not factor in land usage. As the small footprint increase may be acceptable for
    agricultural applications, it is a good avenue for future work. Incorporating
    the economic analysis described would strengthen the paper by balancing the technical
    potential against practical cost factors in the future. 4. Conclusions This research
    aimed to develop a dual-axis solar tracking system to enhance renewable energy
    optimization and collection from solar sources. The key goals were to improve
    solar panel efficiency, collect real-time weather data, and maximize energy yield
    through optimal panel orientation. The results demonstrated that the proposed
    approach increased efficiency by up to 52% compared to fixed solar panels. This
    aligned with the goal of optimizing efficiency through a tracking mechanism. The
    system also transmitted temperature, humidity, and air quality data to farmers
    via a mobile app. This achieved the objective of real-time data collection for
    agricultural applications. Additionally, the artificial neural network optimization
    increased performance stability, meeting the aim of incorporating AI techniques.
    The prototype testbed validated the ability to accurately track the sun’s position,
    fulfilling the goal of experimental validation. Overall, the dual-axis control
    scheme optimized the solar panel orientation to maximize energy generation in
    alignment with the aims. The combination of efficiency gains, data collection
    capabilities, AI integration, and experimental validation demonstrate that the
    stated goals and objectives were achieved. While further work can build upon these
    results, this research makes significant contributions to developing an intelligent,
    high-efficiency solar tracking system with agricultural data monitoring. The outcomes
    provide a foundation for additional studies into reliability, economics, and end-user
    validation to strengthen real-world viability. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: 'Africa is the second largest continent after Asia, having a larger
    than 30 million km2 area. Doubtlessly, one of the biggest ecological and societal
    problems of the twenty-first century is climate change. Since the early 1970s,
    it has been clear that Africa is already experiencing the effects of climate change,
    and it has given rise to a wide range of new and unusual phenomena, such as rising
    temperatures, poor agricultural output, extreme different weather scenarios, and
    the spread of disease, among other things. Therefore, the current review aims
    at screening the impact of climate change on agricultural sector, human health
    and food security in Africa compared to the other continents, evaluating the change
    projections in future and highlighting the role of African leaders in mitigating
    and adapting to these effects. Artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and high-tech
    algorithms were applied to analyze these effects. Historical data were downloaded
    in near real-time from January 2009 to the present from the FAO Water Productivity
    Open-access portal WaPOR and Terra Climate datasets on Earth Engine platform.
    Assessment process was performed using Google Earth Engine, whereas future data
    were downloaded from WorldClim 2.1. We used 2021–2040 timelines and two scenarios:
    SSP245 and SSP585. For the SSP and timeline, we downloaded four versions, based
    on four different global circulation models (GCMs): IPSL-CM6A-LR (France), MRI-ESM2-0
    (Japan), CanESM5 (Canadian), and BCC-CSM2-MR (China), to reflect the uncertainty
    among GCMs. We averaged future projection of each variable and SSP across four
    GCMs to decrease the uncertainty connected with a particular GCM. We presented
    the averaged results as maps. Annual precipitation totals were significantly above
    average in Central and East Africa, while under SSP 245 scenario, Madagascar would
    experience high rainfall. The highest temperature anomalies were seen in parts
    of the Greater Horn of Africa, western equatorial regions, and the north-western
    part of the continent. Minimum and Maximum temperature predictions showed that
    Africa would experience harsh temperatures than previously recorded in the historical
    years. A high average maximum temperature is predicted across the sub-Sahara Africa,
    South Africa, Somalia, and Madagascar under SSP 245 and SSP 585. The MCD64A1 dataset
    tagged in Earth Engine was used to classify forest fire risk in Africa. Analysis
    revealed that the highest fire risk was recorded in Savannah in tropical and subtropical
    Africa. Further, changes in rainfall and increased temperature leading to increased
    evaporation would directly reduce runoff levels and recharge groundwater which
    in turn will have negative effects on biodiversity, agriculture, and food security.
    Notably, African leaders have played positive role in the recent climate negotiations
    and bright climate initiatives have been emerged. Hopefully they will solve the
    climate crisis across the continent.'

    Introduction A major threat to natural diversity and ecosystems has arisen from
    climate change (Bedair et al. 2020). Notably, the average temperature has risen
    by 0.7 °C worldwide over the past century and is likely to continue to do so.
    According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the temperatures
    are predicted to increase by 1.1–6.4 °C by the end of the twenty-first century
    in comparison to 1980–1999 baselines (Change 2014). Notably, the average global
    precipitation has risen by 2% in the last 100 years and is predicted to continue
    rising in future (Change 2014). On the other hand, Africa is a highly susceptible
    continent from the climate change perspective that directly confront the African
    people, their government, and African Union (AU), affecting various aspects of
    people’s everyday lives (Tadesse 2010). For instance, 0.7 °C warming has been
    observed over the twentieth century with an expectation to increase by 0.2 °C–0.5
    °C each decade (Change 2014; Hulme et al. 2001). Similarly, the precipitation
    pattern of Africa is also quite variable as the historical record reveals that
    in East and Central Africa, rainfall has increased over the past century (Change
    2014; Hulme et al. 2001). In addition to the climate change in Africa, it has
    been observed to be linked with the changes in the frequency and intensity of
    extreme events such as episodes of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Midgley
    and Bond 2015). Most importantly, with the increase in the climate change in the
    next decades, it is expected that this will majorly affect the biodiversity of
    Africa_ENREF_4 (Midgley and Bond 2015) and agricultural production (Coulibaly
    et al. 2020) immensely. According to several studies, Africa has a rich biodiversity
    that is estimated to include one-fifth of all known mammal species, plants, and
    birds, as well as one-sixth of all known species of herbs. It also has a variety
    of ecosystems, including savannahs, tropical forests, coral reefs, marine, and
    freshwater ecosystems (Bedair 2020; Millennium ecosystem assessment 2005). These
    diverse ecosystems provide huge benefits to many of the African communities as
    ecosystem serves by providing sustainable livelihoods with feed/fuel-wood/food/timber,
    supporting soil establishment, nutrient accumulation, and cultural services/recreation/eco-tourism
    (Bedair 2020; Millennium ecosystem assessment 2005). However, the climate change
    along with the anthropogenic stressors largely threatened these biodiversity,
    ecosystem, and ecosystem services since it disrupts energy and material circulation
    dynamics (Zhong and Wang 2017). Notably, the climate change is also highly dependent
    on the conversion of biological resources to the useful goods and services. For
    instance, the process by which grasslands and forests are turned into agricultural
    land leads to the emission of various greenhouse gasses (GHGs) (Burnham and Ma
    2016). Therefore, mitigation of climate change could be possible by successful
    management of the GHG emissions and carbon sequestration (Araos et al. 2016).
    Similarly, the climate change poses main risks to the African agriculture production
    that accounts for the Africa’s major socio-economic development, leading to economic
    crisis, largely in the poor African countries in particular where temperature
    plays a pivotal role affecting the agricultural production. Also, the drought
    negatively impacts the African agrarian production largely, irrespective of the
    countries’ economical and developmental states (Coulibaly et al. 2020). Therefore,
    it is crucial that African researchers and farmers implement cutting-edge techniques
    like synthetic biology, genomic selection, and CRISPR–CRISPR-associated protein
    9 (Cas9) in agriculture that provide robust solutions for the environment affected
    by climate change (Francisco Ribeiro and Camargo Rodriguez 2020). The current
    review, therefore, based on the literature and the available climate datasets,
    has aimed to analyze, summarize, and identify the effect of the climate change
    on Africa especially with the loss of biodiversity and the agricultural system.
    Current effects and future projections on precipitation, temperature, and water
    resources have been assessed as well. The forest fire risk along the continent
    in the recent 20 years has been also estimated. Additionally, the emerging technologies,
    initiatives, and policies that possibly could minimize the effects of climate
    change on Africa also been talked about. Also, investigation of the knowledge
    gaps and gray areas that could serve as a groundwork for subsequent studies by
    researchers and envisage prospects in the research were also explored. African
    Climate Changes Over the Last Ten Years and Future Projections Africa covers more
    than 30 million km2 of land, making it the second largest continent after Asia
    (11 million mi2). The waters of the Atlantic and Indian oceans border the continent
    on the west, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean on the east, the Mediterranean
    Sea on the north, and the Atlantic Ocean on the south. In fact, its climatic zonation
    reflects the fact that of all the continents, it is the most evenly spaced with
    respect to the equator (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/). The Köppen–Geiger
    climate classification for Africa shows that only three of the major climatic
    types (Zone A: tropical or equatorial zone, Zone B: arid or dry zone, Zone C:
    warm/mild temperate zone) are present in Africa (Bedair et al. 2023a; Kottek et
    al. 2006). The weather and the climate are becoming more unpredictable in Africa,
    which causes calamities and disrupts the economic, ecological, and social systems
    (https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10421). According to a brand new
    report focused solely on the continent of Africa, the rise in sea levels, irregular
    rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and more extreme weather are all blatant
    signs of climate change that endanger availability of food and water, human health
    and safety, and socioeconomic development (https://unfccc.int/news/climate-change-is-an-increasing-threat-to-africa).
    At roughly 3.6 mm/yr and 4.1 mm/yr, respectively, the sea-level rise rates along
    the tropical, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean coasts are faster than the world
    mean rate. The pace of sea-level rise in the Mediterranean coasts is about 2.9
    mm/year slower than the average rate worldwide (Bedair et al. 2022b) (https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10421).
    Sea-level trends around Africa exhibit substantial geographical variation. From
    Madagascar eastward toward and beyond Mauritius, the south-western Indian Ocean
    experienced a sea-level rise of more than 5 mm each year. In several maritime
    regions encircling the continent, it reached 5 mm annually. This exceeds the typical
    annual worldwide sea-level rise of 3 to 4 mm (https://unfccc.int/news/climate-change-is-an-increasing-threat-to-africa).
    The coastlines of Benin, Côte d''Ivoire, Senegal, and Togo are eroding at a rate
    of about 56%, and this is predicted to get worse in future. Precipitation The
    precipitation data source in this study is Climate Hazards center InfraRed Precipitation
    with Station data (CHIRPS) (Table 1, Fig. 1). In east of the Gulf of Guinea, along
    West Africa''s south coast, to the northwest of the High Atlas Mountains, in the
    Madeira and Canary Islands, and elsewhere in Southern Africa, and in some areas
    of Madagascar, the annual precipitation totals in 2019 were below the long-term
    means. By the end of the century, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
    (IPCC) predicts less precipitation will fall over the south-western parts of South
    Africa and North Africa (https://unfccc.int/news/climate-change-is-an-increasing-threat-to-africa).
    In Central and East Africa, annual precipitation totals that were significantly
    above average (above the 90th percentile) were noted. All of southern Africa''s
    major regions, including the Canary Islands, northwest of the High Atlas Mountains,
    and east of the Gulf of Guinea, experienced extremely little yearly precipitation
    amounts (below the 10th percentile) (https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10421).
    Table 1 Overview of annual precipitation data components (Nations 2020) Full size
    table Fig. 1 Source: WaPOR, remote sensing for water productivity Datasets tagged
    WaPOR in Earth Engine Annual variability of precipitation of Africa (2009–2021).
    Full size image For future projections, we downloaded a dataset of future precipitation
    from the WorldClim 2.1 database (Fick and Hijmans 2017). We used the dates 2021–2040
    and the scenarios SSP245 (a moderate, middle-of-the-road scenario representing
    RCP4.5 from the fifth report) and SSP585 (fossil-fuel-based development or business-as-usual,
    reflecting RCP8.5) (Anibaba et al. 2022). Forecasting future precipitation is
    a bit difficult. In fact, our finding revealed future precipitation prediction
    for Africa is not uniform across the continent. Under SSP 245 scenario, Madagascar
    would experience high rainfall specifically the north-western part of country.
    However, western, northern, and some part of southern part of the continent would
    record low precipitation pattern within 2021–2040 timeline. Similar pattern was
    observed in SSP 585 for the studied timeline (Fig. 2). While declining in some
    areas of southern, western, and northern Africa, annual precipitation will increase
    across much of eastern and central Africa. Some areas have seen annual increases
    of more than 200 mm and more than 25%, while others have seen decreases of more
    than 100 mm and more than 20%. There is disagreement among climate models regarding
    the speed or even the direction of change. However, there are some areas where
    climate models agree strongly: for various regions of northern and southern Africa,
    less precipitation is predicted by more than 80% of climate models (Porter et
    al. 2014). Fig. 2 Precipitation change projection (2021–2040) under SSP 245 and
    585 scenarios Full size image Temperature In mainland Africa, the average temperature
    for 2019 ranged from 0.56 °C to 0.63 °C higher than the long-term mean of 1981–2010,
    making it the third warmest year on record behind 2010 and 2016. The average rate
    of temperature increase in Africa is 1 °C per year. South Africa, Namibia, and
    certain areas of Angola had temperatures that were more than 2 °C above the 1981–2010
    normal. Large regions of the continent, spanning from the north to the south,
    were more than 1 °C above average. Only a small portion of the northwest, including
    Mauritania, and nearby ocean regions saw temperatures slightly below average between
    1981 and 2010 (https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10421). In all African
    sub-regions, the warming trend from 1991 to 2020 was higher than from 1961 to
    1990 and noticeably higher than from 1931 to 1960 (Fig. 3). The highest temperature
    anomalies were seen in parts of the Greater Horn of Africa, western equatorial
    regions, and the north-western part of the continent (Blunden and Boyer 2021).
    There have been more heat waves and hot days since 1901, and over 1 °C of warming
    has already occurred across parts of Africa. According to some research, a temperature
    increase of 10 °C would result in a 10% drop in runoff while maintaining the same
    level of rainfall (https://www.uneca.org/acpc). Africa''s temperatures rising,
    given the present emissions trajectory, are 2.7 degrees Celsius by the 2040s.
    Minimum and Maximum temperature predictions showed that Africa would experience
    harsher temperatures than previously recorded in the historical years. A high
    average maximum temperature is predicted across the sub-Sahara Africa, South Africa,
    Somalia, and Madagascar under SSP 245 and SSP 585. Similarly, Morocco, Algeria,
    and Tunisia would record an extremely average minimum temperature within the studied
    timeline under SSP 245 and 585. The averaged minimum and maximum temperature change
    is not uniform across the Africa (Fig. 4). Fig. 3 Source: Terra Climate datasets,
    Earth Engine platform Annual Temperature (2009–2022). Full size image Fig. 4 Anticipated
    changes in annual mean minimum and maximum temperatures (in °C) and for the African
    continent under 245 and 585 SSP Full size image Carbon Footprints Estimation in
    Changing African Environment The total amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into
    the atmosphere and caused by the activities of organizations, communities, or
    individuals is referred to as a carbon footprint. These gasses include methane,
    nitrous oxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor (https://www.dbsa.org/article/dbsas-plan-reduce-africas-carbon-footprint-through-green-transport).
    The overall carbon emission contribution for African continent is far lower than
    other continents. In fact, only 3.8% of the world''s greenhouse gas emissions
    are produced in Africa. The World Resources Institute estimates carbon dioxide
    emissions in Africa are 0.8 metric tons per person, compared to 3.9 tons globally
    (Change 2006). Despite the fact that Africa contributes a negligible amount to
    global greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of climate change will be felt severely
    in Africa, and therefore, African cities are preparing themselves to engage in

    glaciers are receding more quickly than has ever been recorded in the past. Some
    glaciers now encompass 20% of the area they did one hundred years ago. Flooding
    and rock avalanches from unstable slopes are dangers that are increased by melting
    glaciers. Coastal areas are at risk from increased flooding from the sea and,
    in some cases, from rivers, particularly in densely populated delta regions in
    south and Southeast Asia. Additionally, climate change may increase crop output
    in east and southeast Asia by up to 20% by the middle of the twenty-first century,
    while decreasing yield in central and south Asia by up to 30%. Due to anticipated
    changes in the water cycle brought on by climate change, illness and fatalities
    from diarrheal disease are likely to rise in east, south, and southeast Asia (Pörtner
    et al. 2022). Regarding Australia and New Zealand, water security issues are predicted
    to worsen with a 1 °C world average warming in the northern and some eastern regions
    of New Zealand, as well as in southwestern and southeastern Australia, A large
    portion of southern Australia as well as the northern and eastern regions of New
    Zealand are expected to experience declines in agricultural and forestry output
    due to increased drought and fire. Further, coastal regions will continue to be
    affected by sea-level rise, stronger storms, and coastal flooding. More people
    and infrastructure would be at danger as a result of coastal development and population
    growth in places like Cairns and Southeast Queensland (Australia) and Northland
    to Bay of Plenty (New Zealand). By 2050, some ecologically rich areas, such as
    the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland Wet Tropics, will have a major risk to their
    biodiversity (Pörtner et al. 2022; UN 2007). In Europe, wide-ranging effects of
    climate change, such as receding glaciers, rising sea levels, lengthening growing
    seasons, shifting species'' ranges, and health effects linked to heat waves, have
    already been observed. Higher temperatures and drought in southern Europe could
    decrease water availability, hydropower potential, summer tourism, and agricultural
    output, impeding economic activity more than in other parts of Europe. Moreover,
    the summer precipitation is expected to decline in Central and Eastern Europe,
    increasing water stress. Forecasts indicate a decrease in forest productivity.
    It is anticipated that wetland fires will occur more frequently (Pörtner et al.
    2022). Initial predictions for climate change in northern Europe include a range
    of outcomes, including some advantages like decreased demand for heating, increased
    agricultural yields, and increased growth of the forest. Benefits are likely to
    exceed drawbacks as long as climate change persists. These include rising ground
    instability brought on by thawing permafrost, more frequent winter floods, and
    threatened habitats (Lavalle et al. 2009). In eastern Amazonia, Savanna is expected
    to progressively take the place of tropical forest by the middle of the century
    as a result of rising temperatures and falling soil moisture (Funatsu et al. 2019).
    In drier regions of South America, climate change will probably make droughts
    worse, which will degrade arable land and cause salinization (increased salt content)
    (Mushtaq et al. 2020) and desertification (land degradation). In some regions,
    it is anticipated that the productivity of livestock and some significant commodities,
    like maize and coffee, will decline, with detrimental effects on food security
    (Porter et al. 2014). Soybean harvests are expected to rise in temperate regions.
    The availability of water for human consumption, agriculture, and energy production
    is expected to be greatly impacted by changes in precipitation patterns and the
    melting of glaciers (Grimm 2011; Pörtner et al. 2022). Regarding North America,
    warming in western mountains will decrease snowpack, increase winter flooding,
    and reduce summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources
    (Pörtner et al. 2022). Crops, such as corn, soy, and cotton, which are near the
    warm end of their suitable range or that depend on highly utilized water resources
    will likely face major challenges. High emissions scenarios project reductions
    in yields by as much as 80% by the end of the century (Overpeck and Udall 2020).
    Climate change in the Arctic will probably result in less sea ice and permafrost,
    which may or may not have an impact on human settlements. Infrastructure damage
    and modifications to winter pursuits like ice fishing and ice road travel could
    both have negative effects. More navigable northern sea paths could be one of
    the benefits. Consequently, it is projected that sea-level rise will make erosion,
    storm surge, and other coastal dangers worse (Falardeau and Bennett 2020). These
    effects would put at risk the settlements, facilities, and infrastructure that
    are essential to the survival of island populations (Pörtner et al. 2022). In
    fact, Europe and North America recorded the highest rise in average temperature
    by 0.8 °C in the recent 10 years, compared to Africa (0.7 °C), Oceania, Asia,
    and Australia (0.6 °C) (https://www.worlddata.info/global-warming.php). Causes
    of Climate Change in Africa Complex origins and effects of climate change make
    them issues deserving of social study (Dietz et al. 2020). According to the US
    National Climate Assessment, human activity is mostly to blame for how quickly
    the earth''s climate is changing right now compared to any other time in our civilization
    (Dietz et al. 2020). Crop residue burning, the transport sector, and the use of
    fossil fuels for electricity and heating are major contributors to worldwide emissions
    (Najjar 2011). In fact, savannah burning and forest fires (grass plains in tropical
    or subtropical countries) are natural events that cause air pollution (Mathur
    and Srivastava 2019). According to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, forest loss has historically
    been a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for an estimated 47%
    of all emissions since 1750 (Le Quéré et al. 2015). Deforestation and forest loss
    continue, notwithstanding a decline in tropical deforestation rates still contribute
    significantly to global emissions degradation (Le Quéré et al. 2015). In order
    to combat climate change, forests are essential. Since it was first realized that
    forests play a significant role in the world''s carbon cycle, the use of forest-based
    mitigation has been introduced into international policy frameworks (Canadell
    and Raupach 2008). Surprisingly, over 60% of the fires of all fires worldwide
    in are caused by sub-Saharan Africa savannas (Russell-Smith et al. 2021). The
    tropical savannas, which today account for about 90% of the world''s burned land
    and 62% of global fire carbon emissions each year, are the most prone to fires
    (Giglio et al. 2018). The majority of savanna fires are caused by human ignitions,
    and they often occur under particularly harsh fire weather conditions (hot, dry
    conditions) in the latter months of the yearly dry season circumstances (windy,
    low humidity) (Russell-Smith et al. 2021). The general level of fire activity
    in tropical Africa has been very low this year. The fire season in northern tropical
    Africa lasts from November to April. Nearly every day of 2020 has seen less fire
    activity than the region''s average from 2003 to 2019. Southern tropical Africa
    experiences a fire season from May to October. With the exception of a few days
    where activity was higher than the average for the period between 2003 and 2019,
    activity in this area was quite low this year. Since Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring
    Service (CAMS) records have been kept, southern tropical fires have so far produced
    less carbon dioxide in 2020 than in any other year. The low levels of fire activity
    in tropical Africa are a factor in the world''s overall low levels of activity
    and carbon production. Many of these fires occur in the savannah, where they are
    an essential component of ecosystem renewal despite the fact that they can harm
    human habitation, ecosystems, and respiratory health (Table 4). Table 4 The most
    remarkable forest fires in Africa in the recent 4 years Full size table The monthly,
    500 m worldwide gridded product with per-pixel burned-area and quality information
    is known as the Terra and Aqua combined MCD64A1 Version 6 Burned Area data product.
    The MCD64A1 burned-area mapping method makes use of 1 km MODIS active fire data
    along with 500 m MODIS Surface Reflectance imagery. The technique creates applied
    dynamic thresholds to the composite data using a burn-sensitive vegetation index
    (VI). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) shortwave infrared
    surface reflectance bands 5 and 7 plus a temporal texture index are used to construct
    the VI. Each MODIS tile''s 500 m grid cells have a date of burn determined by
    an algorithm. The date is represented as the ordinal day of the year on which
    the burn occurred, with values allocated to unburned land pixels and additional
    special values provided for missing data and water grid cells (Dataset availability:

    Impacts of Climate Change on Africa Impact on Water Resources Complex interactions
    between the sea and the land can result in a range of situations in a number of
    places govern the continent''s climate (e.g., from the sweltering tropics to the
    extremely dry Sahara). The water industry is very sensitive to climate change
    and sustained climate fluctuation. The impact of climate change on water concerns
    won''t be consistent across the continent. It will lessen water stress in certain
    areas while aggravating it in others. Through intricate connections, changes in
    runoff and hydrological components are significantly related to climate. Owing
    to a lack of knowledge, the relationship between climate change and groundwater
    is uncertain. However, there is no disputing that climate change has an impact
    on water flows, including groundwater recharge. As a result, it is a major worry
    for Africa, where groundwater is a major source of rural water supplies (Giannini
    et al. 2008). Net water productivity, as opposed to gross water efficiency, is
    particularly helpful for tracking how efficiently vegetation and, more crucially,
    crops use water to generate biomass and produce. The data is made available through
    the FAO Water Productivity Open-access portal World Association for Public Opinion
    Research (WaPOR) in almost real-time from January 2009 to the present (FAO 2018).
    Net Biomass Water Productivity (NBWP) is calculated as follows: TBP = Ta + NBWP
    where Ta is the annual real transpiration in m3/ha and TBP is the annual total
    biomass output in kg/ha. To aid in these procedures, with the help of particular
    algorithms and high-resolution satellite photos, agricultural water and land productivity
    can be measured regionally and over time via the WaPOR project (FAO 2021). The
    WaPOR database contains a variety of data elements related to biomass production,
    water productivity, evapotranspiration, and precipitation, as illustrated in Tables
    5 and 6. Table 5 A description of the WaPOR data components with the chosen temporal
    and spatial resolutions (Nations 2020) Full size table Table 6 Components of the
    biomass water Productivity statistics overview (FAO 2020) Full size table Water
    productivity in agriculture indicates how much product (biomass or yield) is generated
    per unit of water consumed by the crop. In Africa, it is possible to see the difference
    between areas with low and high-water productivity and monitor their variations
    over time to target interventions (Figs. 6 and 7). Fig. 6 Net Biomass Water Productivity

    by climate change, as it is in many other regions of the world (https://www.uneca.org/acpc).
    Africa receives about 670 mm of precipitation annually on average. However, both
    time and space exhibit significant variety (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 Annual precipitation
    average in Africa for the period 2009–2021 Full size image Actual Evapotranspiration
    Evapotranspiration is the collective term for two processes that transport water
    from the land to the atmosphere: transpiration from plants and evaporation from
    water surfaces and soil. Actual evapotranspiration (AET) and reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) are the two terminologies most frequently used to define evapotranspiration.
    Under atypical environmental and managerial conditions, the AET is calculated.
    Meanwhile, ET0 is calculated under typical circumstances—in a uniform, fully vegetated
    region with a continuous supply of water and shading (Tabari and Talaee 2014).
    In this study, the annual actual evapotranspiration data source is WaPOR. The
    unit is mm/year (Table 7, Figs. 9 and 10) which shows the average actual evapotranspiration
    rates in the African continent. Annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) averaged
    over Africa exhibited increasing trends across the continent. Table 7 Overview
    of annual actual evapotranspiration data components (Nations 2020) Full size table

    in rainfall and increased temperature leading to increased evaporation would directly
    reduce runoff levels and recharge groundwater. Soil moisture stress for forest
    plants can be assessed from drought conditions by calculating Climate Water Deficit
    (CWD), which is a measure of soil water availability, it is obtained from potential
    evaporation minus actual evaporation (PET-AET), an indicator of prolonged drought.
    With increased CWD, the moisture available to forest plants and drying corresponding
    to the forest fuel state decrease (Lutz et al. 2010). A surplus of water can be
    estimated which means that the value of precipitation is greater than the potential
    evaporation during a given period, while the water deficit means that the potential
    evaporation is greater than the precipitation. The results of water surplus and
    water deficit in the study area are shown in Table 9. The ratio of (WS) and (WD)
    is calculated by: $${\\text{WS}}\\% \\, = {\\text{ WS}}/{\\text{P}}*{1}00 {\\text{WD}}\\%
    \\, = { 1}00 - {\\text{WS}}\\%$$ (1) Table 9 Calculation of Annual CWD and WS

    demand that exceeds the available water and shows the seasonal climate deficit,
    it indicates the demand for irrigation required to make up for the seasonal deficit
    (Fig. 13). Fig. 13 The annual CWD water deficit in the African continent for the
    period 2009–2021 Full size image Food Security and Agriculture Drought Monitoring
    Climate change-induced effects, such as increased rainfall magnitude, severity
    and frequency of droughts, and floods would affect agriculture, livestock, and
    fisheries production, thus worsening the food insecurity situation in Africa (Africa
    2013; Shaltout and Bedair 2023) (https://www.uneca.org/african-climate-policy-governance-and-climate-policy-in-africa).
    Reduction in agriculture productivity because of climate change-induced events
    does not only retard economic growth but worsens poverty levels, and further creates
    new poverty traps which all conspire to affects livelihoods, as agriculture is
    the primary source of income for the majority of people in Africa (Change 2014).
    It has been reported that, the number of malnourished people in sub-Saharan Africa
    has increased by 45.6% since 2012 because of climate change. Similarly, climate
    change will cause cereal crop yield to reduce between 8 to 13% across the continent.
    The pattern of distribution of the drought-affected agricultural land is determined
    by the VHI drought index (Vegetation Health Index) (Belal et al. 2014). The VHI
    index generates values between 0 and 40 that are divided into 5 categories according
    to the severity of the drought: not a drought, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme
    drought (Table 10). Figure 14 shows the evolution of drought, like areas where
    agricultural drought transformed from severe to moderate, and in others, the opposite
    is happening (Dalezios 2017). Table 10 Drought Zonation based on VHI values Full

    Biodiversity Loss and Ecosystem Collapse In Africa, evidence points to several
    historical periods which the climate and vegetation of Sahara has fluctuated back
    and forth into a desert –the last being 6000 years ago (Schuster et al. 2006)
    and that Sahara desert has been expanding at a rate of more than 11,000 Km2/year
    between 1950 and 2022. The IUCN Red List listed 3,148 plants and 6,419 animals
    in Africa as being endangered in 2014. In Africa, 21% of freshwater species are
    classified as threatened and 58 percent of freshwater plant species, as well as
    45 percent of freshwater fish, are overfished (http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/summarystats/2014_2_Summary_StatsPage_Documents/2014_2_RL_Stats_Table8.pdf).
    Additionally, the African bird Red List index of the IUCN shows a reduction over
    the past 25 years, indicating an increase in the extinction risk for African birds
    (Sintayehu 2018). The overall number of vertebrate species of Africa for which
    statistics are available is thought to have dropped by roughly 39% since 1970
    (McLellan et al. 2014). Compared to eastern or southern Africa, declines occur
    more quickly in Central and Western Africa (Craigie et al. 2010). Over the past
    twenty years, marshes, damp and occasionally dry woodlands, and mangroves have
    all experienced considerable decreases, with annual losses normally averaging
    around 1%. Numerous ecoregions in Africa were identified as \"Endangered\" or
    “Critically Endangered” in 2004 (Burgess et al. 2004). Regional Policies and African
    Action to Confront Climate Problems Africa is vulnerable because of the following
    reasons: 1: Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 95% of the world’s rain-fed agriculture,
    2: Agriculture accounts for a sizeable amount of Gross domestic product (GDP)
    and employment. 3- Four of the top 10 most affected countries in 2015 were from
    Africa: Mozambique (1st), Malawi (3rd), Ghana and Madagascar (joint 8th position),
    and 4- According to studies commissioned by United Nations Environment Programme
    (UNEP), the cost of adaptation to climate change in Africa could approach $50
    billion year if the increase in global temperature is limited to 2 °C above preindustrial
    levels by 2050 (Environment 2012) (https://www.afdb.org/en/cop25/climate-change-africa).
    In an effort to combat climate change and environmental degradation, the collaboration
    aspires to foster a continental, pan-African strategy and reaction. In particular,
    several African countries have created climate policy frameworks like National
    Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action
    (NAMA) in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
    UNFCCC''s guidelines (https://www.uneca.org/african-climate-policy-centre/climate-governance-and-climate-policy-in-africa).
    In fact, the climate change work done in the region by the UNEP Africa office
    focuses on assisting countries in setting up a system for carrying out their responsibilities
    to combating climate change, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions
    (NDCs), in a way that satisfies the region''s top socioeconomic priorities, including
    food security, the creation of income and entrepreneurial opportunities for economic
    growth, and youth (https://www.uneca.org/african-climate-policy-centre/climate-governance-and-climate-policy-in-africa).
    In addition, one of the most significant initiatives is EU-UNEP Africa Low Emissions
    Development Project: UNEP worked with seven nations to unbiasedly demonstrate
    how NDC implementation through combining mitigation and adaptation activities
    may result in socioeconomic benefits as well as benefits for the environment and
    climate. (https://www.uneca.org/african-climate-policy-centre/climate-governance-and-climate-policy-in-africa).
    Across the continent of Africa, several adaptation strategies have been implemented.
    For instance, it has been documented that farming inputs, high yielding cultivars,
    water harvesting, soil conservation, and agriculture are among some of the highest
    adaptation strategies in the Sahelian region of Africa (Epule et al. 2021). Similarly,
    Mushore and his colleagues found in their study(Mushore et al. 2021) that farmers
    in the Eastern and Southern African countries like Zimbabwe rely on cash crop
    production, petty trading, barter trade, selling of livestock, and migration to
    other countries to work as adaptation strategies to supplement household food
    requirements. In fact, an advanced method has now been used in restoration of
    several sites in Kenya, such as Ngong road forest, Karura forest, Mau forest (Sururu),
    and the University of Nairobi, Chiromo campus (HayaSHi et al. 2017). Moreover,
    the great green wall is Africa’s most ambitious restoration project which kick-started
    in 2007 and aims to restore 780 million hectares of degraded land in an 8000 km
    long swath stretching from Senegal to Djibouti. Restoration of the African Forest
    Landscape Initiative (AFR100) is also another example of large scale restoration
    project in which 30 African countries in 2015 committed to restore over 100 million
    hectares by 2030. There are also other programs, such as Action Agenda for Pan-African
    Ecosystem Restoration, where nations committed to restoring nearly 200 million
    ha by 2030. There is a must to work more toward climate change mitigation through
    more tree planting programs. To contribute toward Malawi’s climate resilience
    and preparedness capabilities, the project Scaling up the Use of Modernized Climate
    Information and Early Warning systems (M-CLIMES) was launched. The project''s
    goals include expanding Malawi''s meteorological network, installing automated
    weather stations, hydrological monitoring stations, and lake-based weather buoys,
    and improving local officials'' ability to detect risks and anticipate impacts.
    The program would help to optimize the warning period for impending climate-related
    disasters, giving local communities enough time to prepare. Accurate climatic
    data gathered through the program will be disseminated through mobile phones,
    ICT, and radio channels, with a focus on vulnerable farming villages and fishing
    communities near Lake Malawi. In general, the project has so far ensured people
    know what to do with this enhanced weather information (Reed et al. 2022). Argania
    spinosa, also known as the argan tree, is an endemic plant of Morocco. The argan
    forest located in southwestern Morocco serves as a barrier against climate-induced
    desertification and assists indigenous people who rely on these forests for a
    living to adapt and retain their cultural heritage (Bedair et al. 2022a). ‘The
    argan orchards initiative’ attempts to prevent argan forest overharvesting, reducing
    the man-made pressure on the trees, and allowing for natural regeneration. The
    overall goal of the program is to plant 10,000 hectares of argan tree orchards,
    intercropped with medicinal and aromatic plants. Local people are being trained
    on how to properly cultivate argan trees in orchards on private property as part
    of the initiative (Shaltout and Bedair 2022). Further, some research on climate
    crisis solutions by Artificial Neural Networks has been implemented in other countries
    and can be applied to the African continent. A novel residual neural network (RESNET)-based
    economy and CO2 emissions prediction model to analyze and improve the global energy
    structures of various countries has provided guidance and development plans for
    countries or regions with low energy efficiency, which can improve energy efficiency,
    economic development and reasonably control CO2 emissions (Han et al. 2023a).
    Another research by (Han et al. 2023b) has applied a novel production prediction
    and energy structure optimization model based on the long short-term memory neural
    network (LSTM) combining the Monte Carlo (MC) (MC-LSTM) to predict the production
    and optimize the energy structure of ethylene plants in the process industry.
    Moreover, radial basis function (RBF) neural network integrating multi-dimensional
    scaling (MDS) (MDS-RBF) has been developed by (Wu et al. 2022) to assess production
    capacity and carbon reduction modeling technology of industrial processes. The
    Importance of 2022 for Climate Action As the world intensifies its fight against
    climate change and advances past the 2021 Glasgow Climate Change Conference, there
    are 10 big global events in 2022 that have impacted crucial discussions and influenced
    public policy decisions about one of the most important concerns of our day (https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/why-2022-will-matter-climate-action-0).
    In November 2022, Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt has hosted the yearly UN Climate Change
    Conference. The main goals were to achieve the international climate negotiations,
    spur action, and offer a crucial chance to examine how climate change is impacting
    Africa. Furthermore, to address the demands of poor nations, especially Africa,
    LDCs, and SIDS, there is a need for more transparency of financing flows and improved
    access. African action in UN Climate Change Conference (COP27), 2022 In developing
    the detailed schedule, the COP27 presidency has taken into account the interconnectedness
    of the themes with regard to adaptation, mitigation, and finance, especially in
    the most vulnerable countries (https://cop27.eg/#/). Initiatives are started by
    COP27 to let African nations invest in enhancing resilience to climate change.
    “Reducing the Cost of Green and Sustainable Borrowing” is an initiative launched
    by Addis Ababa and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Through
    a number of channels, this initiative will assist in establishing more substantial,
    dependable, and sustainable financing to hasten its post-COVID green recovery.
    Additionally, more green finance will be raised, private capital will be attracted,
    and African states'' ability to borrow at reasonable rates would be strengthened.
    Among its programs are the Harmonization of ESG Standards, the Liquidity and Sustainability
    Facility (LSF), and the Proposal of a Sustainability Sovereign Debt Hub (SSDH),
    among others (https://www.uneca.org/Afri-Res). Africa-based networked centre of
    technical competence and excellence (AFRI-RES) is another African initiative that
    aims to increase the ability of African institutions, such as regional economic
    communities, national governments, river basin organizations, and energy networks,
    as well as the business world (project developers and financiers), to organize,
    develop, and implement infrastructure projects that are resistant to climate change
    and fluctuation in particular industries (https://www.ena.et/en/?p=40006). Further,
    Ghana is setting the bar for African carbon market initiatives (ACMI) in both
    forests and non-forests. It''s a brand new program that offers carbon credits
    for sale in African nations. The millions of dollars in climate finance required
    to fund climate change mitigation initiatives across Africa can be made available
    by carbon markets. In fact, Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative
    (AJAETI) is another initiative that offers a chance to create a new framework
    for collaboration in order to fulfill the pledge to achieve universal energy access
    by 2030 and implement the 2063 Agenda (https://unfccc.int/news). A global group
    called ‘Efficiency for Access’ works to promote high-performing appliances that
    help the world''s poorest people including African continent have access to clean
    energy. Spectacularly, seven climate change initiatives targeting toward Africa
    have been unveiled by Egypt in COP27. The first initiative aims to achieve an
    equitable energy transition for Africa. Decent Life for Africa is the second initiative
    that aims at establishing a connection between adaptation, resilience, mitigation,
    and access to creative solutions and small-scale technologies to enhance the standard
    of living in rural communities in Africa by providing them with access to essential
    services and employment opportunities (Bedair et al. 2023b). The third one is
    a presidential plan that includes several national infrastructure projects that
    are centered on the countryside. Women and Adaptation Initiative: Increasing African
    women''s capacity for a more resilient environment and expanding chances for green
    employment. In addition, the Egyptian initiative to create an early warning system
    and safeguard water from the effects of climate change also includes the water-focused
    aware program. Whereas, the sixth program emphasizes biodiversity to save the
    ecosystems and marine life from the effects of climate change. Natural solutions
    are the foundation of the program. Africa Waste 50, the seventh initiative, seeks
    to reach a 50 percent recycling rate for the continent by the year 2050. A fascinating
    initiative termed ‘Bardawil & Sinai Initiative’ is a cooperation through the public–private
    partnership (PPP) system, between Suez Canal Authority and The Weather Makers
    was signed to start restoration of the Bardawil lake water cycle. This project
    also has a crucial role in restoring Sinai''s agricultural land and vegetation
    cover. In fact, progress in mitigating climate change is hampered by policies
    that limit access to the commodities required to reach net zero, produce disparities
    in the cost of capital, and limit developing countries'' access to concessional
    financing. Hence, the COP 27 Africa Pavilion served as the venue for the event,
    which had the topic “Empowering a Climate-Resilient Africa for the 21st Century:
    Articulating Vision and Opportunity”. Industry leaders from the Volvo Group, IBM,
    the International Cooper Association (ICA), and Google were also there. As part
    of its promise to reduce grid losses in Africa, ICA stated that it will start
    the Grid Efficiency and Resiliency Partnership Initiative, and Google has committed
    to investing USD 1 billion to promote Africa''s digital transformation (https://unfccc.int/news).
    Moreover, Global Environment Facility (GEF) in partnership with Green Climate
    Fund (GCG) have provided 4 billion USD portfolio in Africa for accelerating initiatives
    that inspire more climate action that strengthens communities and ecosystems in
    the public and private sectors. Among them, up to 250 million USD are provided
    to fund climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives in the East African region.
    In addition, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) has provided KCB Bank
    Kenya with a 150 million USD loan to fund climate-smart initiatives. Doubtlessly,
    these initiatives will support climate change mitigation and adaptation over Africa,
    of course, if they will take the right path and end up in the hands of the real
    actors, such as regenerative farmers. In addition, launch of the Africa Just &
    Affordable Energy Transition Initiative is a great step that presents multiple
    clean pathways for a long-lasting just and affordable energy transition across
    Africa. Finally, history was made at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh as parties agreed
    to the establishment of a long-awaited loss and damage fund for assisting developing
    countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.
    The Loss and Damage Fund is important to Africa as it will help address the gaps
    that the Readiness Programme (RP) of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) could not fill
    (Fig. 15). On African soil, the voice of the acutely affected communities was
    finally heard (https://unfccc.int/news). Fig. 15 The Readiness program across
    Africa (data source: GCF Open Data Library 2022). The Readiness Programme (RP)
    is part of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) aim to support country-led initiatives
    by developing countries to build institutional capacities, governance procedures,
    and planning in pursuit of a transformative long-term climate action agenda. Since
    the inception of GCF in 2010, a total of 142 million dollars have been disbursed
    as part of RP across Africa with 3.5% going to the Kingdom of Eswatini, and 0.2%
    to Eritrea Full size image Recommendations and Future Priorities In fact, it is
    time to stand together to mitigate the impact of global warming on Africa. Since
    all of the nations of Africa are equally vulnerable to climate change, greater
    regional collaboration will be beneficial by fostering the exchange of effective
    strategies for reducing the effects of climate change. The creation of vulnerability
    indicators that capture the sub-national level and enable local comparisons of
    intra- and inter-country vulnerability is a promising field of research for academics.
    All stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental, the commercial sector,
    and civil society should collaborate to lessen the negative effects of climate
    change. Financial institutions must mainstream resilience into investments they
    are making. In addition, financial innovation for adaptation must match country-level
    policy and market conditions. Additionally, Better cooperation among African countries
    is necessary in the battle against the effects of climatic change. Countries with
    stronger economic capabilities may help countries with weaker capabilities by
    exchanging knowledge and technology. All levels of government should give due
    consideration to migration and displacement related to climate change, and nations
    should implement migration-related climate change policies. Nevertheless, it is
    important to reduce economic and livelihood dependence on rain-fed agriculture,
    strengthen sustainable land use practices, and increase the adaptive capacity
    using advanced methods such as climate-smart agriculture. It is crucial to introduce
    drought- and heat-resistant crop varieties, familiarize small farmers and pastoral
    communities with irrigation and water management systems, and give small farmers
    and pastoral communities’ access to financial protection options. Information
    and Communication Technology (ICT) is essential for supporting small farmers and
    pastoral communities by offering useful research, information sharing forecasts,
    and capacity building. Supporting services for deforestation, soil preservation,
    and medicinal supply are just a few examples. In fact, there is still a must to
    gather more historical and current climate data in many African regions. There
    are very few weather stations spread out across the continent. Critical gaps in
    the availability of historical climate data have been created as a result, especially
    over rural regions where coverage tends to be worse. Consequently, it’s urgent
    to provide more weather stations in these regions. Additionally, we must quickly
    scale up and reproduce any other climate-friendly ideas in order to deploy them
    in poor nations. It is crucial to establish research and development centers to
    examine regional and subregional climate change patterns, as well as to share
    study findings. Further, integrating Artificial Intelligence tools to improve
    energy efficiency, economic development and reasonably control CO2 emissions in
    African nations is highly recommended. While the recently concluded COP27 provided
    an opportunity to voice out issues related to climate adaptation and mitigation
    in the continent, it also helps to assess the achievements made toward supporting
    the local population in adapting to the devastation of climate change. To ensure
    the effective utilization of funds, African leaders must set up a transparency,
    accountability, and monitoring framework to promote the trackable impact of the
    grants received and safeguard the misuse of the funding facilities by countries
    that have weak financial management systems. Overall, the core cause of climate
    change must be addressed, which includes cutting emissions. Unless emissions are
    dramatically cut, more nations will be confronted with the devastating impacts
    of climate change. Conclusions Africa has contributed very little to the planet''s
    changing climate—between two and three percent of global emissions—yet it stands
    out as the continent with the greatest vulnerability. It has been evident that
    Africa is already suffering from the effects of climate change since the early
    1970s, and these effects have given rise to a variety of novel and unusual phenomena,
    including rising temperatures, poor agricultural output, extreme weather events,
    the spread of disease, and other things. The rates of sea-level rise along the
    tropical and South Atlantic coasts as well as the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean
    coasts are faster than the world mean rate. Moreover, according to the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change, less precipitation is predicted to occur over North Africa
    and the south-western regions of South Africa by the end of the century. Regarding
    temperature, since 1901, over 1 °C of warming has already occurred across parts
    of Africa, resulting in increased heat waves and scorching days. Deforestation
    and forest degradation are still issues throughout Africa. In fact, the year 2022
    has witnessed huge wildfires in northern Africa which burnt large forest areas.
    Consequently, global warming has impacted water resources which in turn threatened
    food security in Africa. Africa''s biodiversity is still under decline due to
    continued extinctions of species and habitats. Sahara desert has been expanding
    at a rate of more than 11,000 Km2/year between 1950 and 2022. Notably, it has
    been estimated the loss of human lives due to climate change will go up 500 times
    in Africa than in Europe. Data availability Data will be made available on request.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: B G NAGARA, India SECTION I. Introduction
    The need for food production has never been more urgent as the world population
    rises steadily. Modern agriculture is pursuing this goal at the intersection of
    innovation and sustainability, where the challenge is to feed the globe responsibly,
    effectively, and sustainably. The control loop must be briefly delayed to allow
    the unmanned flying machine to examine the WSN data and choose its next course.
    It might also reduce the amount of insecticides wasted [1]. Precision pesticide
    application is essential to this project because it protects agricultural production
    from the constant threat of pests and illnesses. Crops were sprayed using a commercial
    UAV, and the work rate and spray deposition for various spraying procedures and
    application rates were measured [2]. The Pixhawk flight controller has gained
    notoriety as a key component in the creation of IoT-powered multi-rotor drones
    for pesticide spraying in an era where autonomous aerial systems have grown to
    be synonymous with farming innovation. In order to reinvent how the approach could
    be of pesticide application in farming, this article sets out on a transformative
    journey that combines the capabilities of the Pixhawk flight controller with IoT
    technologies. Precision agriculture’s potential is increased by the Internet of
    Things (IoT) technology’s combination with the Pixhawk flying controller. How
    well UAVs can be utilised for activities like crop monitoring, crop height estimate,
    pesticide application, soil and field analysis, and crop height estimation is
    examined in the technical evaluation of UAVs in agriculture with precision [3].
    During pesticide spraying operations, this union makes real-time data collecting,
    remote monitoring, and adaptive decision-making possible. It equips farmers and
    agricultural experts with the resources they need to optimise pesticide use, lessen
    their negative environmental impact, and increase crop yields. The Pixhawk flight
    controller is shown in this study as a transformational force in the pursuit of
    efficient and sustainable pesticide application. It enables the agricultural community
    to address issues related to food security while reducing the environmental impact
    of farming through IoT connectivity. The voyage that follows investigates the
    complexities of this technical union and demonstrates its potential to bring in
    a new era of precise pesticide application and environmentally friendly farming
    methods. Still, more technological advancements are needed, especially in the
    field of sensing and mapping systems that can give spatially connected data on
    crop, soil, and environmental aspects [4]. Particle image velocimetry was used
    to measure the downwash flow field droplet mobility and deposition throughout
    the crop at various rotor spinning. speeds using a double pulsed laser [5]. Based
    on GPS coordinates in a lower altitude setting, an \"aerial automated pesticide
    sprayer\" (AAPS) with a blimp incorporated quad copter was created [6]. SECTION
    II. RELATED WORK Biophysical property analysis, biochemical property analysis
    (e.g., anthocyanins, chlorophyll, carotenoids,), and so on, ground-based or space-based
    platforms are used for hyper spectral imaging in agriculture [7]. Hand sowing
    is the most common form of sowing in India. The seed sowing machinery is made
    up of a fluted roll with blade or ratchet teeth fixed on a turning shaft, an aperture,
    and a link [8]. A quad copter achieves yaw, lift, pitch, and roll simply by adjusting
    the thrusts of four motors in relation to one another. The revolutionary quad
    copter design allows any two quad copter arms to be folded either side, disconnecting
    its propeller and camera attachment [9]. Deep learning-based object detection
    approaches are beginning to play a key role in developing remote sensing commercial
    and scientific applications [10]. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) transports
    the multispectral camera in order to collect photos of the examined area. In terms
    of software, the produced applications are primarily based on open-source solutions:
    a web-based user interface aimed at acquisition control and one specific program
    developed for the computation of vegetation indices. Different programs are used
    to process data [11]. SECTION III. METHODS AND MATERIALS A. Multi-rotor Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicle Multi-rotor UAVs are one type of UAV and are divided on the number
    of rotors in their platform. A quad copter is a special type of UAV with a model
    that has four rotors. Fig 1. Quad Copter configuration Show All These rotors generate
    the necessary lift for a quad copter to fly [12]. TABLE I. DIFFERENT TYPES OF
    UAV’S FOR PRECISION AGRICULTURE B. Pixhawk 2.4.8 and receiver trouble shooting
    Popular flight controller Pixhawk 2.4.8 is used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
    like octocopters and drones. Here are some troubleshooting steps if the receiver
    and Pixhawk are not communicating properly. 1. Check the wiring Double check that
    the receiver’s and the Pixhawk’s wiring connections are solid and connected properly.
    The communication may be disrupted by bad connections or frayed wires. 2. Verify
    the receiver is receiving electricity from the flight controller or another power
    source. A solid LED light on the receiver should show that it is turned on. 3.
    Verify the receiver channels: Make sure the Pixhawk’s receiver channels are set
    up properly. For confirmation that the channel mapping is accurate, check the
    radio calibration settings in the Pixhawk mission planner. 4. Examine the receiver’s
    output. To make sure the receiver is sending the Pixhawk the right signals, use
    a servo tester or another receiver. The receiver could be broken if there is no
    output or if the signals are erroneous. 5. Verify the Pixhawk configurations make
    sure the Pixhawk is set up to detect the kind of receiver being used. Check to
    make sure the channel mapping, frequency, and input signal type are accurate.
    One type of UAV is the multi-rotor UAV, which is distinguished by the number of
    rotors in its platform. A quad copter is a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
    having four rotors. These rotors produce the lift that a quadcopter needs to fly
    [13]. C. Designing Spraying System Two mechanics found in the drone model are
    the Seed sowing mechanism and the Slider crank mechanism. Automatic seed sowing
    is performed by the seed sowing system [14]. A slider-crank system can be used
    to spray water and insecticides. 1. Drone Construction. 2. The Drone, Mission
    Planner software, and Pixhawk module are all linked together. 3. Mechanism for
    planting seeds. 4. Calculating the Payload 5.Testing and Configuration. Fig 2.
    Block diagram of Spraying System Show All With the help of ArduPilot Mega (APM)
    Firmware, the Pixhawk module converts the quadcopter into a fully functional personal
    drone. The steps below are used to connect the Pixhawk module and mission planner
    software: Setting GPS waypoints involves: a. Mounting; b. Connecting; c. Loading
    firmware; d. Calibrating. The Pixhawk module is positioned as near to the centre
    of gravity as possible. The arrow on the module is pointing forward. The Pixhawk
    module ports are linked to the Pixhawk component parts. APM firmware must be loaded
    before operating the Pixhawk. Install a mission planner programme on the ground
    station computer to upgrade the Pixhawk''s firmware. Fig 3. Octocopter Testing
    Show All D. Mission Planar The mission planner application in the ArduPilot open
    source autopilot project is a fully complete ground station application. The history
    of Mission Planner and the structure of this website are both covered on this
    page. Mission Scheduler is the name of a control tower on the ground for rovers,
    helicopters, and aircraft. It is only compatible with Windows. Mission Planner
    can be implemented as a configuration tool or as an extra dynamic control strategy
    for autonomous vehicles. Fig 4. Configuring the Mission Planar Show All E. Loading
    Firmware Using the autopilot hardware that already has ArduPilot firmware loaded,
    follow these instructions to get the newest firmware. The Mission Planner ground
    control station will be used during this procedure. F. Custom Firmware Build Server
    Currently being developed experimentally by ArduPilot is a special firmware development
    server that will allow users to produce a firmware updates for their autopilots
    with configurable features. Because all 1MB flash-sized boards presently have
    feature restrictions to allow the code to fit, this will allow a user to choose
    which features will or won’t be implemented, providing 1MB autopilot users some
    flexibility. On the Install Firmware tab of Mission Planner, there is a \"Load
    Custom Firmware\" option that permits creating a customized firmware that can
    be downloaded and flashed onto the autopilot. Fig 5. Connecting to Multiple Vehicles
    Show All G. Mission commands The Mission Planner includes column headings for
    the parameters that require user-supplied values and offers a filtered list of
    the commands suited for the current vehicle type. These comprise navigation commands
    to move to waypoints and linger nearby, DO commands to carry out particular tasks
    (like shooting pictures), and condition commands to regulate when DO commands
    can be executed. H. End of Mission Following the completion of all mission items,
    the Rover will hold, the Plane will RTL, and the Copter will loiter at the last
    waypoint indefinitely until a mode change or disarm (such as when landing). This
    is true even if the final mission item is an unlimited loiter, turn, or landing.
    Fig 6. Copter Mission Planning Show All I. Calculation of Payload A critical step
    in assuring safe and effective drone operations is figuring out a drone’s maximum
    payload weight. To determine the kinds of payloads that may be safely carried
    and the maximum distance that can be flown, it is crucial to know the maximum
    payload weight of a drone. In order to determine a drone’s maximum payload weight,
    the following procedures should be 1. Calculate the drone’s overall weight, including
    the batteries, motors, and other parts. 2. Subtract the drone’s overall weight
    from its maximum takeoff weight. 3. Subtract the number of payloads that will
    be transported from the remaining weight. 4. From the total weight, subtract the
    weight of each cargo. 5. The total weight the drone can carry is represented by
    the remaining weight. Fig 7. Seed sowing mechanism Show All The maximum weight
    that a vehicle, including its occupants, cargo, and fuel, may not exceed is known
    as the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). This data is frequently contained in
    the owner’s manual or on the certification sticker for the car, which is typically
    positioned on the door casing. The available cargo capacity can be calculated
    by deducting the curb weight from the GVWR. Payload Capacity = GVWR−Curb Weight
    View Source TABLE II. DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF INCREASING PAYLOAD CAPACITY J. Increase
    and Decrease payload capacity A vehicle’s handling, braking, and overall stability
    can all be affected by carrying more weight than it can safely handle. The safety
    of both the occupants and other road users can be jeopardized by overloading a
    vehicle, which can increase the danger of collisions, loss of control, and technical
    breakdowns [15]. Overloading a vehicle can lead to poor performance, including
    sluggish acceleration, shortened stopping distances, and decreased fuel efficiency.
    This could make driving less enjoyable and put more strain on the vehicle’s components
    [16]. SECTION IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Depending on the input supplied, the
    octocopter moved left, right, forward, and backward. The controls were all operational.
    The signal could be detected by the receiver at a distance of more than 50 meters.
    When the channel connected to the sprayer module was activated, it functioned.
    The octocopter was stable as it flew. The fact that controlling the octocopter
    was so simple to learn and was the most pleasing result. It’s simple to fly it
    over fields and spray insecticides with it. Fig 8. Mission Planar Auto generated
    Grid Show All Small-scale farmers can afford it, and it is simple as well to use.
    In comparison to entering the field directly, it takes less time and effort. One
    of the main benefits of employing an octocopter to spray pesticides is the possibility
    of avoiding health issues brought on by chemical inhalation. When spraying insecticides
    in the field, farmers typically cover their faces and arms with marks and gloves.
    However, the spraying procedure turns the liquid insecticides into minute particles
    that the farmer would eventually breathe in. As we all know, harmful pesticides
    are used to either kill or scare away little insects and other pests. Resulting
    in a variety of illnesses like asthma and breathing difficulties. By applying
    pesticides with an octocopter, these issues can be avoided. Another significant
    benefit of using an octocopter is that it takes much less time to spray insecticides
    throughout a whole field. The farmer may not be able to spray pesticides with
    the octocopter on the first try, but with enough practice, he will be able to
    do it much more quickly than by going around the fields with spraying equipment.
    The farmer would have to put on all of his safety gear before carrying the container
    and spray module across the entire field. When compared to simply using a remote
    control to fly an octocopter into the field and spray pesticides, this would undoubtedly
    take a lot more time. Spraying a vast field involves a significant amount of labour.
    The farmer would incur significant costs as a result of having to pay numerous
    individuals to spray the entire land. However, a farmer can perform the task themselves
    with the aid of a pesticide spraying drone. Thus, the octocopter will not only
    keep the farmer safe but also improve the productivity of his farming techniques
    [17]. By using additional nozzles that may be stacked in an array, a larger area
    can be covered. The pesticide in the container will run out faster if there are
    more nozzles being used. For precise spraying, the spraying angle can be adjusted.
    Different types of spraying are necessary for different crops. Consequently, the
    spraying angle should vary depending on the crop. The spraying angle can be adjusted
    with a servo motor. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank our colleagues who provided
    useful insights during the process. Special thanks to our guide, Dr.D.Devesana,

    data analytics; interoperability; wireless communication protocols 1. Introduction
    Agricultural systems will be under tremendous pressure to increase food production
    in sustainable ways as the world’s population is projected to nearly double to
    10 billion by 2050 [1]. In order to be prepared for the future, agriculture must
    find inventive solutions to problems like unstable climatic patterns and dwindling
    arable lands. Agricultural frameworks in the modern era face a number of difficulties.
    Unpredictable weather patterns brought on by climate change include more frequent
    droughts and floods. Such unpredictabilities place a severe pressure on conventional
    farming techniques, necessitating a change to more robust agricultural practises
    [2]. Further increasing the need for effective and sustainable agricultural methods
    is the growing loss of arable land, which is mostly linked to urbanisation and
    soil deterioration [3]. The potential of technology intervention shines brilliantly
    in the midst of these difficulties. A ray of hope is provided by precision agriculture,
    which is supported by cutting-edge sensor technologies. By continuously tracking
    crop conditions, weather patterns, and soil health, these devices provide actionable
    data that enable well-informed decisions and prompt treatments. In essence, sensor-based
    technology integration in farming landscapes resolves many of the current problems
    and, more importantly, sets the way for a sustainable and productive agricultural
    future [4]. 2. Sensor-Based Technologies: An Insight into Modern Agricultural
    Practices The era of traditional farming is evolving towards a tech-centric agricultural
    paradigm. Sensor-based technologies, leveraging data, promise enhanced production
    and sustainability. Table 1 highlights key sensor technology advancements and
    their agricultural applications to illustrate this shift. Table 1. Advanced sensor
    technologies being used in modern agriculture. By providing real-time information
    on the qualities of the soil and optimising irrigation and fertilisation, soil
    sensors have transformed precision farming [5]. Farmers can adjust to changing
    atmospheric conditions by using weather sensors to optimise planting and harvesting
    seasons [6]. Crop health and yield are improved by the fine-tuning of microclimatic
    conditions by light and humidity sensors [7]. Spectral imaging-based crop health
    monitors notify farmers to problems like infections or nutritional deficiencies
    and allow for pre-emptive interventions [8]. 3. The Convergence of IoT and Wireless
    Communication in Precision Agriculture Through the incorporation of sensor technology
    and cutting-edge wireless communication systems, the Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed agriculture. Transmitting enormous amounts of real-time data over
    great distances, especially in difficult circumstances, becomes crucial as farms
    transform into digital ecosystems. 3.1. Sensor Networks in IoT-Based Agriculture
    Interconnected sensor networks, which collect various agronomic metrics, are agriculture’s
    IoT [9]. Their true value comes from their ability to interface with centralised
    databases and decision-making tools, giving farmers the power to make quick decisions
    based on current data and promoting a precision culture [10,11]. 3.2. Communication
    Technologies: Bridging the Gap Numerous communication protocols, ranging from
    well-established ones like ZigBee to more recent ones like 5G (fifth generation)
    and NB-IoT (NarrowBand Internet of Things) are available in the tech world for
    smart farming. ZigBee provides balanced power and range, making it perfect for
    isolated farms [12], while NB-IoT provides extensive coverage with low energy
    requirements for large-scale agricultural endeavours [13]. With its speed, low
    latency, and dependability, 5G is poised to redefine data transfer [14]. 4. The
    Interplay of Sensor Technologies and Data Management Modern precision agriculture
    is built on a foundation of seamless sensor technology and data management, creating
    a synergy that offers increased agricultural productivity and better resource
    management. 4.1. Need for Interoperability among Diverse Technologies Different
    sensor systems used in smart agriculture have unique data formats and protocols
    [15]. Interoperability becomes more important as systems become more complex.
    Enhanced interoperability optimises yield and resource consumption by consolidating
    and coherently analysing data. 4.2. Data Analytics, Management Techniques, and
    Challenges Artificial intelligence and smart algorithms help with the rigorous
    management and analysis of the massive amounts of data from sensors [16]. Making
    the transition from raw data to usable insights presents difficulties, such as
    managing storage and protecting data privacy. To solve this, you need to have
    a solid grasp of agriculture and be an expert data manager. 4.3. Techniques for
    Sensor Data Analytics and Management To analyse huge amounts of sensor-generated
    data, advanced analytics, from classical statistical techniques to contemporary
    machine learning, are required. An overview of these analytics and management
    methods for agricultural sensor data is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Comprehensive
    overview of sensor data analytics and management techniques in precision agriculture.
    5. Future Perspectives and Current Challenges in Sensor-Based Agriculture The
    nexus of sensor development, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence is
    the next frontier in agricultural technology. These cutting-edge fields, while
    they hold the potential for paradigm-shifting effects, are also rife with complex
    problems that each call for in-depth investigation. 5.1. Potential of 5G Technology
    and AI Predictive Modelling 5G’s ultra-reliable low latency promises more than
    fast data transfer, facilitating real-time analysis in distant agricultural fields
    [22]. AI (artificial intelligence) predictive modelling, enhanced by real-time
    data, offers precise forecasts, from weather to pest detection [23]. 5.2. Challenges:
    Cost, Data Privacy, System Compatibility, Energy Management Economic difficulties
    arise with the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, particularly for agrarians
    who are resource-constrained [24]. Increased encryption and security measures
    are required due to the increase in data [25]. In order to combine several digital
    platforms in agriculture, seamless system compatibility is essential [26]. Energy
    conservation, notably the use of renewable energy for sensors, must be prioritised
    [27]. For a thorough summary of the obstacles and future directions for sensor-based
    agriculture, see Table 3. Table 3. An analytical synopsis of prospective avenues
    and challenges in sensor-based agriculture. 6. Conclusions With the combination
    of cutting-edge sensor technology and data-driven innovations, agriculture’s historical
    evolution is ready for yet another important revolution. This discussion went
    deep into the technical details of these technologies and highlighted how they
    might affect present and future agricultural endeavours. The analysis of our research
    yields the following key conclusions: Primacy of Sensor Integration: Sensor technologies
    that track factors like soil quality, weather erraticness, light, humidity, and
    crop health are largely responsible for the advancements in precision agriculture.
    They have fuelled data-centric farming methods by offering granular insights,
    assuring the best use of resources and raising yields. Sensor Technologies and
    Data Management Confluence: Different sensor technologies add different data formats
    and communication protocols to the agricultural tapestry as they are woven in.
    Thus, interoperability is essential for achieving a seamless connection. A sophisticated
    analytics and management solution is also required to transform the massive amount
    of collected data into a useful agricultural strategy. Prospective Technological
    Boons: The impending use of 5G technology and the skill of AI predictive modelling
    are positive signs for the future of agriculture. These tools could revolutionise
    agricultural decision making since they promise accurate forecasting and real-time
    data transfer. Inherent Challenges: Even with advances in technology, significant
    problems still exist. These cover issues including the price tag associated with
    adopting new technology, protecting data privacy in an era of information overload,
    establishing system interoperability among various tech solutions, and dealing
    with energy management for remote sensor operations. Implications for Upcoming
    Research: Focused Investigation: Future studies may benefit from focusing on particular
    sensor types as technology continues to progress. This would enable a deeper investigation
    of the problems and applications that are unique to them. Holistic System Design:
    The creation of complete systems that integrate various sensor technologies should
    be prioritised in order to streamline data collection, processing, and the extraction
    of insightful information. Broader Dimensions: Prospective studies ought to extend
    beyond the strictly technical to include ethical considerations of data privacy
    and the larger socio-economic effects of technology adoption in agriculture. Fundamentally,
    even while the fusion of sensor-based technology with agriculture ushers in a
    new era of productivity and sustainability, the road ahead is not without obstacles.
    However, the advantages they offer vastly outweigh these challenges, prompting
    a concerted effort by academics, technologists, and agricultural stakeholders
    to fully realise this enormous potential. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Sandalwood, obtained from trees of the genus Santalum, is highly valued
    for its medicinal properties. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the health of
    these trees. This study proposes an IoT-based tree monitoring system that can
    effectively guide and enhance the yield of sandalwood trees based on the type
    of soil. To collect data on the four crucial environmental factors that affect
    sandalwood growth, relative sensors are used to transmit the collected data via
    IoT. In order to detect the yield of crops, machine learning algorithms such as
    deep learning are proposed. This approach involves training a neural network to
    recognize patterns and predict crop yields based on various inputs. To achieve
    this, data are collected on various factors that can impact crop yield, such as
    weather conditions, soil quality, and irrigation. These data are used to train
    a deep learning model, which can then accurately predict crop yields based on
    these inputs. One of the main advantages of using deep learning for crop yield
    prediction is that it can account for complex relationships between different
    factors, such as the interaction between weather conditions and soil quality.
    This makes it a more accurate and reliable approach compared to traditional methods
    of yield prediction. Furthermore, once the deep learning model has been trained,
    it can be easily deployed to monitor crop yields in real-time, providing farmers
    with valuable insights and helping them to make more informed decisions. Overall,
    using deep learning to detect crop yields is a promising approach that can help
    farmers optimize their crop production and ultimately improve their profitability.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION 1. Introduction
    The sandalwood tree is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties,
    making it a sought-after commodity in the Indian market with a cost of approximately
    12000 to 13000 per kilogram. This high commercial advantage over other trees makes
    it crucial for farmers to maintain the health of their sandalwood crops and optimize
    their yields. To help farmers achieve this, a model is proposed that predicts
    crop yields based on soil type using data collected on various factors that affect
    crop growth, such as weather conditions, soil quality, and irrigation. Proposed
    model utilizes deep learning algorithms to accurately predict crop yields by recognizing
    patterns and accounting for complex relationships between different factors. This
    approach is more reliable and accurate compared to traditional methods of yield
    prediction, which may not account for these complex relationships. By using this
    model, farmers can make more informed decisions to optimize their crop production
    and improve their profitability. The data collected on various factors is used
    to train a deep learning model, which can then predict crop yields based on these
    inputs. This real-time monitoring helps farmers maintain the health of their crops
    and optimize their yields. Additionally, the model can account for the interaction
    between weather conditions and soil quality, making it a more comprehensive approach
    to yield prediction. To facilitate data collection and management, a comprehensive
    database is established that records information from the date of plantation until
    the present day. The data is systematically organized and processed for validation
    from time to time, ensuring the accuracy of the model. Overall, the proposed model
    offers a promising solution to optimize sandalwood crop production and improve
    profitability for farmers. The suggested approach can assist farmers make informed
    decisions to maintain crop health and maximize production by accurately predicting
    crop yields based on soil type and other environmental conditions. SECTION II.

    [2] To assure the quality and safety of leafy crops, Yuhong Dong developed a traceability
    strategy. It employed the HACCP system as well as the FTA technique. The primary
    control points in the leaf vegetable production-transport-sale process were identified
    using HACCP analysis. After that, FTA was utilised to conduct qualitative and
    quantitative analysis on related events. This system has a 30% error correction
    rate. In 2019 [3], Hao Wang presented an NB-IoT-based health monitoring system.
    He conducted experiments to test the dependability of the suggested system. This
    model guides arborists and prevents risks in the absence of trees. It classified
    the data into three categories: healthy, sub-healthy, and unhealthy. In this model,
    KNN was used to analyze the obtained dataset. This model attained an accuracy
    of 87.3 percent. In 2018 [4] Jiang et al. created a leafy vegetable tracing system
    using QR codes, RFID, wireless network sensing, and other technologies. This system
    allows for complete traceability of the manufacturing chain from seed to sale,
    assuring leafy vegetable quality and safety oversight. In 2019 [5], Chung Kit
    Wu suggested a model for assessing the health of IoT trees in metropolitan areas.
    A heterogeneous indexing feature was utilized in this model to investigate the
    implications on tree health. The HNN model was used in this model, which took
    into account the heterogeneous feature structure and examined the co-relationship
    between all features. This model had a 5 percent error rate, which was relatively
    low. In 2017 [6] Phalgun Madhusudan and Jayanth Bhargav propose a research paper
    which explains A special IC which can detect leaves moisture, resin discharge
    from bark and moisture of soil for the forest trees. Thus, different disorders
    will be monitored with the help of special ICs which are placed in specific locations
    of forest. In 2015 [7] Santhosh Hebbar1, Praveenraj Pattar2, Rajeshwari Madli3,
    Varaprasad Golla4 Published a research paper in “Conference on Computing and Network
    Communications (CoCoNet’15), Dec. 16-19,2015, Trivandrum, India” which include
    idea to protect sandalwood trees from unauthorized cutting in owner farm. In their
    paper they use Bluetooth 4.0. The implementation of this model will help farmers
    when there are any robberies in his farm by sending alerts on mobile phones. In
    2018 [8] Prof. P. G. Salunkhe1, Poonam U. Chaudhari2, “Department of Electronics
    and Telecommunication Engineering Sandip Institute Technology and Research Centre,
    Nashik, Maharashtra” published a research paper in ICACCT. They tried to reduce
    theft in forest for different trees using an anti-poaching system based on a microcontroller
    which provides wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology. System will sense robberies
    by monitoring signal which is given by sensor. In 2019 [9] Vijay Kumar1, Raghavendra
    L2, Vineeth M3, Vivek B4, Suhas Gowda5, 1Assistant Professor, “Department of Electronics
    and Communication Engineering BGSIT, Karnataka-India”, published research. In
    their project they are using an electronic kit for each tree which consists of
    several electronic devices and sensors to detect smuggling. In 2019 [10], Alan
    Adel Araby proposed a model which was helpful in monitoring plant’s health. ML
    was used for precision agriculture in which the architecture was based on clouds
    which consisted of several layers. The data set which is used was real data which
    was gathered from CLAC and was called Day Degree. The given model showed a significant
    accuracy of 99.97% using SVM and LR. In 2012 [11] 1 Yunjian Tang1, Peng Han2,
    Zaihuan Wang3, Longcan Hu4, Yue Gao5, Haiyan Li6. The proposed research system
    in this research paper works on a signal to noise ratio system. It is able to
    detect whether chainsaw logging takes place or not by eliminating other noise
    with chainsaw logging noise. The result shows that this system has accuracy around
    70%. In 2019 [12] Anjali Pawar1 Harmeet Khanuja2 This paper presents a visual
    secret sharing scheme for encoding secret QR codes in a shared folder. The secret
    returned by XORing the shares. The proposed system provides high security to the
    message and also provides a more accessible format. The computational cost of
    the preparation process is low. QR codes provide the following functions. It can
    hold all kinds of data and store data in a small space. If the QR code is damaged,
    the QR code can be restored. Visual cryptography is more secure than traditional
    systems. In 2017 [13] In 2017 [13] P.T.V. Bhuvaneswari1 A.M Ezhilazhahi2 Madras
    Institute of Technology explains the health monitoring system of plants to improve
    the quality and quantity of plants. Implementa WSN with the help of IoT. In 2009
    [14] The authors developed an automatic control system for greenhouse based on
    WSN to monitor the environment. Based on the information collected from WSN, the
    indoor environment is controlled and crops are observed. Defined to anticipate
    form and buildup on plants. The collected information is either put away in a
    database or on a server remotely controlled by the client. In 2015 [15],The authors
    studied the sweet potato in controlled and open settings. The concierge is installing
    a small greenhouse, parameters such as the temperature of the greenhouse and the
    temperature of the soil. A greenhouse is created depending on the limit of the
    parameter value. It is controlled by a relay switch that goes to the base of the
    mounted Audino part. SECTION III. Methodology Soil is one of the most important
    factors in any type of agriculture. Choosing the right soil for growing sandalwood
    is important to the success of the crop. The amount and quality of heartwood produced
    can be affected by the availability of certain nutrients in the soil. As a result,
    selecting the proper soil with the right nutritional content may ensure that the
    sandalwood trees thrive and yield optimally. Sandalwood trees require just a little
    amount of water to thrive, and an excess or insufficient supply of water may impede
    their development and productivity. Choosing a good soil with enough water-holding
    capacity and drainage can assist to ensure that the sandalwood trees receive adequate
    water. Sandalwood trees grow on soils that are somewhat acidic, with pH levels
    ranging from 6.0 to 7.5. Higher or lower pH levels in the soil may alter the availability
    of nutrients and water, hence impacting the growth and production of the sandalwood
    trees. They thrive on well-draining soils with enough aeration. Poor drainage
    or thick clay soils can stifle root development and induce waterlogging, resulting
    in low growth and yield. A technique that predicts if a given soil is suited for
    Sandalwood cultivation is presented as a solution. If not, our suggested approach
    would identify the missing nutrients in the specific type of soil, assisting farmers
    in increasing yields by supplying the essential nutrient in the appropriate amount.
    The first step in predicting if the supplied soil is suitable for sandalwood farming
    is to collect data on the soil on which Sandalwood is typically grown and compare
    it to data acquired from local farmers. To compare the two datasets, we must develop
    a model that will efficiently compare them and anticipate the accurate outcomes.
    In this study, we use three distinct ML classification algorithms: Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN), SVM, and Naive Bayes. We evaluate the algorithms’ efficacy
    using performance measures after they independently forecast the results. A. Dataset
    Collection:- Since the machine learning model makes predictions based on what
    it evaluates and discovers from the data we give as input, dataset gathering is
    essential in machine learning projects. The accuracy and effectiveness of machine
    learning algorithms are determined on the quality, consistency, and precision
    of the data used.. B. Data Pre-processing:- Data collecting takes time, but it’s
    harder to organize and turn unstructured data into something useful, successful,
    and effective. In data mining operations, preprocessing data is essential. The
    success rate of the model is directly impacted. The level of complexity of the
    data under examination is lowered when dirty data is present in the real world.
    The term “unclean” refers to data that contains duplicate records, noisy or extreme
    results, or “outliers,” and missing values for features in records..The quality
    of the outcomes will suffer as a result of this. As a result, we must undertake
    data preparation on our dataset. C. Data Selection:- The selection of data is
    an important stage in the creation of a dataset for machine learning, data analysis,
    and other data-driven applications. It entails locating and selecting appropriate
    data to be utilized to train a model or answer a research topic. Choosing relevant
    data ensures that the model is trained on the most relevant and informative data,
    resulting in improved model accuracy and performance. Choosing a varied set of
    data can assist to eliminate dataset bias, resulting in more objective and accurate
    models. Fig.1 Diagram Flow of Collected data. Show All D. Machine Learning Models:-
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN):- Artificial neural networks, or ANNs for brief,
    are a subset of the machine learning algorithms that evolved by modeling the structure
    and behavior of biological neural networks that exist in the human brain. An ANN
    is made up of layers of linked nodes or neurons. The input layer collects data
    and sends it to one or more hidden layers, which use weights and biases to carry
    out intricate computations. The calculations made in the hidden layers are then
    used to create a result in the output layer. An ANN is trained to make precise
    predictions by feeding it labeled data during the training phase. Backpropagation
    is a technique used to iteratively change the weights and biases in the network
    with the goal of minimizing the discrepancy between the expected and actual output.
    Bayes’ theorem:- The method estimates the posterior probability of each class
    given the input attributes using the Bayes theorem, and then outputs the class
    with the highest probability. The posterior probability of a class given the input
    features is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of the class (i.e.,
    the frequency of the class in the training data) by the conditional probability
    of the features given the class. (i.e., the likelihood of the features given the
    class). The Bayes’ theorem is stated as [14]: P(h|d)=(P(d|h)*P(h))/P(d) Where,
    P(d|h) is probability of data d given that the hypothesis h was true P(h|d) is
    the probability of hypothesis h given the data dP(d) is the probability of the
    data. P(h) is the probability of hypothesis h being true Support Vector Machine:-
    This strategy belongs to the category of supervised machine learning. Regression
    as well as classification issues may be resolved with it. However, it is mostly
    employed to address classification issues. The main goal of the SVM method is
    to identify the best fit line or decision boundary. This best-fit boundary or
    line can create different classes in n-dimensional space. This is done so that
    we can quickly assign a new data point to the proper class in the future when
    it is presented. The boundary with the best match is a hyperplane. In order to
    help the hyperplane form, this process chooses two extreme points or vectors called
    as support vectors. This method is known as the Support Vector Machine as a consequence.
    E. Performance Evaluation Metrics:- It’s important to use a limited number of
    performance measures when assessing a model’s performance in order to justify
    the evaluation. The models presented in this study are contrasted using the assessment
    metrics/measures indicated below. These performance metrics may be used to find
    the best models. Four metrics were used to evaluate each classifier’s performance:
    TP [True Positives], TN [True Negatives], FP [False Positives], and FN [False
    Negatives]. Accuracy: This performance indicator displays the proportion of true
    predictions to all cases considered. Accuracy= TP+TN TP+FP+FN+TN View Source Precision:
    This performance indicator displays the proportion of true predictions to all
    cases considered. Precision= TP TP+FP View Source Recall: Recall is an outcome
    statistic or measure that communicates the percentage of accurate positive results
    to all samples that are pertinent to the issue. Recall= TP TP+FN View Source F1-score:A
    performance statistic called the F1-score takes accuracy and recall into account.
    It is calculated using the harmonic mean of both. F1−score=2∗ (Recall∗Precision)
    (Recall+Precision) View Source Fig 2. System Architecture Show All SECTION IV.
    Summary Table SECTION V. Challenges Faced First challenge we faced was the building
    of a dataset for sandalwood trees as people aren’t aware of this issue so no dataset
    was available for the proposed model. The monitoring system needs to be powered
    continuously to ensure uninterrupted monitoring thus the system must be designed
    to use minimal power and have reliable power supply. The system must be calibrated
    and validated to ensure the data collected is accurate and reliable. This necessitates
    careful examination of the system’s sensors and any external elements that can
    have an impact on the data’s accuracy. Developing and implementing a Sandalwood
    health monitoring system can be expensive and the cost may be a significant barrier
    to implementation. Careful consideration of cost-effective solutions and sustainable
    business models must be taken into account. SECTION VI. Conclusion The sandalwood
    yield predicting system and health monitoring using IoT technology is a cutting-edge
    solution that brings together different aspects of modern agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT sensors to collect data on key environmental factors that affect sandalwood
    growth, such as weather conditions, soil quality, and irrigation, farmers can
    better understand the health of their crops and make informed decisions about
    how to optimize their yields. Deep learning algorithms are then used to process
    the data that the sensors have collected. which can recognize patterns and account
    for complex relationships between different factors. This approach is more accurate
    and reliable compared to traditional methods of yield prediction, which may not
    be able to account for these complex relationships. Additionally, the real-time
    monitoring provided by the IoT sensors enables farmers to take immediate action
    to maintain the health of their crops and optimize their yields. This can lead
    to increased profitability and sustainable agriculture practices. Furthermore,
    the comprehensive database that records the date of plantation until the present
    day ensures the accuracy of the model and facilitates data management. This database
    can be easily accessed by farmers, researchers, and industry professionals to
    gain insights and develop new strategies for improving sandalwood crop production.
    Overall, the sandalwood yield predicting system and health monitoring using IoT
    technology offers a promising solution to promote sustainable agriculture practices
    and optimize sandalwood crop production, ultimately benefiting the farmers and
    the industry as a whole. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like

  description: Agriculture plays a significant role in food security and forms the
    backbone of the economic system of a country. The increase in population has led
    to an urgent need to balance demand and supply, threatening sustainability and
    putting pressure on agricultural systems. Furthermore, climate change challenges
    like extreme weather conditions, climatic changes, and environmental impact have
    adversely impacted agriculture and linked resources. Besides this, about 85% of
    Indian farmers are marginal and small landholders. About 60% of the net sown area
    is under rainfed agriculture, and this makes India vulnerable to climate change
    considerably affecting the cropping system, livestock, and soil and increasing
    pests and diseases. Climate change would have a serious impact on Indian agriculture
    in the coming years which would negatively impact some important crops leading
    to food insecurity. The present trend and scenario are evident that without an
    efficient measure, it would be very difficult to meet agro-demand of the country.
    Therefore, there is an urgent need of efficient measures of adaption and mitigation.
    Therefore, smart agriculture using IoT (Internet of Things) technology has opened
    up extremely productive ways for farmers, helps in managing agricultural systems,
    and deals with weather uncertainties and challenges improving resource management.
    It enables farmers to collect real-time data related to weather updates, irrigation,
    production, yield quality, and soil moisture and predict pest, diseases, and market
    information and strengthen good agricultural practices in farms. Additionally,
    IoT solutions along with smart practices in agriculture offer opportunities for
    innovation in climate adaptation reducing the ecological footprints and enhancing
    the livelihoods of farmers. Thus, the present paper aims to review the current
    and future trends of IoT in the Indian agriculture system, highlighting potential
    challenges and also its role in combating climate change. Additionally, the study
    recommends adoption of good agricultural practices, capacity building, and switching
    from traditional to precise farming with IoT-based technology. For future scope,
    institutional innovations, networking of farmers, regulatory authorities, clear
    policies supporting the necessary legal and market architecture for smart farming,
    and transparent data management system will be required.

    Internet of Things Climate change Livelihood Adaptation Access provided by University
    of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download chapter PDF Introduction Climate change is a global
    concern impacting the Earth’s ecosystem and humankind. A recent report by IPCC
    (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) (2021) provides new estimates of the
    chances of crossing the global warming level of 1.5 °C in the next decades and
    is unequivocal (IPCC 2021). There will be intensification of extreme events globally,
    and weather uncertainties will be natural resources including agriculture sector.
    Most importantly, water scarcity is also one of the greatest challenges of the
    twenty-first century (FAO 2011), and agriculture accounts for an estimated 70%
    of global water withdrawals (WWAP 2015). Therefore, it is also important to address
    water scarcity as well as water use efficiency (Hatfield and Dold 2019; Pande
    et al. 2022a). In the Indian context, agriculture is the main backbone of Indian
    economy and accounts for around 20% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) (Economic
    Survey 2020–2021). Climate change impacts will be more visible in developing countries
    like India as compared to developed countries as millions of populations are dependent
    on agriculture and natural resources for their livelihood (IPCC 2014). Additionally,
    the rise in population increases the demand for food security putting pressure
    on natural resources (Adamides et al. 2020; Pande et al. 2021a; Rajesh et al.
    2021). Furthermore, developing countries are more vulnerable due to low adaptation
    measures, lack of financial resources, and technological constraints. Thus, these
    impacts in turn have significant economic, social, and environmental consequences,
    so a better understanding of all the changes that might arise in view of climate
    change and variability is essential. To meet the needs and to overcome these challenges,
    one has to adopt new technologies to gain a much-needed edge. New agricultural
    application in smart farming is precise through IoT which enables crop farmers
    to collect real-time data related to irrigation and plant protection processes,
    aiming to increase production volume, improve product quality, and predict diseases,
    while optimizing resources and farming processes (Adamides et al. 2020). It improves
    the livelihoods of farmers and helps them in tackling climate change challenges.
    Thus, this chapter reviews the potential of current and future trends of smart
    agriculture using IoT-based tools in India and challenges and role in combating
    climate change. The study recommends the use of good agricultural practices along
    with adoption of IoT-based smart agriculture in combating climate change. Smart
    Farming Approach Smart agriculture with IoT-based solution is “a group of infrastructures
    interconnecting connected objects and allowing their management, data mining and
    the access to the data they generate” (Dorsemaine et al. 2015). By utilizing data
    like temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, humidity, wind, pH, etc. from IoT devices
    in the field and using cloud computing and analytics, farmers are timely notified
    to proceed with such targeted activities, and proper planning is done for farming
    based on the real-time database (Ayaz et al. 2019; Adamides et al. 2020). The
    schematic diagram below shows the use of IoT-based techniques where different
    sensors, microcontrollers, power supply, and cloud computing and its application
    in the agricultural system (Fig. 19.1). Fig. 19.1 Schematic diagram of IoT and
    its application Full size image The application of IoT in agriculture aims at
    empowering farmers, enhancing livelihoods of farmers, and providing decision tools
    and automation technologies that integrate products, knowledge, and services for
    increased productivity, quality improvement, and profit (Elijah et al. 2018).
    It utilizes advance information and communication technology (ICT) and deploys
    smart sensors in the field, scanning the field with drones and enhancing the use
    of spatial and real-time events (Walter et al. 2017). This approach improves farm
    productivity, quality yield, increased production, profitability, efficient irrigation,
    identification of pests/diseases, and precise use of pesticides. Good practice
    approach enhances the use of organic manure, less use of pesticides, selection
    of crops, timings, crop rotation, maintaining soil health, and efficient use of
    water in agriculture which in turn also reduces environmental footprint. Thus,
    for an economically and environmentally sustainable production system, there is
    a need to develop techniques that can increase crop production through increased
    efficiency of input use and reduced environmental losses, and smart agriculture
    using IoT solutions is the key component of sustainable agriculture in the twenty-first
    century (Delgado et al. 2019; Sishodia et al. 2020). Smart agriculture is based
    on three important pillars: (i) better resource management, (ii) improved conservation
    of ecosystem and landscape, and (iii) smart farming technologies with more adequate
    services for farmers (Adamides et al. 2020). It is estimated that the smart agriculture
    market will grow by 12.7%, annually (Chen et al. 2019). In the next several years,
    the use of smart solutions powered by IoT will increase in agricultural operations.
    In fact, a few of the recent reports depicted that the IoT device installation
    will see a compound annual growth rate of 20% in the agriculture industry and
    a number of connected devices (agricultural) will grow from 13 million in 2014
    to 225 million by 2024 (Machina 2017; Elijah et al. 2018). Thus, most countries
    are switching from traditional farming to technology-based farming in the long
    run. From Data Collection to Farming Advisories Different emerging technologies
    like the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, artificial intelligence
    (AI), remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and global positioning
    systems (GPS) are very important tools in agricultural operations which aimed
    to enhance production and reduce inputs and yield losses (Elijah et al. 2018;
    Delgado et al. 2019; Jha et al. 2019; Pande et al. 2021b, 2022a, b). Furthermore,
    IoT technology systems utilizing cloud computing, wireless sensor networks, and
    big data analysis have been developed for smart farming operations such as automated
    wireless-controlled irrigation systems and intelligent disease and pest monitoring
    and forecasting systems (Elijah et al. 2018; Jha et al. 2019; Shisodia et al.
    2020). AI techniques, including machine learning, have been used to estimate different
    parameters like evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, soil pH, and crop predictions
    for automated and precise application of water, fertilizer, herbicides, and insecticides
    (Boursianis et al. 2020). These technologies and tools enable farmers to characterize
    the important crop growth parameters enabling the management of good growth and
    yield and avoiding losses (Koch et al. 2004). The ecosystem of smart agricultures
    includes the following as mentioned below: Internet of Things (IoT) IoT is a technology
    aimed at connecting all intelligent objects within a single network, that is,
    the Internet. It involves all kinds of computer technologies, both (a) hardware
    (intelligent boards and sensors) and (b) software (advanced operating systems
    and AI algorithms). Its primary target is the establishment of applications for
    devices, in order to enable the monitoring and control of a specific domain primarily
    used in agriculture for the management of agricultural products within gathered
    real-time data, alongside: (1) searching, (2) tracking, (3) monitoring, (4) controlling,
    (5) managing, (6) evaluating, and (7) operations within a supply chain. Big Data
    Analytics (BDA) It refers to the large volume of data gathered from different
    dataset sources over a long period of time, that is, sensor, the Internet, and
    business data. Thus, BDA involved the utilization of (a) tools, classification
    and clustering; (b) techniques, data mining, machine learning, and statistical
    analysis; and (c) technologies (Alreshidi 2019). The use of BDA in agriculture
    focusses on the management of the supply chain of agricultural products, in order
    to enhance decision-making and minimize the cost of production cost. It is also
    employed for the analysis of the properties of different types of soil for classification
    and further enhancement. Furthermore, it is useful for improved prediction and
    crop production. Cloud Computing It is “a model for enabling convenient, on-demand
    network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (networks,
    servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and
    released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction” (Alreshidi
    2019). The cloud computing can be seen as a high virtualization method for datacenter
    infrastructure distributed over a wide geographical area, linked by means of high
    bandwidth network cables providing a variety of virtualized services. All these
    advanced data acquisitions and processing techniques aid the decision-making process
    for field crops, horticulture, pasture, and livestock (Shisodia et al. 2020).
    Mobile Computing It refers to infrastructure in which data processing and data
    storage take place externally to the mobile device. Systems collect and send daily
    data to farmers, informing them of both the production status and weather conditions.
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) AI covers many areas, including computer vision,
    data mining, deep learning, image processing, and neural networks (Kale and Patil
    2019; Elbeltagi et al. 2022a, b). It includes robots, monitoring crops and soils,
    and predictive analytics, as the following: (a) Robots: These are developed and
    programmed to handle fundamental agricultural tasks/human force. (b) Monitoring
    crop and soil: It employs computer vision and deep learning algorithms for processing
    captured data by sensors monitoring crop and soil health. (c) Predictive analytics:
    This analysis captures data, based on machine learning models capable of tracking
    and predicting various environmental impacts on crop harvest, that is, changes
    in weather. IoT/AI technologies (such as drone and satellite) that generate a
    large amount of data on a daily basis have the potential to enable agricultural
    production to forecast changes and detect opportunities (Alreshidi 2019). Applications
    Smart agriculture also includes Farm Management Systems (FMS) that assist farmers
    with a variety of collected information, by managing and controlling various tracking
    devices and sensors (Alreshidi 2019). The devices are attached to solar panel
    for power supply, and good network connectivity is the outmost need. Remote sensing
    and GIS tools can be also used for monitoring farms, crop yields, water management,
    nutrient management, disease management, and production spatially and temporally.
    Remote sensing uses sensor-based technology, and these sensors differ based on
    spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution. Numerous vegetation indices
    like NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), EVI (enhanced vegetation index),
    and statistical/machine learning approaches, such as deep convolutional neural
    network and random forest, have been applied to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral
    data to extract useful information on crop conditions (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2016;
    Chlingaryan et al. 2018; Chang et al. 2020; Elbeltagi et al. 2022a). More recently,
    quantification of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from hyperspectral
    images has increasingly been applied to estimate photosynthesis, plant nutrients,
    and biotic and abiotic stresses such as disease and water stress (Zarco-Tejada
    et al. 2016; Mohammed et al. 2019). Additionally, special devices like automated
    weather stations collect weather-related data like rainfall, temperature, humidity,
    wind, etc. Disease models and sensor-based cameras provide accurate information
    on pest−/insect-related diseases in crops and help in predicting the trends. Precise
    information on crop pests/insects provides alerts when there is rise in pest attacks
    and saves the crops from further damage. Additionally, it provides guidance in
    the use of appropriate pesticides/insecticides in farms. The utilization process
    of IoT/AI technologies aids in establishment, monitoring, management, processing,
    and analysis of data generated from various agricultural resources, such as field,
    crops, livestock, etc. and further enriches decision-making of stakeholders (Kumar
    et al. 2012). Decision-Making in Farmers The large data obtained from sensor offers
    learning opportunities to improve decision-making in constantly changing environmental
    conditions; such decision-making can be over a short, medium, or long term (Adamides
    et al. 2020). It allows various farms to be connected and managed on a single
    platform, where information on scientific advances, production, marketing, farm
    management, recommendations, and other related topics are disseminated to maximize
    productivity, yield, and revenue. Automated decisions can be made from the IoT
    system when certain conditions are reached, therefore requiring less or no human
    interventions. Such automated decision could range from regulating the temperatures
    to the control of water supply from an irrigation system. Insurance Farmers are
    usually exposed to extreme weather conditions which could lead to poor harvest
    and yield loss due to unpredictable rain and lack of storage system. However,
    with the implementation of IoT technology, farmers can be insured with their crops
    and livestock. A network of sensors can be deployed, and monitoring can be achieved
    by remote unmanned stations (Alreshidi 2019). The data can be sent to the cloud
    and analyzed. The insurance policy can be embedded with a warning system, where
    extreme weather conditions are predicted and the insured farmers are alerted by
    text messages. This can enable the farmers to take precautionary approach to protect
    their farms. Advisories With the help of various applications and interfaces in
    smartphones, farmers can receive advisories at regular intervals at their doorsteps.
    They can plan agricultural practices as per the precise information reducing the
    risks. Additionally, with connectivity through online interface, they get platform
    to connect to markets for buying and selling their produce with the right price
    (Fig. 19.2). Fig. 19.2 Mobile application Full size image Climate Change and Agriculture
    India is the third highest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter after China, and the United
    States accounts for 18% of gross national emissions from agriculture and livestock.
    The agriculture sector is the main source of CH4 and N2O emissions (BUR 2021).
    In the year 2016, the agriculture sector emitted 407,821 Gg of CO2e. Within agriculture,
    in 2016, 54.6% of GHG emissions were due to enteric fermentation, followed by
    17.5% from rice cultivation, 19.1% from fertilizer applied to agricultural soils,
    and 6.7% from manure management, and 2.2% due to field burning of agricultural
    residues (BUR 2018). Climate change is threatening India’s food security with
    frequent dry spells, heat waves, and erratic monsoonal rainfall, adding to farmers’
    woes. As the global population continues to surge, developing countries will need
    to double food production by 2050. Consequently, scientists and policymakers are
    faced with the challenge of meeting the growing demand for food while also reining
    in on GHG emissions. Creating sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural systems
    has been highlighted as part of India’s plan to meet its ambitious pledge to the
    United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change international treaty to
    reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by up to 35% by 2030, compared to 2005
    levels (INDC 2015). Moreover, frequent dry spells, heat waves, and erratic monsoonal
    rainfall add to farmers’ woes. It is very much evident that climate change has
    a severe impact on global food production influencing both demand and supply of
    food grains, globally (Srinivasarao et al. 2018); under such conditions, the program
    of sustainable development goals will continuously slow down, affecting the communities
    immensely. Besides this, about 85% of Indian farmers and marginal and small landholders
    (Agricultural census 2011) and about 60% of the net sown area are under rainfed
    agriculture. This makes India vulnerable to climate change, considerably affecting
    the cropping system, livestock, fisheries, poultry, soil, pest, and diseases.
    Climate change would have a serious impact on Indian agriculture in the coming
    years which would negatively impact some important crops that would lead the country
    to food insecurity. The present trend and scenario are evident that without an
    efficient measure, it would be very difficult to meet agro-demand of the country.
    Thus, efficient measures of adaption and mitigation are required. Advantages of
    Smart Agriculture Based on IoT and Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) IoT system
    has wide applications in the agricultural system. It can manage water content
    efficiency and soil health and also maintain crop growth. It has more advantages
    in multi-cropping agricultural system with diverse crops and huge yields. It saves
    time and minimizes manpower. It reduces the agriculture issues due to uncertainties
    in weather- or environment-related issues. It minimizes the manual works and makes
    a very effective farming system which promotes efficient use of water and soil
    management approach. It is a fast technology; increases crop production; improves
    crop quality, large production, and regular advisories; minimizes loss; and increases
    profits. To enable farm, produce to be internationally competitive innovative
    farming practices incorporating the concept of globally accepted good agricultural
    practices (GAP) within the framework of commercial agricultural production for
    long-term improvement and sustainability is essential. Good agricultural practices
    are “practices that address environmental, economic and social sustainability
    for on-farm processes, and result in safe and quality food and non-food agricultural
    products” (Hobbs 2003). The four “pillars” of GAP are economic viability, environmental
    sustainability, social acceptability, and food safety and quality. GAP in addition
    to improving the yield and quality of the products also has environmental and
    social dimensions. Implementation of GAP would promote optimum utilization of
    water resources such as pesticides, fertilizers, water, and eco-friendly agriculture.
    Efficient use of fertilizer not only lowers emissions at the field but also reduces
    the need for fertilizer and the emissions associated with production and transportation.
    It also represents savings for the farmer. Mitigation options would include applying
    fertilizer at the right time and the right place for plant uptake or using slow-release
    fertilizer forms or nitrification inhibitors. Adoption of zero tillage farming
    and residue management-maintaining crop residues on the soil surface to protect
    the ground from erosion in rice, wheat, maize, cotton, and sugarcane was shown
    to reduce emissions. The use of sprinkler or micro-sprinkler irrigation and fertigation
    together reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Other good practices include the use
    of organic manure vermicompost, farm yard manures, integrated pest management,
    irrigation management, neem use of drip farming, zero tillage, no crop burning
    after harvest, timely sowing, harvesting, storage, transportation, and knowledge
    of markets. The implementation of GAPs contributes to sustainable agriculture
    and rural development. Key Problems Faced in Indian Agriculture System There are
    numerous factors which restrain India’s agricultural output. Some of them are
    systemic or historical in nature, while others are related to environmental or
    technological factors. The technological factors have emerged primarily due to
    lack of advancement of agricultural techniques and affordability of machinery
    and equipment (Dixon et al. 2004). Systemic factors include cropping pattern mono-cropping;
    application of obsolete cropping patterns inhibits agricultural productivity and
    leads to soil degradation. Small/fragmented landholdings of farmers and land tenure
    make it difficult to achieve economies of scale and introduce new technologies
    and machinery. Further, due to lack of systematic agriculture financing provision,
    it is unaffordable for farmers to take load at high interest, thereby making finance
    unaffordable for farmers. Similarly, environmental factors like unpredictable
    behavior of monsoons influence agricultural productivity, overuse of fertilizers,
    increase in tillage, abandonment of traditional organic soil revival techniques,
    and insufficient rotation of crops resulted in soil degradation and loss of fertility
    (World Bank 2012). Furthermore, the diverse topography of India’s land makes it
    essential to identify the right crops for the various soil variants and climatic
    conditions. Other factors include technological factors like lack of farm equipment,
    new farming techniques, lack of efficient ways of water supply for irrigation,
    groundwater, lack of storage facilities, awareness and illiteracy among farmers,
    market connectivity, and the use of traditional farming system (FAO 2017). An
    important aspect in rural India is the dependence of all household members on
    single source of livelihood which makes even more necessary to tackle the problems
    with a comprehensive strategy. While addressing most of these factors needs policy
    interventions, tackling some of them can be easier through the adoption of analytics
    and smart farming. Some of the drawbacks of IoT comprises requirement of continuous
    Internet connectivity, costlier, several kinds of security issues to maintain
    these types of networks, and a need of equipment maintenance done regularly. Conclusion
    and Recommendations Climate change is a global challenge affecting the natural
    ecosystem and humankind. It has detrimental effects on natural resources by altering
    their natural properties. Due to altering of soil and water properties, it not
    only impacts agriculture but also faulty farming practices have detrimental effects
    on the climate. Therefore, there is a need of smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing technology which meets the growing food demand of the increasing
    population, promotes sustainable agriculture, and reduces emissions. Thus, the
    use of AI and IoT techniques can help to practice sustainable agriculture and
    also contribute in climate mitigation by reducing the carbon footprint. Thus,
    this review paper highlights the role of IoT-based technology in agriculture in
    order to make agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations.
    Moreover, the high efficiency of integrated agriculture production systems delivers
    socioeconomic and ecological benefits that profit farmers as well as the whole
    society. There are many ways in which integrated agriculture production systems
    can help producers to adapt to climate change and provide important mitigation
    co-benefits. However, several factors hamper the effective adaptation of integrated
    production systems, such as lack of data on the impacts of climate change and
    high requirements in terms of knowledge and labor and initial investments that
    may pay off only over long time periods. Besides, a key area to be worked upon
    is the strategy to ensure economic feasibility and ease of adoption. Emphasis
    must be given to pilots, and after learnings from implantations, it can be further
    scaled up and framework could be developed. Furthermore, opportunities for entrepreneurs
    will arise in future in this sector. They can further help in capacity building
    of farmers and encourage for more adoption of such technology in their farms.
    Thus, the sustainable intensification of integrated agriculture production systems
    requires a better understanding of the impacts of changes in climate and climate
    variability on these systems; the generation and sharing of local and global knowledge,
    experiences, and practices; capacity development through research and development,
    dialogue, and dissemination of information; and the support and coordination of
    policies, particularly policies that can provide incentives and create enabling
    institutions. Climate-smart policies will emphasize incentives and capabilities
    to encourage improved decision-making at the farm level. This includes the adoption
    of best feasible technologies, improved input use, and postharvest practices.
    Establishment of extension and improved supply chains may go a long way to meet
    this objective. Governments may also consider introducing insurance schemes with
    low transaction costs and moral hazard potential to reduce the cost of risk and
    risk aversion. Further, governments may provide input subsidies in short-term
    situations in which learning by doing is needed, as well as insured and subsidized
    credit. These activities should be designed to induce transition to sustainable
    and economically viable practices. Thus, adopting smart agriculture IoT and practicing
    good agricultural practices in farms would be a boon in agriculture. It is a platform
    for development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, technology,
    and innovation; tracking the crop growth, profit, safety, and nutrition labeling,
    and partnerships between growers, suppliers, and retailers and buyers. Additionally,
    IoT solution has bridged the gap between production and quality and quantity yield
    and increases profits. Real-time data provides precise information in the form
    of advisories related to weather updates, irrigation, production, yield quality,
    and soil moisture; predicts pest, diseases, and market information; and minimizes
    loss. The livelihoods of smallholder farmers will improve by adopting technology-based
    agriculture and play major role in managing food security in long run. Additionally,
    it acts as a viable climate change mitigation and adaptation approach to tackle
    climate change targets. Thus, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production and using of sustainable IoT-based sensors
    and communication technologies is not optional – it is necessary. This will further
    help in achieving our sustainable development goals and development of management
    practices, contribute in climate adaptation, and have implications in policy aspects.
    In the way forward, it can be concluded that institutional innovations would be
    possible, leading to networks of farmers who are more self-organized and flexible
    than today. Joint use of machinery and applications can promote private exchange
    of sowing, maintenance, and harvesting operations. Yet, because regulatory authorities
    need to have access to some aspects of the data gathered, clear policies and a
    transparent data management system will be required. ICT and data management can
    provide novel ways into a profitable, socially accepted agriculture that benefits
    the environment (e.g., soil, water, climate), species diversity, and farmers in
    developing and developed countries. But this can only happen with the proactive
    development of policies supporting the necessary legal and market architecture
    for smart farming, with a dialogue among farming technology supporters and skeptics,
    and with careful consideration of emerging ethical questions. References Adamides

  description: If we talk about a technology that proved to be a boon for mankind,
    it is none other than IoT (Internet of Things) as we all are bound to the industries
    and agriculture where this technology has already spread its tentacles. According
    to the survey, it is an estimation that by 2025 the associated agriculture market
    will get hiked about 4.7 billion US dollars worldwide; it was 1.8 billion US dollars
    in 2019. When we ask ourselves what is the area where IoT is being used humongously,
    it will be in smart watches, Home Automation, Driverless Cars, etc. But in agriculture,
    it has impacted the most. As per statistics, the global population will reach
    almost 10 billion by 2050. Therefore, in order to consume the needs of such a
    gigantic population, it's become the need to head toward the latest technology
    in agriculture, but still we are facing some challenges such as weather condition,
    sudden changes in climate and environmental influence. To cope with such calamities,
    IoT has proved to be a game changer and helped in satiating the needs of eatables.
    As the industrial IoT in agriculture has been introduced globally, so do the advanced
    sensors been used in the market. There are various ways to connect the sensors
    to the cloud either by cellular or satellite network, through which we can have
    real time data just by using the sensors in projects. There are other applications
    also in IoT such as water monitoring system in which farmers can look into the
    tank for checking the water level in real life for the welfare of irrigation process,
    seed and plant monitoring system, in which farmers can monitor their farms from
    the very beginning phase one of seeds sprouting to the fully-grown plant can be
    nourished. Using IoT in farming, farmers have not only enhanced the yields in

    ISBN 9781003051022 Share ABSTRACT If we talk about a technology that proved to
    be a boon for mankind, it is none other than IoT (Internet of Things) as we all
    are bound to the industries and agriculture where this technology has already
    spread its tentacles. According to the survey, it is an estimation that by 2025
    the associated agriculture market will get hiked about 4.7 billion US dollars
    worldwide; it was 1.8 billion US dollars in 2019. When we ask ourselves what is
    the area where IoT is being used humongously, it will be in smart watches, Home
    Automation, Driverless Cars, etc. But in agriculture, it has impacted the most.
    As per statistics, the global population will reach almost 10 billion by 2050.
    Therefore, in order to consume the needs of such a gigantic population, it’s become
    the need to head toward the latest technology in agriculture, but still we are
    facing some challenges such as weather condition, sudden changes in climate and
    environmental influence. To cope with such calamities, IoT has proved to be a
    game changer and helped in satiating the needs of eatables. As the industrial
    IoT in agriculture has been introduced globally, so do the advanced sensors been
    used in the market. There are various ways to connect the sensors to the cloud
    either by cellular or satellite network, through which we can have real time data
    just by using the sensors in projects. There are other applications also in IoT
    such as water monitoring system in which farmers can look into the tank for checking
    the water level in real life for the welfare of irrigation process, seed and plant
    monitoring system, in which farmers can monitor their farms from the very beginning
    phase one of seeds sprouting to the fully-grown plant can be nourished. Using
    IoT in farming, farmers have not only enhanced the yields in multifold but also
    decreased the cost of farming. With the proper usage of IoT technology, the farmers
    have gained a tremendous amount of benefit not only financially but also physically
    by doing smart farming. Now, the water management is much easier, water sprinkling
    system, where sprinkler automatic sprinkles the water once the sensors found a
    lack of humidity in the soil. In a nutshell, we can say that IoT enhances decision-making
    capabilities of the farmers with more precise data in real time and is like another
    wave of green revolution through smart farming. Previous Chapter Next Chapter

    Nagpur, India SECTION I Introduction There has been a sudden increase in demand
    for high-quality nutrient food from the last few decades with the increasing awareness
    about food among consumers [1]. It has forced the farmers to adopt new technologies
    to automate the farms. In conventional livestock farming, various animal species
    are bred in an arena, and nutritious food products like meat, egg, milk, etc.
    are made available at a low cost to human beings for their diet. The integration
    of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the agricultural process
    leads to Precision Livestock Farming (PLF)[2], [3]. ICT reduces investment and
    increases both productivity and animal health in livestock farming. An intelligent
    automated system can efficiently monitor and control the various climate parameters
    by integrating new technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing,
    and Artificial Intelligence (AI), called Edge AIoT [4], [5]. Furthermore, the
    systems are based on AI models trained on the previous data and can predict future
    events. Edge computing is a computational model that enables edge servers to perform
    computationally intensive operations and store huge amounts of data near the User
    Equipment (UE) [6]. However, the limited capabilities of UE create the following
    needs for edge computing: a) to process the data with the help of models requires
    less computational abilities b) to make decisions based on mini clouds. Traditional
    time series models are more suitable for stationary or univariant time-series
    data [7]. Machine learning models can easily be trained for non-stationary data
    and data having a large number of features. These can easily handle autocorrelation,
    seasonality, and trendy effect, while pure time series required manual tunning
    to address these issues. Goehry [8] utilizes the Random Forest (RF) model to predict
    the electricity load forecasting for France and further, Asha [9] compares the
    performance of the RF model with the Facebook prophet model and found the RF model
    is more accurate compared to the Facebook prophet. The Linear Regression (LR)
    models are widely used in time series forecasting, having short-term dependencies
    in different fields, such as electricity demands forecasting, stock indexes, and
    wind speeds. Deep learning models are getting more attention because of their
    strong feature extraction capabilities and good non-linear fitting characteristics.
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is the most frequently used model for time series
    forecasting in many deep learning models, having long-term dependencies as it
    has a memory unit to avoid vanished gradient problems. Guillén [10] utilizes the
    LSTM for temperature prediction in intelligent farming for 3-month temperature
    data set with an accuracy of 92%. Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is also an updated
    version of LSTM proposed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem of LSTM. Both
    BiLSTM and LSTM were compared in [11] and the former was slightly better than
    LSTM. However, the deep learning models put a heavy computational model on the
    machine. The edge computing devices have limited computational capabilities, and
    heavy computational models are challenging to incorporate. Although the machine
    learning models are computationally less complex than deep learning models, we
    introduced the time delay embedding to decrease the error and increase the R2
    value for the predicted outputs. This paper compares machine learning (Random
    Forest, Linear Regression, ARIMA) and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM)
    to predict the temperature time series. The rest of the article is structured
    as follows. Section II gives the background to understand the different ML and
    DL models. Section III compares results for temperature prediction by ML and DL
    algorithms, and Section IV summarises the research work. SECTION II Literature
    Survey This section reviews the mathematical background of the compared machine
    learning models and basic architectures. A. Random Forest This model was proposed
    by L. Breiman in 2001; its ensemble several random decision trees and aggregate
    their predictions by taking the average [12]. It gives an excellent output when
    the number of inputs is considerably higher than the number of observations. The
    overall structure is nonparametric regression estimation, in which square-integrable
    random response Y∈R is predicted for an input vector X∈X⊂ R p by approximating
    the regression function m(x)=E[Y |X=x] [13]. It is a collection of M random regression
    trees. Here m n (x, Θ j ) is the anticipated value at point x by the j th tree,
    where Θ 1 …, Θ M are independent random variables, distributed as a general random
    variable independent of the sample D n ( D n is a training sample with D n =((
    X 1 ,  Y 1 ),…,( X n , Y n )) of independent random variables). These random variables
    can represent the randomness bring about by node rifting and the sampling procedure
    during tree formation. The finite forest estimation from the combination of trees
    is represented as: m n (x; Θ j ,Dn)= ∑ i∈ D ∗ n ( Θ j ) 1 x i ∈A(x; Θ j ,Dn) Y
    i N n (x; Θ j ,Dn) (1) View Source where D n ( Θ j ) is a collection of data points
    selected earlier than the tree formation, An( x; Θ j , D n ) is the cell containing
    x , and N n (x;Θj, D n ) is the number of (preselected) points that falls into
    A n (x; Θ j , D n ) [3]. B. Linear Regression Linear regression is an important
    and extensively used machine learning model for time series forecasting due to
    its lucidity and generates models with a high degree of accountability[14]. It
    considers a linear association of the input variable ( X ) and output variable
    ( Y ) by formulating an equation that describes the Y as a linear combination
    of the X (multiplied with the corresponding variables learned by the model from
    training). Multiple Linear Regression represents a linear relationship between
    various inputs and single output variables with an intercept constant as y= b
    0 + b 1 x 1 + b 2 x 2 +⋯+ b n x n (2) View Source where, b0 = the intercept value
    b1, b2, …, bn = Coefficients describe the linear relationship between a combination
    of the input variables and target variable. C. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) The
    long short-term memory (LSTM) is a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) architecture
    used for computing where data analysis requires more distant information or data
    having a long-term dependency. It can anticipate the future value in the sequence
    based on learning from previous observations with long-term dependencies [10].
    LSTM is a chain-like neural network model consisting of three control gates: forget,
    input, and output[15]. Fig. 1 Basic scheme for LSTM Show All Fig. 1 shows the
    interconnection of the three gates. The gates have the following equations: Forget
    Gate: f t =σ( w f h t−1 + w f X t + B I ) View Source Input Gate: i t =σ( w i
    h t−1 + w i X t + B f ) View Source Intermediate Cell State: c ~ =tanh( w c h
    t−1 + w c X t + B C ) View Source Cell State: C t =( i t ∗ c ~ )+( f t ∗ C t−1
    ) View Source Output Gate: O t =σ( w 0 h t−1 + w 0 X t + B O ) View Source Next
    State: h t = O t ∗tanh( C t ) View Source D. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
    (BiLSTM) The LSTM cell works only on the previous content, the BiLSTM cell was
    designed to work on both previous and future frames. The architecture of BiLSTM
    splits the state neurons of an LSTM into two parts; one part is responsible for
    positive time direction and another aspect for negative time direction. Fig. 2
    gives the comparison of basic architectures of LSTM & BiLSTM [16]. At each point
    in a given sequence BLSTM model has all information about past and future events.
    Fig. 2 Comparison of LSTM & BiLSTM architecture Show All E. Performance Indices
    Four performance parameters are used to evaluate different machine learning models;
    The ideal value of MAE for any model should be zero and expressed mathematically
    [14] as MAE= 1 N ∑ N i=1 |x− x ~ | (3) View Source And the RMSE can be expressed
    mathematically as RMSE= 1 N ∑ N i=1 (x− x ~ ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √
    (4) View Source Spearman''s correlation coefficient is a nonparametric version
    of PCC (Pearson correlation coefficient) that indicates the correlation between
    two variables (test and predicted data). Spearman''s correlation coefficient (SPCC)
    assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). Its values lie in the
    range of −1 to +1. The SPCC ( ρ ) can be calculated as ρ=1− 6Σ d 2 i n( n 2 −1)
    (5) View Source where d i is a difference in paired ranks and n is the number
    of cases. R 2 (determination coefficient) indicates the variations in the predicted
    output as compare to tested input data. It represents how well-determined outcomes
    are reproduced by the model, relying on the total deviation of outcomes described
    by using the model. R 2 =1− s s res s s tot (6) View Source where s s res : sum
    of the squares of residual errors and s s tot : the total sum of errors. SECTION
    III Results and Discussion This section compares various machine learning and
    deep learning models for temperature prediction on subtropical terrain environment
    dataset [17]. The dataset has air temperature, humidity, air velocity recorded
    by sensors in every 10 mins for three months. This dataset has a total of 12960
    entries for 90 days. For this work only temperature is considered and the dataset
    format is as follows: Date and time: in dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm format Air temperature:
    in degree Celsius The temperature dataset is divided into a training sample size
    of 95% and a testing sample size of 5% to - with cross-validation techniques for
    performance evaluation. The performance of all models is compared based on MAE,
    RMSE, SPCC, and R2. Table 1 provides the comparison results of the performance
    of all models. The simulation and experiment have been performed using Python-based
    open-source neural network library implemented on Jupiter notebook with hardware
    as follows: Hardware: CPU: Intel Core i3, x64 bit, Core: 2, frequency 2.30 GHz,
    RAM: 8GB. The RF model is designed with hyperparameters of 100 number of estimators
    and three features. The number of estimators represents the decision tree per
    decision. Fig. 3 Actual and prediction data variation with time for (a) Random
    forest, (b) Linear regression, (c) BiLSTM, (d) LSTM Show All The deep learning
    models LSTM and BiLSTM are designed for 100 number input neurons, two hidden layers
    and 50 neurons per hidden layer, batch size of 128, ADAM optimizer, linear activation
    function, 50 epochs, and learning factor of 0.01. The BiLSTM model starts overfitting
    after 25 epochs as MAE starts increasing after this. Fig. 3 shows the test versus
    predicted outputs by different machine and deep learning models for tested data
    size. These outputs clearly show that the Random Forest predicted outcome strictly
    follows the tested data sample. It is further confirmed by comparing numerical
    values of different performance indices for other models, as shown in Table 1.
    The R2 value is maximum for the random forest, i.e. 0.9992. The linear regression
    model shows a similar type of performance as given by the RF model with the values
    of performance indices very close to the RF model. In comparison, the different
    AI model''s performance gives an insight into identifying a better model for forecasting
    purposes. The performance evaluation of the model affirms that the RF model has
    the most potential in anticipating temperature, followed by the linear regression
    model. The availability of a larger dataset increases the performance of the RF
    model. Table 1 Comparison of different models The concept of time delay embedding
    is used to increase the performance of machine learning. It includes the history
    of information in the model to construct a ‘rich’ features dataset. Each temperature
    entry is taken in the used dataset after 10 minutes for 90 days. We decided to
    go with a lag of half an hour, which means the last three data values are embedded
    in a matrix after testing the model for different past values ( n=1,2,3,…,m ).
    For n=3 , the machine learning models give the best output based on evaluation
    parameters. After n=3 , the values of these parameters become constant, as shown
    in Table 2. Table 2 Comparison of machine learning models performance for different
    time embedding length SECTION IV Conclusion and Future Scopes The preliminary
    information of temperature variations can help farmers anticipate the assets and
    apply speedy control strategies to ensure maximum performance and fewer effects
    on birds'' health. Various machine learning models are compared in this article
    for temperature prediction, and the Random Forest model shows the best performance.
    At the same time, the performance of deep learning models is slightly less than
    the Random Forest model for time series data prediction. The time delay embedding
    on the dataset for machine learning models increases the R2 value and decreases
    the error in predicted output for given tested data. These machine learning models
    can be employed at an edge computing device with less computational complexity.
    In a future aspect, the researchers can optimize the hyper-parameters of deep
    learning models like the number of input neurons, the number of hidden layers
    required and neurons per hidden layer, batch size, optimizer, activation function,
    and learning factor, and the number of decision trees in the Random Forest to
    maximize the performance. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    IoT; offloading mechanism 1 Introduction It is evident that agriculture always
    has a specialized role in the anthrophonic evolution and has been serving as an
    important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around 58% of the population
    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural products have declined over these years as several
    factors have influenced the crop productivity both directly and indirectly. Some
    major factors that affect the crop production are climatic changes, global warming,
    and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is affected by the
    direct and indirect changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already
    affected by the changes in climate incurred by global warming. The nutrition quality
    of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean are affected by the modifications
    in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions such as hail
    storms, dust storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation
    of soil is primarily created by various methods including 93.7% by water erosion,
    9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity and alkalinity, etc. Further changes in
    climate would influence adversely the crop production [7]. Since water is an indispensable
    requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded and thereby
    the fertility is also declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity
    has become a huge problem. Drought-like conditions is already formed in several
    areas and thereby the present and conventional farming practices are not suitable.
    New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need of the hour [8].
    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized
    utilization of resources, accurate forecast of water needs and environmental parameters,
    reduction of human intervention, etc. [10]. Consequently, the outcomes of crops
    in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-effective methods. One such
    booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11]. IoT is the collection
    of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring data via network
    devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily, IoT
    deals with the transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices
    using the Internet for prediction and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based
    methodologies has brought a changeover in agricultural patterns and farming approaches
    [12]. IoT devices can gather information about soil moisture, chemical properties,
    dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The information
    acquired from IoT devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically.
    Farmers can save time and money by responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud
    computing models integrated with on-field agricultural sensors need to be incorporated
    for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data. One of the major challenges
    of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential way. Some of the key
    factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information about
    the type and nature of data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary
    stage comprises acquiring the data and ingesting the data to the system. Substantial
    cognizance of data are achieved as the data pass through all the gateways where
    it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system. In the near future,
    dynamic prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed
    for smart irrigation systems. Therefore, a system is developed for efficient and
    optimal utilization of fresh water in irrigation along with drip irrigation system.
    It aids in finding which one of the plants fails to get sufficient water. When
    the water supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system.
    It becomes important for the farmers to understand the optimal usage of water
    and fertilizers to bring out sustenance in the agricultural industry. Therefore,
    processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns can be analyzed
    and planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad
    vision in deciding where the processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is
    obvious that not all data are crucial, and it provides a clear view of which data
    need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term and short-term purposes.
    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in
    developing nations makes the implementation quite challenging. An applicable solution
    to solve this problem is through edge computing where the essential data could
    be offloaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is the exact
    point where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in. With the
    purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in the agriculture
    domain, a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired
    from IoT components undergo preprocessing and ML models on the edge nodes to analyze
    and assess the appropriate results for providing the best instructions for controlling
    the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at different locations) in the farms. This article
    presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the soil moisture
    using the field information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed
    at the field and the forecast information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm
    has been developed that revolves around the machine learning techniques for the
    prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms with the combination of regression
    + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction
    of soil moisture in the proposed work. The proposed algorithm makes effective
    irrigation decisions with optimized usage of water in a more accurate and reliable
    manner. The effective decision-making refers to the process of predicting the
    rainfall, thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm
    in accordance with the predicted rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making,
    over watering is avoided by saving the soil. The server-side software is developed
    with node-side connectivity using the information for visualization and decision
    support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove the
    efficiency of the edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud
    control. The performance of the decentralized edge-based architecture has been
    evaluated for downloading the hybrid algorithm from cloud in real time execution.
    The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing architecture and measured
    with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response time.
    Edge computing capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption
    while executing the proposed algorithm with irrigation scheduling. Figure 1 Architecture
    of the proposed system. 2 Related work In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system
    not affected by communication disconnection and delay is developed using edge
    nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate impact
    on the plant growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions.
    Due to the working of existing irrigation systems on the cloud, communication
    is instable in the concurrent evaluation of AI models. However, the instability
    does not induce an edge node in its performance. The factors such as type of plant,
    soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil moisture need to be considered
    for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The nature and
    type of plant, soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics
    dealing with the nature of being), whereas other factors such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the sensor network. The trained ML model
    predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors as mentioned
    earlier. Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense
    the parameters impacting the water requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor
    BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer for sensing the temperature, soil moisture, light,
    and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to send and receive data
    through HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample
    dataset for training and decision-making regarding the water needs. Based on the
    input values, the trained model categorizes the input into five possible classes:
    highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed [14]. A decentralized
    smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses in contrast to
    conventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is developed after a small-scale smart irrigation networking prototype
    system and a reference architecture targeting edge data distribution for strawberry
    greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach is formed
    for designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at
    the same time: (i) A small-scale smart irrigation prototype solution with off-the-shelf
    hardware and software equipment is tested and evaluated on various types of plants
    for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large scale. (ii) A reference
    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution specifically for strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system
    in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed in Greece, incorporating
    the proposed reference architecture [15]. Edge computing is proposed for addressing
    the issues by taking advantage of computing resources in the edge of the network.
    The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier to achieve low end-to-end
    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of
    the data to the cloud through edge analytics. If a cloud service becomes unavailable
    due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service attack, a fallback
    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud
    data center. Edge nodes facilitate the timely monitoring of sensors in smart farming
    by the reduced latency and enhanced data transmission. Due to these factors, edge
    computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier open-source software
    platform we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization
    (NFV)-based approach is deployed for performing the local operational decisions
    at the edge level for mitigating the influence of network failures while using
    cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming, a platform enabling
    cost-effective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].
    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge
    interval in measurements (10 minutes), the model presented estimated error by
    more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated the online approach by making
    the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without time-based interruption.
    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using field sensor
    network’s data along with weather forecast station’s data for the management of
    optimality in water conditions for the enhanced growth of grapes. The generated
    data are forwarded to a web server, which displays graphics without statistical
    analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori by the user.
    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application
    is developed, which gets adapted to the parameters needed in irrigation after
    a couple of human-made irrigations. With the usage of various ML algorithms, several
    tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations for the performance evaluation.
    After the evaluation using four different ML algorithms such as logistic regression
    (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting
    regression trees (GBRT), it is found that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To
    analyze the overall performance, a test bed for the sensor edge, mobile client,
    and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two different indoor species
    are selected as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia.
    The outcomes were quite good, and it is inferred that the prototype has learned
    the patterns of irrigation and making decisions automatically with a high rate
    of accuracy [23]. The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology
    for detecting the type and the category of the plant using an automated plant
    irrigation system. The water necessity of the plant is determined using the recognition
    of predefined set of plant images and data set acquired from farm. It utilizes
    the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition process
    is completed. Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous
    set of images needs to be stored. The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML
    methods in the irrigation decision support model using a pre-processed irrigation
    data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation needs of any plants
    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual
    irrigations are performed two times before making precise decisions. Due to the
    dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively, and it can be applied
    to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need for the
    learning model that can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning
    process using environmental parameters that do not need larger storage in the
    system but need higher computation. From the aforementioned survey for making
    a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs to be
    integrated into the irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting
    a platform that implies IoTs and edge computing in monitoring soil moisture via
    sensors, data communication between sensors and edge devices, and an Analytics-as-a-Service
    cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of a density map of soil moisture
    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to the geographical point data by satellite mapping,
    and it actually denotes the point of dry area and watery area through soil moisture
    detection point. This point is averaged among areas of irrigation to be done and
    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system. 3 The proposed system The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented
    in a prototype IoT system that has four components: (i) Edge node layer – This
    layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two microcontrollers. In this layer,
    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer
    consists of Raspberry Pi that act as edge server and capable of multitask processing.
    Here, edge server controls the edge nodes for sending signal and receiving data
    at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud server for receiving
    developed and trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation
    decision for controlling edge nodes. (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is
    deployed in the edge server and it is responsible for controlling the whole system
    through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data, control of
    edge nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control
    access of the proposed machine learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This
    layer composed of cloud services and cloud storage where its role is to train
    the machine learning model and store the data in database. It sends the trained
    proposed model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive interconnections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed
    IoT-based smart irrigation system includes five major components: field deployed
    module, Web-based interface, Web API weather input, soil moisture prediction mechanism,
    and edge communication model. Figure 2 Components of the proposed system. 3.1
    Field deployed module In the field requirements, a wireless sensor network of
    the sensor nodes needs to be deployed as shown in Figure 3. Here, field data collection
    device accommodates four different sensors: Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V2.0,
    DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature, ultraviolet
    (UV) Light Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511
    Analog Output Ultra-Violet Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry
    Pi 4 Model-B read, the output of these sensors where the program is developed
    in Python for the Pi model to fetch the hourly data from sensors and store the
    data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the server database
    using the developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump
    connected to a relay switch. Figure 3 Real-time prototype of the proposed edge
    model. For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web
    service from the responsive web-based interface. The irrigation decisions are
    checked periodically by the proposed model performed in the server. The water
    pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if the server makes any
    irrigation decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee
    [29] technology can be implemented for a large farming area in which several sensor
    nodes can be affixed in the specified area and every sensor node possesses sensors
    similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega reads the sensor output
    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the
    data via web service to the edge server. 3.2 Web-based interface The proposed
    framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize the growing
    data and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also
    be able to examine and analyze the historical growing data, if needed, through
    functionalities such as irrigation control, motor control prediction model deployment,
    and manual data entry implemented in this web application. Here, Node.js was chosen
    for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized as
    the database system. Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud,
    will be used for further data analysis in the future. The web application’s functions
    are designed following a software design pattern called model-view-controller
    (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to represent data
    through dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage
    all the physical devices/actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to
    the cloud, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS), namely, Heroku, had been utilized.
    Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as a service (PaaS), facilitates
    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and functionality by integrating several add-on services.
    The field data are sent to the server by Raspberry Pi using this web service.
    This web service manages the network outage/fluctuation during data synchronization
    from the field device to the server by taking the help of flag settings at the
    database level. The interface facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with
    visualizing real time sensors and predicted soil moisture for upcoming days and
    precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold value of soil moisture
    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The process of irrigation is initiated automatically
    and stopped after the specified threshold value generated from the proposed algorithm
    of soil moisture when it is reached. Figure 4 Web interface for the irrigation
    system. 3.3 Web API weather input The weather prediction data are collected by
    a web service developed in Python. The forecast data such as humidity, temperature,
    ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web forecasting portals like
    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted
    data with JSON format are read by the developed web and stored in database at
    the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction algorithm. Also, these data
    are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.
    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture
    based on data derived from field sensors and weather forecasting using the combination
    of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques has been developed
    underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating the
    difference/change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression
    algorithms are compared against each other and infusing each of them with k-means
    to check the preciseness in mean square error (MSE), R2, accuracy and mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil moisture of upcoming days with
    the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about soil
    moisture for the upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with
    the prescribed levels of soil moisture and predicted precipitation values, thereby
    saving energy and water, is presented by the algorithm. The information generated
    from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil moisture prediction
    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server. 3.5 Edge communication model
    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are flexible and transparent
    in nature for accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum
    utilization of potentiality in edge computing components, the communication among
    various components in the edge-IoT system requires intense probing by using the
    versatility among the devices in network edges. For transferring the data gathered
    from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is needed for
    the irrigation systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed
    work is classified into three main areas as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is used for the communication in the proposed
    system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven IoT messaging protocols (MQTT,
    CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols that
    play a major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved
    to be the most secure protocol after probing all the protocols with respect to
    latency, energy and bandwidth requirements, throughput, reliability, and security.
    Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture and gateway server architecture.
    In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on the IoT solution
    [37]. Under a common identifier, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices
    and IoT hubs or control devices, respectively. When the publishers have new data
    for recording, the data are published to the broker. The broker then flags that
    it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the subscriber.
    Then, the subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly. Figure 5 Proposed
    edge communication model. The first level accomplishes with connecting the end
    users to system with the help of mobile or web-based applications through the
    Internet. The next level (cloud computing server) deals with the connection of
    web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like
    displaying the real time status of the farm for the users, triggering a new deployment
    of the updated ML model to the corresponding edge node. The third level (farming
    area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices (actuators)
    for communicating with other components in the entire system. 4 Deployment of
    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm The watering mechanism of the plant
    has different approaches in the proposed model. Primarily, the system is trained
    with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with respect to
    suggestions defined by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of
    irrigation in the first level of deployment in cloud without the inclusion of
    pre-processed data. After acquiring the required data and training, the proposed
    system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing plenty of
    manual irrigations. Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system
    makes automated decisions in watering using the gathered data and the application
    of ML methods. The proposed model then decides the irrigation strategies automatically
    using ML methods without the need including collected datasets in the automatic
    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each
    stage of training. The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules
    for irrigation strategies according to the soil moisture prediction for upcoming
    days. The first module deals with training the model in cloud with manual irrigation
    datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing, training,
    and model development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil
    temperature (SMT), soil moisture (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV)
    periodically from the physical environment in the data collection stage, which
    is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions. Also, the time
    of performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are
    timestamped and stored in as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the
    time of irrigation. In the next step of pre-processing, inconsistencies are eliminated
    and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected from the irrigation dataset,
    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression
    algorithms such as support vector regression (SVR), multiple linear regression
    (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor (DTR), random forest regressor
    (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment. The
    regression algorithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through
    training, regression models are created, namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model,
    DTR model, RF model, and XB model that are been combined with the second module
    for decision-making. The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation
    for upcoming days by infusing the weather data as an input to the regression trained
    models. The live datasets from the weather API for future prediction of soil moisture
    variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast data like temperature
    (TH), humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the
    aforementioned model for soil moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained
    model is evaluated and deployed using the weather testing data for the prediction
    of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation. After the prediction of
    data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined with
    unsupervised ML algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes
    incurred in soil moisture prediction due to the impact of weather conditions.
    Further, each regression models with k-means algorithm are evaluated for performances
    in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table 1. The combined
    algorithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed
    by the authors in ref. [38]. Table 1 Comparison of performance metrices obtained
    from various ML algorithms Algorithms used Accuracy R 2 MSE MAPE (%) Execution
    time Power (J) SVR + k-means 0.96 0.96 0.25 1.98 0.06078 1164.85 MLR + k-means
    0.94 0.88 0.31 2.15 0.02075 429.30 LR + k-means 0.95 0.94 0.32 2.23 0.02482 351.35
    DTR + k-means 0.93 0.95 0.29 1.62 0.15687 914.70 RF + k-means 0.95 0.91 0.27 1.57
    0.16745 1475.13 XB + k-means 0.97 0.98 0.20 1.08 0.03547 537.87 XGBoost + k-means
    (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively and also
    the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given in
    Table 1. It is evident that the proposed combination performs better when compared
    to other regression + k-means-based approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine
    learning algorithm is applied in irrigation planning module on account of aforementioned
    performance metrices of ML. Although it performs moderately in terms of execution
    time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in edge computing as it
    has better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm
    (XB+k-means) is nearer to the actual value as shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means
    is selected for the implementation of SMPHA in edge-based irrigation scheduling.

    36.73 37.12 03-10-2021 32.88 33.01 4.1 Hardware setup IoT system is crucial to
    handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing nodes at the edge or in
    the cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An
    Arduino micro-control unit controls the combined IoT sensors and actuators at
    the same part of a field into a cluster, each connected to a Raspberry Pi that
    acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the actuators.
    For example, Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected
    to two components: Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The
    first Arduino Mega node is responsible for collecting data from sensors and the
    second one is for controlling the actuators in the field. Depending on the sensor
    type with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling Arduino uno joins with actuators in the field and controls
    (turn on/off) them in accordance with upper layers (from the edge web server).
    The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in edge nodes provides the necessary
    instructions to the edge nodes. 4.2 Web layer setup The deployment of web server
    assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation system. It visualizes
    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live irrigation with real time updates in the form of various
    charts. In accordance with the selected field, the web application redirects the
    user to the field’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The dashboard consists of
    field parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer. These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch
    controls (turn on/off) a particular kind of actuator (for instance, water pump
    to start and stop the irrigation). The user interface facilitates remote controlling
    of the field by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4. 4.3 Edge layer
    setup The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed
    and fed as the input vector to the ML model for processing and to return the control
    signals for activating or deactivating the actuators placed at the farm. Edge
    node processes the physical data (real time) at every end device such as the collected
    and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed scheme.
    The prediction model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google
    Colab in this work. Amazon Web Service (AWS) offers a library named Boto3 having
    many APIs to upload and download objects. After the development of model, it is
    transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS. The edge node utilizes the
    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and
    transmitted to Arduino nodes in the fields landscape immediately for controlling
    the actuators. In another flow, the data collected from sensors are filtered so
    as to keep only the modified data at the edge node before being sent back for
    mitigating the communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are
    used in the updation of the ML model to enhance its efficiency. 4.4 Analytics
    setup The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical
    parameters of a farming land via sensors and utilizing the fetched data along
    with weather forecast information for developing an algorithm using hybrid machine
    learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting the soil moisture for
    the upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation, the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture
    with the assistance of various statistical measures as shown in Table 1. The measures
    are adopted for estimating the appropriateness and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation is feasible
    using a good estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table
    2), with the support of field data and forecast information, thereby utilizing
    the natural rain efficiently. The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic
    changes in weather environment where the models deployed on edge nodes need to
    change the controls accordingly after model gets trained continuously. For the
    process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated. The parameters such
    as TM, HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose,
    and these generated datasets are recorded from the already developed manual mode
    system [39]. The growth of the Indian Mundu Chilli [40] is taken for the observation
    from the first stage to the last grown stage for 95 days. While retraining the
    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing effect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering
    the task of updating the SMPHA model from the web server. At that time, the newly
    trained model is downloaded to replace the existing one at the considering edge
    server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to be updated with
    the real-world knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply
    in the next farming season). 4.5 Work flow The flowchart in Figure 6 depicts the
    working of the proposed system based on the decision support system that is beneficial
    for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli plant is grown
    in a growbag attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for
    95 days of data collection. To bring out optimality in the irrigation system,
    features relating to climate, soil, crop, and field infrastructure are to be considered.
    To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables, decision support
    systems (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of soil moisture differences (SMD) model [41] developed
    for soil moisture prediction. The threshold values of soil moisture are used in
    the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation date based on the predicted
    soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically using
    SVR+ k-means modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work,
    further more number of sensors are used to log soil moisture value, which is averaged
    in the proposed model. This model is developed in two divisions of flowchart as
    shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It is observed that the prediction
    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2. Figure
    6 Flow chart of the proposed edge model. Figure 7 Average response time with 10
    test scenarios. The first phase of the flowchart describes the hybrid algorithm
    for the soil moisture prediction (SMPHA) using the combination of XB + k-means
    algorithm. During the data collection step, the sensor data for the parameters,
    namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing, null values
    and outliers are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost
    model. The developed model is then trained with variables of live weather features
    (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from Weather API for the prediction of SM data. These
    data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm to predict the soil moisture,
    which is defined as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the flowchart.
    The second phase of the flowchart defines the automatic irrigation planning setup.
    The setup starts obtaining the soil moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture
    minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard for setting the maximum and minimum level
    of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM) is sensed and compared
    against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin, the process
    proceeds with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending
    0 to the relay. In SMPHA, the nearest precipitation date is selected and it is
    assigned to the predicted soil moisture (PSM). The SMMax is decided by finding
    the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax is further checked
    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends
    0 to stop irrigation. The process of automatic irrigation ends by forecasting
    the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters. 5 Experimental
    setup and evaluation The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are
    collected for the analysis in irrigation management. Here, Heroku cloud platform
    is used to deploy the cloud web server. The same cloud is also installed at a
    local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n connections
    to denote the edge nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses
    to the web page from various users for evaluating the network parameters. The
    specification of these servers is given in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 Configuration

    of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two different platforms, namely, in the
    cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the benefit of the
    edge computing scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and
    discussed in the next section to show that edge deployment is better than cloud.
    5.1 Evaluation A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the
    first stage of the proposed model. The predicted value of the soil moisture is
    better in terms of their accuracy and error rate. From the comparison of the other
    ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and taken further
    to be deployed in edge and cloud to check its efficiency with each other. Therefore,
    for analyzing the efficiency of the edge server in accordance with the proposed
    hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated in terms of the time taken to train the ML
    model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi is used to train the
    SMPHA model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around
    1,710,000 ms (approximately 28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google
    Colab cloud environment, it takes 204,000 ms (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted
    in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the trained model on edge not to train
    the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge, it
    takes more time to train the model, but it can be ignored as it does not affect
    the purpose of the proposed model. Here, edge is introduced to obtain the task
    of computing from the cloud (i.e., offloading the task) by making the system more
    edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only 14
    s to download a trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size
    of 3,101 kb as given in Table 5. The time to download varies according to the
    size of the trained model. So, from this process it can be inferred that downloading
    the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at the edge.
    Through this in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better
    compared to deployment in cloud services. Furthermore, network parameters like
    latency, throughput, bandwidth, and response time are adopted to measure the performance
    improvements in edge computing. Table 5 Comparison of model training time Edge
    Cloud Model training time 28.4 min 3.4 min Downloading time Not applicable 14
    s The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing
    latency and transmission latency. The time spent on data processing and transmission
    between end devices to cloud servers is termed as computing latency and transmission
    latency, respectively. The computational capacity of the system decides the computing
    latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of capacity to make
    the data processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity.
    The latency in transmission is increased by the end devices and cloud servers.
    Bandwidth: As large number of sensors are deployed in IoT, data generated would
    be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth and leads to several problems
    such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable for
    the data to be transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression.
    Therefore, data preprocessing and aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before
    redirecting them to remote cloud servers. Then, the issue to be confronted is
    to control the traffic flow by migrating data processing and aggregation tasks
    optimally to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the
    data quality. Response time: The total response time is calculated by adding up
    transmission and processing time. The local deployment of the proposed model for
    controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes: (i) Cloud mode: The
    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed
    at the cloud server itself where it uses Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry
    Pi is deployed as an edge server that involves in processing of the SMPHA model
    controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and processed locally
    within the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the
    job of controlling the actuators to initiate and quit the working of water flow
    motors. Through this deployment in both the environments, performance of edge
    server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time,
    so the aforementioned scenarios of two modes are virtually created by generating
    many request and response threads between the servers. This sampling, load test,
    and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43] and also
    verified with Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here
    by data of sending and receiving sampling data between cloud to IoT sensors and
    between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling data considered in this work refer to
    the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud and Arduino to
    Raspberry Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into
    10 days of sampling data collected for each day. The evaluation results are depicted
    for latency and response times in 10 days perspective. In latency parameter, edge
    service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared to the with cloud.
    In the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated
    for an hourly basis for the 10 hours data in a day. From the hourly comparisons
    of throughput value, edge outperforms with 67.17% high Mbps usage. Through this
    analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge computing methodology
    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach. Figure 8 Average latency with 10 test scenarios. Figure 9 Average throughput
    value with 10 h test scenarios. Table 6 Performance metrices for cloud and edge
    services Performance metrices Cloud service Edge service Throughput (Mbps) 0.04944

    86 1,365 Finally, to illustrate the efficiency of resource management in edge
    computing, CPU and memory utilization are considered for the analysis as both
    factors rely on the service execution model and the computational needs of the
    services being fired from off-loaders. Figure 10 depicts the utilization of CPU
    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model affects
    the CPU of the Raspberry Pi node significantly as it consumed around 41.2% of
    the CPU compared to only 3.5% when it does not host the SMPHA model. However,
    the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and without deployment of
    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have much difference in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note
    that, the CPU utilization is still much lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity
    in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes feasible for adopting edge server implementation
    in the proposed irrigation system. Figure 10 CPU and memory utilization with and
    without SMPHA. 6 Conclusion This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based
    irrigation system to facilitate decision-making on watering the plants on scheduled
    time. The proposed approach applying IoT with an edge computing framework enables
    the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental conditions automatically
    and efficiently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather parameters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture
    prediction was performed using major regression algorithms that are again combined
    with k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil moisture prediction.
    These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE, MSE, speed, and power
    consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB + k-means
    algorithm was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the
    developed edge computing model. The proposed edge model saves the data communication
    cost and reduces the response time of IoT services. It can be deployed on existing
    devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes, thereby reducing the overall
    implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach was found
    to perform better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency,
    throughput, and bandwidth usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through
    CPU and memory usage while running with and without the algorithm. In both cases,
    the memory utilization is almost lower to total available resource of the edge
    device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for other computing
    services, which increases the efficiency of edge computing device. The number
    of end edge nodes can be increased according to the field area and then to check
    the potency of the system. Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict
    of interest. Data availability statement: All data that support the findings of

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) can be seen as the electricity
    of 21st century. It has been reshaping human life daily during the last decade,
    with various applications in several critical domains such as agriculture. Smart
    farming is a real-world application in which Internet of Things (IoT) technologies
    like agro-weather stations can have a direct impact on humans by enhancing crop
    quality, supporting sustainable agriculture, and eventually generating steady

    the traditional crop management practices remain insufficient to follow the persistent
    global needs for food. This challenge is mainly driven by the exponential population
    growth, climate change, and bad agriculture practices. The UN estimates that by
    2050, the world population will stand between 9.4 and 10.1 billion. The population
    numbers will continue rising through the years, and it will reach between 9.4
    and 12.7 billion by 2100 [1]. Thus, food production is expected to grow by 70%
    by 2100 to meet the population’s expansion [2]. Meanwhile, the impact of climate
    change, is putting productive lands and production under tremendous stress [3],
    with yearly damages expected to range between 0.1 and 1.0 percent of the gross
    world product by 2100 [4]. Furthermore, farmers’ mismanagement of crops and the
    extensive exploitation of resources often lead to soil deterioration through acidification,
    erosion, and heavy metals pollution [5,6]. Thus, farmers must use different resources
    such as fertilizers, water, and nutrients in a very optimized way for sustainable
    food production [7]. Therefore, smart farming presents a tremendous opportunity
    for farmers to overcome agricultural challenges and protect the environment. Smart
    farming is described as the application of information and communication technology
    (ICT) to the agriculture industry in order to improve crop management efficiency.
    The idea behind this concept consists of combining the most relevant trends in
    monitoring technologies with the best field practices to assist farmers to overcome
    the agriculture challenges [8]. Internet of Things (IoT) based systems for smart
    farming are considered to be the backbone of the fourth industrial revolution.
    It consists of the implementation of IoT-based systems for continuous monitoring
    and data analysis. Different heterogeneous sensor nodes are deployed across yields
    for key environmental processes’ monitoring. Sensor nodes that communicate continuously
    using wireless sensor networks (WSN) technology to overcome various geographical
    constraints that wired technologies have in topographic features such as deserts,
    mountains, rivers, valleys, and lakes. The wireless sensor network is the skeleton
    for an IoT-based system. It is based on a set of wirelessly connected nodes for
    network establishment as presented in Figure 1. The wireless nodes are the front
    gate elements for environmental sensing, data collection, and it can even play
    the role of the actuator through activities automation such as pumps control,
    irrigation, etc. However, sensor nodes with limited size and resources, such as
    power supplies, CPUs, and memory, require an additional optimization layer for
    optimum efficiency [9,10,11]. Therefore, techniques such as wireless network clustering,
    as investigated in our work in [12], can improve considerably the network’s energetic
    performance through the creation of sub-networks and multi-hope communication
    to limit distances between remote IoT nodes and base stations. Thus, avoiding
    energy dissipation in long distances. Additionally, the usage of light communication
    protocols dedicated for IoT sensor nodes, and decentralization where operations
    that consume the system’s resources are not performed on the sensor node’s level
    but the BS level side are part of the optimization approaches that enhance different
    performance. Figure 1. High level presentation of wireless sensor network. Undoubtedly,
    IoT-based solutions for smart farming are tremendously requested by large facilities.
    However, the penetration of such solutions within small farms is considered limited,
    especially in the developing economies [13]. This limitation is mainly due to
    the expensive costs, the complications of maintenance, and the overall performance
    of different solutions and services. Moreover, the lack of technological knowledge
    presents a barrier for IoT adoption among farmers [14]. Nevertheless, many researchers
    around the globe are continuously developing low-cost systems for small farmers,
    different solutions were gathered in detailed reviews such as [15,16,17,18,19].
    In [20], the authors present a low-cost-based agro-ecological management system
    for smart farming in India. The system performance was tested using the OMnet++
    simulation tool. OMnet++ which stands for Objective Modular Network Testbed in
    C++, is a framework and library based on C++ language. The framework is allowing
    researchers to create and simulate wireless networks’ communication. In Egypt,
    the authors of [21] present an agriculture monitoring system based on IoT and
    artificial intelligence (AI) for decision making. The implemented expert system
    enables the proposed framework to mimic the ability of a human expert to make
    decisions on plant diseases. In [22], the authors present a real-time monitoring
    system for farmers, the “Expert Advisory System” is developed to improve the crop
    productivity in Uzbekistan. This is can be achieved based not only on the provided
    environment’s data that supports farmers for their expert judgment (weather status,
    plant’s diseases, etc.), but also to evaluate precisely the soil needs for healthy
    plants and therefore good crop and better natural resources’ preservation. The
    simulation was conducted using Contiki Simulator. In [23], the authors proposed
    an IoT-based low-cost system for smart irrigation. The system is based on MQTT,
    HTTP, and Neural Network (NN) for intelligent decision-making. Another low-cost
    prototype has been presented in [24] in which authors have created a user-friendly
    system for smart farming. In South Korea, the authors of [25] proposed an adaptive
    network mechanism for a reliable smart farming system. The technique feature is
    based on the ability to choose suitable transmission protocols based on the network
    condition. The system implements Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRa-WAN) and IEEE
    protocols for transmission. As a smart farming system, the framework allows having
    a salable transmission system to scale out the platform performance in large farms.
    Using such as transmission approach will guarantee continuous communication between
    sensor nodes and the base station. Therefore, it will provide a continuous hands
    on the farm and its environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature, etc.
    Additionally the paper investigates some metrics such as latency and data reliability
    for the system’s validation. The authors of [26] presented an experimental analysis
    of energy harvesting for IoT devices, as well as a comparison of various wireless
    technologies for agriculture systems in Canada. IEEE 801.11 g, IEEE 802.15.4,
    and LoRaWAN protocols are also being investigated. In [27], an IoT system has
    been proposed for precise ecological monitoring in agriculture domains. The proposed
    platform is based on different views for different end-users. According to the
    authors, the architecture is open for an extra layer of protocols and it can be
    implemented on different servers and cloud-based architectures. In Turkey, an
    architectural approach based on Farm Management Information System (FMIS) has
    been introduced in [28]. In [29], the authors proposed an energy-efficient weather
    station, the system focused on the algorithm optimization to deal with the energy
    consumption dilemma such as devices high power’s consumption in data sending,
    data receiving, wireless communication, energy dissipation in different bands
    within different ranges, etc. Thus, the algorithm focused on the optimization
    in data transmission through the deployment of asynchronous algorithms that is
    based on measurement threshold and sleep mode approach. The station considers
    measurement data is ready when the anemometer’s rotations are reaching a certain
    value. Thus, if no rotation is detected the BS puts the system in sleep mode for
    500 ms. When data is ready, the transmission module doesn’t send the measurement
    of wind speed unless if it is greater than a predefined threshold. According to
    the authors, the optimized algorithm had the potential to optimize the energy
    consumption of the station by more than 60%. In Tunisia, the authors of [30] proposed
    a low-cost monitoring system for smart farming based on IoT and Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed platform relies on a set of under and above-ground
    environmental sensors. To the best of our knowledge, current monitoring systems
    focus on providing systems to the researchers’ community, rather than providing
    customized solutions to farmers for their crops management on a real-time basis.
    The proposed solutions do not address the energy consumption dilemma since most
    papers focus on technologies comparisons rather than hardware and software enhancement.
    Current platforms principally rely on light communication protocols to control
    the energy consumption issue and improve network lifetime. Additionally, the studied
    solutions in this article rely on very basic approaches when handling the operation
    and maintenance (OAM) of different components and services. In addition, current
    systems don’t answer the security dilemma. Some of the most common challenges
    in IoT are presented in Table S1 (see Supplementary Materials). Additionally,
    different authors propose low-cost solutions without breaking down the proposed
    systems’ costs into the cost of investments and the cost of operations. Thus,
    to overcome some of the challenging issues that the IoT-based systems have, this
    paper focuses on designing and implementing a sophisticated yet low-cost meteorological
    system for smart farming. The system is mainly designed based on open-sources
    software and platforms. The system design takes into consideration the algorithmic
    optimization in data acquisition, system security, and data presentation. The
    algorithm design is implemented to overcome the energy consumption dilemma, and
    it is oriented to improve the end-user experience. 1.2. Rationale of the SW and
    HW Architecture of the Proposed Method When targeting deployment of agile systems,
    we should always put in the heart of our approach the continuous integration and
    continuous deployment CI/CD philosophy. Thus, in this work, we use the latest
    technological advancement with new conceptual ideas to deliver an added value.
    Unlike virtualization which consumes resources, is slow to run, and doesn’t offer
    isolation between virtual machines (VMs), the containerization technology takes
    the software design to a new level thanks to the resources’ optimization, high
    level of isolation, and high speed. Therefore, we build a fully containerized
    base station based on the open-source containerization platform (Docker). All
    services within the base station are presented as containers to facilitate the
    operation and maintenance of the base station’s software components such as database,
    MQTT broker, etc. Deploying software on top of Docker will allow us to have features
    such as interoperability, ease of use, scalability, and high performance. Meanwhile,
    performance can’t be achieved only by using the good software infrastructure (Docker)
    but also using a highly adequate technology adapted for the exact use case (i.e.,
    weather monitoring). Consequently, classical databases cannot grant high performance.
    Hence, the time series databases (TSDB) are considered to be the most powerful
    databases to deal with massive monitoring data. In our work, we use InfluxDB as
    one of the best current TSDBs. Meantime, when using low-cost hardware, we should
    avoid pushing the usage of the BS’ available resources to the maximum when we
    can outsource some of the heavy activities, therefore we use Google Colaboratory
    (Colab) free computing resources to train our models and offload our base station
    for other tasks. Once a set of predefined amounts of measurement is recorded,
    the Debian distribution which is a Linux-based Operating System (OS) within the
    BS initiates a cronjob to export data into Google Drive, at that point Colab recover
    the data and start training the prediction’s model. When the model is ready, Tensorflow
    generates “tflite” and store it back into Google Drive. The model is then sent
    back to the BS for internal usage within the local webserver. We chose to deploy
    the open-source LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) server within our BS. Security is
    also a challenge in modern systems due to the high exposure to the internet. Thus,
    in our system, we use different techniques to ensure the system’s security and
    data privacy. Adoption of a separated cloud server that can only receive data
    from the base station is very important. The idea is to allow third-party users
    to consult the dashboard on a cloud server without being able to connect to the
    local server. Connection to a local server is only dedicated to researchers and
    engineers through VPN tunnels based on a pre-generated license. 1.3. Objectives
    and Hypotheses In the course of pursuing our main objective to build an agile,
    low-cost, and AI-powered meteorological station, we address the following hypotheses
    by implementing the corresponding item as described against the bullet points
    below. The different trained models, within the proposed platform, support the
    generation of AI-based information to assist different end-users roles such as
    farmers, researchers, and engineers. The proposed architecture is mainly based
    on open-source technologies to serve the low-cost philosophy adopted in this paper.
    The open-source environments chosen to allow us to customize source codes and
    adapt them for our exact needs with minimal cost of use. Therefore, usage of Debian
    OS rather than Microsoft OS will allow us to modify easily the OS Kernel to optimize
    the performance of our station in terms of the boot, background processes, usage
    of command lines, and enhancing the CPU usage and speed which lead eventually
    to enhance energetic performance. Furthermore, the long-term goal of the system
    is to propose a flexible platform based on the layering approach to enable the
    system’s flexibility and continuous upgrade. The system design follows a hybrid
    architecture that combines centralized and distributed techniques for devices’
    connection which will lead to higher performance. The design enhances the system’s
    portability, scalability, interoperability, and compatibility with different technologies,
    protocols, and equipment’s vendors. The Hardware (HW) design is based on deploying
    heterogeneous nodes that are not dependable on the vendor of the components, the
    type of the sensors, or the end node performance. The proposed distributed agro-weather
    station plays a Base Station (BS) role that embeds different agents. The BS is
    connected to several heterogeneous wireless nodes. The nodes, including the BS,
    are equipped with different heterogeneous sensors to measure the field’s temperature
    and humidity, wind speed and direction, and atmospheric pressure. The network
    continuously monitors the field and provides insights and predictions through
    a local server implemented within the BS. Since energy efficiency is a crucial
    metric in IoT systems, our network ensures good energy efficiency management without
    impacting system performance. The wireless nodes design which is based on standardized
    transmission protocols such as MQTT allows us to have good interoperability between
    nodes and different BS. This design approach is also done in order to fulfill
    the plug-and-play feature in this platform. Therefore, any wireless node within
    our system can be redeployed within other platforms as long as they follow the
    same protocol. We design the Graphical User Interface (GUI) layer to ensure visibility,
    accessibility, ease of use, efficiency, and attractiveness. The software design
    ensures real-time and near-real-time data communication and processing between
    network sensors and the base station. The agro-weather station is AI-powered to
    support farmers and researchers with environment’s data trends and eventually
    allow them to make fact-based decisions such as when planting, spraying, and even
    harvesting. Within the BS, the AI is an agent that is connected to an external
    Google Collaboratory environment (Colab) which is a standalone hosted Jupyter
    notebook that provides free computing resources for background data analysis and
    modeling. Even though it is possible to bypass the usage of Colab and rely only
    on a local Jupyter netbook running on the local server, however, we should avoid
    consuming local BS resources on the training tasks and allocate these resources
    for other services such as sensing, wireless transmission, cronjob services, local
    web-server, etc. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) ensures utility and warranty
    and avoids complications whenever end users are connected, and data is consulted.
    The system’s services such as remote access, web services, database updates, and
    telegram chat-bot are built on top as standalone agents. The multi-agent system
    (MAS) approach helps enhance the BS performance by creating scalable, reliable,
    efficient, and maintainable modular services. In addition, the MAS approach enables
    the stateless configuration of services. Therefore, services can be updated through
    a Start, Upgrade, and Stop (SUS) approach. The SUS approach allows instant execution
    of predefined scripts for each operation. The scripts are hosted in accessible
    repository under/usr/local/bin. The file system/usr/local/bin contains different
    scripts that normal users can access and use, this repository protects scripts
    from being modified when the system’s updates are planned or executed. Consequently,
    facilitating different modules’ operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. System
    security approach and design have been implemented in our platform. Access to
    the BS is ensured locally with user credentials or remotely through a secured
    VPN tunnel. We deploy OpenVPN within the BS. Meanwhile, because OpenVPN needs
    to follow an assigned IP address, while our system is connected to a public address,
    we can overcome this challenge by deploying a NoIP client within our BS that plays
    the role of a dynamic DNS pointing continuously to a static hostname such as “www.ensem-aws.tk”
    accessed on 13 April 2021. Different user roles are configured with different
    roles and privileges. Additionally, offline data snapshots of the OAM & Data dashboards
    are stored in the cloud and consulted separately. The system building costs are
    essential in our platform’s design. Capital expenditures (Capex) and operating
    expenses (Opex) are the leading Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) taken into consideration
    for solution design and prototyping. Thus, the cost analysis is ensured to support
    presenting the system’s short-term and long-term benefits for different users.
    2. Materials and Methods Many contributions have been proposed, and several works
    are continuously developing IoT-based systems for smart farming. Thus, we propose
    an agro-weather station (AWS) designed to serve farmers and researchers at once.
    The system is developed to provide real-time data and AI-based insights for different
    end-users. The logical architecture illustrated in Figure 2 is based on a multi-layer
    approach. The system can be seen as a natural evolution and implementation of
    our previous work in [31]. The proposed system’s high-level design (HLD) is decomposed
    into four main layers: the perception layer, the transmission layer, the presentation
    layer, and the management layer. The main role of the perception layer is sensing
    and collecting data through the network’s deployed heterogeneous sensors. In addition,
    the perception layer contains different sensors to collect environmental parameters
    such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, and wind speed. Meanwhile, the
    transmission layer can be considered as the skeleton of our system. This layer
    connects the network’s dispersed sensors to the BS through different deployed
    protocols such as WIFI, NRF24L01, MQTT, etc. The presentation layer’s role is
    to ensure data collection, processing, and data transformation to trends and insight
    reports. The presentation layer is based on a graphical user-friendly GUI accessible
    through different devices such as laptops, mobiles, and tablets. Finally, the
    management layer is responsible for surveying the system and providing real-time
    status and alarms of different deployed nodes for reliable system management.
    In this section, we discuss the research methods in our system’s design. Moreover,
    we review the several opportunities and challenges that IoT-based systems present
    for smart farming use case. Figure 2. The End-to-End high-level decomposition
    of the proposed agro-weather station. 2.1. System Design To effectively implement
    our system, we adopt an agile methodology approach to develop and deliver the
    system throughout its different phases as presented in Supplementary Part II (see
    Supplementary Materials). The agile approach enables a collaborative environment
    in which different stakeholders such as farmers, researchers, and developers continuously
    improve the system through its different releases and iterations. The approach
    starts with the requirement collection phase. In this step, we gather the system
    requirements that should be implemented according to the stakeholders, such as
    data visualization, system maintenance, and intelligent-based insights. The requirements
    are then prioritized according to their relevance and timeline within the analysis
    phase. The design phase focuses on the hardware and software design approach in
    complete alignment with the system baseline, such as the low-cost strategy, the
    portability, the scalability, the interoperability, etc. The development phase
    consists of the system implementation, where the system is transformed from a
    design into a prototype. The release phase is the extensive operation and exploitation
    of the current prototype version for performance analysis. Finally, the monitor
    phase measures and tracks the system performance and identifies any potential
    problem or improvement for corrective actions. This last phase is conducted in
    a proactive way to allow the system’s continuous enhancement. The design of the
    agro-weather station follows the multi-layer approach. Thus, in following, we
    discuss the various system’s layers: 2.1.1. Perception Layer [Back-End] The perception
    or access layer is the lowest level of the proposed system model. It consists
    of a set of interconnected sensors within different nodes. The Perception layer’s
    primary role is to ensure data collection of different environmental parameters
    through physical sensors. The deployed sensors collect different agriculture data
    such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and solar radiation as depicted in Table
    1. The standalone nodes are designed in hybrid mode. Nodes can either collect
    parameters locally and communicate with the BS through serial protocols such as
    I2C, UART or transmit the data to the BS wirelessly. The BS uses the data to build
    and continuously enhance the AI-based model for weather forecasting. A model that
    is fully based on the LSTM approach. The hybrid energy design of the nodes supports
    a hybrid power supply through solar energy or AC power. Meanwhile, to overcome
    the IoT devices’ power limitation, the integrated firmware supports different
    techniques to enhance the energy efficiency of nodes. The technique mainly involves
    deploying a change point detection algorithm with adaptive communication frequency
    with the BS [32]. Multiple environmental characteristics are consistent over time
    in agriculture, allowing the measurement frequency to be adjusted in response
    to parameter variation. In time-series data analysis, the change point is a critical
    component. It’s the point in time when a signal’s property (variance, mean, etc.)
    rapidly changes. The problem of detecting sudden changes in a time series is known
    as the change point detection [33]. In addition, different agents are deployed
    to follow the perception layer’s performance. Alerts are programmed to track different
    nodes’ energy performance and status. The nodes design takes into consideration
    several baselines such as: Table 1. Sensors’ technical specifications. Nodes portability:
    nodes are portable across the network without any physical or logical constraints.
    Nodes scalability: the nodes can handle additional functions by deploying different
    sensors in any future nodes’ expansion or upgrade. Nodes interoperability: the
    nodes can communicate with different BS based on different vendors without critical
    constraints. 2.1.2. Transmission Layer [Back-End] The transmission layer is the
    skeleton of the network that ensures proper communication between its different
    elements. It focuses on the establishment of transparent and reliable end-to-end
    data transportation links. The layer transport either wirelessly or locally the
    nodes’ data from the perception layer to the presentation layer for eventual data
    formatting. Although wired communication is less energy-consuming than wireless
    communication, not limited by dedicated radio bandwidth, and it is more secured
    to remote network attacks. However, wireless communication is highly flexible
    and easy to deploy in vast areas. It also allows considerable agility in terms
    of deployment and maintenance with remote access from anywhere and anytime. Several
    standards and protocols are deployed in our proposed system in a full-duplex mode,
    such as WIFI (IEEE802.11), NRF24L01, and Bluetooth. Furthermore, the system is
    open-source, enabling its smooth upgrade and supporting new technologies such
    as the extension to wireless technologies 2G/3G/4G, Lora, LPWAN, Zigbee (IEEE802.15.4),
    and Sigfox. Comparison between these protocols is shown in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison
    between wireless transmission protocols. The proposed system supports a connection-oriented
    transmission mode for reliable transmission or connection-less mode to enhance
    network connectivity. Wire communication is also deployed in our system architecture
    to present the different use cases and scenarios the system can handle regardless
    of data transmission medium. 2.1.3. Presentation Layer [Front-End] The presentation
    layer is responsible for reports presentation through formatted data. The designed
    user-friendly GUI is compatible with different platforms such as tablets, phones,
    and laptops. The collected data support the creation and enhancement of the AI-based
    model for weather forecasting. The design of the presentation layer takes into
    consideration several vital metrics such as: Data visibility: to ensure a high
    level of clarity that allows farmers and researchers to monitor, analyze and make
    smart in-depth decisions. Data accessibility: to provide an open and accessible
    data format that different system’s agents can explore for different use cases
    such as modeling, training, evaluation performance, etc. Ease of use: to ensure
    that different user roles can use our GUI comfortably. Thus, we make a baseline
    that different users should explore report overview in the 30s without compromising
    data quality. System attractiveness: to create a dynamic and appealing GUI with
    an attractive and balanced design. System alerts: to monitor the evolution of
    the critical parameters closely and provide timely alerts through different channels
    such as emails and telegram chat-bot. Due to the energy limitations in different
    IoT nodes, we have chosen to rely on lightweight protocols within the presentation
    layer, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and The Message-Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT). HTTP is one of the most popular internet protocols for web messaging
    that runs over TCP protocol. It is based on request and response architecture
    [34]. MQTT is a lightweight bandwidth-efficient protocol designed specifically
    for IoT use cases [35]. 2.1.4. Management Layer [Front-End] The management layer
    is the central part of the agro-weather station. It provides real-time centralized
    data monitoring of the BS and different network elements. The layer continuously
    collects several critical parameters of the base station for an optimized system
    operation. The main parameters provided by this layer are the processor load,
    RAM usage, traffic behaviors, network performance, and overall station health
    checks. The collection of these parameters is done in the background. In addition,
    the layer allows the remote configuration and monitoring of different thresholds
    for alerts. The maintenance users can access the management layer through the
    developed GUI. The access to the GUI is done via an installed end-to-end VPN tunnel
    from external networks, or locally through the BS LAN port or any device within
    the same local network. 2.1.5. Middleware Layer [Back-End] The middleware layer
    plays the role of the orchestrator entity within the base station, which allows
    it to create interfaces between: The deployed agents that are part of the perception
    layer and its different heterogeneous sensors and components. The presentation
    layer and its graphical presentation and reporting. The transmission layer and
    its protocols. The management layer and its operation and maintenance functionalities.
    The middleware layer allows fast deployment of different perception layers’ elements.
    In addition, this layer contains the database for different parameters management,
    cloud computing for the data and eventual models training, and the decision-making
    entity as illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 3. The middleware’s Multi-Agents. Since
    we have described the layers within the platform, we can present the mapping between
    these layers and main HW and SW functionalities. A holistic presentation is depicted
    in Table 3. Table 3. The HW and SW mapping towards layers. 2.2. System Implementation
    In the following, we focus on the end-to-end system design and implementation.
    For the agro-weather station design, the system is broken down into modules for
    a better-controlled approach. 2.2.1. Hardware Design In this section, we detail
    the different elements that constitute our agro-weather station as depicted in
    Figure 4. We address the different components such as the base station, the remote
    sensors, the microcontroller, the power supply, the radio frequency, and the cloud.
    Figure 4. The high level block diagram of the agro-weather station. The base station:
    We use a raspberry pi 4 model B based on a Broadcom BCM2835 system-on-a-chip (SoC).
    The Soc is based on a quad-core 64-bit Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) Cortex-A72
    processor running at 1.5 GHz and a 4 Gb LPDDR4 RAM. The Cortex-A72 processor is
    one of the high-performance and low-power processors that implement ARMv8 architectures.
    The BS supports 802.11 Wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, 2 micro-HDMI displays up to
    4K resolution, 1 Gigabit Ethernet port, and 28 GPIOs supporting UART, I2C, SPI
    protocols. The designed BS supports radio frequency communication through an external
    NRF24L01 chip configured as a master. The remote sensors: We chose to have wireless
    deployed nodes that are based on the ATmega32U4 microcontroller unit (MCU). The
    nodes operate on a 5 V to 9 V power range. The high-performance Microchip microcontroller
    is an 8-bit AVR RSC-based that operates on a voltage range of 1.8 V to 5.5 V.
    The MCU combines a read-while-write 32 KB ISP Flash memory, a 1024 B EEPROM, 2
    KB SRAM and 23 I/O. The MCU supports UART, SPI, and I2C. The MCU can operate under
    extreme weather condition that varies between −40 °C to 84 °C [36]. The designed
    node supports WiFi through an ESP8266 chip and radio frequency communication through
    the NRF 24L01. The MCU supports up to 126 RF channels with GFSK modulation, which
    allows a data rate up to 2 Mbps. When a high data rate is configured, the NRF24L01
    allows the configuration of different saving techniques such as sleep mode and
    standby mode [37]. Sensors: To continuously survey meteorological data, keep the
    low architecture cost and align with the initial system specifications. We have
    chosen to deploy the sensors that respect the technical specification illustrated
    in Figure 4. Capital expenses: To make the agro-weather station affordable for
    the end-users, the strategy of the design consists of relying on scalable open
    source components and migrating HW-based services to SW-based services whenever
    it is possible. The idea behind this migration is to lower our cost while keeping
    the same functionalities that HW offers. The migration can be seen in: The deployment
    of Telegram Bot messaging services instead of cellular messaging for alert generation.
    The use of remote accessible web-based services for data visualization instead
    of local screen. Tools such as Grafana and Chart.JS library. However, even though
    the migration philosophy is prioritized, the end-to-end hardware architecture
    is fully open and supports any future upgrade or modernization. The entire system
    cost is given in Table S2 (see Supplementary Materials). Operating expenses: While
    capital expenses are invested in the project startup to accommodate the solution,
    the Operating Expenses (Opex) represents the day-to-day expenses to run the platform.
    These expenses can be seen as the fixed costs that need to be ensured to operate
    the system. Since the system deployment will be a win-win relationship between
    farmers and researchers, who will be playing the role of system maintainers. The
    farmers will benefit from customized data for their crops and fields, while researchers
    will collect in-depth geographic-related environmental data for their uses. Data
    that can be explored to understand the study area. The OPEX related to the power
    consumption is negligible due to the minimal power usage and the low price of
    energy. In a country like Morocco, the KWh cost is less than $ 0.12 . In [38],
    authors present an in-depth analysis on different board models under different
    scenarios, study shows that the consumed power of an Arduino Uno board in single-byte
    transmission over Xbee S2B module is around 1.04 W using microwatt-meter. The
    power consumption of the Raspberry PI 4 B board in full load is around 7.6 W,
    while it is 2.25 W in idle mode. An extensive study has been done in [39] for
    a similar Raspberry board (PI 3 B+). The OPEX breakdown is provided in Table S3
    (see Supplementary Materials). 2.2.2. Software Design The system performance,
    agility, and security are among many metrics chosen to assess the scalability
    of our agro-weather station. Therefore, in this session, we address the system’s
    software design approach and methodology as they are critical components in the
    system’s operation. System architecture: Since one of our goals is system interoperability,
    two architecture scenarios can be deployed—virtualization for hardware abstraction
    and containerization for system abstraction Figure 5. Virtualization consists
    of deploying virtual machines (VM) with a dedicated operating system (OS) within
    the base station. It is possible based on a physical allocation of hardware resources
    such as memory, storage, and network. However, the approach has many drawbacks
    on system scalability and performance due to the boot-up process, system speed,
    cost of implementation, system dependencies, software updates, networking overheads,
    and virtual machine size. Thus, to deliver the system in an agile methodology
    and minimize HW and SW resources, we chose the containerization scenario that
    performs the virtualization to the OS side and allows the ease of modules maintenance
    without compromising the continuous integration of services and modules. The authors
    in [40], provides a performance analysis of the two technologies based on the
    CPU performance, Disk I/O, and other metrics. Figure 5. Virtualization versus
    containerization. We chose to implement a containerization approach to separate
    the deployed software architecture from the hardware infrastructure. By adopting
    this approach, we were able to deliver the system quickly. Even though several
    open-source operating systems are customized to run on Raspberry Pi, such as kali
    Linux, Windows 10 IoT Core, Ubunto core, and Pidora. We chose to run over an optimized
    and stable Debian image called Raspbian. The Raspbian open-source operating system
    (OS) has multiple advantages, such as being very optimized to be run on Advanced
    RISC Machines (ARM), a family of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures
    for computer processors that is extremely suitable for System on Chips (SoCs)
    such as Raspberry Pi. The OS is subject to continuous development, and it has
    a very active community for excellent support. All implemented services act as
    standalone services. Thus, the development and integration of different services
    can be done independently from technological bounds. The product development life
    cycle approach allows continuous improvement of the OS’ products and services
    through 4 main stages: OS’ introduction, OS’ growth, OS’ maturity, and OS’ decline.
    Even though it is possible to create containers without a specific toolkit, however
    in our work we use Docker since it is a fully open-source containerization platform
    that allows mounting container’s image efficiently. Docker allows us to build,
    deploy, upgrade, and manage containers in a simple and straightforward commands’
    approach command-line interface (CLI). Another important component deployed is
    the Portainer tool that allows the same tasks through a lightweight management
    Graphical User Interface. Portainer plays the role of self-service container manager,
    it allows managing all containers hosted within Docker and grants the privilege
    of registration of new containers such as OpenVPN, influxDB, etc. It also allows
    the quick setup of different containers functionalities such as making a container
    open or secure, public or private within a network which allows the interoperability,
    scalability, and ease of use in the Operation and Management of the local base
    station. Data base: When developing scalable systems, the choice of the type of
    databases is very crucial for the end-to-end system design, especially in the
    back-end design, where real-time data storage and data retrieval are important.
    Several types of databases are used in data management, such as relational and
    time series. While traditional relational databases are fully supported by SQL
    and perform incredibly in displaying large datasets, it performs poorly regarding
    the history of the stored data. Thus, the time series databases (TSDB) such as
    the open-source InfluxDB are considered very scalable and efficient when handling
    time-series data [41]. In our system, we use a container-based image of influx
    DB for different time-series parameters. Dedicated agents ensure data storage
    of different wireless nodes in the database. Local Web server: To manage local
    web-based content such as images, scripts, and HTML files and allow a local web-based
    interaction between BS and different web users, we have deployed a local web server
    based on the open-source Apache. The server serves different technologies such
    as HTML, CSS, HTTP, and PHP. The apache server hosts the complete version of the
    website and local applications and databases. When an automated script needs to
    be executed according to planning it is not the local webserver that does that
    but rather it is the OS that executes it. This can be needed when measurements
    need to be sent to the Colab server for model training, the Cronjob sends all
    measurements that are on InfluxDB to Google drive (updating an existing excel).
    Colab then gets the link from Google drive and recovers the data and runs the
    modeling. Once the model is obtained Colab is then converting it to “tflite” and
    storing it on Drive. The model then is sent back to BS to be used in the local
    server within the BS. The local server runs the “tflite” model from TensorFlow
    and embeds it within the local website as depicted in Figure 6. Figure 6. Overview
    on Docker’s containers and interaction with cloud and Colab. MQTT Brocker: MQTT
    is an OASIS-recognized Internet of Things communications protocol. It’s built
    as a super-lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is perfect for
    linking different IoT devices with minimal network resources. MQTT is now used
    in many industries, including automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, etc.
    Within our base station, we deploy the open-source container-based broker named
    Mosquitto that runs MQTT 3.1.1 version. Once the sensor nodes (clients) are configured
    and pointing to the server broker, all clients can broadcast messages (publisher
    mode) or receive messages (subscriber mode). The communication is done without
    a direct point-to-point connection between publisher and subscriber. The configured
    client in our platform is an ESP32-based wireless sensor node. The broker doesn’t
    store the received data and sends it directly to the time-series database. Configuration:
    Since the base station is based on Debian distribution, we can run our script
    using, literally, any programming language. However, to be consistent, we have
    chosen to configure components using either shell (SH), C/C++ language, Python,
    or Node-RED. All cronjob scripts for automation are created based on SH. Meanwhile,
    all remote nodes such as ESP32, Arduino micro, Arduino Uno, and ESP8266 are configured
    using C++ languages. Additionally, the scripting within the Bs such as remote
    connection with Google drive, Chatbot, local sensing is done based on Python.
    Finally, the interaction between the base station and Mosquitto, influxDB, external
    wireless nodes are done through Node-RED. Node-RED is a visual programming tool
    that was originally developed by IBM for connecting hardware devices, APIs, and
    web services as part of the Internet of Things. Node-RED includes a flow editor
    that is used to construct JavaScript functions in a web browser. Node-RED run-time
    is built on top of NODE.js. Cloud: The data storage model in our architecture
    is based on a hybrid approach where local and cloud-based storage is implemented.
    Locally, the BS station stores data on the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and SDCard. The
    process is also ensured through simultaneous use of the storage as a Service (STaaS)
    cloud computing model to transfer and backup the critical measurement data, such
    as Dropbox, Google Drive, and One Drive. The data backup process is ensured based
    on a pre-configured agent in a cronjob on the BS. The service is deployed to serve
    as backup to ensure any data restoration in case it is planned. The multiple data
    duplication strategies are designed to protect the system against data loss or
    corruption and ensure that the BS services’ availability is guaranteed. We use
    the cloud also as a “Platform as a Service” (PaaS) to run our web-based server
    on which the website and different BS services are hosted. The could is being
    accessed remotely for a read-only mode. For security reasons we don’t allow real-time
    data consultation except through the VPN which requires pre-generated certificates.
    Meanwhile, other users may need to consult historic data, but still, they aren’t
    granted VPN access and they aren’t onsite to connect locally, for this reason,
    we have created a separate entity which is the cloud. The cloud hosts our website
    www.ensem-aws.tk which is an offline version of the local server deployed on the
    base station. The base station has unidirectional communication with the cloud
    which means only BS can push snapshots of the data (measurement and dashboards)
    but reversed communication is not allowed. Different service providers propose
    cloud services as public, private and hybrid solutions, providers such as Amazon
    Web service, Microsoft Azure, and Google cloud are the market’s leaders. In our
    work, we use Namecheap cloud services for the hosting, the choice is driven by
    the cost-effectiveness strategy. However, the created services are not related
    to any vendor, and migration between cloud services is easy with the right set-up
    (DNS configuration). VPN access: One of the crucial metrics is the platform security
    and its immunity to external access and attacks such as Denial of Service attacks
    DOS or Distributed DOS (DDOS). Since the BS is a lightweight server that needs
    to be optimized for resource deployment and usage, we configure a virtual private
    network (VPN) for secure connection establishment. The VPN allows the creation
    of end-to-end private tunnels between clients and the server, allowing external
    users to access the BS through open yet dedicated ports. In our BS, we implemented
    OpenVPN, one of the robust open-source VPN servers that support Secure Socket
    Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. The secured channels
    are established by creating a Full-tunnel where all clients’ traffic is directed
    through the VPN tunnel or the split tunnel where the only specified type of traffic
    is redirected. The tool supports IPv6 for the virtual private networks and can
    be executed over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP). OpenVPN supports up to 500 VPN certificates generation and 100 tunnels
    connection at the same time. The certificates are deployed on the end user’s clients’
    accounts. GUI: The Graphical User Interface is deployed for a human-to-machine
    graphical environment. It is designed in a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach,
    where the end-users needs are prioritized, and restless re-adapting is applied.
    The GUI can be seen as a set of web services and applications hosted on an Apache
    webserver. The web application is organized into different sections with different
    dynamic pages such as the home page, login page, weather dashboard, BS maintenance
    dashboard, and contact page. The dashboards are customized to display different
    parameters within different time ranges. Data presentation is dynamic, and users
    can specify the time range and frequency of data updates such as 1 s, 5 s, and
    10 min. GUI is mainly built on top of Grafana and Chart.JS library for the embedded
    part within the local website. 2.2.3. Neural Network Model Weather forecasting
    or prediction can be seen as the application of various techniques to predict
    meteorological parameters. Many techniques are used in the literature by different
    researchers, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Machine learning’s popularity
    comes from its ability to identify the most relevant features within an appropriate
    model. Various approaches are used, like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN), or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Since meteorological
    data is considered as a non-linear multidimensional time series problem [42] the
    adopted network model has to reflect the temporal features within the dataset
    [43]. Thus, the long-term and short-term model (LSTM), introduced by [44] is one
    of the best approaches to deal with weather forecasting. We use a Recurrent Neural
    Network System (RNN) that supports time series as inputs in our system. The usage
    of LSTM in models building and training allows us to have greater accuracy. In
    our work, the trained LSTM model enables training and forecasting future data
    based on historical multi-variate time series (sequential data). A brief description
    of LSTM structure and workflow is given in Supplementary Part IV (see Supplementary
    Materials). 2.2.4. Dataset for Model Building We collect multivariate weather
    data from the weather station of Mohammad V International Airport in the city
    of Casablanca, Morocco as presented in Figure 7. Figure 7. Geographic location
    of the study area (Casablanca, Morocco). The collected dataset includes different
    features such as minimum and maximum temperature, pressure, wind speed, and dew
    point. The dew point presents the temperature at which the air becomes saturated
    with moisture [45]. The summary of data features is presented in Table 4. However,
    to extract the most relevant features useful for model building, we use feature
    selection based on heatmap as one of the crucial concepts in machine learning.
    The feature selection will allow our model to reduce the overfitting, reduce the
    training time, and improve accuracy. Table 4. Data feature of the our model. The
    collected data covers a daily measurement from the 1st of January 1981 till the
    29th of January 2021 Figure 8. The dataset contains 14 features of 14.638 measurements.
    Figure 8. Exemplary plots of Temperature range, Temperature dew point, Temperature
    Max, Temperature Min, Temperature, Precipitation, Humidity, Relative humidity,
    Pressure, Wind speed range, Wind speed Max, Wind speed Min, Wind speed. After
    analyzing the multi-variate historical data, it was clear that the correlation
    between temperature (mean), Temperature range, Temperature dew, temperature max,
    and Temperature min is very high. Thus we only keep the temperature (mean) and
    delete other features to decrease the overfitting. Further details on the features’
    correlation heatmap are illustrated in Supplementary Part V (see Supplementary
    Materials). 2.2.5. Model Accuracy The model’s performance is assessed through
    the computation of different traditional statistical metrics such as the Mean
    Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) and the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSE). Additionally,
    we use the index of agreement [46] to separate the RMSE into unsystematic and
    systematic components [47,48]: RMSE, MASE: The calculation of the Root Mean Square
    Deviation (RMSE) represents the square root of the average of squared errors.
    It is mainly computed to measure the deviation between the actual values and the
    prediction values to define the accuracy of different models. The MASE was proposed
    in [49] as an assessment technique to define the accuracy of forecasts in regression
    models. As a mean absolute approach, MASE uses the ratio of errors which is allowing
    it to be independent of the scale of the forecaster. The RMSE and the MASE can
    be calculated following the equations: RMSE= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑋 ̂  𝑖 − 𝑋 𝑖 ) 2 −
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (1) MASE= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 | 𝑋 ̂  𝑖 − 𝑋 𝑖 | ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 | 𝑋
    𝑖−𝑠 − 𝑋 𝑖 | (2) where 𝑋 ̂  is the predicted value associated with the actual value
    X, and n is the size of the dataset. The larger the MASE and the RMSE mean, the
    enormous difference between the predicted and actual values, while the smaller
    the MASE and the RMSE mean, the closer the prediction values to the actual values.
    Index of Agreement: The Willmott’s index of agreement [46], 𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 , measures
    the model’s relative accuracy in a range that varies from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating
    no agreement between the model predicted values and real observations and 1 indicating
    a perfect fit [50]. The index can be computed following the equation: 𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥
    =1− ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑋 𝑖 − 𝑋 ̂  ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 (| 𝑋 ̂  − 𝑋 ¯ |+| 𝑋 𝑖 − 𝑋 ̂  ¯ |) 2 ,0≤ 𝑑
    𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 ≤1 (3) where X is the real measured values associated to the predicted values
    𝑋 ̂  , 𝑋 ¯ is the average value of the measurements, and 𝑋 ̂  ¯ is the average
    value of the predicted measurements. 3. Results 3.1. System Workflow In agreement
    with our expectations, the overall system design acted to minimize the human need
    for agro-weather station programming or maintenance. Thus, platform allows remote
    supervision and efficient automation to address this need. The deployed node follows
    a plug-and-play approach, in which the BS listens continuously to old and detects
    any new nodes under MQTT or NRF24L01 networks. Once a new node has its pre-loaded
    firmware, it starts sensing and transmitting data to the BS. The BS receives the
    traffic and ensures data is stored locally to the InfluxDB database for eventual
    analysis. The aggregated traffic from NRF24L01 and MQTT networks is transferred
    to the cloud service based on a cronjob program’s automated script. The cronjob
    under the Raspbian operating system allows the execution of specific scripts in
    specific time and frequency ranges. The Local server ensures data presentation
    from the linked database and presents this data under dynamic web pages that are
    locally hosted. The data is also synchronized with the cloud-based server for
    open access. Alerts are configured for cognitive and context-aware monitoring.
    Several agents continuously monitor specific thresholds in a parallel way. Once
    a threshold is reached, system alerts are generated to the BS’ admin user in emails
    and telegram messages. Different user roles are created to allow different levels
    of data consulting from the dynamic website. Furthermore, for Operation And Maintenance
    (OAM) purposes, remote access to the different BS functionalities and programs
    is ensured throughout the deployed VPN server and the installed clients on the
    end-users devices such as phones, tablets, and laptops. The pre-generated VPN
    profiles are mandatory to allow the VPN tunnels establishment. Additional certificates
    could be generated locally or remotely based on the GUI VPN manager. Additionally,
    the aggregated data is framed and added to the historically collected data from
    the international Mohammed V airport weather station. The concatenated file is
    hosted on a google drive service that is continuously linked to the Colab environment
    for model training and predictions. The end-to-end workflow is depicted in Figure
    9. Figure 9. The network’s communication workflow. 3.2. Experimental Results 3.2.1.
    System’s Performance For experimental purposes, we have tested our system in the
    laboratory and in the field. Different scenarios were applied to monitor the agro-weather
    station performance and behavior. We have also deployed the end-to-end portable
    system in an outdoor open wheat field for a real use case study Figure 10. The
    prototype has been operating for approximately 8 h in a 5-ha farm in Casablanca,
    Morocco for environment monitoring and continuous data collecting. Several scenarios
    were applied to test the BS security level, such as remote access using VPNs,
    on-site access through LAN network, and SSH access through WiFi. The BS monitored
    its different parameters for 8 h and provided through the designed GUI several
    clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and data for end-users in an appealing
    dynamic interface as presented in Figure 11. The web-based GUI, based on Grafana,
    provides different dynamic figures and charts to reflect the BS’ behaviors in
    terms of different metrics. Each figure is included within a re-sizable block,
    giving specific users the right to change the specific time frame, resize the
    block, or even change the position of the entire element. The GUI allows the end-users
    to filter through a specific time range or configure dashboard updates’ frequency.
    It also allows the configuration of alerts based on predefined thresholds. The
    re-configurable dashboard was divided into multi sections for different purposes
    such as quick information, detailed health check, and network performance. The
    quick KPIs embed the critical data such as CPU and GPU temperature, CPU usage,
    RAM usage, and overview on threads and processes were accessible within the fixed
    30 s as predefined in the initial baseline. A detailed health check section was
    created to support the operation and maintenance needs by presenting a detailed
    evolution of different parameters through time, metrics such as CPU load, Memory
    load, Processes, network usage, and network packets, furthermore network performance
    metrics such as load average, network errors, and network drops were introduced
    to assist maintenance users during troubleshooting or root cause analysis if any
    specified behavior. Other parameters such as Disk read/write load, time, and count
    was introduced to track the BS storage behavior. Since the dashboard is embedded
    within the local and the cloud-based website, it is compatible with different
    end-user devices such as phones (IOS, android) and laptops (Mac, Windows, Linux).
    The dashboard’s dynamicity and responsiveness make it adaptable with different
    screen sizes. It allows it to behave and perform like a desktop application. Figure
    10. The agro-weather station in a field in Casablanca, Morocco. Figure 11. The
    agro-weather station dashboard. During the experimentation phase, different agents
    were performing different activities and monitoring multiple metrics. Most of
    the station’s KPIs were below thresholds. The CPU temperature, GPU temperature
    was below 58 °C, while the CPU load was continuously under 75% (average of 45%)
    which allows the protection of the station resources. However, due to the operational
    multi-agents, the number of created processed was typically high reaching 300.
    The memory load was always under 2.8 Gb. Throughout the simulation, remote access
    using VPNs was tested several times which explains the multi-spikes in the network
    usage graph. Data were continuously transferred from the BS to local and external
    HDD which is tracked by the disk I/O requests and volume. An offline version of
    the dashboard can also be consulted through the secured online portal https://ensem-aws.tk/
    using the limited access credential login=“test” and password=“Azerty1+”, current
    snapshots are captured on 13th April 2021. The online portal contains an offline
    stored version of different parameters in a specific period. Synchronization can
    be done periodically through a synchronization agent in form of a cronjob. 3.2.2.
    System’s Security The access to local nodes is limited by using credentials. However,
    it is known that remote accessibility is a crucial feature in any modern system
    especially with the emerging Covid-19 pandemic. In our system, remote access doesn’t
    only allow different users to avoid on-site presence to consult data, but it provides
    also access anytime, from anywhere using any device to connect remotely to the
    base station and its components. As a result, allowing enormous cost savings.
    Meanwhile, the remote access functionality comes always with security challenges
    and threats such as: DDOS attacks. Phishing attacks Password sharing. Vulnerable
    backups. Leakage of information. Therefore, a secured end-to-end connection is
    always required before any data consultation. To address this challenge an open-source
    low-cost VPN solution is implemented. Different certifications are generated per
    user profile. Once a user wants to connect from an external network, the client
    application connects to the server application to establish the end-to-end tunnel.
    In Figure 12 we can connect to our local private network from a public external
    network through the established tunnels. Once the VPN is activated, we can access
    any node within the network with IP address 192.168.x.x using only basic credentials.
    Figure 12. Remote access to the agro-weather station using VPN. 3.2.3. Weather
    Monitoring The sensor nodes implemented within the farm collect continuous environmental
    data through the locally deployed sensors. The aggregated data is then forwarded
    in the form of JSON block to the base station. The Json block represents a series
    of JSON files in a specific time range. The data is transmitted via different
    transmission mediums (wired, wireless) and based on different protocols (NRF24L01,
    WIFI). The Figure 13 illustrates the plot of the temperature and the humidity
    recorded within 8h of environmental monitoring. From the readings, the temperature
    records show a continuous upward trend. The values continuously rise in a range
    between 15 °C and 25 °C. However, the humidity reading shows a continual downward
    trend. The humidity values decrease between 100% in the morning down to 40% in
    the evening. Even though the measurement reflects only 8 h of records, the extensive
    sensing through the year can be extremely useful for the farmers and researchers
    through the following: Figure 13. Temperature and humidity records of the agro-weather
    station. Assist in understanding the various effects of temperature and humidity
    on plants and crop productivity. Adapt the crop type (wheat, oats, potatoes, etc.)
    based on the period. Select the seed quality based on the season. Select and trigger
    automation action (e.g., irrigation) based on a set of parameters (e.g., temperature
    threshold). Select the best time for proper soil preparation. Prevent plants damaging
    by choosing the best timing (high humidity and temperature) to apply pesticides,
    since treatments should be applied in early to allow foliage to dry before reaching
    29–32 °C [51] Due to their significance as ecological controls, the wind speed
    and direction are very important metrics that should be considered by smart farming.
    The analyzed collected data can help farmers and researchers through: Lower production
    costs through the usage of the right wind turbines for electricity generation.
    Increase crops profits. Understand the impact of winds on plants and crop production
    (plants seeding, damaging, etc.) Secure reliable data for implementation of customized
    ML algorithms for dedicated farming fields. In Figure 14 we present the wind rose
    that illustrates the distribution of wind speed and wind direction in the monitoring
    period. Detailed wind speed readings are plotted in Figure 15. The plot shows
    that the dominant wind direction is between North-northwest and the North with
    17% of 4 to 8 km/h and 10% of wind with speed between 8 and 12 km/h and 5% of
    wind in a range of 12 to 16 km/h. Figure 14. Wind speed, direction and distribution
    of the agro-weather station. Figure 15. Wind speed records of the agro-weather
    station. To summarize, smart farming cannot be achieved if it is not supported
    by reliable data and automation of recurrent activities such as monitoring and
    control. Thus, to select and apply the best crop management practices, we should
    be able to understand the evolution and impact of the meteorological parameters
    on the plants and on the productivity of any studied field. The proposed agro-weather
    station in this paper doesn’t only allow different users to monitor their crops
    on a real-time basis but also decreases human activities and improves the adoption
    of new technologies in the agriculture field. Our tailored system allows real-time
    data that can support real-time decisions. 3.2.4. LSTM Model Implementation and
    Validation To train our LSTM model we used the popular Python package named “Keras”
    which is embedded within TensorFlow. Applying the right hyperparameters is crucial
    for an optimized model before any learning process. Thus, an initial parameterization
    has been implemented and adjusted based on the model outcomes. The key optimized
    parameters were the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes within each layer,
    the number of epochs, and the learning rate. The initial setup relies on the Mohammed
    V airport base station’s data to build a reliable LSTM based model for weather
    forecasting. However, after a predefined period, data from the local base station
    is used and concatenated with the historical data to keep the model updated with
    the latest measurement. Meanwhile, since our initial dataset analysis shows some
    missing and abnormal observations at different time slots, we proceed with data
    pre-processing through removing the entire daily record for missing data. However,
    we keep the abnormal measurements (outliers) to measure the robustness and performance
    of the model through its ability to provide a good prediction. For model building,
    the data is split into three subsets, 70% of data is reserved for the training,
    while 20% is dedicated for validation, and finally, 10% is for the testing. In
    the implementation of our model, we used 2 hidden layers which have been enough
    to avoid unnecessary model complications while being able to detect complex features.
    The layers were powered up by 50 neurons in each. The learning batch size was
    tested using 5, 10, and 100 days, while the learning rate was initially set to
    0.1. Meanwhile, for the loss function, we have chosen the mean squared error,
    while the used model’s optimizer is Adam. Additionally, we used sigmoid and tanh
    as the activation functions. The simulations are performed on a cloud using the
    Colab platform from Google. The implemented algorithms used Tensorflow platform
    and Keras as main library to train and test the performance of our models. After
    each round the RMSE, the MASE, and Willmott’s index are computed. The learning
    curve in Figure 16 presents the plot of the computed standard deviations against
    the number of the epoch. The model has been trained during 30 epochs, Even though
    the network was training itself in 30th epochs, it is clear that in our training
    process, the MASE and RMSE were minimal in the 5th epochs with a value of 0.0012
    and 0.034 respectively, however Willmott’s index was around 0.987 with space of
    improving. The optimum values were in Epoch 10 with minimal MASE, RMSE, and Willmott’s
    with values of 0.0012, 0.0034, and 0.988 respectively. The MASE and RMSE minimum
    remain stable throughout the epochs, and Willmott’s index stabilizes at 0.987.
    Figure 16. Presentation of MASE-based and RMSE-based and Willmott’s-based training
    curve. The Records’ deviation in Figure 17, and the real temperature versus predicted
    are plotted in Figure 18. The prediction of our LSTM model is plotted for 1 month,
    1 year, and 8 years from April-2013 till April-2021. The prediction values are
    based on a trained model with 32 years of historical data, which possibly captures
    the ongoing effects of climate change. The visual comparison in Figure 18 shows
    that the LSTM model is performing well. The prediction trends follow almost the
    training trends in the overall plot with a mean of residual values over the 8
    years around 0.59 °C. Further details on model validation are presented in Supplementary
    Part VI (see Supplementary Materials). Figure 17. Prediction deviation vs. number
    of records. Figure 18. Model validation—Muli-timeframe temperature prediction.

    Discussion 4.1. Design Issues Compared to any other field, IoT systems have different
    bottlenecks that aren’t only slowing down the adoption of such solutions but they
    are dragging more attention by scientific communities through several contributions.
    In [14,15] the authors describe the most common challenges in IoT solutions for
    agriculture. Challenges such as resources optimization, cost analysis, lack of
    knowledge of technology, quality of service, security, and networking. Below we
    address most of these challenges. 4.2. Comparison with Other Existing Systems
    Even though various solutions have been presented under different research outputs.
    However, to the best of our knowledge, the current solutions suffer from different
    bottlenecks that impact not only the adoption of such platforms but also the massive
    penetration within small farms. Challenges that are linked to the systems’ cost,
    ease of use, automation capabilities, operation & maintenance, security, and even
    remote access and usage of artificial intelligence. We believe that there is no
    perfect system, and we are convinced that there is always a space for the system’s
    enhancement and adaptation to different use cases. In the following, we compare
    the results from similar works based on the most common challenges such as resources’
    optimization, cost analysis, quality of services, networking challenges, artificial
    intelligence, operation and maintenance, remote accessibility, and security: Resources’
    optimization: Our proposed work relies on a fully containerized architecture,
    where services are not only lightweight but scalable, agile, and portable. This
    makes the agro-weather station’s full software architecture manageable and reproducible
    within a very short amount of time. It allows us to have very reliable and optimized
    micro-services such as local web server, time-series database, VPN server, etc
    that consume wisely the BS’s resources such as CPU, memory, and network as presented
    in Figure 11. Meanwhile, all the studied works in this article [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59]
    are based on classical low-performance system on chips (SoCs) in designing and
    implementing station. The used SoCs such as Arduino microcontroller doesn’t support
    multitasking such as Raspberry Pi micro-computer, which limit the performance
    of the stations to basic monitoring tasks. Cost analysis: In our work, we provide
    an Opex and Capex deep analysis to support the cost-effectiveness approach targeted
    in this work. Thus, we estimated the cost of investment to build the agro-weather
    station at 176 $ as depicted in Section 2.2.1. While, works presented in [22,25,26,30,57,58,59]
    have claimed development of a low-cost-based system for smart farming, meanwhile
    no one of these contributions has provided a detailed operation based analysis
    and capital based costing. Quality of services: When studying the literature,
    we can see that there is a huge limitation when it comes to the deployment of
    a fully multi-agent-based architecture in systems’ design. In [28] the author
    presents a logical tailored approach for multi-user architecture design. In [21,22,23],
    the authors proposed the deployments of advisory systems either for early disease
    detection or crop productivity management. However, the proposed works focus on
    the design of a generic prototype rather than a customized approach relevant to
    each user type. Meanwhile, our system tries to provide different features adapted
    to different users based on real use-cases. Remote access to engineers and researchers,
    temperature forecasting for farmers and researchers, data security for all users
    are all standalone agents within the BS. Each agent ensures the utility and warranty
    of its functions and services. Networking: We address the networking challenge
    based on fully agile architecture embedding different heterogeneous nodes. Our
    system supports multiple protocols for backbone transmission protocols such as
    (MQTT, NRF24L01, LAN). The platform is also extended for other protocols. Additionally,
    we create a system that supports plug-and-play nodes as described in Section 3.1.
    In our platform, we experiment with the proposed transmission protocols through
    the end-to-end monitoring ecosystem. Meanwhile, only [25] presents an adaptive
    mechanism for reliable smart farming. However, the technique is only dealing with
    an isolated scope which is transmission without validating the system by an end-to-end
    smart farming platform. While, other contributions rely on singe transmission
    protocol such as in [20,22,23,52,55,56,57,58,59] or don’t even support wireless
    transmission such as in [21,24]. Artificial Intelligence: AI becomes a necessity
    in modern applications and services. In our system, we deploy a high-performing
    LSTM model part of RNN for temperature forecasting. The deployed model as depicted
    in Section 3.2.3 shows a high-level performance in temperature prediction which
    allows the possibility to train and deploy similar models for other meteorological
    data such as humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc. In our system, we propose the
    hybrid data collection where historical data is continuously enhanced by the BS
    itself for a continuous model’s improvement. The BS supports tasks automation
    in form of cronjob and through a standalone deployed agent for alerts notification.
    The proposed work in [54] proposes a temperature foresting model based on ANN
    (Artificial Natural Network), meanwhile, it is known that the ANN is less powerful
    than the RNN (adopted in this paper). ANN doesn’t support the recurrent connections
    and is considered to be powerful with tabular data and text data rather than the
    sequence data which we have in meteorological parameters. Additionally, in [21,22,23]
    the authors create advisory systems for decision making. The proposed systems
    require a minimum level of knowledge, while in the developing countries the lack
    of technological awareness among farmers will be challenging for the usage of
    such systems. The same technological bottleneck is impacting the usage of AI within
    drones framework in crop management such as in [30,56]. In [53] authors only present
    a conceptual model that lacks testing and validation. Meanwhile, no AI implementation
    is considered in the works in [20,24,25,26,27,28,29,52,55,57,58,59]. Operation
    and Maintenance: The studied works in this effort focus on the system’s utility
    through the functionalities and services offered by the proposed platforms, rather
    than focusing on the warranty through the assurance that the developed platforms
    and services will deliver the needed requirements. Therefore, no system surveyed
    in this work offers the possibility to have a holistic dashboard for operation
    and maintenance. Thus, we have created a dedicated dashboard part of the management
    layer as presented in Section 3.1. The dashboard will allow users such as engineers
    to consult different performance metrics such as network usage and packet drops,
    CPU load, operating system’s threads, and processes, etc. continuously for management
    purposes. Remote access: None of the surveyed works in this study allows the possibility
    to have ultimate remote access to the deployed platform and its components. Only
    conceptual architecture with remote accessibility feature was proposed in [28]
    and partial data consultation was proposed in [54]. Meanwhile, as part of the
    system’s customization adopted in this work, we think that full remote accessibility
    allows tremendous ease of use and cost-saving when it comes to consulting the
    platform and the locally collected data. Thus, the proposed platform allows different
    users to connect remotely to the BS and consult all components through the GUI
    or the SSH sessions. Security: Even though smart farming isn’t a critical domain
    when it comes to data sensitivity. However, privacy in today’s world is a huge
    concern for different users. Remote access comes with privacy challenges. As mentioned
    in Section 2.2.2 and Section 3.2.2 our platform supports the establishment of
    end-to-end VPN tunnels that add an extra layer of privacy and security when using
    remote access. The deployed VPN server allows peers to connect using the pre-generated
    secret keys and certificates that are based on strong 256-bit encryption. Even
    with the high-security concerns especially in the Covid-19 period, none of the
    others experimental platforms address or implement any feature or approach for
    system’s and services’ security and reliability. A holistic comparison between
    our proposed system and the existing system is presented in Supplementary Part
    VII (see Supplementary Materials). In the table, we present the major advantages
    of the system and the major challenges that we detected during the review. We
    also categorize the platforms based on their validation. Additionally, we assess
    their cost-effectiveness based on deployed hardware and software. Finally, we
    categorized the usage of some features such as operation and maintenance, remote
    accessibility, and AI implementation. 5. Conclusions In this paper, we propose
    an end-to-end AI-powered IoT-based low-cost platform for smart farming. The main
    goal of the system’s creation is to support different users such as farmers and
    researchers to monitor, understand, and act for better crop management. The followed
    approach in system design enables the smooth system’s development and enhancement
    through its different iterations, releases, and versions. The platform design
    and development purpose are to propose a real-time context-aware system for continuous
    cognitive monitoring. Ease of use, portability, low cost, and robustness are among
    many metrics considered in the system’s design and implementation. The proposed
    HW and SW prototype was validated on the field and presented a high performance
    in different activities and operations such as real-time monitoring, temperature
    forecasting, scalable wireless connections, reliable dashboards, etc. Therefore,
    we think that our low-cost platform can help farmers and researchers to co-create
    value and to have an impact on crop management. Additionally, we believe that
    developed station stress on vital concepts that were missed in similar works such
    as remote accessibility, security, operation, and maintenance. However, we believe
    that there is a large space for development and system enhancement. Thus, to enhance
    the platform performance, our subsequent work will focalize on: Add more advanced
    functions to enhance the system performance, such as AI-based power management
    and fault detection agents. Design and create predefined test cases and scenarios
    that enable extreme ease of use and service for the enhancement of automation.
    Design AI-based mobility management that can be implemented to BS to reconfigure
    the platform without the need for human interaction. Migrate the solution to a
    pure native cloud and support more communication technologies like Lora, Sigfox,
    and NBIoT. Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be

    Preview 1. Soil Monitoring And Its Parameters Food system in large part starts
    from soil. Taking care of land soil is essential for secured and sustained supply
    of food. It is often taken for granted and is an important natural resource. Composition
    and nature of soil varies with change in geographical location and also with climate,
    animals, and plants feeding on them, the soil’s parent material, and soil’s age.
    Basic components of soil are Minerals, Water, dead organic matter, air, and living
    microorganisms. Continue Reading References Follow Reference Ayaz M. Ammad-Uddin

    modellingwater qualitywhole-farm Introduction Agriculture must drastically increase
    production efficiency to meet projected global food demand, which is forecast
    to increase by 100–110% over the period 2005–2050 (Tilman et al., 2011). Improving
    agricultural production to meet food, fuel, and fibre demands will require innovative
    technology applications driven by applied research in the agricultural, crop,
    engineering, environmental, soil, and social sciences. Ensuring global food security
    will likely be compounded by the occurrence of weather extremes related to climate
    change (Godfray et al., 2010; Tilman et al., 2011). The plant-soil continuum is
    essential for filtering water, sequestering carbon, storing/transferring energy,
    releasing oxygen and recycling nutrients. Interactions along this continuum provide
    an array of invaluable ecosystem services for civilization (Adhikari & Hartemink,
    2016; McBratney et al., 2014). Sustainable agriculture aims to harmonize economic,
    social, and environmental dimensions of production agriculture by managing farms
    to optimize profitability, agroecosystem services (food production, water purification,
    greenhouse gas sequestration) and soil resilience for future food security. Several
    practices (nutrient management, cover crops, reduced tillage,) can simultaneously
    increase yield potential, sequester carbon (C), and lower crop and environmental
    production risks (Fargione et al., 2018) with a change in management, rather than
    large capital investments. Agronomic and environmental performance measures The
    distribution of Earth''s terrestrial vegetation is intimately tied to climate
    and soils; plants and soils coevolve. Interactions among climate, parent material,
    biological organisms, topography, and time account for the wide variety and distribution
    of soils. While climate sets the stage for plant biomass productivity, localized
    soil characteristics play a critical role in determining crop productivity. With
    respect to agricultural crops, productivity is measured as crop yield potential
    which represents a crop-specific yield over a given time period for a given site
    (typically expressed as tons ha−1 yr−1). In the US, yield potentials are typically
    derived from long-term average for a given soil type. A related and important
    concept is economically optimum yield, which denotes a soil fertility level where
    additional application of specific nutrients is unlikely to increase yield potential
    during that growing season. The economic optimum yield approach is the basis for
    many US land grant university soil fertility guidelines. The concept of yield
    potential is critical for determining crop nutrient needs, particularly for large
    annual crops like maize and sugarcane that require copious N (Thorburn et al.,
    2017). Crop nutrient removal is the product of crop dry matter biomass yield and
    nutrient content at harvest (i.e. kg ha−1 yr−1). Crop nutrient uptake estimates
    are important for crop nutrient budgeting, and environmental risk assessment.
    Given that both over- and under-fertilization have economic and environmental
    consequences, and that fertilizer is one of the largest annual farm expenses,
    yield potential should be based on accurate farm records or another reliable data
    source (e.g. university and/or published industry research trials). Yield potential
    and field-specific soil testing to reveal fertility status (i.e. pH, organic C,
    labile soil phosphorus and potassium) are starting points for any nutrient management
    plan. Production agriculture has traditionally emphasized yield as the driving
    force behind crop management decisions. However, given high production costs,
    low/variable profit margins, more extreme weather patterns, and societal ecosystem
    service needs (food/fibre, clean air and water), both crop production and environmental
    efficiency indices are increasingly relevant. Environmental management is especially
    important for large dairy and livestock farms in the US, where detailed nutrient
    management plans aimed at mitigating water resource pollution are required by
    law. Nutrient use efficiency (NUE) is an important agri-environmental measure
    and represents the proportion of nutrient applied that is taken up by a crop in
    a growing season (i.e. [crop nutrient uptake/total appliednutrient] × 100). While
    conceptually simple, an array of biophysical factors and soil-plant-nutrient interactions
    affect NUE, leading to wide variability in published values (typically <50%).
    This is particularly characteristic of N due to its propensity for weather-driven
    hydrological loss mechanisms (leaching, plant uptake, volatilization, denitrification,
    microbial immobilization, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium). A
    particularly difficult challenge is developing effective mathematical models to
    better predict N availability and account for hydrologic-, management-, soil-,
    and weather-related factors affecting NUE and loss potential. Since it is unlikely
    that any one specific approach or method will be adequate, a combination of precision
    agriculture-based technology (models, remote sensing/geospatial tools, sensor
    networks, drones) and traditional agronomic fertility approaches (i.e. soil testing)
    are needed to effectively improve NUE. Nutrient management: monitoring to modelling
    A nutrient management plan specifies the amount, form, placement, and timing of
    crop nutrient applications in an effort to optimize yield potential and minimize
    sediment and nutrient loss to surface and groundwater. Along with developing proper
    crop nutrient needs based on yield potential and soil testing, site-specific field
    characteristics affecting loss potential (concentrated runoff flows/soil hydrology)
    must be identified and delineated on maps. In the US, the USDA-Natural Resources
    Conservation Service (NRCS) develops nutrient management practice standards for
    each state (Code 590). Farms must follow NRCS Code 590''s nutrient management
    practice standards if they receive state or federal grant funding or are regulated
    under the Clean Water Act''s Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (United States
    Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2015). Precision
    agriculture relies on global positioning systems (GPS) guidance to enable real-time
    crop yield/quality monitoring, variable rate fertilizer/agrichemical application,
    autonomous equipment navigation, and other field operations. Precision-based nutrient/agrichemical
    application and GPS-navigation for major field operations can improve NUE and
    are now commonplace on many large farms. Variable rate agrichemical, fertilizer,
    and lime applications are driven by field spatial variability and can be economically
    advantageous (Cassman, 1999; Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010). Given the importance of
    soils, weather, and hydrology on crop growth and nutrient losses and the multiple
    interacting variables governing nutrient fate and transport, predictive models
    of differing complexity can better account for the multiple dynamic processes
    affecting NUE. Collectively, modelling tools of varying complexity and scale offer
    the potential to better capture important dynamic processes affecting nutrient
    loss and help identify appropriate best practices to mitigate nutrient losses.
    Due to the complexity and global importance of the N cycle to food security and
    water quality, models are being developed to estimate real-time N dynamics and
    the need for supplemental fertilizer N in maize systems (Banger et al., 2017).
    Adapt-N is a dynamic, spatially explicit mass balance N model for maize systems
    developed at Cornell University (Sela et al., 2016, 2017, 2019). Its goal is to
    provide real-time soil N availability estimates to inform in-season N need decisions
    based on the probability of achieving an economic optimum yield. Adapt-N combines
    a maize growth model with a sophisticated soil-water N routine and operates on
    high-resolution weather data (5 by 5 km grid) to predict daily N supply, loss,
    and N need to be based on economic risk. While further testing is required, early
    studies suggest Adapt-N can increase NUE compared to more traditional, static-based
    tools (Sela et al., 2016, 2017, 2019). While soil/tissue testing and sensor-based
    technology are useful, they provide no information on weather-related processes
    controlling soil N dynamics (weather, soil type, mineralization, leaching, denitrification,
    crop uptake), and are therefore unable to adjust in-season N application rates
    accordingly. In the dairy and livestock industry, nutrition simulation models
    have been widely applied over the last 40 years to formulate animal diets for
    optimal milk/meat production and on-farm forage/nutrient utilization (Sniffen
    et al., 1992). Precision-feeding aims to model rumen fibre digestion kinetics
    based on animal nutrition requirements (for milk or beef production) based on
    animal biology (breed, age, stage of lactation, environmental factors) with the
    goal of optimizing animal NUE and farm economics. Next-generation whole-farm system
    models aim to simulate animal biology, waste production, cropping, water cycling,
    greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), soil nutrient cycling, and environmental risk
    (Kebreab et al., 2019). The Ruminant Farm Systems model (RuFaS) is an emerging,
    dynamic mass balance model designed to simulate all major dairy farm biophysical
    components including animal biology (water use, fibre intake/digestion, milk production,
    nutrient excretion, GHG emissions), soil-water nutrient dynamics (soil carbon,
    N, P, GHG emissions, runoff/erosion/leaching), and cropping dynamics (crop growth,
    fibre digestibility) (Sniffen et al., 1992; Vayssieres et al., 2009). The soil
    and crop submodule simulates soil-water relationships, crop growth (crops include
    maize, forages small grains, and pasture), nutrient uptake and residue decomposition.
    Ideally, RuFaS and other emerging farm system decision support tools will be applicable
    in a wide range of growing environments and packaged in user-friendly formats
    to facilitate more widespread use by not only researchers, but consultants, agency
    personnel and farmers. While RuFaS is still early in its development, it exemplifies
    a systems-based modelling approach focusing on improving crop and whole-farm NUE
    and reducing environmental risk. Predictive modelling relies on robust calibration/validation
    to assess model performance. Ultimately, modelling success per se depends squarely
    on reliable field data collection/analysis under a range of weather and field
    conditions. Validation with reliably collected field data is paramount to properly
    evaluate uncertainty and the full range of model limitations (Puntel et al., 2018).
    While beyond the scope here, the importance of model calibration/validation cannot
    be overstated and therefore more frequent field plot studies and edge-of-field
    runoff monitoring research will be critical going forward to properly gauge model
    uncertainty (Harmel et al., 2018a, 2018b). Conclusion Nutrient dynamics and management
    underpin many aspects of sustainable agriculture. Our ability to provide adequate
    but not excessive nutrients to crops and animals while mitigating pollutant fate
    and transport through strategic application of best practices is an increasingly
    important issue for agriculture. While local geography (specific soils) determines
    baseline crop yield and nutrient loss potentials, management practices either
    enhance or degrade these functions. Given the importance and complexity of agricultural
    systems, it is clear that continued development of systems modelling and advanced
    computational tools will play an important role in managing crop nutrients. Nutrient
    management is no longer confined to farm/field boundaries, but rather encompasses
    the farm-field-stream continuum, linking whole-farms and fields to surrounding
    air, surface, and groundwater. Going forward, simulation models should focus on
    site-specific factors and processes driving yield and NUE (weather, soils and
    site-specific cropping/soil management practices), including hydrology/connectivity
    to riparian areas and streams (Stutter et al., 2019; Tomer et al., 2013). Given
    the multiple challenges facing agriculture, there is an increasing need for more
    multidisciplinary research to accelerate development of predictive tools that
    can accommodate the wide range of data sources and complexity necessary to better
    predict agroecosystem nutrient dynamics and guide best practice implementation.

    Energy is required in all agricultural activities. Diagramming material flows
    needed by crop production systems supports the proper analysis of energy flows
    interactions within a system’s boundaries. The latter complemented with an economic
    analysis gives a clear view of how beneficial a new practice within a crop cycle
    is—in this case, the variable slope (VS) land leveling (LL) operation. VS is a

    crop profitability 1. Introduction Rice is one of the most consumed cereals around
    the world, and it is in the basis of nutrition (staple food) for vulnerable sections
    within Latin-American society. In Costa Rica the paddy is a primary crop, because
    of its nutritional value and the large area planted. With more than sixty thousand
    hectares, for the period covered in the present study, the paddy is among the
    major crops in the country. In theory, the suitable climatic conditions and water-resource
    abundance on the Pacific coast should enable two growing seasons yearly: (i) during
    the rainy season by the use of precipitation, so called “rainfed paddy,” and (ii)
    during the dry season by the approach of rivers and wells, so called “irrigated
    paddy.” Nonetheless, due to the lack of appropriate infrastructure for irrigation,
    growers generally plant only during the rainy season under suboptimal drainage
    and micro-relief conditions, the latter referring to the formation of puddles
    in low elevation spots, and dryness in higher elevation zones. With land leveling
    (LL, also known as “land forming”) [1] uniform slopes are created, enabling a
    continuous (manageable) flow of water (at a non-eroding speed) within the field
    [2]. Such an operation allows for better production in both dry and rainy, seasons.
    In the dry season the LL makes precise irrigation feasible, whereas in the rainy
    season the benefit of implementing LL is reflected in improved homogeneous and
    timely drainage. Said drainage has a great impact on the homogeneous germination
    and establishment of lowland rainfed paddy fields with direct seeding. During
    the LL, the topsoil of higher elevation zones which hinder the flow of water are
    removed (“cut” material), and subsequently deposited in lower elevation zones
    of water stagnation (“fill” material). Both cut and fill volumes are balanced
    in a way that depends on factors such as soil compaction. Gains in crop yield
    resulting from LL are attributed to its direct effect on the improvement of the
    water availability to plants [3], more efficient weed control and greater efficiency
    in nutrient uptake [4]. Since the 1970s, grade control for leveling was achieved
    through the use of rotating lasers, until the beginnings of 2000s. Laser-based
    leveling, as one of the firsts methods used in paddy production, permitted the
    field to be graded with fixed slopes (FS) in two orthogonal directions—a denotes
    a planar surface. A fundamental drawback to FS designs is the potential disruption
    or excessive removal of topsoil due to large cut and fill depths [5]. Notwithstanding,
    the advent of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) in machine control systems
    enabled grade control to be achieved in 3D space, without restriction to a 2D
    subspace defined by a plane [6]. A particular GNSS relative positioning method
    called real time kinematics (RTK) allows for control of the scrapper cutting blade
    to be achieved at the few-centimeter level of accuracy. A GNSS/RTK-based leveling
    design type called variable slope (VS) has been implemented more and more in paddy
    fields during the last two decades [7], with characteristics that are not feasible
    with laser-based instruments. VS designs provide a continuous piece-wise linear
    surface with a variable but consistently positive slope in the direction of irrigation/drainage
    flow, while possibly allowing the slope to change signs (undulate) in the orthogonal
    direction [8]. Such a design could be determined, for example, by mathematical
    optimization after the method presented by [9], where depths of cuts and fills
    are minimized at nodes of a grid, points at which slopes can also change. Among
    other constraints, the optimization problem can also account for a specified range
    of allowable slopes in two orthogonal directions (i.e., the direction of the grid
    lines) [10]. The combination of an accurate survey of the agricultural field,
    a program for VS design and RTK-based grade control allows cuts and fills to be
    made primarily at locations where the natural terrain impedes the flow of water.
    The result is a graded field that typically fits much better to the original terrain
    than what could have been achieved with a FS-designed surface, thereby protecting
    topsoil and saving money through reduced grading-machine operation and lower fuel
    consumption. The implementation of VS leveling has not been analyzed in terms
    of its energy performance within the crop production system. From soil tillage
    to harvest, mechanized agriculture consumes energy. Between the input and output
    of a material flow diagram, several energy sources are consumed and transformed
    to accomplish work. The understanding of this process is critical to describe
    the efficiency, profitability, sustainability [11] and energy savings [12] of
    agricultural production systems. A way to represent energy flows is to depict
    them graphically using a material flow diagram, as suggested by Odum in the 1960s
    [13]. This kind of diagram facilitates understanding of the convergence of energy
    inputs in an agricultural system [14]. Additionally, such a diagram can reveal
    a more complete view of the benefits of adopting technology in agriculture. It
    can also be complemented by an economic analysis in which costs of investment
    are subtracted from the total gain, facilitating comparisons to scenarios where
    technology is not adopted. Economic analyses for new technologies in agriculture
    have been suggested before in order to assess their real benefits in several agricultural
    contexts—for example, path tracking in sugar cane machinery’s operation [15,16]
    and variable rates of nitrogen application in orange [17] and coffee plantations.
    This study aimed to analyze the energy performance of VS-LL’s adoption in a paddy,
    throughout a case study performed with five-year inputs and yield information
    from a field located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The energy performance
    study was also complemented with an economic analysis, which based on costs and
    price/gain data over the five years of the study, aimed to estimate the effect
    of the operation on the crop profitability. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Environment
    The study was conducted in the Central Pacific region of Costa Rica. The field
    spans approximately 30 ha. The predominant soil type is alluvial Inceptisols [18].
    The climate presents two well-defined seasons: a dry season and a rainy season.
    The dry season ranges from December to March, with April being a transitional
    month. The rainy season with ≈2500 mm of annual rainfall (around the 40% of it
    during the growing season), extends generally from May to October, with November
    as a transitional month. The present study is based on the data from five years
    (2011–2015) of a rainfed paddy, i.e., cultivated during the rainy seasons; thus,
    it has the benefits of LL impacting mostly the drainage. Irrigation was not often
    executed, just during crucial moments when it was required, especially in 2015.
    2.2. Land-Leveling Procedures The process of LL typically involves three main
    steps, which are: (i) surveying, i.e., a topographic survey of the field; (ii)
    designing, i.e., the design of an optimal surface; and (iii) grading, i.e., the
    implementation of the design with tractors and scrapers moving soil. After leveling,
    frequently, levees with an ellipsoidal smooth surface of about 15–18 cm height
    and 1.5–2.0 m base-width are created on the field along contours of each 5–10
    cm elevation differences. The function of these levees is to facilitate the management
    of water for irrigation and drainage [8]. Depending on the soil and weather conditions,
    maintenance actions can be executed in the subsequent years—namely: (i) a topographic
    survey to check where the designed surface has been altered, and (ii) reparation
    of points where the levees are broken (e.g., due to the machinery). However, in
    the studied field such maintenance was not executed, and it was therefore not
    included in the analysis. An RTK system (Topcon Agriculture; Livermore, California,
    USA) [19] was used for the field survey in this study. The system consisted of
    two HiperAG receivers (GPS+GLONASS), one as a base station receiver (“base”) and
    the other as a rover receiver (“rover”). The base was placed at a fixed point
    in the field, and the rover mounted on a four-wheel drive vehicle. The average
    speed of the vehicle during the survey was 5 m/s, and the frequency at which the
    rover provided RTK solutions was 10 Hz. It is expected that RTK accuracy is 2
    cm or less in the horizontal plane (X, Y) and 3 cm or less in height (Z). In the
    same vehicle, a computer was installed with the AGForm-3D [19] land-leveling software,
    whose “survey mode” was used to record elevation points in real time. Data points
    were collected every 5 m along lines spaced about 20 m apart (i.e., at the nodes
    of an approximately 5 m to 20 m grid), generating a data set with density of 100
    points ha−1. For step (2), the “design module” of AGForm-3D was used to create
    a VS design with an average slop of 0.15% southwestwards, and a maximum cut surface
    depth of 12 cm at a 1.20 cut/fill ratio factor. Note that AGForm-3D was used for
    both step (1) and step (2), since it integrates functionalities for both. For
    step (3), a grading system was used, which automatically controled the hydraulic
    valves of a scraper during the leveling operation. That grading system was comprised
    of a GNSS receiver (MC-R3), a GNSS antenna (PGA-3) and a display (X30 computer)
    installed on the tractor equipped with a scraper. Figure 1 depicts the equipment.
    The ArcGIS (version 10.2, ESRI, Redlands, California), a geographic information
    system (GIS), was used to compute and overlap the 3D maps of the original and
    the leveled topography. Figure 1. Field equipment and machinery: GNSS-RTK system
    for (a) topographic survey and (b) land leveling (LL). For our analysis we count
    this operation within the “indirect inputs”—specifically, in the machinery operations.
    Its economic cost is implicit in the gross amount of investment. Furthermore,
    in an attempt to reinforce the differences between VS and FS in this manuscript,
    we computed FS leveling pursuing the planar surface that best fit the original
    topography of the field. Its main characteristics, such as the total volume of
    soil removed and the cut depth, were compared with those obtained with the VS
    design. 2.3. Material Flow Diagram and Energy Analysis The material flow diagram
    of the system herewith analyzed (Figure 2a) is based on terminology suggested
    by [20]. The symbols are self-explanatory by their names (Figure 2b), except for
    the switch, which represents paths of energy flow that can be activated and deactivated
    by human actions. We used that symbol to represent the opening/closing actions
    in water inlets. The material flow diagram, as a whole, characterizes the path
    of the energy, since it is included in the system until it leaves. The symbols
    are used to represent what occurs with the energy within the system—whether it
    flows, interact with other materials, is stored, is dissipated as heat or is transformed
    into production (in this case, crop yield). The material flow diagramming involves
    a set of input data and certain outputs, as described in the following. Input
    data associated with growing and harvesting a hectare of paddy, including information
    about seeds, chemicals, fuel, machinery and labor, were obtained directly from
    the farmer, who also provided the fuel consumption of each operation. In addition,
    a simplified version of the diagram is presented in Figure 2c, particularly for
    readers unfamiliar with the illustration of material flows. Figure 2. Material
    flows in LL and non-leveling systems, both with specific line types: blue dashed
    lines for flows for the leveled scenario; red dashed lines for the flows in the
    systems without leveling. Continuous lines represent permanent energy flows (a).
    The symbols and terminology (b) are based on [20], presented by [14] as well.
    In (c) a simplified version of the diagram is presented for readers unfamiliar
    with the illustration of material flows. In the Figure 2 the interactions of inputs
    within the system are represented in an energy flow diagram for both scenarios
    studied, i.e., with and without the implementation of LL. All the acquired inputs
    (seeds, chemicals, fuel, machinery and labor) are directly related to machinery
    operations, which improve soil conditions. Obviously, soil quality directly affects
    the growth of a paddy, which is also influenced by weather conditions—sunlight,
    rain, wind, etc. Evapotranspiration is represented as a special interaction of
    climate (wind, sunlight and rain) and the crop. Moreover, the differences between
    the two systems studied (i.e., one with and one without LL) are represented by
    different line types. Blue dashed lines show the energy flows present only in
    the paddy production system with LL, and red dashed lines with arrows show the
    flows present only on the system without leveling. The continuous lines represent
    permanent energy flows. These data were converted into energy-per-area using energy
    equivalents obtained from [21,22] from the Nebraska Trac. Test Lab [14,23]. We
    calculated the energy required (MJ ha−1) for every input for two scenarios: one
    with and one without the benefit of land-leveling operations. The primary differences
    between those two scenarios are due to the addition of costs of machinery operations
    associated with LL itself and levees marking, and labor. The latter is associated
    with the labor required for irrigation and drainage, both consisting basically
    of the same task of opening and closing the water-pass points along the levees
    (Figure 3). To irrigate the field there is an additional task required: to open/close
    the water entrance; however, this is a fast and punctual task with a negligible
    impact on the labor estimations. Figure 3. Aerial perspective of the study field
    during irrigation in 2016 (a,b), and a zoom-in exemplifying where some water-passes
    were located (c). Pictures are included for illustration purposes; no similar
    pictures are available for the years of the study. Output information was obtained
    from the yield data of five continuous cropping seasons, from 2011 to 2015, recorded
    with a gravimetric yield monitor [24], which consisted of a GNSS receiver with
    sub-meter accuracy, a moisture sensor, a touchscreen console and an impact plate
    (which indirectly detects the weight of each data point collected). Since only
    a few farmers in the country used VS-LL, national yield averages were used to
    show that variations in the production of the study field are not linked to national
    trends. The original data, in units of Mg ha−1, were converted to units of MJ
    ha−1 using the equivalence 14,600 MJ Mg−1 ([21] Table 1 in Section 3). Data obtained
    from the yield monitor were processed to generate “yield maps.” In order to analyze
    the energy performances of the studied systems, the following energy indicators
    were used (Equations (1)–(3)): Table 1. Energy performance of paddy production
    for both “with leveling” and “without leveling” cases. The respective sources
    of the embodied energy equivalencies are presented in brackets. Energy Return
    on Investment (EROI) [21,25]. 𝐸𝑅𝑂𝐼= 𝐸𝑂 𝐸𝐼 (1) Energy Productivity (EP) [21,26].
    𝐸𝑃= 𝑌 𝐸𝐼 (2) Energy Balance (EB) [21,22,27]. 𝐸𝐵=𝐸𝑂−𝐸𝐼 (3) The EROI is a unitless
    index used to represent the amount of energy produced divided by the energy invested;
    EP is energy productivity, representing the crop produced per unit of energy invested.
    EP can be computed either as a unitless value if both factors (Y and EI) are converted
    to MJ ha−1, or as weight (Mg or Kg) per MJ data if Y is not converted. In the
    present study we calculated the EP in kg MJ−1. EB is energy balance, representing
    the net energy balance; EO is energy output in units of MJ ha−1; EI is energy
    input in units of MJ ha−1; and Y is crop yield in units of Mg ha−1. The EI is
    the sum of the energies contained in all direct (kg ha−1) and indirect (h and
    L ha−1) inputs, while EO denotes the amount of energy contained in the total grain
    produced per hectare. To obtain both EI and EO values in terms of MJ ha−1, equivalencies
    of embodied energy per unit of input and output were utilized (the references
    are clarified in Table 1). 2.4. Economic Analysis Our economic analysis quantified
    the total gain in both scenarios (i.e., with and without LL) by subtracting the
    amount invested from the partial gain (yield increase times market price). The
    assumed production cost for a paddy was 2100 USD ha−1 [28,29,30,31]. From 2013
    to 2015, it was estimated that the investments in technology, i.e., the cost to
    acquire the necessary equipment (72,000 USD), depreciated in the total area (400
    ha) where said technology was used for over three years of the study. The IT (investment
    in technology) represents the investment in all the equipment needed for both
    surveying and leveling; although it can be overestimated due to the short lifespan
    considered (three years), the investment was 60 USD ha−1. Taken into account as
    well were the investments in increased machinery use (leveling and levee marking)
    and labor (irrigation/drainage tasks). A lifespan of 10 years was adopted for
    the machinery. The partial gain was determined by multiplying additional yield
    by the market price, 580 USD Mg−1 for all the years [30]. Equations (4) and (5)
    express how the profit without leveling (PWoL) and the profit with leveling (PWL)
    were calculated: 𝑷𝑾𝒐𝑳= 𝒀 ×𝑷 𝑨 −𝑪𝑷 (4) 𝑷𝑾𝑳= 𝒀 ×𝑷 𝑨 −[𝑪𝑷+𝑰𝑻+𝑰𝑴𝑶+𝑰𝑳] (5) where Y
    is the crop yield in Mg, P is the price (USD Mg−1) of one Mg of rice, A is the
    area of the plot in ha and CP is the cost of production (USD ha−1) for one hectare
    of paddy. For the estimation of PWL we included IT, IMO (increment in machinery
    operations) and IL (increment in labor), all expressed in USD. The CP represents
    agricultural inputs determined by agronomic prescription, such as fertilizers,
    pesticides and seeds. Investment in machinery operations (IMO) for LL was obtained
    based on 230 USD ha−1. For every hectare, around 120 m3 of soil was moved, resulting
    in a cost of about 1.9 USD m−3. Investment in labor (IL) was also based on the
    farmer’s records—considered the same as the cost for irrigation management; it
    totaled 140 USD ha−1 which was the only additional labor after land forming. 3.
    Results and Discussion The surfaces depicted in the following figure were generated
    from surveys and VS leveling designs using AGForm-3D. The original (Figure 4a)
    and leveled (Figure 4b) surfaces are presented alongside the map of cuts and fills
    carried out (Figure 4c). In an attempt to reinforce the differences between the
    VS 3D-land forming and the FS best-fitting plane leveling, previously reported
    by [6], we estimated how much the maximum cut depth and volume of soil removed
    would be if the FS was employed. The results showed that the volume of soil to
    be removed with the FS would be 450 m3 ha−1, i.e., around 3.75 times more compared
    with the VS (120 m3 ha−1, as reported in Section 2). Moreover, the depths of cuts
    and fills in the VS design were always lower than 20 cm (distributed in site specific
    spots of a few square meters), whereas the FS design resulted in cuts and fills
    exceeding 45 cm (distributed larger areas of several hundred square meters). Obviously,
    our choice of a VS design surface in this case fulfills our objective to minimize
    topsoil disturbance, compared to the alternative FS design surface. Figure 4.

    respective map of cuts and fills. The contour lines in (b) represent the pattern
    of the levees that were marked on field after the executing the VS design. Figure
    5 shows yield maps for the harvest periods evaluated. LL was conducted only in
    years 2013, 2014 and 2015. The lowest yield in the five-year study was observed
    in 2011, before LL commenced, when the average was 2.76 Mg ha−1. In 2012, the
    average increased to 4.42 Mg ha−1, but it was still lower than the yields obtained
    in 2013–2015 when LL was performed. In 2013, after implementing leveling, the
    yield increased by more than 3 Mg ha−1 compared to 2011 and more than 1.5 Mg ha−1
    compared to 2012. Consequently, technological adoption alone does not guarantee
    against yield decrease. Rather, combining LL with good practices such as selection
    of a quality seed hybrid and an appropriate planting density [10] should result
    in a higher probability of avoiding yield decreases. We assert that LL creates
    conditions more favorable for the inputs and that is should be expected to result
    in a more homogeneous growth of the crop. Figure 5. Yield maps based on the information
    obtained from the yield monitoring system [24] for the harvest periods 2011–2015.
    The labels on the left-hand side indicate the years without (a,b) and with (c–e)
    VS-LL. The average yield is presented at the top right of each map. A common color
    scale was used for the four maps. The impacts of LL on crop production were analyzed
    considering biotic and abiotic stress conditions of particular seasons. For that
    purpose, field records of crop health, and historical records about the occurrence
    of El Niño and La Niña climatic phenomena offer an idea about stress environments
    in specific years. Figure 6a presents the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI, National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration—NOAA) [32] used to monitor the El Niño-Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO), namely, the presence of either of the two phenomena (Figure
    6b) during the period of the study (2011–2015). The figure includes the national
    and the field study average yields as well (Figure 6c). Figure 6. Monthly intensity
    of El Niño and La Niña according to the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI, National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration—NOAA) [31] (a); locally reported El Niño and La
    Niña phases regarding the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO, National Meteorological
    Institute of Costa Rica—IMN) [34] (b); and yearly average yields in the country
    and the study field (c) [28,29,30,31]. In 2011, La Niña caused rainier and cooler
    weather, which alongside the lack of levees to drain the field and suboptimal
    microrelief, might be associated with the lower average yield of the study field
    compared with the Costa Rican mean. During 2012–2013, at neutral to transitional
    ENSO phases, and without a meaningful biotic stress, the effect of LL on production
    is clearer. The yield increased from 4.42 Mg ha−1 in 2012 to 6.09 Mg ha−1 in 2013
    (first year with leveling). In 2014, aside from weather factors promoted by the
    El Niño in the second half of that year, the decrease in crop yield is attributed
    to a rice mite (Steneotarsonemus spinki) attack. In 2015, with a more intense
    El Niño effect but without meaningful biotic stress, the average yield in the
    study field surpassed two times the national mean; meaning that such a production
    increase was not linked to a general trend in the country. This finding highlights
    the greater impact of LL when the capacity to manage precision irrigation and
    drainage becomes crucial to keep a crop healthy, under adverse weather conditions.
    Specifically, in 2015, there was a combined effect of the LL benefits, which was
    used (i) to improve the water retention within the field by closing the water-passes
    when precipitation rates declined, and (ii) to execute some irrigation events
    when they were necessary due to the stronger El Niño effect. In a parallel study,
    Quiros et al. [32] analyzed the effect of LL on the distribution of yield homogeneous
    zones. In 2013, in a contiguous rainfed paddy field without LL, the authors reported
    a yield 3.79 Mg ha−1 lower than the one measured in the present study (already
    with LL by that time). Remarkably, in 2014 when the field analyzed in the [33]
    research was leveled, its yield (5.10 Mg ha−1) was similar to the one observed
    in the present study (5.40 Mg ha−1). Moreover, in 2015 the yield increased by
    around 2.90 Mg ha−1 in both studies. These results offer an idea about the consistency
    in the impact of LL on the yield, particularly in 2015 when LL was used for both
    irrigation and drainage purposes. Besides the quantitative impacts on yield, our
    investigation addresses the flow of materials within the paddy system as well
    (Figure 2, Section 3). The diagram describes how the input energy coming from
    constant external sources, such as seeds, chemicals and fuel, interacts with the
    machinery operations done in both systems, and its embodied energy finally converges
    in the crop land. Some fuel is invested for leveling and levees marking operations
    and some of its energy is stored in the new infrastructure (levees), and some
    other amount of energy is required by irrigation. Part of the remaining energy
    was used to provide inputs into the soil, which provides together rain (in systems
    without leveling), river water (only in systems with leveling), solar light and
    the evapotranspiration (as an interaction which liberates water from the system
    as well) conditions to rice production in the paddy crop until harvest. Finally,
    some heat comes out from the harvest operation to obtain the yield as the final
    output. As a final annotation, the energy flow arrow of the sunlight that comes
    immediately out of the system represents the solar light reflected by the canopy.
    All the inputs required and all the energy the paddy produced are listed for both
    systems: with and without leveling (Table 1). Direct inputs represent the same
    amount of energy in both scenarios, because the amounts of seeds and chemicals
    required do not depend on whether LL is done or not. The energy demand was 8.69
    GJ ha−1, of which seed and nitrogen comprise the highest values. On the other
    hand, indirect inputs varied from 5.33 GJ ha−1 without leveling to 9.49 GJ ha−1
    with leveling. This difference was due to the increase of machinery use for leveling.
    In this study, energy output is considered as the amount of energy per amount
    of the grain harvested. Following [21] a value of 14,600.00 MJ Mg−1 was adopted.
    To better understand the benefits of technology adoption, in terms of energy conserved,
    the use of certain energy indices for the inputs and outputs is most helpful.
    Table 2 shows the values of three energy indices calculated for each year of the
    study: energy return on investment (EROI), energy productivity (EP) and energy
    balance (EB). EROI is computed as a ratio of the amount of energy produced to
    the amount of energy invested. For example, an EROI value of 1 means that the
    amount of energy invested was the same as the amount of energy produced, whereas
    a value greater than 1 means that there was more energy produced than invested.
    Considering the general improvement that leveling resulted in, 2014 was an exception
    for EROI and EP (both 7% lower than in 2012). In the same season, EB was 20% above
    2012. For both 2013 and 2015, EROI and EP were 5% to ≈30% above 2012, respectively,
    whereas the EB values for 2013 and 2015 were 20% and 80% above that of 2012, respectively.
    Averaged index values for the scenarios leveled and non-leveled show that leveling
    has a 93.3% improvement in EB and 35.5% improvements in EROI and EP, respectively,
    compared to the non-leveled case. Note that EROI and EP represent the same trend,
    since output energy is directly proportional to yield. Table 2. Energy indices
    computed for each year of the study. The higher yield, EP, ER and EB values in
    2015, compared to 2013 and 2014, suggest that the benefit of LL may increase over
    time, which would be an argument in its favor as a partial solution to the growing
    demand to conserve energy in paddy production [4,35]. The additional energy demand
    (4254 MJ ha−1) is equivalent to 0.29 Mg ha−1 of paddy, which is the minimum additional
    yield to keep the same EB. Finally, an economic analysis can also help to decide
    for or against technology adoption (GNSS-controlled LL in this case). Thus, we
    present Table 3, which shows the resulting profit in the field for each of the
    five years of study. The negative value of profit in 2011 was due to low income
    caused by a low yield. From 2013 to 2015, after leveling was performed, the investment
    cost was 2530 USD ha−1, being the sum of CP (2100 USD ha−1), IT (60 USD ha−1),
    IMO (230 USD ha−1) and IL (140 USD ha−1). Income is the result of yield multiplied
    by the paddy price (580 USD Mg−1), which was considered fixed for all five years.
    Table 3. Economic analysis comparing the investment partial and total gains of
    the scenarios with and without LL. After leveling, the average profit was 3.4
    times higher than 2012 (from 2.3 to 4.9). We did not consider 2011 when making
    these comparisons, as its unexpectedly low total gain could overestimate the benefits
    of technological adoption (here, LL). Indeed, a longer-term analysis could prove
    more reliable, but decisions on whether to adopt new technology cannot always
    wait. Often, when technological options are introduced into the market, farmers
    have no reliable way to judge the degree of their benefit. The results suggest
    that, for the technology evaluated here, and even with the lower yield of 2014,
    the investment was worth it. The additional production cost of 430 USD ha−1 (i.e.,
    IT+IMO+IL) is equivalent to 0.74 Mg ha−1 of paddy, which was the minimum additional
    yield to keep the same profit realized in 2012 before LL was performed. Alongside
    the energy performance and economic profitability, the ecological benefit of the
    GNSS/RTK-based VS-LL might be highlighted from two perspectives: (i) the higher
    efficiency in the use of water, and (ii) the shallower soil alteration. Such technology
    which improves irrigation and drainage efficiencies may help in the feasibility
    of producing crops in water-scarce regions. Given the current generalized water
    scarcity around the world [36], it might be helpful in a wide range of crops and
    regions, especially those crucial for the food safety of vulnerable populations.
    For instance, Sub-Saharan African crops are in need of these techniques to improve
    production systems, in a context where the access to food is increasingly difficult,
    and the lack of technology makes it difficult to access the sources of water in
    their arid to semi-arid climate [37]. Abdullaev et al. [38], for instance, reported
    a reduction of more than 500 m3 ha−1 in the water application rate in fields leveled
    by laser. A similar impact would be expected with VS leveling, without the large
    soil displacement commonly seen in laser leveling. Moreover, by means of the shallower
    cuts and fills, the GNSS/RTK-based VS-LL is suitable for soil conservation. This
    is a critical fact in the present context where soil is being degraded by human
    actions and land use changes, and again, the least advanced economies (Sub-Saharan
    Africa, South America and South Asia) are the most affected [39]. The impact of
    the LL on the yield in the studied rainfed paddy field is directly attributed
    to the improved drainage. With the field leveled and levees built the farmer was
    able to: (i) release the excess of water within the field during, e.g., either
    days of higher precipitation or specific phenologies which require drier soil,
    and (ii) retain the water in the field during days of lower rainfall. Indirectly,
    LL improves the homogeneous availability of water for the crop [3], at the time
    that facilitates a more efficient control of weeds, and a greater efficiency in
    nutrient uptake [4]. Besides the commented-on benefits of LL for crop production,
    a set of limitations associated with the LL operation, in general (not VS specific),
    have to be mentioned. First, considering the risk of removing the topsoil layer,
    its depth must be considered before executing the operationm in the sense that
    the maximum cut designed must be several centimeters shallower than the topsoil.
    In addition, the field size should be accounted for in the designs as well, avoiding
    long soil carrying distances and deeper and larger cut and fill areas; for instance,
    large fields (in the order of several tens of hectares) should be divided into
    smaller ones where the cut and fills can be better distributed. Moreover, the
    price of LL equipment (specified above) is sometimes a limitation for farmers,
    depending on their production capacity; however, at the same time it presents
    an opportunity for companies to develop outsourcing businesses. 4. Conclusions
    The implementation of LL-VS positively impacted the sustainability performance
    in the studied paddy field. Improvements of yield and energy performance were
    detected after the adoption of VS-LL. The impact of LL on yield is stronger under
    adverse weather conditions with irregular water supply, either limited or excessive.
    In such situations the precision irrigation (in dry seasons) and drainage (in
    rainy seasons) management enabled by LL becomes crucial to keep a crop productive.
    Furthermore, our analysis has shown that the technological adoption of VS-LL resulted
    in gains of energy efficiency and crop profitability. In average results, the
    additional energy demand (4254.00 MJ ha−1) was compensated by higher additional
    energy output, providing greater EROI, EP and EB. Moreover, the augment in the
    return of energy obtained by implementing the VS leveling surpasses the increase
    in input energy that it requires, since the increase in energy output in the form
    of yield is higher than the increase of indirect inputs. Indeed, the energy compensation
    is reached with additional yield above 0.29 Mg ha−1, over the one obtained without
    land forming. In addition, from the economic perspective, after leveling the average
    profit was 3.4 even with the lower yield of 2014. Therefore, this suggests that
    the VS was worth the investment for the field and the conditions of the present
    study. Finally, environmental benefits should also be noted, since VS allowed
    shallower topsoil cuts distributed on specific spots. Indeed, the implementation
    of said operation brings the production benefits of a more efficient irrigation
    system, while at the time that avoiding major damage to topsoil layers. Author

  description: Crop diseases have the potential to cause devastating epidemics that
    threaten the world's food supply and vary widely in their dispersal pattern, prevalence,
    and severity. It remains unclear what the impact disease will have on sustainable
    crop yields in the future. Agricultural stakeholders are increasingly under pressure
    to adapt their decision-making to make more informed and efficient use of irrigation
    water, fertilizers, and pesticides. They also face increasing uncertainty in how
    best to respond to competing health, environment, and (sustainable) development
    impacts and risks. Disease dynamics involves a complex interaction between a host,
    a pathogen, and their environment, representing one of the largest risks facing
    the long-term sustainability of agriculture. New airborne inoculum, weather, and
    satellite-based technology provide new opportunities for combining disease monitoring
    data and predictive models—but this requires a robust analytical framework. Integrated
    model-based forecasting frameworks have the potential to improve the timeliness,
    effectiveness, and foresight for controlling crop diseases, while minimizing economic
    costs and environmental impacts, and yield losses. The feasibility of this approach
    is investigated involving model and data selection. It is tested against available
    disease data collected for wheat stripe (yellow) rust (Puccinia striiformis f.sp.
    tritici) (Pst) fungal disease within southern Alberta, Canada. Two candidate,
    stochastic models are evaluated; a simpler, site-specific model, and a more complex,
    spatially-explicit transmission model. The ability of these models to reproduce
    an observed infection pattern is tested using two climate datasets with different
    spatial resolution—a reanalysis dataset (~55 km) and weather station network township-aggregated
    data (~10 km). The complex spatially-explicit model using weather station network
    data had the highest forecast accuracy. A multi-scale airborne surveillance design
    that provides data would further improve disease risk forecast accuracy under
    heterogeneous modeling assumptions. In the future, a model-based forecasting approach,
    if supported with an airborne surveillance monitoring plan, could be made operational
    to provide agricultural stakeholders with reliable, cost-effective, and near-real-time
    information for protecting and sustaining crop production against multiple disease
    threats.

    Crop diseases have the potential to cause devastating epidemics that threaten

    if supported with an airborne surveillance monitoring plan, could be made operational
    to provide agricultural stakeholders with reliable, cost-effective, and near-real-time
    information for protecting and sustaining crop production against multiple disease
    threats. Introduction Crop diseases have the potential to cause devastating epidemics
    that threaten the world''s food supply and vary widely in their dispersal pattern,
    prevalence, and severity (Chakraborty and Newton, 2011). Diseases like stripe
    rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) (Pst) and fusarium head blight (Fusarium
    graminearum) (FHB) on wheat, and powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) on grapes,
    to highlight just a few, cause major crop losses globally (Hovmøller, 2001; Carisse
    et al., 2009; Haran et al., 2010; Newberry et al., 2016). Plant breeding to increase
    host resistance remains the primary approach for managing diseases and to help
    sustainable agricultural yields, as crop breeding networks that deploy resistance
    genes decrease the likelihood that pathogens will overcome resistance (Ojiambo
    et al., 2017). Nonetheless, despite the introduction of crop cultivars/varieties
    with higher resistance, new disease races, with increased virulence, continue
    to emerge. Environmental conditions affect resistance gene performance, but the
    basis for this is poorly understood (Bryant et al., 2014). Moreover, environmental
    drivers and pressures are increasing in their influence over agroecosystems; climate
    change and variability is raising temperatures and lengthening growing seasons,
    especially in northern climates (Canada) or temperate zones (Australia), producing
    more days without frost, and more intense heatwave and rainfall events. Disease
    dynamics itself involves a complex interaction between a host, a pathogen, and
    their environment, representing one of the largest integrated risks facing the
    long-term sustainability of agriculture. Genetic factors (e.g., emergence of new
    diseases and of new races), environmental-driven influence (e.g., global climate
    change impacts on disease spread), and management-intervention driven agroecosystem
    interactions (e.g., crop breeding and monitoring technologies) are all important
    considerations in disease risk mitigation. The cost of pesticides (e.g., fungicides,
    insecticides, herbicides) is a substantial burden for growers—with substantial
    uncertainty involved in deciding when and how much to apply to commercial fields,
    especially as multiple diseases often affect crops at the same time. Currently,
    when monitoring their fields for disease, growers often rely on simple, visual
    identification, assessing severity using standard area diagrams (SADs), disease
    progress (AUDPC) curves, and weather/forecast conditions (Contreras-Medina et
    al., 2009; Nopsa and Pfender, 2014; Ojiambo et al., 2017). Pesticides are then
    applied either preventatively, or even if no disease is detected, on a calendar-based
    schedule, based on perceived risk (Carisse et al., 2009). This approach is, however,
    limited in its ability to detect and control disease. Pesticide application must
    generally occur during the early stages of epidemics, and at sufficient rates.
    Over-application is costly and creates added selection pressure for more pesticide
    tolerant strains, while under-application may also be cost-prohibitive in regions
    where expected yield is lower (Chen, 2007). Moreover, high pesticide concentrations
    are not only costly, but are also associated with detrimental environmental and
    human health impacts (Newlands, 2016). Reducing pesticide use is a major focus
    of global agricultural sustainability efforts (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016).
    The effectiveness of applications are also highly dependent on timing, stage of
    disease progression, and the strength and directionality of micro- and meso-scale
    wind currents (Meyer M. et al., 2017). Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is the
    deployment of a variety of methods of pest control designed to complement, reduce,
    or replace the application of synthetic pesticides. It involves regular monitoring,
    use of decision thresholds, combining approaches for targeted pesticide management
    and substitution to broader agroecosystem considerations (Pretty and Bharucha,
    2015). For a comprehensive global overview of the history, programs, and adoption
    of IPM programs around the world, readers are referred to Peshin et al. (2009).
    They highlight problems with assessing the adoption and success of IPM programs
    and how pesticide use has not consistently decreased in the majority of programs,
    despite reduction of pesticide use being one of their primary goals. Here predictive
    models may not only enable better program assessment and adoption, but also help
    to identify how to optimize changes in the timing and application of pesticides
    (e.g., fungicides) in time and space to reduce pesticide use where predicted disease
    risk is sufficiently low. Disease prediction models using advanced statistical
    methods (e.g., artificial neural networks) integrating weather and aerobiological
    monitoring data have been successfully developed and validated for Ganoderma spp.
    and white blister on Brassica crops (Brassica spotTM) (Minchinton et al., 2013;
    Sadyś et al., 2016). Such prediction models need to be adapted and extended for
    other crop diseases and then integrated into operational IPM programs. For many
    IPM programs, there is a crucial need to develop and involve a more reliable and
    effective approach (i.e., analytical framework) for managing disease risk that
    establish relationships between the amount of airborne inoculum and disease development,
    combined use of models that integrate theoretical knowledge on crop (host) growth,
    disease (pathogen) development, and environmental influences; alongside data from
    disease monitoring, climate/weather, and other explanatory variables for assessing
    and predicting disease (Juroszek and von Tiedemann, 2013; Ojiambo et al., 2017).
    Past efforts have been hindered by sparse spatial data, limited use of field monitoring
    technology, and a need for greater integration and quantification. Past efforts
    have also concentrated mainly on understanding the physical and biological mechanisms
    of plant (crop) pathogen spore dispersal linked disease development, outbreaks
    and spatial epidemic patterning and spread. Improved detection of new airborne
    inoculum, weather, and satellite-based technology, however, provide new opportunities
    for combining disease monitoring data with predictive models. This has the potential
    to improve the timeliness, effectiveness and foresight for controlling crop diseases,
    while minimizing crop loss (Isard et al., 2011; Devadas et al., 2015; West and
    Kimber, 2015; Mahlein, 2016). In a recent review of modeling the impact of climate
    on crop disease, improvements in measuring the uncertainty of climate change projected
    impacts using multi-model ensembles are highlighted. This synthesis identifies
    the need to explore other sources of uncertainty inherent in disease models that
    still remain unexplored and unreported (Newberry et al., 2016). They articulate
    the crucial need to investigate crop disease dynamics at the landscape spatial
    scale, across a broader range of crops and pathogens. This study also identifies
    the need for new frameworks and models to improve the ability of models to predict
    impacts of climate change on crop diseases for guiding the planning of climate
    change adaptation strategies to ensure future food security. Because disease patterns
    can change in unintended ways when interventions take place across spatially heterogeneous
    landscapes, Newberry et al. (2016) articulate five key challenges for advancing
    models: (1) flexibility and accuracy, (2) interaction and contact assumptions
    and statistical representation, (3) how to define and estimate a critical threshold
    of transmissibility, while recognizing a mixture of infection types under changing
    susceptibility, (4) how to model disease dynamics that depends on long-distance
    interaction (e.g., air transmission via wind trajectories with deposition via
    rainfall events), and, (5) identifying the natural scale (i.e., operational resolution)
    for modeling (and forecasting) transmission and interaction, and how this relates
    to the scale at which intervention is most effective, recognizing that different
    sources of data are typically available at different scales (Riley et al., 2015).
    Model uncertainty and reliability remain two major issues challenging the development
    of more robust and effective quantitative approaches for disease management. To
    address these aspects requires an integrated model-based framework and statistical
    approach that can integrate new types of data, model spatial and temporal dependence
    and interaction, quantify uncertainties, evaluate multiple scenarios, and bridge
    empirical-theory knowledge gaps (Held et al., 2004; Contreras-Medina et al., 2009;
    Haran et al., 2010; Savage and Renton, 2014; Kouadio and Newlands, 2015; Riley
    et al., 2015; Newlands, 2016; Höhle et al.,, 2017; Ojiambo et al., 2017). Dennis
    (1987) derived a simple, multivariate regression-based model of Pst disease infection
    based on air temperature and surface wetness period. Incorporating Monte-Carlo
    simulation to model uncertainty, El Jarroudi et al. (2017) further incorporated
    the Dennis disease infection model into a threshold-based weather model to guide
    fungicide applications for Pst. They show that an optimal combination of high
    humidity (>92%), temperature (4–16oC) for at least 4 consecutive hours was sufficient
    to cause an epidemic. Audsley et al. (2005) developed a simulation model integrating
    it within the Decision Support System for Arable Crops (DESSAC) system that uses
    a genetic algorithm for the selection of fungicide spray plans (Parsons and Te
    Beest, 2004; Audsley et al., 2005), integrating major risk variables for pathogen
    (i.e., inoculum source and transfer), host (cultivar-specific resistance, leaf
    age, nitrogen uptake), and weather conditions (temperature, rain, humidity, wind),
    Using the simple, multiple regression modeling approach, Kuang et al. (2013) demonstrated
    a model-based, operational prediction system for wheat stripe rust that integrates
    geospatial and internet/networking technology to enable multiple users to interact,
    share data, automate, and update model design, combining regional predictions
    and testing statistical significance. The inter-comparison of assumptions (models),
    spatial resolution and uncertainty (climate datasets), spatial correlation/dependence
    of host-pathogen-environmental interaction, and its effect on model performance
    and forecast accuracy is lacking. In this paper, an integrated modeling framework
    to forecast disease risk is proposed. The feasibility of model-based, operational
    disease risk forecasting is investigated, using data available for wheat stripe
    (yellow) rust (Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici) (hereafter, Pst) fungal disease
    within southern Alberta, Canada. Two candidate, stochastic models are evaluated;
    a simpler, site-specific model, and a more complex, transmission model. These
    models are calibrated using airborne inoculum data by a Burkard cyclone spore
    collector, for the first time. In addition, satellite measurements of major disease
    risk variables (i.e., canopy temperature and liquid water on the canopy surface)
    are integrated. The ability of these models to reproduce an observed infection
    pattern is tested using two climate datasets with different spatial resolution—a
    reanalysis dataset (~55 km) and a weather station network township-aggregated
    data (~10 km). Materials and Methods Integrated Modeling Approach The integrated
    framework was designed to take into account major aspects and considerations involved
    in operational model-based forecasting of crop disease at the regional-scale (Figure
    1). This approach combines data on host, pathogen and environment, and models
    to capture different aspects of disease dynamics under different assumptions.
    In this figure, starting and end points are shown with respect to seasonal disease
    progression. Boxes represent model components—dashed boxes are disease aspects
    not considered in the current modeling. Full boxes are those that are currently
    considered. This design is a prototype, and while not exhaustive of all general
    and pathogen-specific aspects, is based on published scientific studies, evidence,
    and in consultation with several expert AAFC/Canadian pathologists. This design
    supports feasibility testing, involving the evaluation of different models, datasets,
    and forecast metrics. The framework integrates threshold-based infection and multivariate
    spatial assumptions, extending previous approaches to include a broader, more
    representative set of disease dynamic parameters, climate covariates, and assumptions
    on disease-climate interaction and spatial dependence. Its component-wide structure
    permits scaling-up from homogeneous to heterogeneous assumptions, whereby a region
    is divided into smaller subregions, with transmission assumed to occur between
    them and a calibrated model used to capture their specific disease dynamics, susceptibility,
    incidence, and risk. Further details of the model input and output parameters
    and variables are provided for a non-spatial/site-specific (CLR) and spatial model
    (hhh4) formulation in this section. figure 1 FIGURE 1. A prototype integrated,
    model-based framework for forecasting disease risk. Risk components for the major
    disease progression stages (i.e., immigration, deposition, germination, infection,
    incubation/residency, multiplication, re-dispersal, perennation) are included,
    alongside major risk variables, e.g., weather trigger events and conditions, host
    exposure and susceptibility, pathogen survival, residency, latency, endemic infection,
    cycling, epidemic transmission and dispersal, and evolved virulence associated
    with the risk of resistance breakdown in the field (i.e., finer subregions compared
    to the ROI). Full boxes are components of the framework that are considered in
    the current disease risk modeling, while dashed boxes will be considered in future
    extended modeling. Wheat Stripe Rust Disease Stripe (yellow) rust (Pst) is a prevalent
    fungal disease in all wheat (Triticum aestivum) growing regions around the world,
    occurring in most production zones having cool and moist weather conditions during
    the growing season (Chen et al., 2014). This disease has the potential to cause
    devastating outbreaks/severe epidemics that threaten the world''s wheat supply
    and, in turn, global food security, as 88% of the world''s wheat production of
    760 million metric tons (~$185 USD/mt or $140.6 billion USD in 2017/18) is susceptible
    (World Bank Group, 2017; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), 2018). This fungus (a wind-dispersed, obligate biotroph that only infects
    and survives in a living host) has yellow urediniospores during its asexual infection
    cycle and is able to disperse over long distances across continents. It is also
    adapting and overcoming resistance genes via rapid stepwise evolution (Lei et
    al., 2017; Schwessinger, 2017). There are different types of resistance depending
    on host wheat plant growth stages and environment (laboratory or field), such
    that stripe rust resistances can be separated into all-stage (also called seedling)
    resistance (ASR) verses adult-plant resistance (APR); greenhouse resistance and
    field resistance; temperature insensitive resistance verses temperature sensitive
    resistance; and non-durable resistance vs. durable resistance (Wang and Chen,
    2017). With the constant evolution of new rust strains, and their adaptation to
    higher temperatures, consistent and durable disease resistance is a key challenge.
    The dual/split application of fungicide, with half rates applied early and later,
    can reduce disease intensity (AUDPC metric) close to that of a single, full application,
    based on field trials of fungicide effectiveness (Braithwaite, 1998). Crop rotation
    likely does not prevent the spread of Pst, given its rate of spread is so fast
    across large areas (Xi et al., 2015). Nonetheless, delayed planting, reduced irrigation,
    avoidance of excessive nitrogen use, and elimination of volunteer and grass plants
    can reduce stripe rust severities—but these cultural practices are often not profitable,
    conflict with conservation farming, and/or reduce yield potential (Chen, 2007).
    A consideration of host resistance, pathogen survival and dynamics, alongside
    best management or cultural practices, enabling farmers to use fungicides more
    judicially, is a long-term, ultimate need and goal to minimize the risk of this
    disease (Xi et al., 2015). Most areas of the United States are not suitable for
    Pst survival in both summer and winter, and only the Pacific Rim states (California,
    Oregon, and Washington) have favorable areas where the disease survives in summer
    and winter (i.e., oversummering and overwintering), based on summer/winter survival
    indices linked to climate conditions (Sharma-Poudyal, 2012; Sharma-Poudyal et
    al., 2014). The major source of stripe rust inoculum for Alberta (Western Canada)
    is considered to be from this Pacific Northwest region (hereafter PNW) (Xi et
    al., 2015). Pst occurrence is generally associated with higher elevations, northern
    latitudes or cooler years (Newberry et al., 2016). For regions north of latitude
    40°N, it infects both winter wheat and spring wheat (winter wheat is generally
    more susceptible than spring wheat), surviving in cool summers, with hot summers
    substantially decreasing the chance of its survival, and severe winters preventing
    its survival (Xi et al., 2015). Pst development becomes dormant for longer durations
    (slower cycle time) as night-time temperatures cool. In this way, indices based
    on average daily mean temperatures may overestimate infection risk, especially
    in early spring and late summer, when cooler nights are more frequent. Because
    different races can infect different wheat varieties/cultivars having different
    resistance to the pathogen, the reaction of different resistance genes on selected
    host varieties/cultivars (differentials) is used to determine the “race spectrum”
    for a given pathogen population (e.g., within a single field). As with most other
    wheat-growing regions, urediniopores (asexual cycle) are the only inoculum source
    for the initial and recurrent infection of wheat, with an infection cycle time
    that varies through the growing season. New and older rust isolates (i.e., pathogen
    isolated in field samples that are geographically or location specific) within
    Western Canada have similar urediniospore rates of germination, occurring between
    2 and 20°C, and highest/optimal close to 5°C, with cooler temperatures favoring
    spore germination (Tran and Kutcher, 2015). While Pst outbreaks have been documented
    in Alberta since 1925, the variable virulence of Pst has enabled it to overcome
    the resistance of wheat cultivars, with increasing epidemics occurring in the
    1990s, whereby the older population of races (i.e., pathotypes) in the United
    States have been replaced by a new population since 2000 with germination occurring
    at higher temperatures between (16–18°C) and being more tolerant of higher summer
    temperatures (Chen, 2010; Xi et al., 2015). Warm chinook winds create milder winter
    weather conditions across southern Alberta and change snow cover. Snow cover is
    beneficial to urediniospore survival during the winter, whereby areas in the vicinity
    of Olds are more conducive for spore survival than areas near Lethbridge. This
    enables Pst to overwinter in this region, and cause outbreaks in early spring
    when the weather is cool and wet (Conner et al., 1988; Phillips and Newlands,
    2011; Xi et al., 2015). Significant snow cover (>7.6 cm) has an insulative effect,
    enabling Pst to infect wheat within 4–6 h and survive at temperatures down to
    −10°C. With no snow cover and with temperatures less than −5°C, Pst goes dormant
    (Sharma-Poudyal et al., 2014). Newer isolates have thus adapted to warmer temperatures
    and have higher germination rates at higher temperatures than older isolates.
    The definition of latent period is the approximate time taken for an infection
    to result in new spores and is temperature-dependent; within an optimal temperature
    range between 12 and 20°C. Latent period is 10–14 days (Anonymous, 2018) and is
    cultivar-dependent; a susceptible cultivar AC Bellatrix of red winter wheat (first
    released by AAFC in Lethbridge in 1999) was shorter at higher temperature for
    new isolates, with a higher disease intensity over time for new isolates, compared
    to older ones (i.e., measured as the area under the disease progress curve or
    AUDPC) (Tran and Kutcher, 2015). This evidence supports the hypothesis that new
    stripe rust populations continue to adapt to warming temperatures, with increased
    aggressiveness and explains its expansion into Alberta, including other Canadian
    Prairie Provinces (i.e., Western Saskatchewan). For Eastern Saskatchewan and Manitoba
    the source of Pst is from the Mississippi Valley, recent field surveys conducted
    during July, August, and September 2016 on winter and spring wheat indicate that
    Pst is found with varying levels of infection depending on spatial location. Winter
    wheat lines, depending on location and cultivar, can have upwards of 70% infection
    (2016 Cereal Disease Situation Report, Western Committee on Plant Disease, WCPD.
    Unpubl.). A recent global analysis of Pst outbreaks involving 887 genetically
    diverse isolates across 35 countries (2009–2005) reveals that a few, highly divergent
    genetic races are driving its epidemics and that its populations are being largely
    shaped by invasion across geographical areas (Ali et al., 2017). With such high
    epidemic potential, there is greater urgent need for improved predictability of
    its emergence and dynamics. Study Region (Southern Alberta, Canada) The region
    of interest (hereafter, ROI) is southern Alberta (within Western Canada), a major
    area of agricultural production with a growing season of about 123 days (May-August).
    Wheat is the largest crop, followed by barley and canola. Crops are irrigated
    in this region due to reduced rainfall (semi-arid conditions: 300–450 mm/year).
    In 2015, adverse weather conditions (i.e., dry spring, low night-time temperatures
    and frost in fields, hot summer with limited moisture) led to poor growing conditions
    with yields being lower than long term averages. It first affects winter wheat
    fields before spreading into spring wheat, as winter wheat (e.g., AC Bellatrix
    and Radiant varieties) is direct-seeded in early September and harvested several
    weeks earlier than spring wheat the next year. Pst immigrates into this region
    from the south (i.e., PNW and areas in the vicinity of Portland, Oregon), as well
    as, from the north where it overwinters in central Alberta. Backward, diagnostic
    trajectories (5-day time frames) using analyzed wind fields, indicate that Pst
    within the NWR of the United States is the main Pst source region for southern
    Alberta, Canada (AAFC Cereal Rust/Wind Trajectory Event Update Report (Summer
    2015) by Turkington et al. Unpubl.). Also, forward, prognostic trajectories using
    NOAA''s HYSPLIT model (April-May, 1995) and forecast wind fields (discrete fields
    700–850 hPa) having starting points within the PNW region (vicinity of Portland,
    Oregon USA) show an immigration zone for high potential for spore dispersion into
    southern Alberta (not included here for brevity, Newlands unpubl.). These simulations
    use archived (2-hourly) weather data from Regional Analysis and Forecast System
    (RAFS)''s Nested Grid Model (NGM) (US National Centers for Environmental Prediction,
    NCEP). The atmospheric deposition of spores onto the ground still needs to be
    accounted for, using models such as the one developed by Chamecki et al. (2012)
    to know more accurately where and when they fall. Airborne inoculum sample data
    (weekly, June-October) was obtained for 2015 at Lethbridge (Fairfield site: N
    49° 42.493/ W 112° 41.738) from the first year of sampling (Figure 2) with sticky
    microscope slides placed on a Burkard cyclone spore collector. This is considered
    a passive method of spore trapping/collection, instead of active sampling of the
    air. The slides were attached on the cap of the Burkard cyclone instrument, just
    below the collection orifice, so that the slide was always facing the prevailing
    wind (i.e., 180° incidence angle). Double-sided adhesive tape (#M Scotch® Removable
    Poster Tape 3/4′ (199 mm) wide, clear) was used. The adhesive tape covered almost
    the whole translucid surface of the slide, covering an area of 19 × 50 mm. The
    slides were kept inside a slide box at room temperature for a few days until they
    were analyzed under a light microscope (Laroche et al., 2018). While it could
    have been located anywhere in the study region for the entire growing season,
    it was fixed in its location in an agricultural field (Fairfield) located in Lethbridge,
    given the high Pst visual occurrence historically detected in fields near this
    site. Microscopy, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and multiplex qPCR molecular
    techniques were used to identify Pst urediniospores and quantify the concentration
    of spores collected by the cyclone collector instrument (Araujo et al., 2016)
    (PCR is a technique to make many copies of a specific DNA region in vitro). figure
    2 FIGURE 2. The southern Alberta, Canada region of interest (ROI): The Lethbridge
    site (located within township TW008R21W4) is indicated; areas where wheat (winter,
    spring) are grown are indicated (brown) superimposed on a grid of Alberta townships
    (~10 km). A sub-region of 40 municipalities was selected surrounding the Lethbridge
    site for model computations (upper inset). Satellite measurements of major disease
    risk variables (i.e., canopy temperature and liquid water on the canopy surface)
    (Laroche et al., 2018), regional-scale climate reanalysis (Kobayashi et al., 2015),
    and quality-controlled weather station network data (hourly scale), spatially-interpolated
    to the regional municipality scale were provided by the Alberta Climate Information
    Service (ACIS) (1961-2016)1. The ACIS interpolation method linearly weights station-based
    air temperature estimates of up to 8 closest neighboring stations by inverse-distance,
    within a correlation radius of 60 km. Precipitation is inversely-weighted by distance
    (i.e., cube of the inverse distance within a correlation radius of 200 km), with
    the inverse distance monthly totals redistributed proportionally, relative to
    the nearest station with a complete monthly record. The JRA-Year Reanalysis (JRA-55)
    high-resolution, climate reanalysis dataset was used, being among the most sophisticated
    reanalyses currently available. It also includes pathology-relevant variables
    with a spatial resolution of 0.55° × 0.55° (~55 km) and 3-hourly (and 6-hourly)
    temporal resolution for years 1990-2015 (Bebber et al., 2016). Figure 3 compares
    the distribution of potential disease risk based simply on climate variables (i.e.,
    thresholds in mean daily temperature and humidity range) illustrating how the
    importance of finer resolution in revealing spatial trends and correlation patterns,
    and the need to model such spatial impacts to predict disease risk rather than
    relying on climate threshold-based information alone. Simple thresholds are typically
    assumed in many current operational, weather-based disease risk forecasting systems,
    avoiding the use of models with assumptions of pathogen-host-environmental interaction
    that adds additional uncertainty to risk forecasts. The finer-scale pattern of
    potential Pst pathogen infection risk revealed across the townships (~10 km) varies
    considerably from the host (i.e., wheat) distribution pattern, pointing to the
    need and importance of disease risk modeling to explain and better predict differences
    in host and pathogen distribution and variability in relation to environmental
    (e.g., climate) uncertainty (Figure 2). Also, information on fungicide efficacy
    in relation to spray timing and varietal response for stripe rust control is limited
    in central Alberta, contributing additional uncertainty (Xi et al., 2015). figure
    3 FIGURE 3. Spatial distribution of potential Pst infection risk between June
    17 and Sept 1 in 2015 (in units of total number of growing season days having
    conditions favorable to infection). The total number of growing season days was
    based on threshold range of mean daily temperature 3–25oC, average humidity >57%
    (ACIS) and hourly canopy moisture >0 (wet days) (JRA-55), illustrating the effect
    of spatial resolution and importance of capturing spatial dependence (in finer-scale
    climate data) for improving model-based disease prediction. (ESRI ArcGIS 10.4,
    Canada Albers Equal Area Conic Projection). Hourly leaf wetness duration (LWD)
    and canopy temperature (Tc) data was obtained from the JRA-55 reanalysis dataset.
    Canopy moisture (kg m−2) and temperature (°C) was converted2 from the JRA-55 variables
    named “moisture storage on canopy” (code 223) (m) and “canopy temperature” (code
    114) (K) from the ground/land surface forecast fields (fcst_land125) produced
    every 3 h (at 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, and 21UTC) (Figure 4). Leaf wetness
    duration (LWD) is highly skewed, with many dry days (Figure 4A). Leaf wetness
    is the presence of free water on the surface of a crop canopy comprising canopy-intercepted
    rainfall/fog, irrigation, and dew (dewfall/dew-rise) that forms on leaves where
    water vapor condenses on a surface; it is triggered when the temperature of a
    canopy surface drops below the dew point temperature of the surrounding air (Rolandson
    et al., 2015). In June-Oct of 2015, coinciding with the airborne sampling measurement,
    the majority of wetness events were below 0.001 m (or 0.10 kg m−2) early in the
    season (June), but increases through the season reaching 0.30–0.35 kg m−2 at end-of-season
    (August-Oct) (Figure 4B). There were 54 days with rainfall (of 77 total of airborne
    sampling in 2015). Canopy temperature showed considerable variability through
    the 2015 growing season (Figure 4C). figure 4 FIGURE 4. (A) Growing season wetness
    duration (h) distribution, (B) canopy wetness (m), and (C) temperature (oC) within
    the modeled ROI comprising 40 townships within the 2015 growing season, surrounding
    the Lethbridge site. CLR Model (Site-Specific) A site-specific model was first
    evaluated in predicting Pst disease. This model has previously been used to predict
    disease risk and a historical 2008-2011 outbreak of Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR, Hemileia
    vastatrix) in Colombia (Bebber et al., 2016) (hereafter, CLR model). The CLR model
    assumes infection by germinated fungal spores occurring on leaves that are wet
    for longer than a critical leaf wetness duration (Wcrit or LWDcrit) and specifies
    a temperature response function [(Yan and Hunt, 1999) Type] of germination and
    infection based on pathogen-specific minimum, maximum and optimum temperature
    (θmin, θopt, θmax). Sensitivity analysis of a generic fungal model for Pst using
    these variables lends further support for their use in predicting Pst disease
    dynamics (Bregaglio et al., 2012). The model assumes: temperature is assumed constant
    over each hourly interval, an equal size of new spore cohorts that being germinating
    at the start of each wet hour, and no germination during dry periods, with no
    neighbor infections. The process of spore germination and appressoria formation
    (i.e., infection) over time is modeled as a Weibull-distributed survival process.
    This generates a cumulative hazard function having germination and infection processes
    that are time-varying and random, with rates that are greatest at θopt and decline
    to zero outside of the temperature range (θmin, θmax). Disease development is
    thus assumed to be dormant until the temperature moves back within the required
    range. The CLR model was implemented using validated R code [(Bebber et al., 2016;
    R Core Team, 2017) (includes supplement and example R code)] with the critical
    wetness, temperature-response, and germination/infection process (Weibull-distribution)
    parameters estimated for Pst, using the JRA-55 reanalysis 3-hourly climate data.
    hhh4 Model (Spatial) The hhh4 spatio-temporal endemic-epidemic model having spatial
    dependence assumptions was selected to compare with the CLR site-specific model
    predictions. This model has been implemented in the surveillance R package (Held
    and Paul, 2012; Paul and Meyer, 2016; Meyer S. et al., 2017). Separate runs of
    the model using JRA-55 reanalysis (~55 km), ACIS station-based township (~10 km)
    climate data as input, and both datasets combined, were performed to benchmark
    the effect of the spatial resolution of input climate data on disease model accuracy.
    The hhh4 model is a multivariate time-series model for disease incidence, Yit
    involving multiple, geographical sub-regions (e.g., units of townships or fields),
    i = (1,…,I), across multiple time periods t = (1,…,T). It assumes a negative-binomial
    (i.e., clustered) distribution of spore counts, with an additive mean (Meyer S.
    et al., 2017), μ it = e it ν  it + λ it Y i,t−1 + ϕ it ∑ j≠i w ji Y j,t−1     (1)
    and the over-dispersion parameter, ψi. The additive mean μit consists of an endemic
    (eit νit) and epidemic ( λ it Y i,t−1 + ϕ it ∑ j≠i w ji Y j,t−1 ) component, where
    eit is the expected counts (i.e., a multiplicative offset to the endemic mean
    νit). The epidemic component consists of two autoregressive spatial effects, namely:
    disease reproduction within region i, and a neighborhood or spatial-temporal interaction
    effect involving spore transmission to other region j. The disease endemic and
    epidemic contributions can be assumed identical across regions, vary within each
    region, random, or correlated between regions, by representing them as log-linear
    functions having intercept, αi and associated predictor variables, whereby, log(
    ν it )= α (ν) i + β (ν) T z (ν) it ,     (2) log( λ it )= α (λ) i + β (ν) T z
    (λ) it ,      (3) log( ϕ it )= α (ϕ) i + β (ν) T z (ϕ) it ,      (4) where T denotes
    the transpose of a weight vector β(ν) for covariate vector z (ν) it .If the epidemic
    parameters, λ = exp(α(λ)) and ϕ = exp(α(ϕ)) are assumed homogeneous across all
    sub-regions, and constant over time (i.e., λit = λ, = ϕ, ∀i, t), an underlying,
    seasonal temporal trend effecting all regions equally at time t with annual frequency,
    ω = 2π/52. Infection transmission is assumed to occur only between directly adjacent
    townships (wji = I), where I is the identity matrix, then Equation (1) and its
    component log-linear predictor (Equation 2), becomes (Meyer S. et al., 2017),
    μ it = e it ν  it +λ Y i,t−1 + ϕ it ∑ j≠i w ji Y j,t−1     (5) log( ν t )= α (ν)
    + β t t+γsin(ωt)+δcos(ωt)     (6) For this homogeneous version of the hhh4 model,
    weather/climate variables are used to determine the initial infection profile
    in each township (Equation 5) and then scaling adjustments to these township profiles
    are made as the model simulation proceeds, whereas the heterogeneous model inputs
    the weather/climate variables in the covariate vector of the log-linear equations
    (Equations 2–4). A susceptibility correction to this homogeneous version of the
    hhh4 model was considered that assumes a township-specific proportion (1−νi) as
    a proxy for the susceptible population. Model simulations (i.e., independent runs)
    were performed with and without a susceptibility correction (i.e., a specific
    percentage or population susceptible to disease) to gauge how susceptibility assumptions
    affect model accuracy. This susceptible proportion can be accounted for either
    as an offset to the endemic population i.e., (1−νi) (i.e., resulting in a form
    of the model having a multiplicative offset and log-linear covariates), or as
    an offset to the autoregressive component of the model (i.e., resulting in a model
    form that has endemic and/or autoregressive effects). Susceptibility modifies
    the endemic effect through the substitution of this component with this offset
    (refer to Equation 1), whereby, e it  ν it ← (1− ν i ) β s e i     (7) Alternatively,
    it can be considered as an offset to the epidemic component (i.e., an autoregressive/covariate
    effect), λ it Y i,t−1 ← exp( α (λ) + β s log(1− ν i )) Y i,t−1                =exp(
    α (λ) )  (1− ν i ) β s Y i,t−1     (8) where, βs≥1 is a power effect of high proportion
    of susceptible populations in sub-region i which boost new infections (Meyer S.
    et al., 2017). The arrow in Equations (7, 8) indicates replacement of the left
    side terms by the right side terms when susceptibility is considered as a model
    parameter. Both of these candidate models were evaluated in accounting for wheat
    cultivar/host susceptibility for Pst in the ROI, with the best-performing model
    (same dataset) selected by maximizing the likelihood/minimizing the Akaike Information
    Criterion (AIC) that corrects for variance due to the total estimated number of
    model parameters. The hhh4 model (homogeneous) has the seven parameters: (λ, ϕ,
    ν, exp(βt), A, φ, ψi), where the two sinusoidal terms of the seasonality-adjustment
    in Equation (6) are combined into a sinusoidal wave of amplitude A and phase shift
    φ. Considering susceptibility adds one more model parameter, whether included
    as an offset (βs = 1), or as a covariate (βs estimated). The Akaike Information
    Criterion (AIC) was used in measuring model accuracy and performance (e.g., best
    and worst cases) of the hhh4 model (R stats library). Infection within each township
    was modified both by changes in the hhh4 model parameters and subregion climate
    variability. Five competing cases were evaluated: Case 1 (JRA hourly reanalysis
    climate) Case 2 (ACIS daily station-based climate input) Case 3 (combined JRA
    and ACIS) Case 4 (Case 3 with susceptibility offset correction) Case 5 (Case 3
    with susceptibility covariate correction) The climate variables selected to drive
    the model differed depending in each of the cases above, depending on which dataset
    was used (JRA coarse-scale and/or ACIS fine-scale) and whether the climate variables
    was hourly or daily. For case 1, JRA hourly mean, minimum and maximum canopy temperature,
    and leaf wetness duration (LWD) were used to drive the model, For case 2, ACIS
    daily mean, minimum and maximum temperature and daily relative humidity were used.
    For case 3, JRA hourly mean, minimum and maximum canopy temperature and leaf wetness
    duration were used to determine the infection profile for a given township using
    the temperature response function and assumptions of the CLR site-specific model.
    This was in addition to ACIS daily mean temperature and humidity for determining
    initial infection profiles in each township before the model was simulated and
    dynamical scaling adjustments made. As the JRA data was hourly and ACIS data was
    daily, this model case after initialization was then simulated at a common (i.e.,
    weekly) aggregation scale, with the two datasets combined using simple, non-weighted
    averaging to avoid introducing any aggregation bias. Cases 4 and 5 used the same
    climate variables as in case 3, but with additional susceptibility corrections
    [i.e., case 4 with susceptibility correction as an offset (Equation 7) and case
    5, with it introduced as an additional covariate (Equation 8)]. For the models
    and their various cases, Table 1 provides a summary of input datasets, variable
    inputs, fixed parameters, data, and model spatial and temporal resolutions. table
    1 TABLE 1. A summary of input datasets, climate variable inputs, fixed parameters,
    data and model spatial, and temporal resolutions. For the best-case, One-Step-Ahead
    forecasting was performed to approximate forecast error covariance. This was performed
    assuming a lead-time of a partial (1–4 weeks) and full season (1–11 weeks) time-window.
    The partial time-window could apply when forecasting disease within a growing
    season, while the longer time-window could apply when using data from a previous
    season in forecasting a future season. Four different statistical metrics or “scores”
    were evaluated in measuring the discrepancy between a model''s predictive (i.e.,
    “future” prediction is also termed a “forecast”) distribution, μP, and future
    observed value, y, namely: squared-error score (ses), logarithmic score (logs),
    Dawid-Sebastian (dss), and ranked-probability score (rps), given by, ses:  (y−
    μ P ) 2 logs:  (y− μ P ) σ 2 p 2 +2log σ p dss:  (y− μ P ) 2 σ 2 p 2 +2log σ p
    + 1 2 log2π rps:  E cdf,P |Y−y|− 1 2 E cdf,P |Y−Y''|     (9) Y and Y′ are independent
    random variables associated with the distribution function p, y is a future “observed”
    or measured value, and μP and σ 2 p are the mean and variance of the predictive
    (i.e., forecast) distribution, p. Both the location and spread of the forecast
    distribution are taken into account by the logs, dss and rps scores in judging
    how close the distribution is to the observed value. The rps score uses the predictive
    cumulative density function (cdf) and reduces to absolute error if p is a point-forecast
    rather than a distribution-forecast. It measures how well probability distribution-based
    forecasts match observed outcomes. These scores are summary measures of the predictive
    performance that allow for the joint assessment of calibration and sharpness are
    reviewed by Gneiting and Katzfuss (2014) and were computed using the surveillance
    R library package (Meyer S. et al., 2017). Lower scores indicate a model that
    has better predictive power, with mean scores used to identify a model with the
    best (i.e., minimal) forecast accuracy. Results Temperature response function
    parameters (θmin, θopt, θmax) for germination and appressorium formation (i.e.,
    infection) were estimated using data, as (5.91, 15.41, 33.94) for germination,
    and (5.57, 15.57, 32.11) for infection (de Vallavieille-Pope et al., 1995). This
    optimal germination temperature range lies within the reported range (i.e., 16–18°C)
    of post-2000 Pst survival/occurrence at warmer temperatures (Chen, 2005; Xi et
    al., 2015) and previous reported estimates of (2.6,8.5,18) (Bregaglio et al.,
    2011). Critical wetness duration (Wcrit) was set at 4 h, as a lower bound to the
    Pst reported range of 5–8 h (Bregaglio et al., 2011; Rolandson et al., 2015).
    The 4 h wetness duration estimate coincides with the timing of a rapid increase
    in infection for Pst, confirmed by experimental data under controlled conditions
    (de Vallavieille-Pope et al., 1995). This estimate also is close to observed mean
    wetness duration distribution peak for the ROI (Figure 4C). Risk distribution
    parameters (i.e., Weibull-distribution) of scale (α) and shape (γ) were estimated
    (α, γ), for germination as (13.36, 1.29) and for infection as (19.1, 2.14). The
    CLR (site-specific) model predictions (Figure 5) (scaled) are compared to observed
    Pst spore profile, collected at the Lethbridge site (Fairfield) during the 2015
    wheat growing season [AIC = −749.47, root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) = 312.92].

    0–1), compared to the observed Pst airborne inoculum counts/profile collected
    at Lethbridge during the 2015 wheat growing season. Best-fit estimates (and associated
    Standard Error) of the spatial model parameters are summarized for the 5 cases
    considered (Table 2). AIC values are provided under each case number in brackets.
    The predicted Pst spore population (for township region that contains the Lethbridge
    sampling site) through June-October for the 2015 growing season is shown against
    the observed Pst/airborne inoculum profile collected at the Lethbridge site (Figure
    6A). Variability in these model predictions (case 3) for neighboring regions surrounding
    the Lethbridge township is shown for this particular season (2015) and subregion,
    to be strongly endemic, with low autoregressive and transmission contributions
    from neighboring regions (Figure 6B). Estimates forecast scores obtained from
    one-step-ahead model forecasting are summarized in b. The two different lead-times
    assume: (i) only Pst population information for the first few weeks (i.e., weeks
    1–4 occurring before the main infection peak) is available, and (ii) full data
    for the entire season is available. table 2 TABLE 2. Best-fit estimates of the
    hhh4 homogeneous model parameters (Equations 5, 6) and associated Standard Errors

    ϕ = exp(α(ϕ))] contributions are shown for each of the cases considered: case
    1—JRA reanalysis only (∼55 km), case 2—ACIS climate only (∼10 km), and case 3—multiscale
    with both JRA and ACIS, and two susceptibility corrections of the best-fitting
    homogeneous model i.e., case 3 (indicated by *) (case 4—offset type, case 5—covariate
    type). figure 6 FIGURE 6. (A) Spatial model predictions of the hhh4 model for
    cases 1–3 with different climate input data are shown compared to observed at
    the Lethbridge collection site, (B) Predicted Pst disease incidence (scaled 0–1)
    within the Lethbridge township (TW008R21W4) and its neighboring townships for
    the best-fitting model (case 3) vs. number of weeks. Variability in the endemic,
    autoregressive, and spatio-temporal contributions are shown driven by climate
    variability across the regions. Discussion The site-specific model (CLR) with
    the coarser JRA reanalysis input was able to reproduce the general shape of the
    observed Pst detection (2015 at Lethbridge) based on the assumptions of critical
    thresholds of wetness and temperature-response, and independent, Weibull-distributed
    germination/infection processes (Figure 5). The model predicts the rate of infection
    (slope of mid-season peak) well, but predicts a narrower peak width (timing of
    main infection peak rise and fall) and predicts peak infection a week earlier
    than it occurred. Predictions of the model are more variable during the early-
    and late-season, which is attributed to higher variability in the weather conditions
    (i.e., fluctuations in canopy wetness and temperature shown in Figures 4B,C).
    Using the same coarse JRA climate input data, the spatial hhh4 model with spatial
    transmission assumptions (case 1), while not the best fit obtained to the observed
    infection curve, like the CLR site-specific model, does also predict a narrow
    peak. However, the hhh4 model predictions are less variable in early/late season
    and it predicts peak infection time correctly (Figure 6). This indicates that
    assumptions on how Pst immigrates, overwinters and moves between subregions, are
    important for accurately determining both infection variability in early/late
    season as well as the timing of peak infection. Changing the spatial resolution
    of climate input data (i.e., from JRA regional-scale in case 1 to finer ACIS township-scale
    in case 2), improved the prediction of width of the infection peak, which is especially
    crucial, as it is at this time that disease dynamics can switch from an endemic,
    to an epidemic disease occurrence pattern. Finer scale climate input improved
    the ability of the spatial hhh4 model to predict Pst disease dynamics (case 2
    vs. case 1) (Figure 6). The best-performing model (hhh4 case 3 with lowest AIC)
    (Table 2) had the strongest endemic contribution (initial deposition followed
    by weak transmission of Pst through the growing season, measured at the Lethbridge
    site). Comparing AIC values for the various cases of the hhh4 model (see Table
    2) in terms of relative gain in accuracy [i.e., (|AICold-AICnew|/|AICold|) x100%,
    where AICold denotes the model with the higher AIC, and AICnew the improved model
    with the lower AIC] provides quantification of the various improvements (spatial
    and temporal resolution, and inclusion of a susceptibility correction as an offset
    or covariate). Changing spatial resolution (55 km to township/10 km) and temporal
    resolution (hourly to daily) led to a relative improvement in accuracy (relative
    reduction in AIC) of 64% (case 2 vs. case 1). A further relative accuracy gain
    of 89% was achieved by combining information at different spatial and temporal
    scale (i.e., hourly and daily, 55 km and township/10 km) (multi-scale case 3 vs.
    case 2). Correcting for susceptibility as an offset led to a relative accuracy
    gain of < 1% , and no change as a covariate, but these quantified changes are
    more unreliable due to associated increases in the standard error of model parameters.
    Overall all cases, the best case (Case 3) was identified or defined as the model
    case that had the lowest AIC value or highest forecast accuracy) used multi-scale
    JRA and ACIS data and assumed no correction for susceptibility. The worst-case
    (Case 1) was identified as the model case that had the highest AIC value or lowest
    forecast accuracy using only JRA data and assuming no correction for sustainability.
    Case 3 not only obtained the lowest AIC, but also produced more accurate estimates
    of the endemic parameter (smaller standard error). This case explains the data
    the best (with the lowest AIC) as having weak epidemic components, but strong
    endemic component, even though the standard error in some model parameters relative
    to their estimated value increased. Case 3, with the lowest AIC value (best case
    model), when compared to the highest AIC value (Case 1 worst case model) has a
    relative overall gain of 93.4% in model accuracy. The small accuracy improvement
    offered by a susceptibility correction could be, in part, due to the homogeneous
    modeling assumptions. Accounting for susceptibility in the best-fit model (case
    3), reduced model accuracy only slightly. More observed airborne inoculum sampling
    data would considerably reduce the high standard error (SE) of the intercept and
    susceptibility coefficient parameters ( α (ν) , β s ) . Considering susceptibility
    as an endemic offset, rather than an epidemic autoregressive/covariate effect,
    produced a model with slightly higher accuracy. This was largely determined, however,
    by weather variability. Accounting for susceptibility increased the uncertainty
    in the endemic parameter considerably, pointing to the need for heterogeneous
    assumptions, alongside a larger data from Pst airborne surveillance in the region
    to reduce it. This also indicates that the susceptibility parameter is a useful
    metric for gauging disease risk and determining where to optimally monitor for
    Pst across the entire ROI. Additional susceptibility effects could be considered
    if heterogeneous assumptions were considered in the hhh4 model, whereby a multi-variate,
    “susceptibility function” could be defined (i.e., that further modifies Equations
    7, 8). This function could integrate specific-cultivar attributes and/or fungicide
    control/spray data, and potential canopy changes due to disease detected from
    available vegetation index satellite data (Davidson, 2015; Devadas et al., 2015).
    More complex forms of the hhh4 spatial model with spatial-interaction assumptions,
    heterogeneity driven by long-range transmission, and higher-order neighbors/transmission
    across sub-regions (power law or second-order model) could be considered. Also,
    independent random effects uncertainty could be included that typically results
    from unobserved heterogeneity due to under-reporting of disease occurrence. The
    hhh3 case 3 model (relying on multi-resolution climate data and spatial dependence
    assumptions) had reasonable ranges of the predictive assessment scores (Table
    3). Based on a test period of 4 weeks (i.e., in June-July in advance of peak infection)
    the best-fit model is able to forecast with 50% accuracy (using the full window
    of 11 weeks as a benchmark). This forecast accuracy was achieved using airborne
    inoculum data for a single site and season, alongside disease, environment and
    susceptibility assumptions. A larger dataset of Pst infection data would enable
    a more reliable determination of the forecast accuracy of this model and reliable
    attribution of forecast error to environmental (i.e., climate/weather) variability,
    and/or host-pathogen disease dynamics. table 3 TABLE 3. Performance of model-based
    forecasting (4 scores) for Pst disease (i.e., disease risk) within southern Alberta
    in 2015 for a partial and complete season lead-time, using the best training case
    (case 3) of the hhh4 model. In summary, the integrated framework proposed offers
    a feasible way to combine diverse datasets and models with a wide range of assumptions
    to explain variability and uncertainty in observed disease incidence patterns
    and to forecast risk. Current findings show that the more complex, stochastic
    model (hhh4) using weather station network data with susceptibility correction
    provides sufficient accuracy and reliability. Machine-learning may further improve
    model-based disease risk forecasting under highly unpredictable weather or management
    regimes (Liao and Ji, 2009; Wen et al., 2017). Testing the feasibility of this
    framework and modeling approach relied on limited airborne inoculum data for Pst
    (i.e., available and high-quality controlled data from the recent 2015 season
    at Lethbridge) and homogeneous assumptions. Nonetheless, this is the first time
    such data has been collected for Pst in this region of interest. Current findings
    are supported by the integration of knowledge, parameter estimates, multiple evidence
    sources (i.e., published empirical data on Pst, included latest available, quality-controlled
    climate, satellite and airborne inoculum). An expanded evaluation of model-based
    forecast accuracy will require a large, seasonal airborne surveillance program
    and heterogeneous assumptions. Heterogeneous assumptions would help to fine-scale
    incidence and risk variability based on measured changes in endemic-epidemic transition
    time, maximum infection potential, infection peak timing, and width between regions.
    The most accurate, efficient, and cost-effective airborne surveillance monitoring
    plan may be a multi-resolution sampling design that could sample disease across
    the full extent of a large ROI at a coarser resolution, while sampling denser,
    at a finer resolution within known disease hotspots. This is supported by the
    current findings; the spatial model (case 1) using coarser climate input predicted
    an underlying pattern of Pst occurrence that is under-dispersed (ψi < 1), while
    cases 2 and 3 indicated it is over-dispersed (ψi>1). Given case 3 fit the observed
    data better, a more clumped, concentrated pattern is inferred for Pst based within
    the 2015 growing season. Hotspots could be identified as townships or subregions
    where a disease overwinters/oversummers across a sufficient number of sampling
    seasons, or higher risk clusters of townships within which Pst disease is first
    or early-detected. Susceptibility offsets and covariation provides an important
    spatial-based sustainability metric for gauging subregions where disease risk
    may be highest and where to more intensively sample (Kouadio and Newlands, 2015).
    Extensions of the spatial model could also include viability of inoculum (i.e.,
    variability in the different isolates that are present into a “natural” inoculum).
    In laboratory studies, often a single isolate is used. Field studies can involve
    both a single or composite inoculum; when a composite, one can consider a number
    of different characterized isolates or assume that a field isolate that was present
    in a previous growing season has been amplified (multiplied) and is re-inoculating.
    Also, in further expanded modeling and with the availability of spore data for
    2016-2018, the models could be run for the 2019 growing season to predict disease
    risk, using hourly/daily climate data across all past 4 years where spore data
    was being collected (i.e., 2015-2018). The 2016-18 time period could be then used
    to provide training/calibration data for the models, and uncertainty in the model
    fixed parameters and current season disease risk could be compared to an uncertainty
    range estimated using all past climate information. This would also provide a
    historical prediction range to compare against a current-season prediction range.
    A multi-scale airborne surveillance design that provides data to support operational
    model-based disease risk forecasting, may, in the future, enable more reliable,
    timely and cost-effective decisions in sustaining crop yields against multiple
    disease threats. Developing an integrated understanding of disease risks, impacts,
    consequences (whether anticipated or unanticipated), alongside decision trade-offs,
    could provide crucial, cornerstone insights to controlling crop disease, and increasing
    crop yields sustainably. Author Contributions The author confirms being the sole

    Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 180–188, 2018 INTRODUCTION As communities across the
    US struggle with the challenge of living sustainably, a continuing theme is the
    conflicting needs and impacts of food, energy and water production and use. Keeping
    track of resource conditions across multiple sectors and working to balance resource
    quality with ecosystem health and integrity is expensive and complex. The use
    of Geographical Information System (GIS)-based modeling and autonomous sensor
    arrays for data collection as the backbone for understanding complex relationships
    is one approach being explored by researchers at New York Institute of Technology
    and its partners. Long Island, New York is a good place to field-test such an
    approach. Long Island has many of the factors involved in food, energy and water
    production typical of other parts of the country—all in one place. There are also
    many active programs to collecting environmental data useful for describing local
    conditions and understand how and why they are changing. Although the island of
    Long Island, New York is the largest island in the continental USA1, the two eastern
    counties, Nassau and Suffolk, are the municipalities typically understood to be
    “Long Island.” From west to east, Long Island gradually changes from densely populated
    suburban communities to less dense communities, including the sparsely developed
    Pine Barrens and the farming regions of the east end. Within this diverse setting,
    energy generation facilities are scattered throughout the region. The island is
    substantially but not totally self-sufficient in its energy production. Agricultural
    activities have been a major part of Long Island''s history since the 1600s, and
    Suffolk County is still one of the most productive agricultural economies in the
    state. The water supply is derived from groundwater but the coastal waters and
    beach communities are a strong part of the regional economy, bringing in tourist
    and seasonal residents along with fishing interests for shellfish and finfish.
    In the Peconic Estuary, in eastern Suffolk County, 19 sub-watersheds of the estuary
    had 50% or more of their nitrogen derived from on-site septic systems, while 3
    sub-watersheds had 50% or more attributed to agricultural fertilizer. High concentrations
    of nitrogen promote algal blooms in Long Island Sound and the Peconic Estuary
    which can degrade water quality, kill fish and shellfish, and hurt the fishing
    industry. Furthermore, the Northport and Port Jefferson Power Plants on Long Island
    are petroleum-based power stations that supply power to Long Island. The impact
    of cooling-water discharges from the power plants may increase the temperature
    of the receiving waters which may contribute to toxic algae outbreak. When energy
    demand goes up substantially in the summer, this results in more water use for
    cooling, and becomes a vicious cycle. Part of that electricity is also used for
    pumping of irrigation water used by agriculture and similar activities, such as
    sod farms and nursery businesses. Environmental Conditions and Data Looking at
    the three sectors under consideration—food, water and energy—there are specific
    environmental concerns and impacts associated with each sector on Long Island.
    In the food production arena, Long Island has a history of pollution problems
    caused by agricultural practices. These include groundwater quality impacts from
    fertilizers, pesticides, water table loss and saltwater intrusion. Along the coastline,
    marine waters are also impacted by high-nitrogen agricultural runoff contributing
    to algal blooms (red, brown, blue-green, and mahogany). Massive fish kills have
    occurred in the past few years as algal blooms depleted oxygen and introduced
    toxins into the coastal water systems. These trends in water quality have been
    tracked by Suffolk County Department of Health Services, the Peconic Estuary Program,
    the US Geological Survey (USGS), Stony Brook University Marine Sciences Center,
    and the Farm Bureau along with Cornell Cooperative Extension Service. The drinking
    water is drawn from the Sole Source Aquifer system beneath Long Island. In Suffolk
    County, groundwater data are collected by the Suffolk Department of Health Services,
    the Suffolk County Water Authority, the USGS, and other individual water suppliers.
    It shows a slow decline in raw groundwater quality due to land use activities.
    The primary pollutants of concern include nitrates, volatile organic compounds,
    pesticides, gasoline, and chemical spills (MBTE and BTEX), industrial legacy pollutants,
    and tritium to mention a few. Major power generation plants such as Northport
    and Port Jefferson use substantial amounts of groundwater for steam generation
    and some use for cooling water. The Northport power plant uses 95 million gallons
    of groundwater per year while the Port Jefferson plant uses 53 million gallons
    per year.2 In addition to the groundwater use, power plants on Long Island use
    over 1 billion gallons of saltwater per day for cooling purposes which is discharged
    back to the coastal waters as heated water. When using saltwater for cooling,
    the plants have a substantial impact on local marine life. The Northport power
    plant stands out, affecting over 8 billion fish eggs and larvae and 127,118 adult
    and juvenile fish per year. The Port Jefferson power plant affects over 1 billion
    fish eggs and larvae annually.3 There are at least nine power plants producing
    electricity for Long Island''s use. Additional electricity is imported via cables
    from New Jersey and Upstate New York and beyond. Local power production relies
    on natural gas/oil fired steam electric systems. Oil burning systems are being
    phased out. They have an impact of air quality in a region that violates the Clean
    Air Act for ozone and occasionally carbon monoxide. The Northport power plant
    is the second most polluting plant in the Northeast. It releases 5.2 million metric
    tons of carbon dioxide per year.4 Water conditions are monitored by power companies
    as well as environmental organizations such as Long Island Soundkeeper, NYS Department
    of Environmental Conservation, and the LI Sound Program/US Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA). Understanding the interconnection among the food, energy and water
    sectors requires consistent and reliable data as well as an economical, technically
    feasible measurement and implementation mechanism. This article discusses the
    challenges of using current environmental data collection and proposes a wireless
    sensor network-based autonomous environmental measurement framework. RELATED WORK
    The advance in sensing and networking technology has enabled more efficient ways
    for data acquisition for environment monitoring. In recent years, wireless sensor
    networks have been considered for various aspects of environmental monitoring
    1-5. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were widely used in military applications
    such as reconnaissance and surveillance 6-8. With the cost reduction on rotor-based
    UAVs, more commercial applications have been explored such as shipping, traffic
    monitoring, and environmental sensing 9-13. An overview of sensor-based machine-to-machine
    (M2M) agriculture monitoring systems presented in 14 outlines the design criteria
    such as sensor topology and routing algorithms and applicable scale for various
    monitoring requirements. A framework that uses M2M communication networks by integrating
    sensors in agricultural field with other wireless devices was proposed 14. It
    is integrated with a crop model/decision support system for agriculture use. Different
    schemes have been proposed to provide energy and bandwidth-efficient designs for
    wireless sensor networks for data collection 11, 15-18. Distributed Source Coding
    (DSC) with constrained Viterbi Algorithm (VA-DSC) with both convolutional and
    turbo codes which take advantage of known parity bits to increase the decoding
    performance while reducing decoding errors and computational complexity. The design
    and deployment of a smart system for data collection in estuaries using WSNs to
    monitor salinity changes in estuaries has been designed by Parra et al 16. A FlyPort
    wireless module was developed for the proposed system that collects and sends
    data to a server. The FlyPort is a programmable compact Wi-Fi module based on
    the open source platform, openPICUS. A server application was developed in Java
    capable of receiving data from the sensors and stores them in a database. A connection
    between devices was established using TCP sockets. A new conductivity sensor was
    developed for placement in a discharge plume in order to measure salinity differences
    between fresh water and ocean. Murphy et al. 17 proposed a system which uses WSN
    technology to monitor a beehive colony. The experimental design consists of the
    Libelium “Waspmote” v1.2 platform, a low power XBee Series 2 radio, a solar panel
    for energy harvesting and a battery. Also, three nodes were developed: a general
    hive conditions node; a gas detection node; and a base node for the system. Results
    from a 2-week data collection project showed that their proposed system could
    be adapted to different environments. Solpico et al. 11 have proposed improvements
    to a lake management and aquaculture productivity observation system. The system
    was designed to take measurements from floating field-servers, data from aerial
    imaging and data input from stakeholders. Data are then uploaded to an online
    database through an SMS-based telemetry system. Authors placed floating field-servers
    in Lake Palakpakin, in San Pablo City, Philippines. They monitored for more than
    one year parameters such as conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and turbidity
    at two depths – 0.5 and 2.5 meters. They also developed an event recorder for
    the stakeholders using android phones in order to gather more information of the
    system. A prototype toolkit developed by Si et al. 18, named TeaCP, has been used
    for evaluation and analysis of collection protocols. The toolkit includes packet
    generation rates and transmission power for testing protocols, visualization of
    packet routes, network topology and other statistics. Post experiment analysis
    is also provided with TeaCP. It is tested with both lab experiments which analyze
    and evaluate Collection Tree Protocol, the Backpressure Collection Protocol, and
    real experiments which include 9 sensor nodes that periodically generate data
    and forward it. Experiments showed that users can analyze collection protocols
    and determine unusual attributes with TeaCP. Wireless sensor network has also
    been used to test drinking water safety 19 where the system assesses the water
    quality and sends alert to users when water is not safe to drink. Furthermore,
    efficient node placement strategy balancing energy consumption and end-to-end
    delay of a multi-hop network was developed for autonomous sensing in underwater
    sensor networks 20. This shows great potential for wireless sensor network to
    be adapted in various environment for a large range of water quality measurement.
    WATER QUALITY DATA Water quality is measured by chemical, physical, and biological
    properties of water, sediment and tissue samples. The USGS provides access to
    water quality data at its National Water Information System 21. The USGS water-quality
    data for the national database contains 4.4 million historical water quality collection
    results. It consists of water quality data from thousands of sites ranging from
    daily measurements, historical observations and results from field/lab samples.
    It is worth noting that the data are categorized as “approved” (quality-assured
    and publishable) and “provisional” (unverified accuracy and subject to revision).
    The US EPA Storage and Retrieval and Water Quality Exchange (STORET and WQX) is
    a data warehouse where water quality data from various sources such as EPA, USGS,
    US Department of Agriculture are aggregated and accessible through the WQX framework
    22. Hydrology, physio-chemistry, and biology are three important parts of water
    bodies which provide a thorough characterization of the water body under study.
    A complete assessment of water quality depends on applicable monitoring of these
    parts. Broadly, assessments can be categorized into two classes: use-orientated
    and impact-orientated. Choosing appropriate characteristic variables for any water
    quality assessment program relies on the objectives of the system 23. A suitable
    choice of variables will help to meet the objectives proficiently and in the most
    cost effective way. Use-orientated assessment tests whether water quality is agreeable
    for particular purposes such as drinking water supply, mechanical/industrial use
    or other commercial needs. Public water utilities have specific requirements for
    the physical and chemical characteristics of a water resource as well as for the
    presence of specific pollutants. Water quality is defined by codes established
    by local, state and federal rules and regulations. In New York State, the public
    health code defines acceptable water quality for drinking water. The NYS Department
    of Environmental Conservation sets the standards for coastal water quality. Impact-oriented
    assessments regularly look at the impacts of particular activities on water quality.
    Commonly, such an assessment examines pollutant discharges from a variety of sources
    such as urban, suburban or rural run-off or unplanned contamination accidents.
    These discharges may be regulated through permit programs or may be unregulated,
    generalized runoff, often related to wet weather events. If large enough, these
    releases can have notable impacts on the local receiving water quality. To understand
    the impacts, it is helpful to understand water quality conditions prior to anthropogenic
    inputs. The objective of this study is to find a correlation between water quality
    measurements and observed impacts from point and non-point sources within a targeted
    area. In order to observe changes in water bodies, a complete characterization
    of water quality that involves many different variable measurements is needed.
    The assessment variables used in this study were based on the recommended tables
    by Chapman 23 who developed a guide for environmental monitoring. Tables 3.8.
    and 3.9 of his report provided a range of 20 to 40 different variable types based
    on measurement location. As a preliminary step, this study reviewed water quality
    data queried from the EPA WQX framework. It focused on data for Nassau and Suffolk
    counties in New York State. The database was queried for water quality information
    from all types of organizations and stations, measured between 2000 and 2016.
    Water was the activity medium in the query, including all types of activities
    and community sampled, information as characteristic group type and nutrients
    as characteristic type. A total of 1,069,241 water quality measurement records
    were reviewed, which included 179 different locations and 161 different characteristic
    descriptions. Among these data records, we observed the following challenges in
    using the data for this correlation and modeling study to connect the food, energy,
    and water relations: Few locations have a sufficient number of meaningful measurements,
    especially for nutrient measurements, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. which
    can provide insights into agriculture runoff and wastewater discharge. Data collection
    can be sparse. Most sites showed that much more data were collected during summer
    than other seasons. Various sampling rates resulted in inconsistent data during
    the same measurement time and at the same location for many sites. Eleven monitoring
    locations were selected in Long Island Sound, as shown in Figure 1, to show the
    properties of data. In this article, sample locations are identified as Lx, where
    x is the location number. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Selected water
    quality measurement locations in the Long Island Sound. [Color figure can be viewed
    at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The study extracted and analyzed temperature, salinity,
    dissolved oxygen and pH data for the 11 locations in the Long Island Sound. The
    coordinates of this location are provided in Table 1. Table 1. Coordinates of
    the 11 selected locations. Location Latitude Longitude L1 40.99 −73.04 L2 41.02

    show a few examples of the data challenges for scientific study for FEW connections.
    Figure 2 compares the measurement data at L2 and L11. The x-axis is time (years).
    The y axis is the measurement data for temperature (°C) and salinity (in practical
    salinity unit) on the left, and dissolved oxygen (mg/L) and pH labeled on the
    right. As shown in Figure 2, there are different amounts of data collected at
    these two different locations. Data were not collected at a constant period. For
    L11, there were no data available from 2011 to 2008. This large chunk of missing
    measurement data is typical of many locations in the data set. Figure 2 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Sample data set expose data challenges—missing measurement.
    [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] In order to observe patterns
    within the data, a few water quality parameters were selected to show if there
    are spatial or temporal trends for certain characteristics that may be correlated
    to weather, agriculture, and other industrial activities or events. Statistical
    analysis was used to show changes for water quality characteristics over multiple
    years. The data was filtered by location, time, and characteristics. The biggest
    challenges with using data available from the EPA database were: data readings
    were very limited at many locations making it difficult to generate meaningful
    results. Especially with respect to nutrients, it was not possible to make any
    meaningful assessment due to the limited data available. Some other challenges
    include: the majority of readings were taken during summer periods at most locations.
    This was true even for locations that had information that extended throughout
    the year. Also, data are not consistent at many locations; some locations have
    one year of missing data while others have up to 5 years missing data during the
    period that was investigated. There isn''t a consistent time established for taking
    samples and sampling amounts vary every year at every location. There are many
    simultaneous inputs of different values for the same locations at the same time.
    This raises the concern of reliability of data sources. These limitations led
    us to focus on readings for a few parameters such as temperature, salinity, dissolved
    oxygen and pH characteristics that have ample data records in August for the years
    2009 to 2014. Table 2 shows the number of data records available at each location
    studied in this paper, from 2009 to 2013 for each water quality characteristic.

    data of two locations in the Long Island Sounds. [Color figure can be viewed at

    DO, pH and salinity observed at these locations show the following: There is an
    increase trend for water temperature median value at every location. L11, located
    further away from heavily populated areas, has higher dissolved oxygen values
    than other locations. Lowest pH values were observed in 2013 at every location.
    Salinity values also seem to increase throughout the years at every location,
    L11 has higher salinity values than other locations. Measurement location closer
    to the shore and near populated areas, temperature values seems to get higher
    and dissolved oxygen seems to decrease. This preliminary study on the existing
    water quality data showed that more consistent, synchronous and periodical measurements
    are needed in order to support the modeling to be used to establish a correlation
    between agriculture activities, energy production, and water quality. Water quality
    changes may happen in multi-scale time periods, such as within a day, week, month,
    season, or year. A fine-grained data collection system will support modeling of
    various food, energy, and water related parameters to formulate causal functions
    to identify normal vs. abnormal changes in water quality. PROPOSED AUTONOMOUS
    SENSING FRAMEWORK The lack of fine grained data both spatially and temporally
    to support more accurate modeling is generating interests in the research community
    to design new autonomous measurement techniques to understand the interconnection
    among the food, energy, and water components 24, 25. The emerging technical trend
    of the Internet of Things is enabling a large number of sensors to be deployed
    in various infrastructures and environments to monitor parameters that can portray
    the health and connectedness of these three activities. This article proposes
    a framework that integrates sensor networks with remote sensing through the use
    of UAV for automated environmental data collection. As shown in Figure 4, the
    framework is composed of three layers: the wireless sensor network (WSN) layer
    is the lower layer deployed in the field for in-situ data collection; the drone
    layer is the middle layer responsible for remote sensing that guides sensor placement,
    data transmission and WSN maintenance; and a cloud computing layer responsible
    for data storage, aggregation and analysis. The work flow follows these steps:
    (1) a general areal mapping of the interested region through remote sensing is
    generated where the imaging results indicate key locations where sensors should
    be deployed (carried out at the drone and cloud computing layers); (2) Sensors
    are deployed in the indicated locations and connected through a wireless sensor
    network to collect, process, and communicate data to a database system in the
    computing cloud (carried out at the WSN and cloud computing layers); (3) data
    are further processed and integrated to a GIS system for analysis and visualization
    (cloud computing layer). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Framework of
    autonomous environment sensing system. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    Remote Sensing In the proposed framework, the UAVs are equipped with hyperspectral
    sensors for remote sensing as well as data collection and sensor network maintenance
    vehicle to reduce deployment cost. Hyperspectral sensors, also known as imaging
    spectrometers, are imaging systems that can provide high resolution imaging of
    a scene collected in tens of thousands of narrow bands simultaneously that allows
    the system to fingerprint unique materials using spectral signatures often not
    visible to human eyes 26. Spectrogram imaging combined with in situ sampling data
    has been used to estimate the water quality parameters, such as Chlorophyll-a
    (Chl-a), Secchi (SD) depth, Chromophoric dissolved organic matter 27-29, as well
    as tropical state mapping in a reservoir 30. The imaging results can provide insights
    into components and thermal processes through infrared and other frequency spectrograms.
    With the resulting accurate water pollution map with a high spatial resolution,
    the system can help identify pollution sources and system disturbances with greater
    accuracy. The cost of these hyperspectral cameras remains high. To reduce cost,
    UAV can be used for surveying the environment for continuous high-resolution mapping.
    These lightweight, low-cost aircraft platforms offer a promising solution to responsive,
    timely, and cost-effective monitoring of environmental phenomena. Wallace et al.
    31 reported that microcopter UAVs exhibit less vibration than fixed-wing systems,
    making them better suited to photogrammetric data capture. We consider rotor-based
    UAVs for our vertical profiling experiments as well as spatial surveys. The main
    limitation in most lightweight UAV platforms is weight and power supply to sustain
    longer flight. Furthermore, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
    on drones need to be considered for system deployment 32. A valuable component
    of this study will examine how to comply with the new FAA regulations affecting
    UAV use in this application. Several team researchers will have to obtain certification
    for flying the UAVs. This process will be documented and evaluated. Wireless Sensor
    Network Location of Sensors The location of sensors will be based on the input
    from the imaging results. Sensors can be placed at strategic locations that can
    collect scientific data to support the modeling approaches, such as close to point
    sources or along a stream flow path. The sensors should require minimum maintenance
    to reduce the cost of the system. Sensors and sensor communication designs have
    been extensively studied 33. Renewable energy from solar, wind and tide can be
    harvested to power the sensors and their communication systems. The number of
    sensors can be optimized based on the area of coverage and communication range.
    This can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize energy
    consumption of the three layers of the framework. Data communication Upon identifying
    the location of interests, such as point sources, sensors can be deployed at these
    locations for continuous data collection. The sensors will be connected wirelessly
    through different access technologies. Cluster head will be selected which will
    be equipped with more communication, storage, and processing capability. These
    cluster heads will be transmitting the processed data through a cellular network
    to the cloud for further processing. Many wireless communication technologies
    can be applied based on the communication range including, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    cellular networks, and satellites. The larger the communication range, the higher
    the energy cost for these sensor nodes. This adds additional complexity to the
    multi-objective optimization problem in term of minimizing energy cost. System
    Maintenance Because sensors are to be operated autonomously, maintenance of these
    sensors such as battery charging, software upgrade, and hardware debugging will
    be automated using the autonomous UAVs which can follow routine flight paths to
    survey the health of the wireless sensor nodes and the communication network.
    These UAVs also serve as relay nodes for data collection where periodic data collection
    can be carried out between cluster heads and the UAVs with shorter communication
    range to conserve energy. Cloud Computing for Data Analytic and Visualization
    Environmental data collected from sensors can be processed in the embedded system
    in the sensors or in the computing cloud. The process design is dependent upon
    the required processing power, the amount of data to be transmitted and communication
    cost. Cluster heads of the WSN are capable of processing, compressing, and storing
    data sent from the sensors nodes. These cluster heads will be equipped with algorithms
    that can find the optimized way to communicate data to the computing cloud based
    on energy consumption. The computing cloud will further aggregate and process
    data for visualization and modeling. The aggregated measurement data will be stored
    in a central database in the cloud. These data will be cross validated based on
    the location of the measurement and integrated with measurement data from other
    databases such as the national weather services, USGS, EPA to form a much richer
    data set. Machine learning algorithms will be applied for knowledge discovery
    from the existing data set. We envision challenges on incomplete and unbalanced
    data due to device error, communication interference, and other system anomaly,
    to be further investigated to improve the accuracy of the modeling. An application
    that runs on both mobile devices and desktop computers will be created to provide
    data query and data visualization in a GIS. The design of the system requires
    the consideration of multi-layer design constraints ranging from physical sensors,
    communication network designs, minimized energy consumption, and system maintenance.
    Technologies in renewable energy harvesting, UAVs, sensor networks, and cloud
    computing can be integrated for a cost-effective solution. The fine-grained sensing
    data can be further integrated with the GIS system, which can provide accessible
    information visualization to the policy holders and the general public in real
    time and reliable data sources for scientific modeling. CONCLUSIONS A high-resolution
    spatial and temporal visualization system is a very useful tool to engage both
    the public and stakeholders to collaboratively develop sustainable practices and
    solutions to reverse the negative impacts of human activities to the natural environment.
    Such system requires inputs from a large number of data sources with a continuous
    data feed. An autonomous environmental data collection system can be a feasible
    solution for providing and visualizing data. This article presented a case study
    of the water quality data of Long Island, New York available from the US EPA public
    database and demonstrates the challenges of using existing water quality data
    to identify the relationship between agriculture activities (food), energy consumption
    and production, and water quality (FEW) systems. A new framework composed of remote
    sensing, wireless sensor networks, and cloud computing for autonomous environmental
    data collection was proposed. An outline of the design challenges in the proposed
    framework was presented and discussed. It called for the use of UAVs to carry
    out fine-grained remote sensing, monitoring and maintain of a hardy wireless sensor
    network to reduce deployment cost. The optimized design of this system required
    balancing the technology requirements, energy consumption and the operating costs
    of the system. 1 Long Island is 120 miles long and up to 20 miles wide. It technically
    includes Kings County (Brooklyn) and Queens County, boroughs of New York City,
    as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The island of Long Island runs west to
    east and extends out into the Atlantic Ocean. The south shore fronts the Atlantic
    with extensive barrier island systems and the nrth shores face Long Island Sound
    that separates Long Island from Westchester County, New York and Connecticut.

    on many societal sectors, including energy production, health, forestry and agriculture.
    The reduced availability of water accompanied by high temperatures led to substantial
    economic losses on the order of 1.5 Billion Euros, in agriculture alone. Furthermore,
    soil droughts have considerable impacts on ecosystems, forest fires and water
    management. Monitoring soil water availability in near real-time and at high-resolution,
    i.e., 4 × 4 km2, enables water managers to mitigate the impact of these extreme
    events. The German drought monitor was established in 2014 as an online platform.
    It uses an operational modeling system that consists of four steps: (1) a daily
    update of observed meteorological data by the German Weather Service, with consistency
    checks and interpolation; (2) an estimation of current soil moisture using the
    mesoscale hydrological model; (3) calculation of a quantile-based soil moisture

    a natural phenomenon that results from deficiencies in precipitation compared
    to the expected or normal amount (Wilhite 2005). It may translate to water scarcity,
    a discrepancy between the actual demand and the corresponding availability of
    water for environmental and societal needs. Compared to other natural disasters,
    droughts have the largest spatial extent and longest duration (Sheffield and Wood
    2011). These slowly developing events easily persist over several years and can
    reach national to continental spatial coverage (Sheffield and Wood 2011, Samaniego
    et al 2013). According to the EM-DAT database (Guha-Sapir et al 2015), droughts
    affected 2.2 billion people worldwide between 1950 and 2014, thus making droughts
    the second most important natural disaster after floods (3.6 billion people affected).
    In Europe, for example, the costs per event during this period are estimated to
    be 621 Mio. EUR, the costliest amongst all natural disasters that occurred in
    this region (Guha-Sapir et al 2015). Droughts have impacts on many societal sectors,
    including forestry, water resources management, energy generation, and health.
    Their impacts can be divided into direct and indirect impacts (Wilhite et al 2007).
    Examples of direct impacts are reduced crop yield and forest productivity, increased
    forest fire hazard, reduced water levels, and increased mortality rates for livestock,
    wildlife and fish. They can usually be quantified, though the assessment of indirect
    impacts is often challenging. An example of indirect drought impact is variable
    food prices due to market effects in the agricultural sector. As a result, it
    is difficult to estimate the total costs and losses at the regional and national
    levels. Indirect losses of droughts often exceed those of the direct ones (Wilhite
    et al 2007). According to the European Commission, the frequency of droughts has
    increased since 1980 and will, very likely, further increase (EEA 2012). To date,
    11% of the European population and 17% of the area of the EU have been affected
    by water scarcity (European Commission 2007, 2010). For example, the 2003 drought
    event, which covered major parts of Europe, caused 7000 fatalities in Germany
    alone (European Commission 2012) and had an agro-economical impact of 1.5 billion
    EUR. On the European level, the death toll was estimated to exceed 70 000 (Robine
    et al 2008), and the agro-economical impact was estimated to be 15 billion EUR
    (COPA-COGECA 2003). This severe drought impacted many components of societal life.
    It disrupted irrigation, inland navigation, and power plant cooling (Fink et al
    2004, Parry et al 2007). A precise and generally accepted definition of drought
    does not exist (Wilhite 2005) because drought impacts are specific to the region
    of its occurrence and to the field of interest. According to the WMO (2006) and
    Mishra and Singh (2010), four different types of drought exist: meteorological,
    hydrological, agricultural and socioeconomic droughts. Meteorological droughts
    relate to a deficiency of precipitation. Agricultural droughts arise as a consequence
    of this deficiency. They are characterized by low soil water availability for
    plants. Potential consequences of agricultural droughts are reduced biomass and
    yield or crop failure. Long-term soil water deficiencies diminish to surface and
    subsurface water availability, resulting in hydrological drought. It is denoted
    by reduced streamflow and low water levels of reservoirs and lakes. Hydrological
    droughts mainly affect water resources management, power plant cooling, irrigation
    and inland navigation. Groundwater droughts are a special case of hydrological
    droughts (van Lanen and Peters 2000, Kumar et al 2016). They occur when water
    deficiencies reach deep subsurface storages resulting in exceptionally low groundwater
    levels, groundwater recharge and baseflow. They reduce the supply of fresh water,
    where groundwater is the major source for drinking water supply. Socio-economic
    drought can emerge from all of the aforementioned drought types. It is characterized
    by a shortfall of water supply (water scarcity) leading to monetary losses. In
    terms of duration, precipitation drought has the shortest occurrence, followed
    by agricultural drought and finally hydrological and groundwater droughts. The
    German drought monitor (GDM) presented herein focuses on agricultural droughts,
    which are highly relevant for Germany because they may induce substantial agro-economic
    losses as shown by the 2003 drought event. Within this study we review existing
    drought monitoring systems and the advantages of the newly developed monitor for
    Germany. Furthermore, we present the technical implementation of the GDM and an
    analysis of the drought event 2015 for which the GDM received broad attention
    from several media and the public. Finally, we provide an outlook on future developments
    of the GDM. 2. Drought monitoring Drought monitoring and early warning systems
    are designed to identify water deficiencies in climatic or hydrologic variables.
    They aim to detect emergence, probability of occurrence and the potential severity
    of drought events (WMO 2006). A drought monitoring system that delivers timely
    information about the onset, extent, and intensity of drought events could help
    to mitigate drought related impacts such as economic losses (Wilhite 1993). 2.1.
    Existing drought monitoring systems Several drought monitors for large parts of
    the world are currently available to the public. On the continental scale, drought
    monitoring or forecasting systems exist for North America (Lawrimore et al 2002),
    Europe (Horion et al 2012), and Africa (Sheffield et al 2014). On a national scale,
    online platforms are available for India (Shah and Mishra 2015), the Czech Republic
    (Trnka et al 2014), and the United States of America (Svoboda et al 2002, Luo
    and Wood 2007, Wood 2008). Efforts to monitor drought evolution on the global
    scale have been made by Pozzi et al (2013) and Hao et al (2014). A variety of
    input data, spatial and temporal resolutions and estimated drought indices can
    be found among these monitoring systems. The longest established system is the
    US drought monitor launched in 1999. The weekly published map is a composite of
    different indices based on meteorological observations, i.e., standardized precipitation
    index (SPI), the Palmer drought severity index, soil moisture percentiles derived
    from hydrologic model simulations, and expert knowledge from more than 130 people
    (Svoboda et al 2002). Thus, local experts like agricultural and water resources
    managers can add information and help verify the drought map. The North American
    drought monitor was implemented in 2002 based on experience with the US drought
    monitor (Lawrimore et al 2002). It enlarges the investigated domain to Canada
    and Mexico and delivers monthly drought maps. The drought monitors of the University
    of Washington (Wood 2008) and Princeton University (Luo and Wood 2007) cover the
    continental United States, showing simulations and forecasts of soil moisture,
    snow and runoff at 1/8° spatial resolution derived using the variable infiltration
    capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrologic model (Liang et al 1994). Systems established
    for India (Shah and Mishra 2015) and Africa (Sheffield et al 2014) are based on
    bias-corrected satellite precipitation with the latter including a seasonal forecasting
    capability. These systems are running on 1/4° resolution using the VIC model and
    provide drought indices based on precipitation, soil moisture, and streamflow.
    The Czech drought monitor (Trnka et al 2014) is based on modeled root zone soil
    moisture, which is derived from local meteorological observations. Maps are published
    on a weekly basis and have a spatial resolution of 500 m. The European drought
    observatory (EDO) publishes the current drought status for Europe at a 10 d interval
    based on a combined drought indicator composed of the SPI as well as soil moisture
    and vegetation conditions (Horion et al 2012). The soil water and vegetation status
    are assessed by its anomalies. EDO uses local observations to derive the SPI and
    the hydrologic model LISFLOOD (De Roo et al 2000) to estimate soil moisture. The
    status of the vegetation is estimated based on the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically
    active radiation (fAPAR) retrieved from ENVISAT. The spatial resolutions of precipitation,
    soil moisture and fAPAR are 25 km, 5 km and 1 km, respectively, whereas their
    reference periods are 1981–2010, 1990–2010, and 1997–2010, respectively (Horion
    et al 2012). 2.2. Aims of the GDM The implementation of a national drought monitoring
    system goes beyond the capabilities of the existing systems. In our work with
    regional stakeholders from agriculture and forestry, the need for a high-resolution,
    near real-time, regional monitoring system was expressed. Therefore, the drought
    monitoring system presented herein is based on data provided by the German Meteorological
    Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), 2015), which are the most dense and reliable
    meteorological data available for this region. Furthermore, due to the long-term
    availability of these data, we are able to use a 60 year reference period for
    the estimation of drought indices for every grid cell and day of the year. This
    is substantially longer than those in other existing systems for this region.
    The GDM addresses the need for daily up-to-date agricultural drought information.
    This broadens the decision base for local authorities complementing other available
    drought information based on e.g. precipitation or streamflow. Finally, the implementation
    of a national drought monitor encourages local experts, stakeholders and decision
    makers to take part in the future development. At the same time, it helps to validate
    the GDM. 3. Operational drought monitoring framework Ground-based monitoring of
    nation-wide soil moisture is to-date hardly possible. Hence, this study presents
    a drought identification and classification framework based on near real-time
    observed meteorological data and distributed hydrologic modeling. The GDM estimates
    soil drought conditions on a high spatial resolution and allows for the evaluation
    of recent drought events with respect to historical events. A similar framework
    to that used in the GDM is applied to rank historic drought events in Germany
    (Samaniego et al 2013) and for seasonal drought predictions in Europe (Thober
    et al 2015). The operational system consists of four processing steps (figure
    1). In the first step , local observations from the German Meteorological Service
    are retrieved every morning (Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), 2015). These data are
    initially quality checked by the DWD. Nevertheless, the GDM checks the downloaded
    data for consistency and detects outliers as a supplementary quality control.
    Currently, approximately 1700 precipitation and 500 climate stations, which observe
    the minimum, maximum, and average daily temperatures, are used to derive daily
    fields of meteorological input data for the hydrologic model. The daily data are
    interpolated by external drift kriging using terrain elevation as external drift.
    The spatial resolution of the resulting meteorological fields is a compromise
    between the demands for highly resolved hydrological predictions, which are required
    by stakeholders and practitioners, and the lowest reasonable resolution supported
    by the input data. The average minimal distance between two neighboring precipitation
    stations is approximately 6 km in Germany. Thus, a target of 4 × 4 km2 resolution
    was implemented, which would provide high-resolution information without facing
    the risk of over-interpreting of the meteorological observations. These data are
    available with a time lag of 4 d. Due to the high persistency of soil moisture,
    this near real-time estimation is considered sufficient for agricultural or water
    management purposes. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 1. Framework of
    the German drought monitor. After (1) downloading and interpolating of the meteorological
    data from the National Weather Service (DWD) the data are fed to the hydrologic
    model mHM. (2) mHM estimates the soil moisture for the entire root zone on a daily
    basis which is used to (3) calculate the soil moisture index (SMI). The SMI is
    (4) classified and visualized in a drought map published online. Download figure:
    Standard image High-resolution image In the second step, these interpolated fields
    are used to force the mesoscale hydrological model (mHM), a process-based model
    that treats grid cells as unique hydrological units. It comprises hydrological
    processes such as interception, snow accumulation and melting, infiltration, soil
    water dynamics, groundwater recharge and storage. The generated discharge of a
    model cell consists of direct runoff, baseflow, slow and fast interflow, which,
    after aggregating its components, is routed through the model domain using the
    Muskingum-Cunge flood routing algorithm (Chow et al 1988, Todini 2007). By using
    the multiscale parameter regionalization technique (Samaniego et al 2010, Kumar
    Samaniego and Attinger 2013), mHM directly accounts for the sub-grid variability
    of physiographic characteristics. The model parameters are estimated in a preliminary
    step on the lowest possible input resolution of the physiographic variables, i.e.,
    100 × 100 m2. In a second step, effective parameters at the hydrological modeling
    resolution of 4 × 4 km2 are estimated by applying particular upscaling operators.
    This technique makes mHM scale- and location-independent because it connects effective
    parameters to physiographical inputs (Kumar Samaniego and Attinger 2013). In several
    studies, the model has shown to perform satisfactorily in a wide range of catchments
    with drainage areas ranging from 4 to 530 000 km2 and with contrasting climatic
    regimes (Germany, India, USA, Europe; e.g., Samaniego et al (2011, 2013), Kumar
    et al (2013), Rakovec et al (2016)). A soil moisture field, updated daily, is
    estimated by running the model with an internal time step of one hour. The soil
    water availability is estimated in three different layers. The thicknesses of
    the upper two layers are 5 and 20 cm. A third layer is spatially variable in depth,
    depending on the soil horizon properties specified in the input data. This variable
    depth, is on average, 1.8 m in Germany. The estimated soil moisture of each single
    layer is used to estimate the total root zone soil moisture. The hydrological
    model stores specified state variables at the end of a model run. To calculate
    the soil moisture statistical reference, we performed a 60 year simulation from
    1954 to 2013. Within the operational framework, we are currently performing hydrological
    simulations initialized with the model states of December 31, 2013. Thus computational
    time is minimized as the daily model simulation runs from January 1, 2014, onwards.
    An evaluation of the hydrologic model on the domain of Germany is provided by
    Samaniego et al (2013). The third step within the GDM is to transform the daily
    updated soil moisture into the soil moisture index (SMI) by estimating the percentile
    of the updated soil moisture value with respect to its climatology. The daily
    updated soil moisture is estimated as the average of the soil conditions of the
    preceding 30 d. Therefore, it represents values that correspond to a time period
    of 1 month. The SMI is estimated using a non-parametric kernel-based cumulative
    distribution function based on a 60 year historic soil moisture reconstruction
    (1954–2013), as described by Samaniego et al (2013). The SMI is bounded between
    0 and 1 and can be easily transformed to the unbounded range of the standard normal
    distribution e.g. used for the SPI (McKee et al 1993). It is estimated on every
    grid cell and for the particular time of the year (i.e., the average of the 30
    days preceding the estimation day). The 1 month running mean of soil moisture
    data for SMI derivation was chosen because it is well established in scientific
    literature (Andreadis and Lettenmaier 2006, Sheffield and Wood 2007, Vidal et
    al 2010, Samaniego et al 2013). Finally, the fourth step consists of categorizing
    the estimated SMI into several drought classes and visualizing the results. A
    main requirement for the appearance of the publicly available drought map is intelligibility.
    For the visualization of drought events, we adapted the appearance of the GDM
    to that of the US Drought Monitor (Svoboda et al 2002), using five classes. Four
    classes define drought conditions, and the fifth class describes the pre-warning
    state of abnormally dry (table 1). The four drought classes scale from moderate,
    (vegetation prone to water stress) to exceptional (high probability of losses
    of crops and increased forest fire risk). Table 1.  The classification of droughts
    for the German drought monitor based on the soil moisture index (SMI) (adapted
    with permission from Svoboda et al (2002) © American Meteorological Society).
    SMI class Condition of the soil Description of potential impacts 0.3 ≤ SMI < 0.2
    Abnormally dry Conditions before or after a preceding drought 0.2 ≤ SMI < 0.1
    Moderate drought Damages to crops and pastures possible 0.1 ≤ SMI < 0.05 Severe
    drought Losses in crops and pastures are likely 0.05 ≤ SMI < 0.02 Extreme drought
    High probability of major losses in crops and pastures SMI ≤ 0.02 Exceptional
    drought High probability of exceptional losses in crops and pastures The classes
    are derived using the thresholds of the SMI (table 1). These thresholds reflect
    the occurrence of similar conditions in the past and thus indicate the potential
    impacts of these conditions. For example, the class of exceptional drought is
    defined by an upper threshold of 0.02. This implies that this soil moisture conditions
    were observed in less than 2% of the time within the 60 year reference period
    at this grid cell and time of the year. Thus, this drought condition only occurred
    in less than 1.2 cases over the last 60 years, which is equal to a return period
    of 50 years. Because the SMI describes the status of the soil but not necessarily
    the impact on the vegetation, this classification scheme still requires further
    research. Crops cope with drought conditions better or worse at different stages
    of plant development and may not be influenced by heavy drought conditions. Revisiting
    this argument would mean that an effect of the SMI on vegetation at different
    stages of plant development has to be investigated. The resulting maps are visualized
    and published online in the GDM. Currently, an up-to-date drought map is published
    every morning at 3 am CET on www.ufz.de/droughtmonitor. This information is accompanied
    by historical, monthly drought maps starting in 2014. We provide detailed maps
    available since 1954, of particular regions as well as the underlying soil moisture
    and SMI data on request. 4. Benchmark for the recent 2015 drought event Germany
    has experienced two drought events since the implementation of the GDM. The first
    took place in spring 2014, and the second occurred in summer/autumn 2015. These
    events are used to assess the performance of the GDM. The 2014 event (see figure
    2, upper row) had its largest spatial coverage in April 2014. In Germany, 70%
    of the area was under drought conditions (SMI 0.2), with 25% of the total area
    being under exceptional drought (SMI 0.02). The situation improved significantly
    in May 2014 due to above average rainfall, and the total drought area (moderate
    to exceptional drought) decreased to almost half of the area affected in April.
    Furthermore, the area under exceptional drought reduced to only 1%. As a consequence,
    the vegetation and, in particular, agricultural crops received sufficient amounts
    of water, especially during the crucial growing phase after seeding in April/May.
    In consequence, even the deterioration of drought conditions in June did not have
    a negative impact on yield in 2014. On the contrary, the Federal Ministry of Food
    and Agriculture (BMEL 2014) reported that productivity of agriculture was superior
    to the preceding 6 years. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 2. Soil water
    conditions from April to August in 2014 (upper row) and 2015 (lower row). Download
    figure: Standard image High-resolution image In 2015, the drought situation was
    different (figure 2, lower row). In contrast to the situation in 2014, soils were
    not experiencing extreme to exceptional dry conditions in spring. The drought
    primarily evolved during spring and summer. Nevertheless, the growing phase of
    some crops was already delayed by water shortage in May (BMEL 2015). In some regions
    of Northern Bavaria and Eastern Saxony, soils were under drought conditions since
    autumn 2014. These regions were especially prone to losses in crop yield and to
    increased forest-fire risk. According to (BMEL 2015), corn yield was 22% below
    the average yield between 2009 and 2014 in Germany. Additionally, some regions
    of Germany were prone to losses in animal food production, so they faced the decision
    of either buying additional food or reducing livestock (BMEL 2015). Due to the
    low water levels, inland navigation was stopped on the Elbe River. A hotspot for
    very dry conditions was Berlin (figure 2, lower row), where trees had already
    started shedding their leaves in the middle of August. Reports on economic consequences
    have not been published yet, but there were extensive fire watch activities due
    to very high forest fire risk and losses in crops such as corn, which led to increased
    expenses. Almost 75% of the area of Germany was under at least moderate drought
    in July 2015. During August 2015, the total area under drought decreased, but
    the areas of extreme and exceptional drought conditions increased to 22% and 5%,
    respectively. The recognition of the GDM increased significantly during the 2105
    event. The information provided by the GDM were used for public information and
    drought assessment in local authorities. We could identify users due to individual
    requests of several federal state agencies including the Saxon State Office for
    the Environment, Agriculture and Geology, the Thuringian State Office for Environment
    and Geology, the Bavarian State Office for Agriculture, and the North Rhine Westphalia
    Chamber of Agriculture. They used the GDM to inform agriculture and forest managers
    about the current soil moisture status. The drought monitor got attention in the
    public due to reports in several media ranging from regional to national newspapers
    as well as television broadcasters. The number of page views of the GDM website
    followed the estimated area under drought (figure 3). This highlights that extreme
    events gather more public attention during periods when they do actually occur.
    Attention rose in April 2015 when newspapers in Saxony started reporting drought
    conditions due to negative impacts on forestry and agriculture, e.g., seeding
    of maize and dying tree seedlings. The highest interest was reached when several
    national media started republishing the maps of the GDM in August 2015. In the
    private sector, we got feedback from insurance and seed production companies.

    High-resolution image The benchmark of the 2015 event with respect to historical
    drought events is shown in figure 4. The left graph of this figure is created
    by applying the cluster identification algorithm proposed by Samaniego et al (2013).
    This three-step algorithm uses the duration, spatial extent and drought intensity
    to calculate a dimensionless drought magnitude. The drought intensity is calculated
    as the negative deviation from the SMI value 0.2, whereas the magnitude is the
    integral of drought intensity over time and space. The results show that the ongoing
    2014–2015 event ranks among the 10 largest events observed in Germany since 1954.

    months over the last 62 years. The magnitudes are represented by the size of the
    bubble and the color code. The reference period for this figure is 1954/01/01–2015/10/31.
    Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image A more detailed insight
    can be obtained from the four panels on the right in figure 4. In these graphs,
    drought events are evaluated for calendar months. The integral of drought intensity
    is based on monthly values. The probability is calculated from the empirical cumulative
    density function of the area under drought. The numbers next to the bubbles denote
    the respective year of the drought event. The drought conditions in June and July
    2015, rank within the four largest events with respect to spatial extent. The
    magnitude is highly correlated to the area under drought; hence, between June
    and September, the 2015 event ranks among the 7 largest events for the respective
    months. The displayed 2003 event is well remembered in Germany due to its large
    socio-economic impacts. In 2003, the drought event evolved more slowly than the
    2015 one did, but the former peaked in August, with a magnitude M = 2067, which
    is greater than the maximum magnitude reached by the 2015 event in July (M = 1770).
    5. Conclusion and outlook The GDM provides an easily accessible agricultural drought
    information system on both the regional and national level. It provides an added
    value through the daily, high-resolution availability of formerly unaccessible
    information. Stakeholder feedback indicates that the main user groups are from
    regional agencies and the agriculture and forestry sector. During the 2015 drought,
    the GDM was widely used by the media and stakeholders when drought consequences
    became visible (e.g., in tree leaf coloring in summer). The GDM is driven by an
    observational dataset, which enables drought estimates on a higher spatial resolution
    (4 × 4 km2) compared to other available products. A soil drought map for Germany
    is released to the public on a daily basis, with a latency of 4 d. This map is
    intended to be comprehensible and easy to access via a web browser. Additional
    information, e.g., the underlying SMI data, are available on request. The GDM
    information aims to support practitioners to optimize their actions. A comparison
    of an ongoing event with historical drought events helps to understand their severity
    and to assess potential impacts. The sensitivity of plant growth to soil water
    availability depends of the timing within the year. This could be shown in the
    comparison of consequences of the drought situation in 2014 and 2015. Currently,
    the SMI data is used in our research to investigate the relationship between soil
    moisture and crop yield for different times of the year to gain more knowledge
    about the consequences of agricultural droughts. Feedback from stakeholders has
    already been integrated in the GDM, e.g. in the publication of drought information
    for the uppermost soil layer with a depth of 25 cm. The future development of
    the GDM will reflect the needs of stakeholders and decision makers. We use the
    Climate Office for Central Germany, a regional climate service center, to inform
    agencies, agricultural engineers, water resources managers, hydrologists and policy
    makers about the potential of the GDM. In this dialog-based knowledge transfer,
    we identify (1) how to improve the visualization of drought information (e.g.,
    readability and information content of the maps); (2) how to implement local expert
    knowledge into the daily published product, and (3) which additional information
    or combination of drought indices may be beneficial (e.g., SPI). Currently, the
    drought maps are based on a 30 days soil moisture average, which is a well established
    procedure found in the literature. Shorter time aggregations may provide new information
    for particular crops. Thus, further research has to be attributed to determine
    the sensitivity of temporal aggregation on the SMI and how this relates to agricultural
    crop development. An additional field of work remains in handling predictive uncertainties.
    These uncertainties stem from the input data, the model structure and the model
    parameters (e.g., Wagener et al 2003). Samaniego et al (2013) showed that parametric
    uncertainty alone can lead to significant classification errors in drought characteristics.
    A major challenge is to investigate how to communicate such uncertainties to the
    public and decision makers without counteracting the GDM''s simplicity and intelligibility.
    Providing forecasts may help to better mitigate drought consequences. Studies
    like Thober et al 2015, however, showed that soil moisture drought forecasts underlie
    significant uncertainties at seasonal lead times. Nevertheless, we aspire to assess
    the potential of short and medium range forecasts. The GDM presented herein provides
    free, high-resolution, near real-time drought information for Germany and a contribution
    to mitigate negative effects of agricultural droughts. Acknowledgments We kindly

  description: Cai Songwu works for the Guangdong Centre for Disease Control and Prevention,
    studying disease outbreaks. In the past, communication between Cai and other officials
    about outbreaks was slow, hampering their ability to anticipate and respond. Since
    2005, districts and counties across the province have been able to connect to
    a real-time online monitoring system. ‘With real-time data, we are able to understand
    the breeding speed, growth and decline of vectors and pest density,’ he says.
    This kind of monitoring is becoming increasingly important as climate change alters
    the environmental conditions – temperatures, humidity, rainfall and carbon dioxide
    concentrations – that allow different kinds and numbers of pests to survive and
    thrive. ‘In the future, regions previously without vector organisms might become
    more suitable for vectors to breed, and this is likely to give rise to infectious
    diseases.’ The links between climate variability, seasons, human behaviour and
    health have been areas of concern for researchers and public health officials
    globally, as described by Cai Songwu; climate change must now be factored into
    health programmes. Shifts in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, increasing
    incidences of floods and droughts, and sea level rise are just some of the many
    examples of a visibly changing climate. Death, injuries and illness due to extreme
    weather and slow-onset events have unfolded at unprecedented scales in the turn
    of the millennium; these have finally begun to attract attention to the critical
    challenge the impacts climate change poses to human health (Field et al., 2014;
    Huang, C. et al., 2011; Parry et al., 2007). Vector-borne and zoonotic disease
    transmission rates are also likely to be altered by climate change and are being
    investigated by research organisations. The Fifth Assessment Report from the United
    Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states with very high
    confidence that the health of human populations is sensitive to shifts in weather
    patterns and other aspects of climate change.1 For example, in many parts of the
    world, including China, heat waves and other extreme temperature events have led
    to increased morbidity and mortality. Climate change, in conjunction with rapid
    urbanisation and development, is altering the distribution of infectious diseases.
    Climate shifts are contributing to livelihood losses and food insecurity due to
    reductions in agricultural productivity associated with floods, droughts and storms.
    These can in turn increase risk of malnutrition or illness from contaminated food
    and water (WHO, 2010; Kan et al., 2012). If the climatic changes continue as projected,
    the health of a large number of populations, particularly those who are poor and
    vulnerable, will be at risk and their existing problems will be exacerbated (Field
    et al., 2014). Current research suggests that climate change will primarily exacerbate
    existing health problems, although unanticipated health consequences cannot be
    excluded. Compared to sectors like agriculture, forestry, ecology and water resources,
    climate change related health impacts have received little attention from decision
    makers. The need for many countries to develop response strategies to protect
    health continues to go unnoticed. Until recently, health impacts were not assessed
    or well-quantified, nor have the findings been communicated effectively beyond
    the scientific community. This lack of information may have contributed to the
    perception in China that the burden of ill health from climate change is minimal
    and will continue to be so. There exists a gap in understandable information that
    clearly explains the potential health effects of climate change, as well as what
    can be done to reduce climate change-health risks. This chapter looks at the range
    and magnitude of climate change impacts on human health in China. The chapter
    opens with a brief overview of trends in climate change and health in China, drawing
    from an extensive literature review of the contemporary work of Chinese researchers.
    The chapter then presents a case study on Guangdong Province, drawing from two
    separate investigations conducted by the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public
    Health (GD IPH) and the Guangdong Provincial Centre for Disease Control (GD CDC),
    with support from Griffith University (Australia). Guangdong is one of the most
    populated and urbanised provinces in China and has the largest GDP. Despite this,
    extreme regional imbalances in economic development, a large population of economic
    migrants and rural/urban disparities result in low per capita economic indicators.
    The province’s location on China’s south-eastern coast leaves it highly exposed
    to tropical cyclones, storm surges and tidal flooding, all of which will be exacerbated
    by sea level rise. Its climate is hot and humid, with an average annual temperature
    of 23°C – perfect conditions for vector-borne diseases. Further detailed information
    on Guangdong’s current and future vulnerability and climate risks beyond those
    posed to health are presented in Chapter 10. The combination of these factors
    makes the province of great research interest in terms of climate impacts on human
    health, and research and climate resilience activities and policies conducted
    within it can provide lessons to the rest of China. The chapter concludes with
    current policy responses in China at the national and provincial levels and outlines
    some of the existing challenges in building a response.

    works for the Guangdong Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, studying disease
    outbreaks. In the past, communication between Cai and other officials about outbreaks
    was slow, hampering their ability to anticipate and respond. Since 2005, districts
    and counties across the province have been able to connect to a real-time online

  description: Sources of fecal water pollution were assessed in the Grand River and
    two of its tributaries (Ontario, Canada) using total and host-specific (human
    and bovine) Bacteroidales genetic markers in conjunction with reference information,
    such as land use and weather. In-stream levels of the markers and culturable Escherichia
    coli were also monitored during multiple rain events to gain information on fecal
    loadings to catchment from diffuse sources. Elevated human-specific marker levels
    were accurately identified in river water impacted by a municipal wastewater treatment
    plant (WWTP) effluent and at a downstream site in the Grand River. In contrast,
    the bovine-specific marker showed high levels of cattle fecal pollution in two
    tributaries, both of which are characterized as intensely farmed areas. The bovine-specific
    Bacteroidales marker increased with rainfall in the agricultural tributaries,
    indicating enhanced loading of cattle-derived fecal pollutants to river from non-point
    sources following rain events. However, rain-triggered fecal loading was not substantiated
    in urban settings, indicating continuous inputs of human-originated fecal pollutants
    from point sources, such as WWTP effluent. This study demonstrated that the Bacteroidales
    source tracking assays, in combination with land use information and hydrological
    data, may provide additional insight into the spatial and temporal distribution
    of source-specific fecal contamination in streams impacted by varying land uses.
    Using the approach described in this study may help to characterize impacted water
    sources and to design targeted land use management plans in other watersheds in
    the future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

    Highlights • Sources of fecal loading of a multiple-use watershed were evaluated
    over 10 months. • A Bacteroidales 16S rRNA gene assay was combined with land use
    and hydrological data. • Rainfall has a major role in host-specific Bacteroidales
    marker loading in rural areas. Abstract Sources of fecal water pollution were
    assessed in the Grand River and two of its tributaries (Ontario, Canada) using
    total and host-specific (human and bovine) Bacteroidales genetic markers in conjunction
    with reference information, such as land use and weather. In-stream levels of
    the markers and culturable Escherichia coli were also monitored during multiple
    rain events to gain information on fecal loadings to catchment from diffuse sources.
    Elevated human-specific marker levels were accurately identified in river water
    impacted by a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and at a downstream
    site in the Grand River. In contrast, the bovine-specific marker showed high levels
    of cattle fecal pollution in two tributaries, both of which are characterized
    as intensely farmed areas. The bovine-specific Bacteroidales marker increased

    Introduction PCR-based fecal source tracking tools targeting Bacteroidales genetic
    markers have become increasingly recognized as an identification tool for various
    fecal sources, including humans (Bernhard and Field, 2000), cows (Bernhard and
    Field, 2000), dogs (Dick et al., 2005a), pigs (Dick et al., 2005b), horses (Dick
    et al., 2005b), gulls (Jeter et al., 2009), and geese (Fremaux et al., 2010).
    However, quantification of Bacteroidales markers alone may not provide a complete
    set of information to accurately identify fecal source(s) as well as to characterize
    fecal loadings from diffuse sources in the environment. As an approach to improve
    source-tracking capability, the outcomes of marker-based tools can be interpreted
    in combination with environmental reference information including catchment hydrology
    and/or watershed land use (Peed et al., 2011, Reischer et al., 2008). This approach
    is expected to allow more accurate interpretation of microbiological fecal source
    tracking data (Reischer et al., 2011). Rainfall is one of the most important hydrological
    factors that affect transport of microorganisms in the environment (Jamieson et
    al., 2004). Microbial loadings to surface water typically increase during rainfall
    via overland surface transport, in-stream routing, and sediment resuspension (Dorner
    et al., 2006). The effects of rain have been extensively studied for fecal indicator
    bacterial loading in an urban inland watershed (Gentry-Shields et al., 2012),
    coastal storm water outfalls (Converse et al., 2011), freshwater streams affected
    by faulty septic systems (Peed et al., 2011), tidal creeks (Stumpf et al., 2010),
    coastal river watersheds (Surbeck et al., 2006), and tributaries of a drinking
    water reservoir (Kistemann et al., 2002). The effects of rainfall on loading of
    fecal Bacteroidales markers to surface water have been reported in a few cases
    (Converse et al., 2011, Sauer et al., 2011, Gentry-Shields et al., 2012). Most
    of these reports focused on transport of human-specific Bacteroidales markers
    in urban settings during intense storm events. More recent studies have applied
    genetic markers of agricultural origin for fecal source identification and to
    interpret its outcome in relation to environmental and land use parameters (Jent
    et al., 2013, Marti et al., 2013), however, these studies remain limited. In addition
    to human sources, farm animals, in particular cattle, may be responsible for fecal
    pollution of many watersheds. Cattle livestock in Canada, the US, and the EU produce
    approximately 100 million, 860 million, and 1.1 billion metric tons of manure
    annually, which account for 78%, 82%, and 79%, respectively, of the total manure
    produced by all forms of farm livestock (Foged et al., 2011, Hofmann and Kemp,
    2001, US Department of Agriculture, 2000). Therefore, it is important to assess
    fecal loadings from these two primary sources (i.e., human and cattle) for proper
    management and remediation of fecal water pollution in many North American watersheds.
    In this study, the sources and loadings of fecal water pollutants were characterized
    in the Grand River Watershed including both urban and rural-agricultural areas.
    Specific aims included (a) identification of fecal pollution source(s) at each
    sampling site using Bacteroidales 16S rRNA gene-based quantitative PCR (qPCR)
    assays and land use information; and (b) analysis of fecal loadings to streams
    from both human and cattle origins during rain events. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Study sites The present study was conducted in the Grand River and two of
    its tributaries (Conestogo River and Canagagigue Creek) in Ontario, Canada between
    July 18th, 2012 and May 7th, 2013. The five sampling sites included four river
    sites and one point source of fecal contamination. These sites were selected to
    represent (a) the most upstream site on the Grand River with relatively limited
    human or agricultural impacts (GRU), (b, c) two agricultural sites in the Conestogo
    River (COR) and Canagagigue Creek (CAC), both of which are characterized by intensely
    farmed watershed, (d) a point source of human fecal pollution [municipal wastewater
    treatment plant (WWTP) effluent] in the Grand River (WTE), and (e) an urban location
    at the most downstream on the Grand River (GRD) (Table 1, Fig. 1). Land-use and
    hydrological summaries for each watershed included in this study are shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Watershed characteristics of five study sites. Site location

    Fig. 1. Grand River watershed located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada (A) and
    enlarged area showing five study sites in the Grand River and two tributaries
    (B). Shaded areas represent urban land cover. Information on the five sites is
    provided in Section 2.1 of Materials and methods and Table 1. 2.2. Sample collection
    On 25 separate occasions, a total of 125 water samples (25 occasions × 5 sites)
    were collected. Samples were taken a minimum of twice per month at each site to
    capture a range of hydrological conditions, including base-flow and rain events.
    On fifteen occasions, there was no substantial rainfall and stream levels were
    maintained at or near base flow; and on the other ten occasions of rain event,
    accumulated precipitation exceeded 15 mm within 12 h from the onset of rain and
    stream levels surpassed the base flow level by at least two times as measured
    by gauges. Precipitation data were obtained from the National Climate Data and
    Information Archive (Environment Canada, 2012). During a sampling occasion, a
    single water sample (about 250 mL) was collected in a sterile polyethylene bottle
    (300 mL size) at each study site. As some sites were downstream of wastewater
    treatment facilities that use chemical disinfectants, the water sampling bottle
    contained sodium thiosulfate (about 50 mg/L final concentration when dissolved)
    to quench the activity of any chlorine residues in the sample. All water samples
    were stored on ice during transport to the laboratory and processed within 24
    h from the sample collection. 2.3. Nucleic acid extraction and Bacteroidales qPCR
    assays All water samples were divided into two 100-mL aliquots; one for nucleic
    acid extraction followed by Bacteroidales qPCR assays and the other for Escherichia
    coli enumeration. Bacteroidales cells were collected by passing 100 mL of water
    samples through a 0.45-μm-pore-size mixed cellulose esters membrane filter (Pall
    Canada Ltd., St. Laurent, QC, Canada) under partial vacuum. The filter was placed
    in a sterile disposable tube containing 1.5 mL of 5 M GITC lysis buffer (5 M guanidine
    isothiocyanate, 100 mM EDTA at pH 8.0, and 0.5% (w/v) sarkosyl) (Dick and Field,
    2004). Cells were separated from the filter by shaking the tube on a sample mixer
    for 1 h at 70 rpm and large impurities were removed from the GITC lysate by centrifugation
    for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy Mini Spin Columns
    (QIAgen Canada Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to our laboratory protocol
    where two extra washing steps with AW2 buffer were added to the manufacturer''s
    protocol. All water samples collected were analyzed using TaqMan real-time qPCR
    assays on the order Bacteroidales (BacTotal), cattle-specific Bacteroidales (BacBovine),
    and human-specific Bacteroidales (BacHuman) in singleplex mode (Table S1; Lee
    et al., 2010). Primers and TaqMan probes of the assays were verified for their
    efficiency as described previously (Lee et al., 2010). In the present study, the
    previous BacGeneral and BacBovine I assays were renamed as BacTotal and BacBovine
    assays, respectively, and the BacBovine II assay was not used due to its limited
    capacity to detect bovine-specific Bacteroidales signals in the environmental
    samples. Template genomic DNA, primers, and probes were added to a PCR master
    mix to final concentrations of 176 nM for TaqMan probes and 500 nM for each primer.
    Real-time PCR assays were performed with a temperature profile of 50 °C for 2
    min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C
    for 60 s each. The inhibitory effect of environmental samples on PCR efficiency
    was tested and corrected for each sample as described previously (Lee et al.,
    2010). 2.4. E. coli enumeration Culturable E. coli cells were enumerated by the
    membrane filter technique as described previously (Ontario Ministry of the Environment,
    2012). Briefly, a 100-mL aliquot water sample was passed through a mixed cellulose
    esters membrane filter (0.45-μm-pore-size, Pall Canada). The filters were then
    placed on mFC agar plates supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronic
    acid (BCIG) (Thermo-Fisher Scientific Inc., Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Culture
    plates were incubated at 44.5 ± 0.2 °C for 24 h and E. coli colonies were enumerated
    based on the appearance of blue-green color resulting from the hydrolysis of BCIG
    by β-glucuronidase. 2.5. Data presentation and statistical analysis For each study
    site, the concentration of Bacteroidales markers and culturable E. coli was presented
    as an individual measurement, or a median of all 25 time points pooled from the
    entire sampling period (see Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The relative contribution
    of host-specific fecal pollutants to total fecal pollution was estimated from
    the host-specific Bacteroidales marker (BacHuman or BacBovine marker) level expressed
    as a percentage of the total Bacteroidales marker (BacTotal marker) number. Download

    Correlation between microbial assay data and precipitation, as well as correlation
    among microbial assay data, were analyzed using non-parametric Spearman''s rank
    correlation analysis. Differences in E. coli and Bacteroidales marker concentrations
    among the five sampling sites were analyzed using non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis
    one-way analysis of variance. All statistical test outcomes were regarded as significant
    at P ≤ 0.05. 3. Results 3.1. Comparison of general fecal indicators among sampling
    sites To provide an overview of the spatial distribution of total fecal pollutants,
    the median concentration of BacTotal marker and culturable E. coli was plotted
    using data points pooled from the entire sampling period for each study site (Fig.
    2; Table S2). The highest concentration of BacTotal marker was observed at WTE
    throughout the sampling period [median values of 6.8 × 107 copies/100 mL (n =
    25)] (Fig. 2A). The level decreased to about 1.7 × 106 copies/100 mL at the downstream
    urban site (GRD). This number was the second highest among the sampling sites.
    At upstream agricultural sites (CAC and COR), the concentration of BacTotal marker
    was lower than those found at the two downstream sites on the Grand River (WTE
    and GRD), although the levels were still fairly high (6.5 × 105 copies/100 mL
    in COR and 6.3 × 105 copies/100 mL in CAC). The most upstream site GRU showed
    the lowest BacTotal marker concentration (3.0 × 105 copies/100 mL). The BacTotal
    marker level was significantly different (p ≤ 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis
    of variance) among the five study sites except that the level in COR was not statistically
    different from those at CAC and GRU. The culturable E. coli concentration exhibited
    a spatial distribution pattern that is similar to the one observed for the BacTotal
    marker concentration, with a level about three to four orders of magnitude lower
    than that of BacTotal marker across the sampling sites (Fig. 2B; Table S2). The
    median E. coli level was highest at WTE, which was significantly different from
    those at the other four sites (p < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance).
    The concentration of E. coli at GRD was significantly different from that at GRU,
    with the lowest level at GRU. There was no significant difference in E. coli concentrations
    among COR, CAC and GRD. When the number of a fecal indicator, culturable E. coli,
    was plotted against that of another fecal indicator, BacTotal marker, a statistically
    significant correlation was observed at three sites (WTE, r = 0.67, p = 0.001;
    CAC, r = 0.60, p = 0.002; GRD, r = 0.45, p = 0.029; Spearman''s rank correlation).
    A significant correlation was not observed between the two fecal indicators at
    the other sites (COR, r = 0.25, p = 0.204; GRU, r = 0.36, p = 0.089). BacTotal
    marker data pooled from all study sites also exhibited a significant correlation
    with culturable E. coli data pooled from the same sites (r = 0.73, p < 0.001,
    n = 125, Spearman''s rank correlation). 3.2. Comparison of fecal source markers
    among sites The relative contribution of host-specific fecal pollutants to total
    fecal pollution was estimated from the host-specific Bacteroidales marker level
    expressed as a percentage of the BacTotal marker number. WTE exhibited the highest
    BacHuman marker level at 27.0% (median, n = 25), throughout the sampling period,
    with GRD showing the second highest at 7.7% (Fig. 3A). The BacHuman marker proportion
    was much lower in the two agricultural streams (<0.1% at COR and CAC) and the
    most upstream site on the Grand River (0.2% in GRU). A significant difference
    (p < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance) was observed between
    the higher BacHuman marker levels (WTE and GRD) and the lower levels (CAC, COR,
    and GRU). The BacHuman marker level of WTE was also significantly different from
    that of GRD. The percentage value of BacBovine marker was highest in two agricultural
    streams (17.8% in COR and 17.4% in CAC); these values were significantly different
    (p < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance) from those at other sites
    on the Grand River (2.9% in GRD, 3.6% in WTE and 2.3% in GRU) (Fig. 3B). The marker
    levels of the two agricultural streams were not statistically different from each
    other. In the next series of statistical analysis, relationships between the general
    fecal indicator (BacTotal marker) and host-specific fecal indicators (BacBovine
    and BacHuman markers) were examined (Table 2). At agricultural sites, the concentration
    of BacTotal marker was correlated with that of BacBovine marker (CAC, r = 0.72,
    p = 0.001; COR, r = 0.81, p < 0.001), but not with that of BacHuman marker. In
    contrast, the concentration of BacTotal marker in the WWTP effluent and the most
    downstream site exhibited a significant correlation with that of BacHuman marker
    (WTE, r = 0.89, p < 0.001; GRD, r = 0.72, p = 0.001), whereas it did not show
    a correlation with that of BacBovine marker at the same sites. At the most upstream
    site GRU, the BacTotal marker concentration did not exhibit a significant correlation
    with either of the BacBovine or BacHuman marker concentration. Table 2. Spearman''s

    When the E. coli concentrations were compared to the accumulated precipitation
    over the 48-h period prior to sampling, significant correlations were observed
    at three sites (GRU, r = 0.69, p = 0.002; CAC, r = 0.68, p = 0.001; COR, r = 0.58,
    p = 0.004), whereas a significant relationship was absent in the downstream GRD
    (Column A, Table 3; Fig. 4A). The concentration of BacTotal marker showed a significant
    correlation with precipitation at agricultural sites (CAC, r = 0.57, p = 0.005;
    COR, r = 0.42, p = 0.034) (Column B, Table 3). The upstream GRU and downstream
    GRD did not exhibit a significant correlation between the BacTotal marker concentration
    and precipitation. Table 3. Spearman''s Rank Correlations between total daily

    0.06, p = 0.757 r = −0.01, p = 0.976 *Statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05. At
    both agricultural sites, a significant correlation was observed between precipitation
    and the concentration of BacBovine marker (CAC, r = 0.48, p = 0.016; COR, r =
    0.50, p = 0.012) (Column C, Table 3; Fig. 4C), but a significant relationship
    was absent between precipitation and the concentration of BacHuman marker (Column
    D, Table 3; Fig. 4D). Precipitation did not exhibit a significant relationship
    with the BacHuman or BacBovine marker concentrations at GRU and GRD (Column C
    and D, Table 3, Fig. S1). Precipitation at the WTE did not exhibit significant
    correlations with either Bacteroidales marker numbers or E. coli counts (see more
    information in Section 4.2 of Discussion). 3.4. Influence of storm events on microbial
    parameters The BacBovine marker level at agricultural sites (CAC and COR) increased
    by more than an order of magnitude during a heavy rain event (October 23rd) and
    the heavy rainfall associated with Hurricane Sandy (October 26 to 30th) (Fig.
    4C). The effect of these two rain events, especially one on Oct. 23rd, was also
    clearly detected in the BacTotal marker and E. coli concentrations in agricultural
    sites (Fig. 4A, B). The BacBovine marker concentrations in November at both agricultural
    sites decreased rapidly after the storm events by about two orders of magnitude,
    which are almost one order of magnitude lower than the pre-storm levels. 4. Discussion
    The qPCR assays targeting Bacteroidales 16S rRNA genes are increasingly being
    used as molecular tools to identify fecal sources in a quantitative manner. However,
    it is difficult to identify unknown fecal source(s) solely based on the qPCR assay
    results due to lack of information on routes of marker transport in the environment
    (Reischer et al., 2011). In the present study, we used the qPCR assay to compare
    the fecal loading in well characterized watersheds impacted by varying land uses
    (urban and rural), with a particular focus on identification of fecal pollution
    sources. The assay results were interpreted in relation to the dominant weather
    event (i.e., rainfall) that is expected to influence fecal marker loading to streams
    from diffuse land-based sources. 4.1. Tracking fecal pollution sources The spatial
    distribution of BacTotal marker was similar to that of the culturable E. coli
    (Fig. 2), and the two microbiological parameters exhibited significant correlations
    at most sampling sites (see Section 3.1). This outcome may indicate that BacTotal
    marker can be useful as a general fecal pollution indicator in the Grand River
    Watershed. The Bacteroidales assays were able to accurately determine the dominant
    fecal pollution source (human and/or bovine) at each sampling site under various
    weather conditions during the 10-month period, confirming our assumptions based
    on land use information. Our assays accurately identified municipal WWTP effluent
    as a predominant point source of human fecal pollution among our five study sites.
    To a lesser extent, the most downstream site was impacted by human fecal pollution
    which could be the result of in-stream transportation of Bacteroidales markers
    from the WWTP effluent, as well as other smaller sewage effluents upstream in
    the watershed (see Section 4.2 for more discussion). The Bacteroidales assays
    demonstrated that the streams designated as agricultural (CAC and COR) were largely
    influenced by the cattle-originated fecal pollutants. The fecal source tracking
    assay outcome is consistent with land use information of the same watershed (Table
    1). In these instances, bovine fecal pollutants could enter these agricultural
    streams from non-point agricultural sources. These watersheds are also speculated
    to be influenced by wildlife and other agricultural animals, such as poultry and
    swine (Dorner et al., 2006), however, their impact was not assessed in this study.
    Downstream of these tributaries, the cattle fecal marker could become quickly
    diluted by less impacted upstream water (as observed at GRU) as these streams
    discharge to the Grand River (Fig. 1). In agricultural areas, the concentration
    of BacTotal marker was significantly correlated with that of BacBovine marker,
    but not with that of BacHuman marker (Table 2). In WWTP effluent and the most
    downstream site, the concentration of BacTotal marker was significantly correlated
    only with that of BacHuman marker. In conjunction with the outcome of the relative
    contribution of host-specific markers (Fig. 3), this correlation result indicates
    that the elevated level of BacTotal marker could have resulted from the increased
    input of BacBovine marker at agricultural areas and of BacHuman marker at downstream
    sites (WTE and GRD), confirming our previous claim that the Bacteroidales qPCR
    assays could accurately determine the contribution of fecal sources at agricultural
    and urban sites. 4.2. Effects of rainfall on Bacteroidales marker loading In this
    study, the concentration of bovine-specific Bacteroidales marker, as well as those
    of human-specific marker and E. coli, was monitored along with precipitation in
    rural and urban areas. This approach complements previous studies where the effect
    of rain was investigated mostly for the human-specific Bacteroidales marker concentration
    during intense storm events in urban settings (Converse et al., 2011, Gentry-Shields
    et al., 2012, Sauer et al., 2011). In two agricultural streams, a positive relationship
    was observed between 48-h total rainfall and microbiological measurements, such
    as the concentrations of BacBovine and BacTotal makers and E. coli, indicating
    that precipitation is an important factor in fecal material loading to surface
    water in these tributaries (Fig. 4). According to studies conducted at the same
    tributary (CAC) by Dorner et al., 2006, Dorner et al., 2007, the in-stream level
    of fecal microorganisms, such as E. coli and waterborne pathogens, is primarily
    affected by subsurface transport of microorganisms from land-based sources via
    tile drainage systems, whereas overland transport of microorganisms and resuspension
    of sediment-bound microorganisms can be important inputs during large storm events.
    A positive relationship between the in-stream level of fecal microorganisms and
    precipitation (or streamflow rate) has been reported (Converse et al., 2011, Kistemann
    et al., 2002, Peed et al., 2011, Stumpf et al., 2010). The evidence of such a
    relationship has been scarce for host-specific Bacteroidales markers originating
    from diffuse sources in agricultural settings (Mauffret et al., 2012). In contrast
    to cattle fecal pollution dynamics, human fecal loading was not significantly
    affected by rainfall at any of the five sites. A lack of correlation between precipitation
    and the human-specific marker in WWTP effluent (p > 0.1, Spearman''s rank correlation
    analysis) was expected as this site is not influenced by rain-triggered events
    such as discharge from combined sewer overflows (Lake Erie Source Protection Region,
    2012), and it is a continuous source of human fecal pollution to the Grand River.
    Precipitation also did not correlate with the human-specific marker at the most
    downstream site, and this suggests that human fecal contamination is likely a
    result of inputs from point sources located upstream. Non-point sources of human
    fecal pollution (most likely leachate from faulty septic systems), which could
    be affected by precipitation, is likely of limited impact compared to the much
    larger influence of WWTP effluent in the watershed. A significant correlation
    was also not observed between precipitation and the BacHuman marker levels in
    other urban settings (Gentry-Shields et al., 2012, Sauer et al., 2011, Surbeck
    et al., 2006). 4.3. Source tracking capacity during specific storm events Besides
    the capacity to identify fecal pollution sources over an extended period, the
    assays could detect changes in BacTotal and BacBovine marker levels during specific
    storm events at agricultural sites (CAC and COR). For example, a drastic increase
    of fecal pollution (by 20- to 40-fold) was noted during one-day heavy rainfall
    and subsequent heavy rainfall associated with Hurricane Sandy (October 23 to 30;
    marked as “heavy rain” in Fig. 4). Since manure is mostly spread on agricultural
    fields during fall and spring in Canada (Beaulieu, 2004), these incidences could
    be the result of intense surface run-off from agricultural fields following cattle
    manure spreading. In the same stream (CAC), large rain events were reported to
    trigger the highest fecal microorganism inputs to the stream mostly by overland
    transport (Dorner et al., 2006). However, we could not exclude other means of
    transport, such as resuspension of the markers from river sediments. Even at the
    most downstream site (GRD), cattle fecal signals detected were 3- to 10-fold higher
    in late October than during the rest of the sampling period (data not shown),
    probably as a result of the in-stream transport of fecal pollution from upstream
    agricultural areas. Transport of Bacteroidales markers from field deposited livestock
    feces via surface run-off was also reported in another study (Mauffret et al.,
    2012). Cattle fecal pollution declined in November probably due to drastically
    diminished precipitation. Total rainfall in November (13.7 mm in total) was less
    than 10% of that in October (140 mm in total). 5. Conclusions The Bacteroidales
    marker assays, when combined with weather and land use information, can allow
    for a better understanding of the sources of fecal inputs in various watersheds,
    but more importantly this approach can help us to understand when these fecal
    sources may impact water quality (i.e., seasonally, monthly or intra-storm events).
    This spatial and temporal information of fecal source inputs may lead to the development
    of future on-land management activities, as well as protection strategies, for
    drinking water sources and recreational waters. The study confirms that the Bacteroidales
    marker assays can be useful in microbial source tracking studies, and also shows
    that rain plays a major role in loading of host-specific Bacteroidales genetic
    markers from diffuse sources in agricultural areas. Acknowledgments This research

  description: 'The future electricity networks will have to accommodate large scale
    distributed generation (DG) with renewable energy resources such as windfarms.
    One of the problems facing the electricity utilities is the thermal ratings of
    components in the networks. The networks were designed in the past to transport
    power from centralised power stations to consumers, now they have to accommodate
    additional in-feeds from distributed generation. The utilities are under pressure
    to maximise the utilisation of their network to increase power flow. The overhead
    line conductors form the backbone of the power transmission and distribution systems.
    In order to maximise the power transfer capability, it is necessary to fully utilise
    the thermal ratings of the lines. This cannot be achieved by using the traditional
    static summer and winter line ratings as defined for example by the UK''s Engineering
    Recommendation P27, which are based on worst case weather conditions. Dynamic
    line rating (DLR) which takes into account the actual weather and environmental
    conditions is therefore gaining importance. This paper provides details of a protection
    relay that has been developed which is able to compute the dynamic line rating
    based on real-time weather conditions including ambient temperature, wind speed,
    wind direction and solar radiation. By comparing the maximum of the three phase
    line currents with this dynamic line rating, the relay is able to determine whether
    the rating of the line is about to be exceeded. The paper describes all the innovative
    features of this relay. It also discusses the different applications of this new
    technology. Analysis of the data obtained from a site trial in the UK shows that
    wind speed has the most significant impact on the line rating of the weather parameters.
    The analysis also shows that compared to the static ratings dynamic line ratings
    can enable up to 30% or more wind generation to be connected to the grid. Another
    particular concern for distribution network operators who must now manage integration
    of DG into the network is that of reliably detecting the islanding of DG from
    the main network. The term islanding or loss of mains (LOM) refers to the condition
    in which a generator is accidentally isolated from the mains supply and continues
    to feed local demand. This condition is highly undesirable for a number of reasons,
    including: risk to utility staff, provision of a poor quality supply to demand
    and the risk of out of synchronism re-closing. The condition is currently detected
    using a range of different passive protection elements including: over/under frequency
    and voltage, rate-of-change-of-frequency and voltage vector shift. Unfortunately,
    there is a widespread view that these techniques do not offer the levels of sensitivity
    to near balance conditions and stability during network faults that will enable
    the reliable integration of distributed generation. This paper also describes
    a protection relay incorporating a novel islanding detection method that is based
    on an accumulated phase angle drift measurement. No additional invasive hardware
    is required and so the method retains the passive characteristic that is valued
    by network operators. The method has been tested extensively using a Real Time
    Digital Simulator (RTDS). The results obtained indicate that the method possesses
    good sensitivity whilst at the same time giving highly stable operation for even
    electrically close three-phase faults.'

    Overview The use of crop system models and simulation had its start in crop physiology,
    soil physics, and soil-crop-water processes. Early models focused mainly on the
    crop carbon (C) balance under optimum conditions, where only solar radiation and
    temperature were the driving variables. Simulation of crop canopy photosynthesis
    from leaf-level parameters was a primary focus (DeWit, 1965; Duncan, 1971), along
    with predicting crop development as described through their growth stages and
    examining strategies for increasing reproductive yield. These patriarchs of crop
    modeling soon advanced to developing simple whole crop models. Concurrently, the
    early agricultural engineers and soil physicists were developing soil-plant-water
    balance models that predicted daily crop evapotranspiration, crop water uptake,
    and water flow processes in soils (Whisler et al., 1986). See Whisler et al. (1986)
    for an overview and history of crop simulation models up to the mid-1980s, including
    typical processes considered, data required, model testing, and applications.
    The crop aspects of many of the early soil-water-balance models were often fairly
    simple, estimating daily growth from light-interception and radiation-use-efficiency.
    The soil water balance models vary from tipping bucket one-dimensional water balance
    (Ritchie, 1985, 1998) to more complex Darcy-driven water flow with two dimensional
    flow such as 2-DSOIL (Ahuja, Ma, & Timlin, 2006) and RZWQM (Ma et al., 2003).
    The next improvement in crop system models came with the simulation of soil nitrogen
    (N) balance with a simple tipping bucket plug-flow of nitrate N to allow simulation
    of N leaching, but success was limited until improvement in two major components
    had occurred: first, the crop C balance routines needed to estimate crop N demand
    accurately and second, accurate routines to estimate soil organic matter mineralization
    are needed to estimate the supply of soil mineral N beyond that coming from applied
    fertilizer N. There are many published soil organic matter models (e.g., see Smith
    et al., 1997, who compared nine different soil organic matter models). The most
    frequently cited organic matter models are CENTURY (Parton, Stewart, & Cole, 1988)
    and ROTHC (Jenkinson & Rayner, 1977), and these models often serve as reference
    models for many studies (Traore, Bostick, Jones, Koo, Goita, & Bado, 2008). Each
    of these models has shortcomings, and there are many difficulties correctly simulating
    soil organic matter dynamics, even after 20-30 years of progress, because soils
    are so variable and soil organic matter is complex. Continue Reading References

  description: Crop simulation models that respond to daily weather data are being
    developed to assist within-season decision making. The sensitivities of these
    decisions and of resulting profit to current season weather data, short-term weather
    forecasts, and assumptions about future weather were investigated for three separate
    seasons. The analysis indicated that actual rainfall data prior to each decision
    date were essential. The use of average temperature and radiation decreased profit
    by 1 to 2%. Future weather and management conditions had a large impact on the
    irrigation schedules and the net profit simulated by the model. Therefore, reliable
    short-term precipitation forecasts coupled with location-specific precipitation
    probability distributions for the remainder of the season were needed for applying
    the soybean crop model to make real-time irrigation decisions.

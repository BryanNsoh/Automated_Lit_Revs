  description: Due to the application of internet of things (IoT) to large-scale cow
    breeding, mass of multi-scale data and multi-divisional sensor data and video
    monitoring data of cow individuals were collected. Therefore, it is significant
    to dig out useful information about features of healthy reproduction behavior
    for development of scientific large-scale breeding measures and improve economic
    benefits from cow breeding. For the rapid and accurate identification of cow reproduction
    and healthy behavior from mass surveillance video, totally 400 head of young cows
    and lactating cows were taken as the research object and cow behavior from the
    dairy activity area and milk hall ramp was analyzed. The method of object recognition
    based on image entropy was proposed, aiming at the identification of motional
    cow object behavior against a complex background. Calculation of a minimum bounding
    box and contour mapping was used for the real-time capture of rutting span behavior
    and hoof or back characteristics. Then, by combining the continuous image characteristics
    with movement of cows for 7 d, abnormal behavior of dairy cows from healthy reproduction
    can be quickly distinguished by the method, which improved the accuracy of the
    identification of dairy cows characteristics. Cow behavior recognition based on
    image analysis and activities was proposed to capture abnormal behavior that had
    harmful effects on healthy reproduction and improve the accuracy of cow behavior
    identification. The experimental results showed that through target detection,
    classification and recognition, the recognition rates of hoof disease and heat
    in the reproduction and health of dairy cows were greater than 80%, and the false
    negative rates of oestrus and hoof disease reached 3.28% and 5.32%, respectively.
    This method can enhance the real-time monitoring of cows, save time and improve
    the management efficiency of large-scale farming.

    Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agriculture Machinery (CSAM), in charged
    of China Association for Science and Technology (CAST), sponsored by CSAM and
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Mechanization Science(CAAMS), started publication
    in 1957. It is the earliest interdisciplinary journal in Chinese which combines
    agricultural and engineering. It always closely grasps the development direction
    of agriculture engineering disciplines and the published papers represent the
    highest academic level of agriculture engineering in China. Currently, nearly
    8,000 papers have been already published. There are around 3,000 papers contributed
    to the journal each year, but only around 600 of them will be accepted. Transactions
    of CSAM focuses on a wide range of agricultural machinery, irrigation, electronics,
    robotics, agro-products engineering, biological energy, agricultural structures
    and environment and more. Subjects in Transactions of the CSAM have been embodied
    by many internationally well-known index systems, such as: EI Compendex, CA, CSA,
    etc.    下载PDF阅读器 引证文献(本文共被引1次): [1] 郑国生,施正香,滕光辉.基于不同行为时间的奶牛健康状况评价[J].农业工程学报,2019,35(19):238-244.

  description: In intensive and large-scale farming, piggery environmental monitoring
    is an important method for improving productivity and preventing disease in pig
    herds. The piggery environment mainly includes air temperature, air humidity,
    and ammonia concentration. Piggery environmental monitoring mostly concentrates
    on a single environmental factor and data processing. Few studies focus on multiple
    environmental factors and information fusion from a variety of monitoring sensors.
    Therefore, in this paper, the main environmental factors that affect herd health,
    such as temperature, humidity, and ammonia concentration, were monitored. According
    to the analysis of piggery environmental adaptability indicators, a multi-sensor
    data fusion model with five layers based on the adaptive fuzzy neural network
    of T-S inference was established. The structure of the model is 3-8-18-18-1. To
    check the performance of the model, 432 groups of data were selected by monitoring
    a piggery environment for three consecutive days. A total of 288 sets of data
    were obtained for training, and 144 sets of data were obtained for checking. The
    result shows that the model effectively fuses multi-sensor data. After 600 training
    cycles, a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.14×10-3 between the actual output
    of the system and the desired output can be achieved. The system output has high
    accuracy. The RMSE of the checking data and fuzzy system output is 0.18×10-2.
    Moreover, the operation efficiency of the system is high. Thus, the system is
    suitable for analyzing data in real time and for the processing of piggery environments.
    This system provides a good data processing method for monitoring and controlling
    piggery environments.

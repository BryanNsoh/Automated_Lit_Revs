    Abstract In recent decades, networked smart devices and cutting-edge technology
    have been exploited in many applications for the improvement of agriculture. The
    deployment of smart sensors and intelligent farming techniques supports real-time
    information gathering for the agriculture sector and decreases the burden on farmers.
    Many solutions have been presented to automate the agriculture system using IoT
    networks; however, the identification of redundant data traffic is one of the
    most significant research problems. Additionally, farmers do not obtain the information
    they need in time, such as data on water pressure and soil conditions. Thus, these
    solutions consequently reduce the production rates and increase costs for farmers.
    Moreover, controlling all agricultural operations in a controlled manner should
    also be considered in developing intelligent solutions. Therefore, this study
    proposes a framework for a system that combines fog computing with smart farming
    and effectively controls network traffic. Firstly, the proposed framework efficiently
    monitors redundant information and avoids the inefficient use of communication
    bandwidth. It also controls the number of re-transmissions in the case of malicious
    actions and efficiently utilizes the network’s resources. Second, a trustworthy
    chain is built between agricultural sensors by utilizing the fog nodes to address
    security issues and increase reliability by preventing malicious communication.
    Through extensive simulation-based experiments, the proposed framework revealed
    an improved performance for energy efficiency, security, and network connectivity
    in comparison to other related works. Keywords: agriculture system; Internet of
    Things; fog system; soil monitoring; green energy 1. Introduction Today, the Internet
    and the Internet of Things (IoT) dominate nearly everyone’s life. IoT is a paradigm
    that connects things, people, or networks and allows them to process and react
    precisely to any kind of physical or virtual communication [1,2,3]. IoT has applications
    in every industry, including healthcare, agriculture, and home controllers. It
    efficiently provides user-required services by utilizing Internet connectivity,
    sensors, and a variety of other technologies and protocols for collecting and
    analyzing data [4,5,6]. The Internet of Things helps companies to automate operations
    and improve service delivery using Internet technologies and cloud-based data
    transmission. For the various industries it is utilized in, IoT does not permit
    the adoption of universal software architecture; instead, it must be modified
    to meet user requirements [7,8,9]. Nowadays, smart agriculture is more important
    than ever because of the expanding global population and rising food demand. In
    this context, smart technologies have become a crucial route to cutting-edge agricultural
    practices [10,11,12]. There are many different applications, protocols, and prototypes
    in the field of agricultural land. Furthermore, several IoT policies and standards
    have been developed in the agriculture sector in numerous nations and organizations
    worldwide. Due to the limited boundaries of IoT devices, sensors, and actuators,
    a detailed study of IoT in the context of agriculture is required to understand
    the present state of research [13,14,15]. Throughout history, the agricultural
    industry has played a significant role in human cultures worldwide. Machine learning
    is a subset of artificial intelligence widely explored for identifying malicious
    attacks. Such a technique also focuses on making the system smart so that additional
    overhead can be reduced on the IoT devices [16,17]. The organization and practices
    of modern agriculture are significantly impacted by the development of information
    and communication technologies (ICTs). Despite the benefits of this evolution,
    several security concerns have the potential to negatively affect the agriculture
    sector [18,19,20]. Since farmers could sustain a significant financial and personal
    loss in the event of a data breach, data integrity and confidentiality are critical
    security concerns within the agricultural sector [21,22,23]. In this work, the
    main contributions are as follows: It provides a strategy to effectively manage
    IoT resources, identify the redundant nodes that are collecting the same data
    and forbid using them. Such a scheme is efficient in utilizing the resources of
    the network and prolonging the system life cycle. It develops intelligent methods
    using distributed machine learning to predict routing decisions for the selection
    of optimal forwarders with increasing data delivery and load balancing. Another
    aspect of the proposed framework is the usage of a fog system to establish a secure
    chain in the presence of unidentified and faulty nodes by establishing a reliable
    group of nodes. We verified the proposed framework with other work and the results
    demonstrate enhanced performance for various network parameters. This paper is
    further organized as follows: the discussion for related studies is presented
    in Section 2. Section 3 presents the detail of the proposed framework. In Section
    4, the simulation environment is briefly explained. Section 5 presents the results
    and discussion of the experiments. Lastly, the conclusion is in Section 6. 2.
    Related Work The smart city emerged as a concept with the fast growth of dependable
    information and communication models and the combination of sensor technologies
    [24,25,26]. Modern fog computing technology develops intelligent networks combining
    IoT networks and cloud platforms. Fog computing is applied at the network edge,
    and they perform a significant number of tasks in terms of processing, storage,
    and communication. Networking devices such as routers, gateways, etc., make up
    fog computing. Compared to sensor nodes, these devices have more processing, transmission,
    and storage capabilities [27,28]. In an IoT system, fog nodes received data from
    sensors and are further forwarded for high-cost processing with the support of
    data centers. A smart city promotes sustainability by utilizing various sensors
    to collect information from the environment while providing improved social facilities,
    transportation, and accessibility. The gathered information can then be utilized
    to manage urban infrastructure, including water supply, food services, environmental
    monitoring, and traffic congestion [29,30,31]. Smart agriculture is based on the
    IoT with future generation networks and is expected to benefit from the intelligently
    developed methodologies. The objectives of this strategy are to preserve water
    resources, lessen soil erosion, and improve soil quality [32,33]. An effective
    and scalable protocol for the remote monitoring and decision making of farms in
    rural areas is named the CL-IoT protocol, and it was proposed to focus on the
    requirements for smart farming applications [34]. To decrease network communication
    delay, latency, and energy consumption, cross-layer-based clustering, and routing
    algorithms were developed. The cluster head (CH) selection method based on cross-layers
    has been proposed as a means of solving the energy efficiency issue for resource
    constraint networks. Each sensor’s physical, medium access control (MAC), and
    network layer parameters were analyzed and chosen as the optimal CH for effective
    data transfer. The algorithm with a novel probabilistic decision rule that was
    inspired by nature is proposed and serves as a fitness function to choose the
    best path for data transfer. To choose the cluster head, a hybrid artificial neural
    network and decision tree method were built with the cognitive radio [35]. The
    base station receives more packets and collects more data from the typical sensor
    nodes as the residual energy level rises. The on-demand routing protocol is designed
    to hold data in local storage for retransmission during link failure to achieve
    reliable data transfer. Performance metrics for the proposed technique include
    throughput, packet drop rate, packet delivery ratio, normalized overhead, and
    residual energy. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy was compared to a
    cluster-based data aggregation scheme. A novel intelligent routing protocol was
    proposed in [36] to increase the network lifetime and offer energy efficiency
    in the routing process, which is used to deliver data to the irrigation system.
    The protocol is known as terrain-based routing using fuzzy rules for precision
    agriculture and it uses fuzzy rules to provide a revolutionary intelligent energy-efficient
    routing scheme. The routing decisions were made using the fuzzy inference method
    described in this work. The equalized cluster head election routing protocol and
    region-based routing are two routing algorithms that were constructed and compared
    with the system. The experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested algorithm
    outperforms the other available algorithms. For an Agriculture Internet of Things
    (AG-IoT) network, the authors proposed a supervised machine learning multipath
    and administrative-distance-based load balancing algorithm [37]. The proposed
    algorithm, also known as AI-enabled multi-hop and administrative-distance-based
    opportunistic routing (MHADBOR), processes the collected data from source to destination
    using the network’s multi-hop count and administrative-distance-based communication
    infrastructure. In addition, the authors frequently used CHs, microbase, and macrobase
    stations in the network to efficiently manage the deployed network traffic in
    a communication environment without congestion. In [38], the authors proposed
    an optimization of resource utilization in smart agriculture systems using IoT
    (SMAIoT) that can monitor several low-cost IoT sensor types. This framework gathers
    information from the soil, air, water, and insects and uses them to produce suitable
    decisions. The innovative aspect of the proposed framework is the scientific automation
    of functions such as irrigation, fertigation, pest detection, and pesticide spraying
    with efficient productivity. In [39], the authors provide an inter planetary file
    system (IPFS) storage for protecting agricultural sampling data based on the double-blockchain
    method for IoT networks. It stores the content of the sampled data using the IPFS
    network, and the proposed system can obtain the entire data segment using an oracle
    technique. Then, the authors developed a consortium blockchain, Agricultural Sample
    Data Chain (ASDC) by using Ethereum technology, and enhanced the Merkle Patricia
    Trie (MPT)-based accounts for all categories of sampled data. To retain a public
    record in the case of malicious attacks, block hashes are generated and uploaded
    on Ethereum’s main chain after storing the data in ASDC blocks. Limitations of
    the Existing Schemes The summary of relevant studies shows that the IoT has grown
    significantly in creating and developing smart agriculture systems. It aids the
    farmers in monitoring soil conditions and water supply and increases productivity
    with the management of costs. It gathers the agricultural data and sends them
    to cloud databases to take the necessary actions accordingly. Numerous solutions
    have recently been proposed to deal with intelligent data monitoring with improved
    latency using machine learning techniques. However, many of the existing systems
    do not make it apparent how different connections are handled when there are redundant
    data. Moreover, efficient load balancing with the collaboration of mobile sensors
    is another significant research challenge [40,41]. Although many solutions have
    offered security for remote monitoring, this has been at the cost of computation
    and complexity. As a result, we need a framework to handle the timely supply of
    monitoring data using some smart and intelligent behaviors. 3. Material and Methods
    This section presents a detailed discussion of the proposed framework with the
    system model. Additionally, its algorithm and developed components are explained.
    3.1. System Model and Background of the Proposed Framework The system model consists
    of sensors, fog nodes, and the sink node. They are deployed at random positions
    and the sink node is mobile. The fog nodes are considered more intelligent and
    have sufficient resources as compared to ordinary sensors. The mobile sink has
    a direct association with cloud systems. Initially, IoT sensors are arranged in
    an undirected graph 𝐺 with finite vertices  𝑁  and edges 𝐸 . Each node has enough
    memory to hold and maintain its neighbors’ information. Similarly, neighbors in
    the fog system’s proximity are arranged in the form list based on a particular
    score. Fog systems not only aggregate the agricultural data for transmission towards
    the sink node but also offer a security layer among sensors and cloud services.
    Each node has a prefixed transmission range, and in case the sink node is far
    away from it, the proposed framework adopts a multi-hop forwarding decision. We
    show the scenario for the proposed framework in Figure 1. A robust routing strategy
    was built with the identification of the redundant nodes, and agricultural sensors
    are installed in the field to sense the various situations. In the case of redundant
    nodes, such information is not permitted for transmission. Later, fog layers are
    made up of numerous fog nodes to initiate communication with sink nodes. Agriculture
    users may simply obtain the data from their smart devices with the support of
    cloud platforms. Our proposed framework also ensures data privacy and security
    in an unpredictable environment. Figure 1. Scenario for fog-based IoT agricultural
    system. Figure 2 depicts the block diagram of the proposed framework. It is comprised
    of three sub-blocks, i.e., network structure, machine learning system, and fog-based
    secured communication. Firstly, sensors, actuators, gateways, and other communication
    devices initialized themselves for sensing and forwarding agricultural data. The
    sensors continuously record environmental information, which is then sent to sink
    nodes via local coordinators or gateways. Second, a machine learning-based technique
    was created to reduce the communication overheads of the sensor nodes. Finally,
    the proposed system adopts the distributed regression function to assess the various
    attributes of the system and achieves efficient node management [42]. Moreover,
    the machine learning approach not only balances the load over the multiple routes,
    but the proposed framework can also identify the redundant nodes. Duplicate data
    are therefore prohibited from entering in proximity to fog nodes. In the end,
    a fog-based secured scheme is developed with the intelligence of fog nodes and
    cryptographic techniques. Fog nodes perform dual functionalities for communication
    with both the IoT system and cloud platform. This validates the authenticity of
    incoming packets, and accordingly, appropriate actions are taken. In the case
    of authorized nodes, they are allowed to send the data towards the cloud system
    or the request packets are dropped by the fog nodes. The information is recorded
    in the table about false messages and non-authentic devices. Figure 2. Block diagram
    of the proposed methodology. 3.2. Machine Learning-Based Distributed Regressional
    Analysis Based on the undirected graph, the proposed framework identifies the
    initial and temporary routes 𝑅( 𝑟 1 ,  𝑟 2 ,……,  𝑟 𝑛 ). The selected routes are
    based on the distance factor and each node maintains its neighbor table in a controlled
    manner. By exploring the neighbor table, each node formulates a route to the sink
    node for data transmission. To attain an efficient routing scheme with balances
    the load and bandwidth utilization, the proposed framework initiates the nodes
    management activity on the routes 𝑟 𝑖 . Let us consider that 𝑁 𝑖 has a data 𝐷
    𝑖 to transmit to the sink node. Then, the proposed framework first identified
    the overlapping nodes that lay in the same transmission range. If any such nodes
    exist, then set their flag’s value in the routing table. The flag value indicates
    the forwarding status of the nodes. Let us suppose that 𝐷 𝑡 is the distance threshold
    of the node  𝑁𝐷𝑠 , and 𝑟 is the predefined radius. To determine the overlapping
    nodes, the proposed framework exploits the search zone candidate nodes  𝐶 𝑁  based
    on the 𝐷 𝑡 and 𝑟 , as given below 𝑁𝐷𝑠 ( 𝐶 𝑁 ,  𝐷 𝑡 )≤𝑟 (1) After determining the
    candidate nodes, the proposed framework updates the routing table of source node
    𝑖 with the latest statistical values of neighbors. Table 1 describes the format
    of the routing table. It comprised node identity, transmission power, flag value,
    computing score, and distance. The node identity which is one byte long is unique.
    The next field is one byte long and contains the value of preset transmission
    power. The flag field is just a Boolean parameter to indicate whether the node
    can be silent or not, and it is one bit long. Finally, the scoring factor is two
    bytes long and depends on the captured information about the nodes. In the end,
    the distance is 1 byte long and contains information about the space toward the
    fog system. Table 1. Format of a routing table. The proposed framework only allows
    one node in the transmission radius for sensing and forwarding the agricultural
    data. To achieve this, it determines the node score  𝑠 𝑐 𝑖  with 𝑤 𝑖  weighted
    coefficient using distributed weighted regression function 𝑋(𝑖) , and based on
    the maximum score, the flag value of the nodes 𝑖  is set to either “True” or “False”,
    as given below: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝑖𝑓 𝑠 𝑐 𝑖 ==𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑓 𝑖   𝑖𝑠  𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒   (2)
    𝑋(𝑖)= 𝑤 𝑖  . 𝑠 𝑐 𝑖  (3) The 𝑠 𝑐 𝑖  value for node 𝑖 is determined by exploring
    the residual energy 𝑒 𝑖  , packets load  𝑃 𝐿 𝑖  , distance  𝐷 𝑓 𝑖  , as given
    below: 𝑠 𝑐 𝑖 = 𝑒 𝑖 +1/𝑃 𝐿 𝑖 + 1 𝐷 𝑓 𝑖 / (4) where  𝑃 𝐿 𝑖   defines in terms of
    transmitted packets 𝑁 at time interval 𝑇 , as defined below. 𝑃 𝐿 𝑖 = 𝑁 𝑇 / (5)
    3.3. Fog Systems-Based Security Maintenance In the proposed framework, the fog
    nodes performed the role of the intermediate system between the data originating
    network and cloud services. Firstly, it received all the data and stores it in
    memory for further analysis and processing. It then confirms the data authenticity
    to forward it towards the cloud system in the multi-hop discipline. Then, the
    aggregated data  𝐷 𝐴  is encrypted 𝐸𝑛 using the secret key 𝑘 of the node 𝑖 . Additionally,
    it is integrated with the identity 𝐼 𝐷 𝑖  as given below. 𝐸𝑛(𝑘) ( 𝐷 𝐴 +𝐼 𝐷 𝑖 )
    (6) Upon receiving, fog nodes decrypt it to retrieve the aggregated data and the
    identity of the data-originated node. After the decryption process, the fog nodes
    verify the identity of the nodes with their stored information, and if it matches
    positively, then it will look up its routing table for the selection of the next
    hop among the neighboring fogs. Moreover, the cloud system 𝑐 authenticates the
    receiving data using digital signatures. To achieve this, the fog node 𝐹𝐺 first
    digitally signs the aggregated data 𝐷 𝐴  using its private key 𝑝 𝑟  to generate
    a secret value 𝑆 , as given below. 𝐹 𝐺 𝑐  =𝑆 + 𝐷 𝐴  (7) where 𝐸 𝑝 𝑟 ( 𝐷 𝐴 )=𝑆
    (8) On the other side, the cloud system first authenticates the digital signature
    using the public key of the fog nodes and upon successful verification, it is
    further forwarded to the connected end users with the IoT system. The flow between
    the developed techniques for intelligent agricultural routing is shown in Figure
    3. Initial routes are formulated using the greedy method and exploited for optimizing
    the routing process. It can detect redundant nodes in the proximity of a predefined
    radius and accordingly, it sets the flag value by exploring the intelligent technique
    of machine learning. The flag value indicates the status of neighbors and whether
    they can transmit the data or keep them in silent mode. Finally, agricultural
    data is transmitted towards the sink node using the fog-based IoT system. Figure
    3. Developed methods for the proposed framework. Figure 4 explains the security
    algorithm for transmitting agricultural data with the support of fog nodes. It
    clarifies the fog-based trust mechanism with privacy concerns and reliability.
    Accordingly, the proposed security algorithm decreases the probabilities of network
    attacks and stabilizes the communication system. Fog nodes are utilized as a bridge
    to facilitate both the IoT and cloud systems. Firstly, fog nodes verified the
    incoming agricultural data, and upon its validation, authentication and session
    agreement are established. The session agreement is valid for a particular time
    and needs to be refreshed later for further communication. In case verification
    is unsuccessful, then the error message is generated towards the data originating
    node. Additionally, fog nodes construct routing paths for data forwarding by exploring
    the routing table. The routing information is updated and evaluated each time
    that data transmission is needed. In the end, fog and cloud ensure data security
    using cryptography-based digital signature and encryption techniques. Such a technique
    provides high-level security measures to the upper layers. Figure 4. Flowchart
    of the proposed security algorithm. Moreover, the functioning of the proposed
    framework consists of many states, as depicted in Figure 5. The system will be
    in a specific state at a given time, and it will change states when a particular
    trigger is called. The objectives of the states are defined below. Figure 5. States
    of the proposed framework. - Sensor’s deployment: In this state, agriculture nodes
    are randomly dispersed in the targeted area. They have limited constraints and
    not enough memory, transmissions, and processing resources. They are not able
    to communicate with the sink node directly; - Data sense: All the deployed sensors,
    actuators, and IoT devices collaborate in collecting the data. In addition, the
    data are transferred to the sink nodes through integrating fog systems. The fog
    nodes are explored for reducing communication delays; - Relay node: The data are
    obtained from the deployed sensors and forwarded towards the relay node. The roles
    for relay nodes are not predefined, they are chosen using quality-aware parameters;
    - Decision making: In this state, a distributed machine learning technique is
    applied using network statistics to offer the optimal results for attaining a
    reliable communication system; - Data security: In this end, security actions
    are performed in this state. It identifies faulty nodes and false messages to
    detect the comprised data using private values. It increases the reliability of
    remote users that are connected to cloud systems. 4. Simulations This section
    presents the simulation environment and a discussion of the various tests. We
    ran the simulations of a core i7 laptop with 64 GB RAM and 1 TB hard drive. 20
    trials of the simulations were performed. Between 150 and 750 sensor nodes were
    used in each simulation experiment. Zigbee technologies were used in the testing,
    and experiments were carried out in 1000 m × 1000 m area with a variety of configuration
    settings. For sensing the agricultural environment, numerous sensor categories
    were utilized, including temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, and water quality.
    Two sink nodes, between ten and fifteen 15 fog nodes, and various relay nodes
    were also deployed. Sensor nodes collected the agriculture data and forwarded
    them to the relay nodes for aggregation and data routing. The fog nodes existed
    between sensors and sink nodes. The duration of the experiments was 2000 rounds
    and each round had a time interval of 20 s. The sensors were equipped with GPS.
    Communication channels were scattered with certain malicious nodes to test the
    system’s security. The results analysis was obtained based on the packet delivery,
    energy efficiency, network connectivity, and reliability metrics. All the network
    metrics were evaluated under scenarios of varying sensors and distances from the
    sink node. Table 2 contains the various parameters for simulations. Table 2. Simulation
    parameters. 5. Results with Discussion We evaluated the performance of the proposed
    framework with other studies in terms of energy efficiency. The performance evaluation
    of the proposed framework against those of related works is shown in Figure 6a,b
    for varied IoT sensors and the distance from the sink node. It was found that
    the proposed framework, even in the presence of malfunctioning nodes, considerably
    improves the delivery rate of data packets by an average of 20% for varying nodes,
    and 22% for varying distances from the sink. It results from exploring security
    approaches, key generation, and mutual trust. In the proposed paradigm, the intelligent
    system achieves sustainability and effectively identifies harmful activities by
    utilizing the secret and personal data of devices. Furthermore, the sink nodes
    are more powerful than IoT sensors and verify each activity before sending it
    to the end users. Unlike the majority of the proposed research, our framework
    explicitly provides intelligent decision modules for enhancing packet delivery
    performance with the aid of machine learning and sustains the network load with
    improved throughput. Figure 7a,b demonstrate the comparison of the proposed framework
    in the literature and it was discovered that it notably improves the network reliability
    by an average of 18% and 23% for both scenarios. This is due to the exposure of
    machine learning techniques to identify the optimal IoT nodes and intelligently
    interact with cloud systems. Moreover, the proposed framework can tackle redundant
    information and decreases the chances of data unavailability and congestion. Additionally,
    the security solution decreases unwanted traffic across the open transmission
    system and stops malicious devices from sending false route request packets. As
    a result, the proposed framework lengthens the response time for critical situations
    with a nominal delay rate. The comparison of the proposed and existing solutions
    is revealed in Figure 8a,b in terms of varying nodes and distances from the sink.
    The statistical analysis demonstrated that the proposed framework increased energy
    usage by 15% and 24%, respectively. Energy efficiency was found to be negatively
    impacted when the number of devices increased. On the other hand, the proposed
    framework provides a smart energy solution based on a distributed machine learning
    technique and smoothly selects the updated routes by utilizing the optimum solution.
    Additionally, the proposed framework effectively defends against multiple attacks
    and minimizes the consumption of network bandwidth by employing a security algorithm.
    Consequently, the nodes’ energy is increased, which improves the performance of
    the entire network. By finding the redundant nodes in the routing table, the flag
    status is modified. Nodes whose flag value is false are therefore prohibited from
    participating in data routing. The performance comparison of the proposed framework
    to the existing solutions for network connectivity is illustrated in Figure 9a,b.
    Network connectivity indicates the active time at which nodes use particular communication
    links. The connectivity ratio for the proposed framework against various IoT devices
    and varied distances is remarkably enhanced by an average of 16% for varying distances
    from the sink and 20% in terms of varying nodes. This is due to the ability of
    the proposed framework to efficiently manage power distribution across the sensors
    and investigate the machine learning principles for accomplishing forwarding decisions.
    Moreover, the proposed framework directs the routing module to formulate the routes
    by re-evaluating the decisions whenever any disrupted intermediate links are discovered
    or frequent re-transmissions. The proposed framework successfully manages the
    transmission overheads by including the least computational cost function. Figure

    With an emphasis on green energy and remote monitoring, smart technologies and
    agricultural systems have grown significantly in recent years. It controls the
    plants, soil characteristics, water pressure, and weather-related information,
    which benefits farmers and increases production. However, limited solutions have
    been proposed to enhance production in precision agriculture while reducing latency
    and information disturbance. Furthermore, protecting agricultural data while utilizing
    the insecure Internet is another significant research challenge. In this study,
    we presented a framework for providing a farmer communication system to enhance
    timely delivery through the cooperation of fog systems. This system also incorporates
    redundant information detection, which reduces network bandwidth inefficiencies.
    Additionally, the proposed framework employs security methods to counter privacy
    attacks on sensing data. The performance results showed the good outcomes of the
    proposed framework with maximum energy efficiency and delivery ratio. Furthermore,
    its performance has proven the improved processing usage in the existence of malicious
    devices. In the future, we intend to cope with the proposed framework’s scalability
    and load-balancing issues with the support of a multi-cloud architecture. Moreover,
    we would like to integrate security to maintain cloud integrity from the point
    of users’ perspective. Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.R. and K.H.;

    necessity of smart city has grown considerably. The smart city infrastructure
    grasps several technologies like Internet of Things, blockchain, and fog and cloud
    computing to form sustainable development of innovative applications for intellectual
    data processing, control systems, and communications between heterogeneous network
    infrastructures. Some of the smart city’s initiatives are green energy, water
    and pollution management, smart transportation, wireless Internet services, and
    promotion of local commerce that incorporate technologies in infrastructure to

    security to strengthen the trust and integrity of data transactions. Fog computing
    acts as a significant place to analyze the IoT data gathered from the near sensor
    devices at the edge of the network. The network edge performs the data processing
    for smart city applications and reduces the energy consumption for communication
    in IoT environment. But, the downside of the technology’s implementation is it
    faces multiple challenges like security, data privacy, data integrity, platform

    in the urban lifestyle, the smart cities originated for the improvement of the
    quality of living and to optimize the utilization of cities’ resources [1]. There
    are a lot of improvements that have been carried out on infrastructure and different
    services which elevated the eminence of life. All these could be possible with
    the support of the Internet, telecommunication, and advancement in the information
    technology field [2]. The expectation from the awareness of smart cities includes
    smart transportation, efficient society services, and better infrastructure results
    in on-demand accessible and effective interactive services. With the support of
    the Internet of Things (IoT), the vision of the smart city becomes reality. As
    a result, many IoT applications have been built up for the smart cities services
    to interact with the people anytime and anywhere. The smart cities are deployed
    with physical objects interconnected with the IoT system. This system emphasizes
    four pillars in IoT concepts such as things, data, objects, and processes. Hence,
    the integration of IoT concepts with smart city domain will facilitate the promising
    services in the near future. Big data analytics is an emerging technique to analyze
    the massive data generated by IoT-connected devices which could help to sort out
    the issues of data storage and processing. Fog computing, also referred to as
    edge computing or fogging, extends the cloud computing services to the enterprise
    network’s edge. It allows the edge devices to transfer a significant amount of
    data to compute, store, and communicate for the local decision and forward over
    the Internet. This chapter discusses a conceptual framework with the dimensions
    (1) technology, (2) human, and (3) organization and reconnoitering the challenges
    of digital technologies with the support of blockchain-based fog computing model
    (BFCM) for smart cities [3]. This model reduces energy consumption and latency
    in data communication and improves security features. The convergence of blockchain
    and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in smart cities ensures the security
    and privacy of data captured and stored in a cloud-based infrastructure. In the
    IoT application execution of fog computing, the node called fog node (FN) acts
    as a basic fundamental entity and an intermediate layer between the cloud and
    edge devices [4]. Emerging IoT applications require the support of mobility, low
    latency, geo-distribution, and location awareness. The BFCM architecture targeted
    to improve the efficiencies of the above parameters by handling most of the data
    at the network edges rather than transferring to cloud always. Another important
    service to address is the security of data and devices which could be enhanced
    by using the blockchain technology. The blockchain technology [5, 6] is organized
    as a series of blocks and chains of records stored in a shared database which
    could be secured by cryptographic hash functions. Each block is a group of transactions
    that had occurred for a while. 2 IoT Technologies in Smart Cities In recent decades,
    there are several researchers that worked on IoT-related smart cities. Smart cities
    are one of the rapidly progressing technological revolution and escalation of
    Internet of Things development in every possible aspect of urban lifestyle [7].
    A smart city is designed for providing solutions for the environment, traffic,
    and other energy management problems by integrating various technologies such
    as Internet of Things, big data, and blockchain. Simply, the smart city is a network
    of environment with objects, people, and services sharing the information with
    one another through the communication technologies like 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi. Due
    to the blended heterogeneous devices with different technologies, the deployment
    of smart cities becomes very much complicated [8]. The large-scale network exponentially
    increases the difficulties of object’s management and tracking which results in
    an intruder or attacker easily performing security breaches. By taking all these
    in mind, building a basic infrastructure for a smart city in urban areas needs
    support from various sensors and technologies [9]. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is one among them, considered as a key builder in the development of smart city.
    The fundamental components and concepts of smart city are given in Table 5.1.
    Table 5.1 Fundamental components and concepts of smart city [36] Full size table
    An emerging smart city objective is to make use of the resources like energy and
    electricity in an effectual way to provide a suitable and comprehensive infrastructure
    for the human society in day-to-day life. Therefore, the impact of IoT is magnified
    in various services of smart cities [10]. The smart city is a network of six components:
    smart environment, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart economy,
    and smart living (Fig. 5.1). Some of the applications and services where IoT technologies
    and smart city projects de facto overlap are listed below [11]: Public services
    such as public transportation management, citizen services, tourism services and
    healthcare sector administration, and information services Sustainability which
    includes smart wastage management and recycling system, smart metering, smart
    energy, smart water, and environmental monitoring Infrastructure services that
    deal with smart building’s structural health monitoring, smart lighting, smart
    irrigation, smart schools, etc. Transportation services that handle smart traffic
    management, coordinating the connected vehicles on the road, smart road system,
    pollution and noise control management, and so on Safety services which are video
    surveillance, disaster recovery system, environmental screening, and telemedicine
    system Fig. 5.1 Smart city components [12] Full size image IoT technologies in
    Table 5.2 provide IT solutions for automatic electricity services, telecommunication
    services and construction, vehicle telematics, smart healthcare, and other business
    services [12]. Table 5.2 IoT technologies for smart cities Full size table 3 Fog
    Computing for Smart Cities The Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of everyday
    automation objects/things to collect and exchange massive amount of data over
    the Internet. All those collected data are pushed into the cloud for further analysis
    and knowledge discovery for future purpose [10]. Moreover, the amount of gathered
    data becomes overwhelming to store and manage, requiring high-processing computing
    devices to forward to cloud, and will have limitations such as resources wastage
    (e.g., storage, bandwidth), unreliable latency, and data security. The result
    of fog computing or edge computing offers different solutions to these limitations.
    The main goal of Fog computing technology is to improve the effectiveness and
    minimize the amount of information sent over the Internet to the cloud for analysis,
    processing, and storage by performing data analytics at the network edges [13].
    Edge devices are easy to control, manage, and self-govern at the local network.
    Therefore, the network traffic and data processing have been reduced considerably
    by moving the services to the edge of the local network. In smart cities development,
    the fog computing plays a potential role in processing a variety of volume of
    data swiftly and most securely . Figure 5.2 illustrates the various elements of
    smart city that applies fog computing technology to support low latency , location
    awareness, and mobility to the end users. Fig. 5.2 Fog computing for sustainable
    smart cities [3] Full size image Smart cities achieve the below listed benefits
    through the incorporation of fog computing technology [14]: Reduced the amount
    of data being sent to cloud: Fog computing uses intelligent sensing and filtering
    technique to allow only the useful and most needed information to the cloud; the
    remaining will be available at the local fog devices in the network premises.
    Low latency: Fog devices are capable of data processing and decision-making and
    sending back results without depending on the remote cloud services. Especially,
    these characteristics save a lot of time considerably in IoT automated environment.
    Reduced bandwidth: Forwarding and processing of sensed data require huge amount
    of bandwidth in cloud computing. But, in the case of fog computing, this issue
    does not exist because most of the data are stored and processed by the fog nodes
    inside the local network which significantly reduces the consumption of total
    network bandwidth. Security enhancement: Fog computing restricts the outreach
    of most sensible and confidential data exposed to the vulnerable public network
    (Internet) which results safeguard the data from cyberattacks and hacking. Henceforth,
    fog computing provides relief to the smart city components by achieving reliable
    and faster data communication. In succession, the urban areas called as fog (edge)
    computing smart city proliferate the communal sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing,
    education, transportation, energy, and utilities [15]. 4 Blockchain-Based Fog
    Computing Model (BFCM) The blockchain-based fog computing model (BFCM) for the
    smart cities is introduced to connect the Internet of Things (IoT) and fog nodes
    . This model is an on-demand service that provides high performance with low latency
    and secure device management and data privacy in a distributed form of infrastructure
    [16]. It will result in the improvement of lifestyle quality of the citizens and
    meeting the expectations of day-to-day activities. 4.1 Blockchain: A Study A blockchain
    technology is a decentralized distributed database with special data structure
    which forms all transactions into blocks with secure distinctive hash code and
    transmits them to every node [17]. It works with different elements like network,
    authentication, and transactions to store the sensitive data. It also enables
    the network’s authorized members to validate the transaction data at any time
    and to quickly store it as a digital information which is easy to manage against
    any forgery and attacks. A public key cryptographic technique is used to sign
    all the transaction on a distributed ledger linked blocks of records known as
    blockchain [18]. Once the data is transferred, it cannot be changed, and it provides
    better security to the information. For smart cities management, various frameworks
    support Internet of Things (IoT) technology but face multiple issues like security,
    resource management, heterogeneous devices and data, multiple application assistance,
    and platform independence. The BFCM-based infrastructure secures sensitive information
    with authentication, edge computing, encryption, and blockchain. 4.2 Structure
    of Blockchain Generally, a blockchain is nothing but consecutive list of records,
    called blocks, that contains the detailed transactions linked using cryptography
    in a network. In Fig. 5.3, each record, or block, consists of a header and a body,
    where the header comprises the previous record or block’s identity and the body
    portion encompasses stored data/transactions that are being transferred [6]. The
    chain of blocks is connected as linked list to transfer over the network. Fig.
    5.3 Structure of blockchain [6] Full size image Intuitively, blockchain technology
    offers desirable features such as decentralization, immutability, distributed
    ledger, and fault tolerance. Intrinsically, BFCM promotes transparency and trust
    on smart city elements and helps to provide on-demand services to the citizens
    [19]. Decentralization—A blockchain technology is a decentralized database network
    which does not have any governing authority or entity at the framework to manage
    and control the transactions of data among the smart city components. So, the
    data storage and analytics integrate the security and trust on decision-making
    processes. Immutability—It is one of the exciting key features of blockchain technology
    , where the network is permanent, uncorrupted, and unaltered. The chain of immutable
    blocks contains the secured data with digital ledger ensuring the validity and
    corruption-proof. IoT-enabled smart city infrastructure struggles with handling
    massive data being generated, safety and security of carrying sensitive information
    such as financial transaction, health-related data, traffic information, and so
    on. With the support of immutability in smart cities, the communication becomes
    tamper-free where an attacker would have to compromise all the devices within
    the network to alter any records in the blockchain. Distributed Ledger—Generally,
    the term DLT stands for distributed ledger technology , used to keep multiple
    copies of single ledger in a distributed manner. So, all the ledger holders should
    ensure the data integrity and the data cannot be altered in between. The DLT provides
    data sharing and smart services in building a smart city infrastructure that are
    supported by blockchain and IoT . Fault Tolerance—The distributed nature of blockchain
    technology allows the nodes to tolerate the malicious behavior for certain threshold.
    Blockchain peers will automatically reject the blocks if any tampering occurred.
    The fault tolerance servers are imperative in providing continuous services and
    operations to maximize the value of smart industries. Since the data are shared,
    replicated, and synchronized across the participating devices, any failure in
    one or more devices in a smart network does not affect the performance of entire
    system. 4.3 Blockchain and IoT Technology Basically, the Internet of Things (IoT)-technology-supported
    network works as a centralized architecture for communication where the data is
    collected, processed, and analyzed in various forms from different millions of
    devices. Yet, this technology suffers with numerous issues like security and privacy
    of massive data, scalability of devices, and scarcities in resource management
    at IoT edge network. Fortunately, the blockchain technology with distributed nature
    offers countermeasures for all the above listed issues and secures the data from
    tampering embedded into real-time IoT applications [20]. Nevertheless, using blockchain
    technology in the smart city’s infrastructure requires huge amount of energy to
    generate blocks of live records and to verify its integrity with the use of energy-constrained
    IoT devices. The smart city infrastructure enhances these technologies to support
    and provide sustainable solutions for the new era. The BFCM plays a prominent
    role in the rapid moving environment of smart cities [21]. Blockchain technology
    could be incorporated in three ways: Public blockchain: It is also named as “Permissionless
    Blockchain”; a decentralized environment allows everyone to keep a replica of
    blocks and take part in validating new blocks. Private blockchain: It is referred
    as “Permissioned” or “Private” or “Closed” blockchain; the access to the blocks
    of records are restricted to some specific participants. It supports three types
    of permissions to setup a blockchain: Read—allows to access and see the transactions
    of ledger records Write—allows to access, modify, and see the transactions of
    ledger records Commit—allows the ledger records to update the state after modification
    Consortium blockchain: It is like private blockchain where the permission is required
    to access the blocks. The main role of consortium blockchain is to synchronize
    the distributed databases and to keep track of data exchanged between the participants
    in the network. It provides faster latency and more auditability for the chains
    of blocks in the networks. 4.4 Challenges in Blockchain-Based IoT On the other
    side, there are some challenges in the integration of blockchain with IoT technology.
    The IoT technology visualizes the smart city as collection of connected smart
    devices or sensors or things that interacts and shares data with each other using
    smart applications. IoT-based solutions are being incorporated in many of the
    smart city components such as smart industries, smart grid, smart transportation,
    smart healthcare, and smart environment to optimize the performance and digitizing
    of the communication [22]. The smart applications that generate huge data require
    uninterrupted connectivity and continuous power that lead to excessive number
    of challenges. Integrating the blockchain with IoT technology will enrich the
    infrastructure by providing trustable sharing services; reliable information can
    be traceable at any point. The challenges [6] in an integration of both technologies
    are summarized in Table 5.3 [23]. Table 5.3 Integration challenges of blockchain
    and IoT [6] Full size table 5 BFCM-Based Smart City Architecture The objective
    of BFCM-based model is to incorporate the IoT-based smart cities with blockchain
    and fog computing technologies to solve traffic-, energy-, and environment-related
    problems and to enhance and better the lifestyle of the citizens. The smart city
    network is composed of different components like smart healthcare, smart transportation,
    smart banking, and smart industries using different communication model of IoT
    technology [24]. The smart city use cases are broadly categories into three levels
    of services as depicted in the Fig. 5.4, which includes (1) localized services,
    (2) area-level services, and (3) city-level services, to understand how the BFCM
    model is acting as digital technology transformation in data transmission and
    its communication [25]. The lower-level localized services are populated with
    the highly reliable, low-cost IoT smart objects and sensors like RFIDs, IR sensors,
    GPS, and cameras deployed across the smart cities horizontals such as generation,
    distribution, transmission, and consumption. The security to the data generated
    by sensor devices is achieved through blockchain technology where the information
    is stored as blocks of records called ledger. The next level is the integration
    of computing services and blockchain technology to provide distributed area-level
    services for handling substantial amount of data communication and analysis through
    fog computing framework [26]. As shown in the figure, not all data are to be processed
    and handled at the network edge; some of the data as per the user’s requirements
    can be transferred directly called as “Direct Communication” to the cloud storage
    and analysis without fog computing in the edge of network. Fig. 5.4 BFCM-based
    smart city architecture [37] Full size image The blockchain provides guarantee
    to the data integrity and transactions between the local network and the cloud.
    Blockchain strengthens the security and privacy of the internal information by
    using SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) [27]. Smart cities are growing exponentially
    with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Every edge device should
    cover up the sensors to perform local traces and instant analysis. The outcomes
    of fog layer may either have transferred fully to the smart city’s IoT application
    processing at cloud or may be off-loaded in the network edges. The distributed
    environment at city-level services experienced massive raise of data storage and
    data processing. Cloud computing is a solution to handle huge amount of data storage
    and processing in on-demand and anytime and anywhere basis. It supports centralized
    monitoring and control of information with high performance and different behavioral
    analysis. The topmost level is the trusted event-driven applications that impeccably
    integrate the IoT technologies, spatiotemporal analytics, and complex-event processing
    for the different smart city’s components present to the end users. 5.1 Blockchain
    IoT Applications and Platforms Emerging technologies such as blockchain fog and
    cloud computing have been improvising the IoT applications particularly in security
    domain, e.g., data integrity and data reliability. This has resulted in an enlightenment
    of increasing electronic devices or smart devices deployment in many areas and
    stepping into the digital world. The smart devices can be able to sense, actuate,
    and communicate over the Internet without any human interventions [28]. The end
    users connected with the IoT applications, which are more specific in features
    and characteristics, generate large amount of data and expected high connectivity
    and electric power for long periods. The smart cities are the collection of different
    components such as smart healthcare, smart home, smart transportation, smart education,
    and smart grid [2]. Each component is embedded with IoT sensors that can communicate
    with each other using BFCM model. The presented figure is a multitier architecture
    that illustrates the detailed layout of smart city infrastructure with the technologies,
    Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, blockchain, telecommunication, and cloud
    services (Table 5.4). Table 5.4 Blockchain- and fog-based architecture network
    characteristics [3] Full size table 5.2 Challenges and Security Features for Device
    Management in BFCM A smart city is a network that consists of complicated and
    heterogeneous urban devices connected with the Internet that have the capacity
    to send and receive the data using Internet of Things (IoT) technology and can
    exponentially increase the security problems where the attackers can perform several
    cyberattacks [30, 31]. Some of the security measures for device administration
    security in a smart city are as follows. Confidentiality. A wide range of devices
    across the smart cities will sense, collect, store, and process data that could
    contain more sensitive information [29]. Confidentiality means providing security
    and privacy over those data and enabling only authenticated and authorized entities
    to access that information. One of the general methods to provide confidentiality
    is relying on cryptography technique. Since the BFCM model uses blockchain technology,
    that integrates the cryptography with private and public keys in the list of records
    to strengthen the sensitive information. Integrity. The data exchanged between
    the smart devices are reliable, accurate, consistent, and integrity to ensure
    the transferred data are delivered without any modification. The blockchain technology
    is designed to prevent the data modification using hash functions: the data does
    not get changed once it is added into the chain. Availability. Sensors act as
    a backbone of smart cities, and continuous collection of massive data from different
    geographic areas requires high availability to the authorized entities. The BFCM
    model is deployed as distributed decentralized infrastructure and provides data
    availability with no single point of failure. Accounting. Blockchain technology
    is a distributed P2P database system; the data is stored and managed as a record
    with timestamp called block. A block is a data structure that accounts all the
    records of transactions between the smart devices. So, the blockchain provides
    efficient accountability for data management. Latency. In BFCM, the data are gathered
    and processed at the edge of the network in geographic proximity. Due to that,
    it enhances the performance of the network by reducing the latency and provides
    higher bandwidth in transaction. Adaptability. The smart city operates on open
    interconnected heterogeneous smart devices and technologies that result in interoperability
    issues. But the BFCM enables decentralized architecture to manage cross-disciplinary
    IoT systems. 5.3 Privacy-Conserving Blockchain and Fog Computing It is to all
    appearances that the main challenge in IoT is to overcome the downsides associated
    with privacy, security, and vulnerability aspects. Moreover, the blockchain technology
    requires enormous amount of energy to process and verify each block of record
    that are difficult to handle with resource-constrained IoT devices and real-time
    data applications [32]. Due to the public ledger system, blockchain discloses
    the privacy of the stakeholder’s data though it is secure from data alteration.
    Fog computing technology reduces the complexity of data privacy at cloud computing
    by populating the real-time applications data at the network edges. However, due
    to handling of massive data, distributed environment, and shortage of enough resources
    made, this model endlessly suffers from abundant security and privacy issues [33].
    Remarkably, blockchain technique provides strong countermeasures to these security
    issues and protects data against any tampering even in distributed nature of IoT.
    It is very difficult to provide message delivery in end-to-end connectivity without
    the cooperation of network devices. But, some selfish devices in the network become
    reluctant in data transmission due to minimum resources utilization such as energy
    consumption [34]. The BFCM provides remote data integrity verification which allows
    the remote users to validate the reliability of the transmission data. The authors
    [31] proposed homomorphic encryption for data aggregation scheme in fog-assisted
    IoT devices. There are several articles that addressed the various techniques
    used to preserve the privacy of information through blockchain and fog computing.
    Some of them are listed below: Identity privacy—A user’s identity in IoT environment
    should be preserved and protected from impersonate attacks. The authors [30] present
    various pseudonym techniques to preserve identity privacy. Data privacy—There
    are algorithms run between the fog and cloud services to preserve the information
    transferred. But the reality is this algorithm consumes massive amount of resources
    at the network edge devices. At the local edge, same encryption method can be
    deployed without decryption to allow privacy preservative collection [31]. Usage
    privacy—Additional important concern in blockchain-based fog computing model is
    user’s resource usage privacy pattern. Let us consider that the smart energy meter
    in smart industry reads and stores a massive amount of data continuously that
    are user’s private data, energy consumption, user unavailability, and other online
    and offline appliances status at home, which are threat to user’s privacy [34].
    Location privacy—However, the fog clients and remote monitoring nodes are in different
    location; there are rare possibilities that the path route may be revealed to
    fog nodes. One method to hide the fog node’s location is to obscure the identity
    of fog client [35]. 6 Conclusions With the support of emerging technologies like
    Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, blockchain, and cloud computing, the
    world is moving toward the digital electronic era of communication. The smart
    city projects uplift the use of all these technologies in a common citizen’s day-to-day
    lifestyle to share information and data communication among the smart devices
    between cities. In smart cities, there are abundant Internet of Things (IoT)-related
    applications along with smart sensors, actuators, and controllers that provide
    energy-aware, scalable, and low-latency network to the society. We started with
    the impact of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in smart city’s infrastructure
    which generate huge amount of data that should be handled by fog computing nodes
    at the network edges to provide state-of-the-art security and privacy to meet
    the limitations. In addition, next, we discussed the role of blockchain technology
    as an emerging solution to the security issues in fog-enabled IoT environment.
    At the end, we addressed some of the challenges in integration of blockchain-based
    fog computing model (BFCM) in the IoT platform. To conclude, BFCM provides many
    advantages in smart city infrastructure and networks in terms of data computation
    and information storage with minimal energy consumption. References Albino, V.,

    Concepts The main aspect of technology is to enhance the human life experience.
    The larger collection of humans with all facilities is termed as cities. According
    to United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Dynamics
    data, in the year 2018, world’s population living in urban areas is 55.3% of total
    population & projected to increase to 60% till 2030. One among the three people
    will reside in urban areas, understanding this growth in urbanization to fulfill
    the 11th Sustainable Development Goal [1]. In INDIA according to Ministry of Housing
    & Affairs, 2001 to 2011 decade has shown an increase of 3.35% in urban population
    results in 31.6% of total population residing in urban areas [2], increased to
    34.03% in 2018 [3] we should be looking at finding out new ways for making these
    cities a better place to live by transforming them into Smart Cities. Smart City
    implementation includes Smart Healthcare system, Smart Energy Management, Smart
    waste management, Smart Building-Apartment, Smart Transport, Smart Retail management,
    Issuing Licenses etc. To work all of these systems properly the coordination among
    them & a centralized control over all of these required for local authorities,
    municipalities & in some cases data must be required to be accessed by state government
    too, So, for implementing Smart City, a Smart Governance system must be developed
    so that there should be a mix of collaborative, open and participatory Governance
    for proper communication between authorities & all stakeholders for better service
    to the citizens. Goal of Smart City is to provide support for transforming government
    centric administration to citizen centric administration avoiding the time-consuming
    bureaucratic process & corruption in the government work. IoT (Internet of Things)
    seems to be the promising technology to implement the Smart City, as with the
    help of it we can control the operations in the city with minimum or no intervention
    of the human being. B. Motivation First, In a developing country like INDIA with
    large population density in urban areas, effective implementation of Smart Governance
    is a challenge. Larger the scale of population more the number of devices will
    be required to collect the data & implement the action. These large number of
    devices like sensors generates huge data which is to be sent to cloud for storage
    & processing through local gateway & again signals are sent back to the end node
    for taking the action. Exchange of data from the edge devices to & from cloud
    raises three concerns, it generates heavy traffic in the network increasing the
    Latency, second is larger data also increases the cost for processing & storage
    of this large data & the third & most important concern is, not so useful information
    is also being sent to the cloud which is the waste of network capacity & storage.
    Transferring the load of computing & storage towards the distributed nodes to
    minimize the latency & other effects. This action of offloading the task of cloud
    near the nodes is called as \"Edge Computing\". In this paper we would like to
    use Edge Computing technology to serve better Governance to Smart City & discusses
    some of the applications of Smart City Governance. SECTION II. IOT ARCHITECTURE
    Actually, Smart City & e-Governance concludes in the Smart City Governance which
    ensures transparent, collaborative, accountable & participatory Governance for
    all stakeholders. The advanced technologies like innovation and smart governance
    are found to be essential prerequisites for developing smart, creative, innovative
    and sustainable cities [4]. IoT (Internet of Things) is emerged as the promising
    technology to implement the ICT (Information & Communication Technology) for implementing
    smart governance for smart city. IoT is a collection of elements used for Identification,
    Sensing, ccommunication, Computation, Services & then creating semantics of the
    collected data to initialize the action. IoT is the application oriented technology
    which means its architecture is flexible & can be modified as per the requirement,
    still a standard five level architecture is preferred in common [5]. Generalized
    IoT architecture has three layers Perception, Network and Application Layers,
    which can be simplified as Sensing, Network, Data Processing and Application Layers.
    A. Identification & Sensing Identification is the important task in IoT network
    to identify a particular node for a dedicated application among hundreds of sensor
    in the range. Identification methods like such as EPC (Electronic Product Code)
    and uCode (ubiquitous Code) are in place for identifying an object by its name
    and IPv4 & IPv6 provides the addresses. Object named \"S1\" may refer to sensor1
    and its address referrers to its location in communication network having a unique
    ID provided by network. Identification methods are not universal so we can identify
    the unique node, device or sensor by unique network addressing which provides
    the clear identity For each object working in the network. Once identified next
    task to gather the relevant data from the related sensors like Temperature, Humidity,
    Pressure, Velocity etc. These sensors may be embedded in the smart device, wearable
    device, Mobile devices which are connected to the network. B. Communication Network
    Sensed data from the devices are dependent on the network protocols for the communication.
    As IoT devices are of very small size & should operate on low power so the communication
    protocols used for communicating with the IoT devices are generally connected
    to near field communication devices. IEEE 802.15.4, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Z-Wave,
    LTE Advanced, RFID, UWB (Ultra-Wide Bandwidth). Useful communication protocol
    is chosen for the particular application depending upon the distance of device
    from central node i,e, range of communication, the data transfer rate required
    and energy utilized in transfer. For example, NFC protocol operates on 13.56MHz
    having a range up to 10cm & data transfer rate up to 424kbps. Whereas Wi-Fi operates
    on 2.4GHz & 5GHz technologies can connect up to 100m range having data transfer
    rate from 11 to 54Mbps. Evolution in mobile network communication advances from
    2G, 3G & currently LTE network which is theoretically has data transfer rate up
    to 100Mbps. C. Data Processing & Computation Collected data from the sensors must
    be processed to transform the information collected through sensors into knowledge.
    This operation we can categorize into two essential components i,e, Hardware &
    Software. Specifications of these will be dependent on the number of devices connected
    to node & the level of decision to be taken. Brain of the system is the processing
    units the family of processors starting from 8051 microcontrollers, microprocessors,
    FPGA’s are popular Hardware’s. For IoT applications many small size Hardware platforms
    are developed such as Arduino, Raspberry-pi, Intel Galileo, BeagleBone, Cubieboard,
    along with these operating systems installed on these hardware are also important
    TinyOS, LiteOS, RiotOS are some examples for instant reaction RTOS (Real Time
    Operating System) like Contiki RTOS are used. D. Cloud Platform For small scale
    IoT deployment a smaller number of nodes can be processed at the edge with less
    computing capabilities but for bigger applications with larger geographical area
    to be covered with hundreds & thousands of sensors sending huge data. This huge
    data called as \"BIG DATA\" will be sent to cloud platforms for storage & processing,
    real time processing is also possible due to cloud. Many commercial Cloud Platforms
    are available for serving to the IoT application. Cloud Computing gives power
    to IoT for management of Big Data. Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Bluemix,
    Google cloud platform are available commercially to serve IoT. SECTION III. IOTAASG
    (IOTAS A SERVICE TO GOVERNANCE) Globally people living in the urban areas are
    increasing drastically so that urban cities must be enabled with advanced ICT
    technologies to offer the better place for living & to enforce the system to implement
    the same, a smart governance infrastructure should be in place. IoT is the most
    promising technology to collect & process the data in real time for implementing
    real time Smart Governance in Smart City using Cloud Computing Services can be
    termed as IoTaaSG (IoT as a Service to Governance). IoTaaSG refers to infrastructure
    to facilitating the Smart City Governance using IoT. Smart City Governance has
    multiple vertical aspects to cover as Smart Health, Smart Transport, Smart Energy,
    Smart Grid, Smart Waste Management, Smart Water Management, Smart Resource Management,
    Smart Weather Monitoring etc. and to for proper & effective governance there should
    be horizontal communication among these technologies. All data should be communicated
    to the administration and to all permitted verticals. SECTION IV. CHALLENGES OF
    IOTAASG IoTaaSG system will work fine for limited number of sensors where response
    to the data is much faster, but according to applications system verticals can
    be classified in 3 categories as Time Constrained, Less Time Constrained & No
    Time Constrained Processing for example all critical patient monitoring data is
    highly time constrained so that the doctor can save patients life, any lag in
    communication may cause loss of life, same is the case with traffic monitoring
    & boarder security where latency in data may cause savior effects. Applications
    where data is not so time constrained such as, weather forecasting, resource management
    are less time constrained & some applications where there is no time depended
    processing is done. For IoT data communication there are 3 different communication
    models depending upon applications: M2M (Machine to Machine) communication: In
    this network two devices connected over same network can communicate with each
    other without any intermediary. For example, operating switch over short-range
    using Bluetooth. Machine to Gateway Communication: In this communication network
    data of multiple nodes communicated to intermediary Gateways for processing or
    storage, these gateways may take help of cloud for larger data processing. Machine
    to Cloud Communication: When data from device is communicated to the cloud through
    the protocols like HTTP, TCP, UDP & after processing it is sent to the nodes.
    This type of communication requires large amount of network usage As the size
    of IoTaaSG oriented architecture increases with increasing population & facilities
    provided to citizens the number of sensors deployed will increase resulting in
    increase in data generated. Big Data is generated in smart city & to process it
    Cloud Computing Platforms are capable, but as the velocity & volume of the data
    increases the latency which is not useful for real time applications. Cloud Computing
    (CC) is based on 3 services PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a
    Service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provided by different vendors like
    Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure. IoTaaSG may only require the PaaS to provide a platform
    to operate over a data collected. For cloud based communication 3 layer architecture
    is considered consisting of Sensors, Nodes in first layer, Gateways at second
    layer & Cloud Computing is the third one. Sensors and Nodes: In Smart city application,
    thousands of sensors need to be deployed in wider geographical area which will
    produce diverse data which will be useful for further processing. Most of the
    requirement of physical devices is in this layer only. After processing the data
    action need to be taken & executed to the end node where controlling mechanism
    is introduced. Each node is connected to other node or devices with the help of
    network to take the input & generate the response. Gateways: Gateway is the combination
    of Hardware & Software unit connecting the Sensors or nodes to the cloud. Task
    of the gateway is to establish the secured connection between them & do the pre-processing
    on the data before sending them to the cloud. IoT gateways will reduce the unnecessary
    overhead of the data traffic & also decreases the redundancy. Cloud Network: To
    provide the support to IoT application the cloud servers will store & process
    the received data. Different applications may have different storage & processing
    needs, according to that the resources will be allocated to them. Cloud platform
    are very dynamic & end user need not to worry about the memory allocation & processing.
    Earlier discussion was focused on fundamental units required for construction
    of IoT based smart city. In 3 layer architecture all information from Sensor/node
    is transmitted to Cloud through Gateways for storage & processing, it also applies
    the knowledge acquired from initial data to generate the action according to the
    data received in the real time. But, the time constrained applications as discussed
    earlier face the following issues with the cloud computing used for IoT Latency:
    Sending data to cloud from node & transmission of response back to node after
    processing will require a lot time which creates latency in the network. Bandwidth:
    As large number of sensors sending data continuously to the cloud & response is
    served through same medium which will generate huge data traffic & to serve this
    Network Bandwidth requirement will increase. Energy: IoT devices are power constrained
    & has very less or no processing capabilities, sending the information frequently
    to the larger distance will radiate large power & will keep system thirsty for
    power which is not desired. Cost: Hosting the cloud computing requires huge investment
    for data storage & processing capabilities Security & Privacy: Sending the data
    to the cloud involves multiple hops for data to reach the end point which is the
    bigger threat to Security of sensitive data and sending personal information also
    concerns about the privacy of the data in the network. Scalability: As the number
    of sensors in the network will increase, it will become impractical & uneconomical
    to send all the raw data to the cloud for storage & processing. So, cloud services
    are not useful for larger scale. These drawbacks of Cloud Computing using with
    IoT limits its possibilities to scale up IoT for IoTaaSG. Implementing IoTaaSG
    will require larger processing of the data at low cost & low power with limited
    bandwidth or multifunctional bandwidth & low or no latency for real time application
    data processing. SECTION V. IOT WITH EDGE COMPUTING Edge computing is the term
    related with pushing the cloud computing capabilities closer towards the edges
    in the network. Such type of computing technologies are very useful than cloud
    computing for smart city applications for having low and predictable latency,
    provides the location awareness and also supports the mobility of the,nodes. Edge
    computing is the distributed model of the heterogeneous nodes spread across the
    city communicating over the network for the storage and computing. Edge computing
    has three paradigms according to their architecture & area of application as,
    Cloudlet Mobile Edge Computing(MEC) Fog Computing Cloudlet & MEC are having flexibility
    of available resources, but Fog Computing relies only on hardware such as switches
    & routers designed by the Cisco for computational capabilities. Following are
    the characteristics of Edge Computing Support to Mobility: Edge computing supports
    to mobility using protocols such as LISP (Location ID Separator Protocol) to distinguish
    host & location identity. Geographical Distribution of Nodes: Number of nodes
    deployed will be increasing as per the population to be monitored in the Smart
    City increases resulting in dense distribution of nodes. As Edge Computing is
    closer to the physical location of the nodes, it is more important. Location Aware
    Nodes: Mobile nodes are allowed to access the nearest available Edge Server depending
    on the data gathered by GPS or Wireless Access Points. Such are used in disaster
    management in Smart City. Lesser Latency with Proximity: To improve the experience
    on the go to the public for Smart City, lesser or no latency is required this
    facility is provided by Edge Computing. For local device support extracting the
    device information requires the high proximity supported by edge computing. Node
    Heterogeneity: For larger applications like Smart City there is need of different
    devices working on different standards to communicate to the common platform.
    Edge Computing platforms are more advanced & can communicate with the diverse
    edge protocols. Before choosing the best technology to fit for the IoTaaSG, characteristics
    of all three need to be taken into consideration one by one. A. Fog Computing
    Cisco Systems earlier in 2011 introduced term Fog Computing & later founded the
    \"Open Fog Consortium\" in 2015 for promoting the research & development activities
    in Fog computing. It is the extended cloud with limited storage & processing capabilities
    distributed over networking devices such as routers, switches, gateways etc. Fog
    computing is the decentralized infrastructure for computing using fog computing
    nodes. Heterogeneity of the nodes is neutralized by using the uniform fog abstraction
    layer which will monitor the device for resource allocation, device management
    & security. B. MEC (Mobile Edge Computing) Mobile Edge Computing or Multi-Access
    Edge Computing is the communication and networking standard defined by ETSI (European
    Telecommunication Standard Institution) which is introducing the cloud services
    closer to the user at the mobile cellular networks. MEC technology is implemented
    at the cellular base station with the help of advanced networks like 4G/5G. MEC
    is known for bringing computational & storage capabilities closer to the edge
    &within the Radio Access Networks. These MEC device servers offers the real time
    information of the network including the load versus capacity of the network,
    it also offers the information about devices connected to the network server along
    with their information of networking & location. C. Cloudlet It is the mini data
    center provided near to the edge developed by Carnegie Mellon University in 2013
    for first time. Extension to these \"Micro Data Center\" is developed by Microsoft
    in 2015. This will serve as middleware between mobile devices & the cloud. It
    is the cluster of highly trusted computers communicating with each other over
    internet. SECTION VI. APPLICATION FOR SMART CITY Every administrative work has
    to be transformed through ICT (Information Communication Technology) implementation
    like IoT to transform it into Smart City. Following are the some applications
    which can implement IoTaaSG for effective & Smart Governance. A. Smart Energy
    Urban areas are the most crucial & Energy greedy areas which creates the huge
    demand of energy to provide the high quality of life to its citizen & to support
    the high manufacturing sector to fulfill the demands by industries. Energy management
    is one of the most demanding issues in urban areas. Modern cities energy requirements
    are complex and are not only limited to Smart Grids for effective electrical energy
    distribution but also includes HVAC Systems, Renewable energy sources, transportation
    etc. We have to monitor five energy related activities like Generation, Storage,
    infrastructure, facilities and transport which will helps the administrator to
    control the Demand & Supply chain avoiding losses. B. Smart Grid It is an intelligent
    electrical grid covering multiple operations like Switching with renewable energy
    sources, Smart Distribution Appliances, Smart Meter, Smart Electrical Conditioning
    etc. Conventional Electrical Grids are controlled in unidirectional as power transmission
    & electricity distribution and it is a demand driven control. In today’s world
    of ICT, real time continuous monitoring of end users for billing & dynamic pricing
    is important. Self-inspection for fault finding, Self-Healing should work without
    intervention of technician also the automatic load management, demand side management,
    network topology & load side management are the tasks to be performed through
    Smart Grid. C. Smart Environment IoTaaSG has most real time application as to
    maintain the neat & clean environments to all inhabitants in the city. The real
    time governance of air quality to control the air pollution in the city beyond
    acceptable limits & give alerts for the same. D. Smart Transportation Smart City
    needs the faster connectivity among the to control the traffic or to route the
    traffic in the desired manner to avoid the conjunction is important use case in
    IoTaaSG. Smart Car, Smart Street Lights, Smart Traffic Signs, CCTV, Smart Navigation
    are the some applications for Smart Transportation applications. E. Smart Water
    Supply Monitoring To ensure the proper Public Health monitoring the quality of
    the water is to be maintained properly. Conventional way requires a much more
    human resources engaged & human errors may arise. Water collection from source
    to tank & then tank to the tap of the home requires quality check at every point
    which will ensure the safety is possible by IoT systems. F. Smart Waste Management
    Collection of waste in the city for its proper disposal can be monitored using
    IoT, improper collection of waste may lead to bad public health in the city. IoT
    systems will ensure the categorized collection and their proper distribution among
    the different dumping grounds. G. Smart Public Health Medical record keeping is
    essential to maintain the health of the city & track their hospitalization to
    cure the pandemics like COVID-19 in proper manner. IoT system can monitor personal
    health and get the real time data about any infections directly. Governance of
    hospitals by monitoring the availability of doctors & beds for patients can be
    done. SECTION VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In this paper we discussed about
    the application of IoT for governance and the model is treated as IoTaaSG. Cloud
    computing is the viable solution for the larger memory & faster processing power
    but it fails in real time applications of IoTaaSG as for real time applications
    many parameters like latency, power, bandwidth and raw data handling etc. should
    be taken into consideration. Edge processing is the best solution for real time
    distributed computing before sending all the data to cloud in which amongst Fog
    computing, Mobile edge computing & Cloudlet one is to be chosen according to the
    hierarchy at which it is implemented & how much computing power and memory for
    storage is required. Some of the major applications of IoTaaSG for the Smart City
    are demonstrated. Authors References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Traditional agriculture is transforming into smart agriculture due to the prominence
    of the IoT, edge communication, and the use of UAVs for performing various farming
    operations. Low-cost and low-power, yet precision are the primary objectives for
    any IoT network to be effective to the farmers. There is always a necessity to
    protect and monitor the crops in the farms. These monitoring and transmission
    of data should be real-time. Also, to provide an instant solution to the crops,
    the data should be collected smartly and not through traditional/manual techniques.
    This can be achieved through a wireless sensor network (WSN). Sensor devices deployed
    in outdoor farming areas monitor several process inputs like soil status (salinity,
    pH), growth status, irrigation water, pest and fertilizers, weed management, and
    greenhouse production environment [2, 4]. The green technology approach of smart
    agriculture reduces the ecological footprint of traditional agriculture. These
    can be achieved with optimal deployment and communication between sensors, and
    real-time and low-power computing and decision-making capabilities of UAVs. A
    network of sensors and UAVs collect data/images from the soil and crop, pre-processes
    the data at the UAV, transmits the processed data to a central device. The central
    device, based on the received data, decides the necessary measures to be undertaken.
    Recently, UAVs (drones) are being widely used for remote sensing for smart agriculture.
    They provide finer control and flexibility and, in addition, reduce the role of
    satellites in monitoring and capturing agricultural images. These UAVs can perform
    several tasks like remote sensing of fields, spraying chemicals to crops, creating
    several vegetation indexes, and in addition, collects data from various sensor
    devices. Although the IEEE 802.15.4 [1] standard is well suited for smart agriculture
    to support low-power, low-cost, energy-efficient communication, and have been
    extensively studied for its performance on-the-ground; few challenges in communication
    to highly mobile UAVs still exist. The IEEE 802.15.4 defines a DSME MAC mode that
    guarantees low and deterministic delay, improved reliability as well as scalability
    by utilizing the multi-channel access and contention access period (CAP) reduction
    mechanism. Communication in DSME mode is based on a multi-superframe structure
    that defines the time structure of channel access. Processing of captured images
    on UAVs itself emerges as a potential solution in the limited hardware resources
    and power budget for the computer vision tasks. In smart agriculture, deep learning
    techniques [12], especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [15] successfully
    detects and classify the abnormalities of the corps. In most of the smart agriculture
    system, images captured by UAV have to be sent to the base station (or centralized
    cloud) for further detection and classification. Transferring images maximize
    the computational and communication cost of the monitoring system. Hence, integration
    of low-power and compact on-board image processing unit build the UAVs more autonomous
    and cost-efficient. Fig. 1 DSME multi-superframe structure Full size image Fig.
    2 DSME CAP-reduction Full size image 1.1 Overview of DSME MAC and Multi-superframe
    The DSME MAC defines a multi-superframe structure, which is a collection of the
    IEEE 802.15.4 superframes. A DSME multi-superframe structure is shown in Fig.
    1. A superframe duration (SD) is divided into a total of 16 equal timeslots. The
    active period called the SD, consists of a CAP and a contention-free period (CFP).
    The CFP is implemented in a multi-channel, whereas the CAP transmissions take
    place in a single defined channel. In the CFP, guaranteed timeslots (GTS) are
    implemented to allow the device to operate on the channel within a portion of
    the superframe that is dedicated exclusively to that device. The DSME superframes
    can allocate higher number of GTS with its multi-channel communication feature.
    Here, a device can further increase its available GTS allocations by reducing
    the size of the CAP (i.e., all the CAP are disabled, except the first superframe
    CAP). This technique is known as CAP reduction (shown in Fig. 2). 1.2 Motivation
    The IEEE 802.15.4-2011 has been designed to support low power, low data rate applications
    with relaxed throughput requirements. Alternatively, to meet specific QoS criteria,
    the IEEE 802.15.4 has been ratified with a focus on throughput and latency. DSME
    MAC mode has been defined that guarantee latency and enables robust communication
    through multi-channel approach. However, multi-channel GTS transmissions are limited
    to the CFP period only, thus reducing the capabilities for time-critical and real-time
    applications. The standard provides a CAP reduction mechanism to address the problem
    (as shown in Fig), but this results in higher energy consumption. Also, the standard
    does not specify mechanisms to revoke the CAP reduction or when CAP reduction
    is to be implemented. Therefore, a light-weight mechanism is necessary that adapts
    the conventional multi-superframe structure to CAP reduction and back forth to
    the CAP as per the QoS requirements. Specifically, in smart agriculture, when
    the UAVs hover near the sensor devices (deployed near the crops), the data needs
    to be immediately transmitted. Further, the UAVs capture images of the crops and
    transmit both the data (collected from the sensors) and images to the PAN coordinator
    (base station), which is also the edge/fog device in the considered topology.
    The UAVs or the fog/edge device need to process these images/data to carry out
    agricultural land’s tasks like spraying pesticides or harvesting. Therefore, there
    is a need to design a fast and low-power computing architecture for processing
    the data and images at the edge devices. 1.3 Related Research Works like [2,3,4,
    8] proposes smart agricultural application based on IEEE 802.15.4. Authors in
    [2] proposed a low-power consuming IoT network for smart farming that monitors
    soil moisture content. Bacco et al. [4, 8] conducts a series of work on smart
    farming using UAVs. The authors develop a real testbed that implements the IEEE
    802.15.4 PHY/MAC for communication between the UAV and sensor devices deployed
    in the field. They also discuss several aspects in the designing and deploying
    of sensors in smart agriculture. In [5], the authors provide an insight to evaluate
    the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 for data collection from UAVs. To examine several
    factors affecting throughput and RSSI, an outdoor aerial real-testbed is setup.
    Similarly, the authors in [6] examines ground-aerial communication by the use
    of physical testbed with highly mobile UAVs. Works like [7, 9] have studied several
    applications of smart agriculture that has used cloud computing as a backbone
    infrastructure. The authors in [7] presents several functions of UAV technology
    in smart farming by analyzing the implementation of UAVs in different use cases.
    The authors also analyze the use of UAV technologies in complex agricultural scenarios.
    All these works fail to address the inherent problem of the IEEE 802.15.4 devices,
    i.e., its constraints in terms of power. In order to achieve low-latency transmission,
    higher energy is consumed [11]. Also, data communication between the sensor devices
    and UAVs needs to take place in real-time without delay. Therefore, there is a
    need to analyze and propose a mechanism to support both low-latency as well as
    low-power. 1.4 Contribution and Organization In this paper, we propose a mechanism
    to adapt and tune the CAP reduction technique in the DSME multi-superframe. The
    proposed mechanism automatically disables the CAP units (except the first) for
    the transmission of sensed data to the UAV. This is done when the buffer occupancy
    in the sensor devices is high, and the resulting transmissions (in the CAP) may
    lead to a delay in transmission to the UAVs. In addition, we propose a fast and
    low-power computing architecture that processes the collected data and sensed
    images at the edge devices (UAVs). The main contributions of the paper are summarized
    as follows: A dynamic and adaptive CAP reduction mechanism is proposed. A fast
    and power-efficient computing unit is for the edge/fog devices is designed. The
    rest of this paper has been organized in the following way. Section 2 and Sect.
    3 presents the proposed CAP reduction mechanism and the computing architecture,
    respectively. Experimental results and discussions are presented in Sect. 4. Finally,
    the conclusions of the work are discussed in Sect. 5. 2 Proposed CAP Reduction
    Scheme We propose a CAP reduction mechanism that allows any DSME-based device
    to implement CAP reduction when the device buffer occupancy exceeds a pre-defined
    threshold of 80%, and it receives enhanced beacons from the mobile UAVs. Both
    these conditions need to be met prior to proceeding with the CAP reduction technique.
    The buffer occupancy/queue length can be computed through the pending data at
    a coordinator device, ready to be transmitted to the next hop (or UAV). A predefined
    threshold for buffer occupancy is considered because the coordinator may have
    to drop packets from its associated sensor devices if the buffer exceeds beyond
    its capacity. DSME MAC allows devices the use of DSME-GTS for transmitting data
    to the UAVs. But, during the short presence of UAVs, transmissions at the CAP
    can be unreliable (in terms of delay), and if the buffer is full, the available
    DSME-GTS may not be sufficient to transmit all the sensed data to the UAV. Hence,
    the need for extra GTSs arises to increase network throughput. After successful
    transmissions to the UAVs, the DSME multi-superframe needs to be restored to avoid
    excess energy consumption. It may be noted that, with no CAP (which is a single
    channel), transmissions through DSME-GTS (multi-channel) ensures reliability,
    but consumes higher energy due to the overhead incurred through multi-channel
    maintenance by the device [11]. Also, a severe reduction of the CAP reduces the
    responsiveness of the network to varying traffic demands. The proposed scheme
    is presented in Algorithm 1. The algorithm can be invoked at each BI or preferably
    after \\(\\alpha \\)BIs. 3 Proposed Computing Architecture Deep Learning (DL)
    techniques have drawn a lot of attention in agriculture for image monitoring and
    recognition. DL has been used in many aspects of agriculture, including plant
    disease detection, weed control, and plant counting [12]. To carry out this assessment,
    images captured by UAV have to be sent to the base station (or centralized cloud)
    for further detection and classification. Transferring images maximize the computational
    and communication cost of the monitoring system. On-board processing of captured
    images alleviates this problem by sending only those pictures that have any abnormalities.
    In a real-time system, accurate and efficient on-board processing of DL algorithms
    greatly affect the autonomous condition assessment. Several challenges, such as
    limited hardware resources, power constraints, architectural modularity, and compactness,
    are observed in the joint use of UAVs and learning techniques for precision agriculture.
    In this work, we have proposed a fast, low power computing technology to classify
    the image captured by agricultural UAVs. This approach uses a portable, low-powered
    Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS) interfaced with the Raspberry Pi. NCS
    is a co-processor that performs \\(\\sim \\)40 times faster along with the embedded
    processor like Raspberry Pi. The NCS is powered by the Myriad2 Vision Processing
    Unit (VPU) and supports C++ or Python API. Instead of training a neural network,
    NCS accelerate the execution of a pre-trained neural network model to classify
    the images. A pre-trained, MoblieNet-SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detection) model
    is deployed in the NCS because of this streamlined architecture and low compute
    power. MobileNet is an efficient convolution Neural Network (CNN) framework that
    adopts depth-wise separable convolution and suitable for low-power mobile embedded
    devices [13]. A MobileNet-SSD is more suitable than the widely used tiny YOLO
    [14] model as it occupies approximately 9.8\\(\\times \\) smaller disk size while
    installed on an NCS device. Further, the detection speed of MobileNet-SSD is found
    to be approximately 3\\(\\times \\) faster than YOLO while trained on a COCO dataset.
    The Block diagram of the proposed NCS, along with the Raspberry Pi setup on UAV
    for image monitoring, is shown in Fig. 3. The edge devices Raspberry Pi, NCS,
    and camera installed on the UAV are connected through USB ports. In this approach,
    high latency and bandwidth (communication) consuming Internet connection is utilized
    only to transfer the images to the base station which have abnormalities. Fig.
    3 Block diagram of on-board processing system Full size image 4 Preliminary Results
    and Discussion The Network Simulator OMNeT++ is used to perform simulations to
    evaluate the performance of the proposed CAP reduction mechanism. OpenDSME is
    used to implement the IEEE 802.15.4 DSME MAC mode. We considered a p2p network
    consisting of 61 devices covering a radius of \\({1000}\\, \\mathrm{m} \\times
    {1000}\\, \\mathrm{m}\\). The proposed CAP reduction mechanism is evaluated in
    terms of throughput, latency, energy consumption, and channel utilization. Figure
    4 shows the increase in throughput capacity of the network when CAP reduction
    is applied. The network restores to its original throughput capacity once data
    have been transmitted to the UAV for processing. The gain in throughput is due
    to the increase in availability of DSME-GTS across several channels. Besides,
    GTS transmission ensures collision-free transmission as only a single device is
    permitted to transmit at a particular timeslot. In Fig. 5, during the same time
    instant (increase in throughput due to CAP reduction mechanism), the latency during
    transmission decreases. This is due to the use of DSME-GTS for transmissions instead
    of CSMA/CA in the CAP. Transmission of frames during CSMA/CA is observed to be
    higher compared to DSME-GTS in cluster-tree networks [11]. As a result of CAP
    reduction, although we observed increase in throughput and decrease in latency,
    it comes at a cost of increased energy consumption as shown in Fig. 6. This is
    because DSME-GTS allocation mechanism procedure consumes higher energy compared
    to CSMA/CA procedure [11]. Also, multi-channel transmission results in higher
    overhead arising from channel switching. An overhead in terms of control frames
    arising from GTS allocation request and response is also incurred by the network.
    This results in higher energy consumption during the CAP period. Hence, a trade-off
    between QoS parameters (throughput, latency) and energy consumption is necessary.
    Finally, we analyze the proposed scheme in terms of channel utilization. As DSME
    is a multi-channel approach, its true benefit can only be utilized during the
    CFP (using GTS), as transmissions in CAP takes place through CSMA/CA using a single
    channel. We observe an improvement in channel utilization during the time period
    of CAP reduction. In addition, CSMA/CA mechanism involves channel sensing at the
    beginning, followed by transmission of frames, only if the channel has been sensed
    as free. But, successful transmission is still not guaranteed due to collisions
    arising from hidden nodes. DSME-GTS addresses such issues as devices acquire exclusive
    usage of a portion of the channel for its transmission. Fig. 4 Throughput comparison

    5 Conclusion and Future Work This paper addresses the problem of CAP reduction
    in a DSME-based smart agriculture. A dynamic and adaptive mechanism to adapt the
    CAP reduction technique is proposed. The proposed scheme improves the low and
    deterministic latency-based packet transmission, incurring low overhead in terms
    of transmission, computation, and power consumption. Further, to process the sensed
    data at the UAV or edge devices, a low-power and fast computing technology to
    classify the image captured by agricultural UAVs. As a part of the future work,
    we plan to devise data offloading schemes for the edge devices or UAVs. Further,
    the speed of the on-board processing of images can be increased by incorporating
    accelerator architecture for CNN models in the future. References Wireless Medium

    sustainability 1. Introduction The lack of water and water-stressed areas are
    becoming serious problems to many places around the world. According to the United
    Nations (UN), by 2025, water scarcity will affect 1.8 billion people and two thirds
    of the population will live under water-stressed conditions [1]. In addition,
    water demand is expected to grow 50% by 2050 due to the increase in the number
    of people living in urban areas. As a consequence, drought is expected to have
    a widespread short and long-term impact on the everyday life of many people. Together
    with that, climate change is increasing flood risks and extreme precipitation
    events [2]. To tackle the previous issues, the UN recommends taking actions on
    three aspects [1]: the development of drought monitoring systems, the assessment
    of the potential risks and vulnerabilities, and the design of drought risk mitigation
    strategies. The present article deals with the latter by designing, implementing,
    and validating empirically a smart irrigation system that can be deployed in urban
    and suburban scenarios. Specifically, the irrigation system proposed in this article
    has been deployed on a university campus and makes use of Internet of Things (IoT)
    nodes able to collect environmental data (e.g., soil temperature/moisture and
    air temperature) and that can be activated remotely, either through manual commands
    or through intelligent automated actions. In addition, the proposed system overcomes
    the main communications challenges that arise in urban scenarios (e.g., the need
    for long-range communications, long battery life, or high network node capacity)
    by using Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) transceivers based on LoRa and LoRaWAN,
    a standard that has recently attracted a lot of attention from industry and academia
    [3,4,5]. This article also deals with another emerging technology that has gained
    momentum: fog computing [6]. Fog computing is a type of edge computing [7,8,9]
    that allows for extending certain cloud computing features to the edge of the
    network through the use of low-power computational devices like Single-Board Computers
    (SBCs). Thus, low-cost fog computing devices have proven to be able to provide
    responses to IoT nodes significantly faster than a cloud [10], besides bringing
    location awareness to such responses (i.e., the responses provided by a fog device
    to the monitored IoT nodes can be adapted and refined depending on their physical
    location). The optimization of the deployment of fog computing gateways and IoT
    nodes requires carrying out radio planning tasks. Such tasks are essential for
    scenarios like the one modeled for this paper (i.e., an university campus), which
    are specially challenging in terms of radio propagation due to their large dimensions
    and the numerous obstacles that impact electromagnetic waves. For that purpose,
    empirical models are usually employed, which give rapid results but, with high
    errors, since they are very site-specific. In order to obtain accurate estimations,
    in this work, an in-house developed 3D-Ray Launching (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm
    has been used to characterize the LoRa/LoRaWAN radio channel at 868 MHz and 433
    MHz. As it will be later described in Section 4, the algorithm provides a good
    trade-off between accuracy and computational time. In addition, in order to complete
    the radio planning study of the scenario under analysis, and validate the obtained
    simulation results, empirical RF measurements were obtained for both 868 MHz and
    433 MHz frequency bands. Specifically, the following are the main contributions
    of this article: A comprehensive state-of-the-art section is provided on the most
    relevant academic smart irrigation systems and on the use of LoRa/LoRaWAN for
    underground scenarios. An architecture is proposed for building novel smart irrigation
    systems based on the deployment of LoRa/LoRaWAN transceivers and fog computing
    nodes. The implementation of the proposed system and its hardware is described
    in detail so as to allow future developers to replicate it easily. The radio planning
    analysis of the scenario (i.e., a university campus) is presented together with
    an empirical measurement campaign to corroborate the analytical results. The rest
    of this article is structured as follows. First, Section 2 analyzes the most relevant
    previous works on smart irrigation systems and on the use of LoRa and LoRaWAN
    in underground scenarios. Section 3 describes thoroughly the proposed communications
    architecture, the deployment scenario, and the implementation of the different
    components of the smart irrigation system. Section 4 provides details on the performed
    radio analysis: its characteristics, the configuration of the used 3D-RL tool,
    and the obtained simulation results. Finally, Section 5 is dedicated to the description
    and analysis of the results obtained during an empirical measurement campaign,
    while Section 6 is devoted to conclusions. 2. State of the Art 2.1. IoT Smart
    Irrigation Systems IoT has gained in the last few years a lot of interest as a
    key enabler technology in smart agriculture [11]. With respect to smart irrigation
    systems, there are a number of recent academic works focused on decision planning
    and operation support. For instance, Khan et al. [12] describe a Decision Support
    System (DSS) that uses Xbee devices to cover a relatively small area. Another
    interesting work was presented by Togneri et al. [13], who designed a flexible
    IoT platform that enables developing Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions for
    smart irrigation. Its core components are a set of software, hardware, and communication
    technologies (e.g., LoRaWAN) that include soil moisture sensor probes, the use
    of an open-source platform (FIWARE), a SPARQL event processing architecture, as
    well as specific services for irrigation planning and operation. Unfortunately,
    the mentioned article does not provide further details on the communications architecture.
    Recently, Boursianis et al. [14] proposed a sophisticated smart irrigation system
    that exploits the capabilities of 5G networks and energy harvesting. A different
    approach is proposed by Munir et al. [15], which uses an intelligent method based
    on a fuzzy logic to schedule irrigation based on different parameters. Since the
    design of smart irrigation systems involves several considerations, Table 1 shows
    an overview of the main aspects to be taken into account. A complete and detailed
    overview of the current state-of-the-art regarding the IoT irrigation system for
    precision agriculture is presented in [16]. The authors review in detail common
    sensors and actuators to develop the IoT irrigation systems, most common parameters
    to be monitored, the type of irrigation, the type of node, the type of wireless
    communication technology, among others. Table 1. Overview of the main aspects
    of smart irrigation systems. 2.2. Communication Technologies for Smart Irrigation
    Systems Among the most popular LPWAN communications technologies (e.g., Sigfox,
    LoRa/LoRaWAN, WavIoT, Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA), Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)
    or LTE-M), LoRa and LoRaWAN were selected due to their expected communications
    range and performance in scenarios where significant signal attenuation occurs,
    like is the case for underground communications. In fact, some authors already
    performed thorough comparisons among LPWAN technologies and showed that RPMA and
    LTE-M incur additional path losses in comparison to Sigfox or LoRAWAN technologies
    [17]. In the case of LoRa or LoRaWAN, they use a proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum
    (CSS) modulation in the PHY layer, but their MAC layer is an open specification.
    On the contrary, Sigfox makes use of an open chipset, but its network is closed
    (i.e., it is necessary to pay a periodic fee). Nonetheless, it must be noted that
    there is no fully open LPWAN protocol stack (for PHY and MAC layers). To provide
    coverage for large areas, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been suggested for developing
    smart irrigation systems. For example, Gloria et al. [18] describe a Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) controlled by a single gateway (a broker) that is in constant
    communication with an online server that uses LoRa peer-to-peer connections. Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) via a WiFi connection is used for exchanging
    messages between the server and the nodes. Another solution was presented by Usmonov
    et al. [19], who detailed a LoRaWAN-based cost-effective wireless control system
    for drip irrigation. Such a solution uses a master station to relay packets between
    the control application and the deployed end-device nodes. It is also worth mentioning
    the work described in [20], which details the design and implementation of a LoRaWAN
    smart irrigation system in a typical urban environment. In such a work, the authors
    indicate that the communications distance between the irrigation node and the
    gateway can reach up to 8 km (covering an area of up to 2 km2) and provide energy-consumption
    results that consider different operating modes of the end nodes. Note that larger
    areas could be easily covered with LoRa. Finally, it is relevant to mention the
    work of other authors like Citoni et al. [21], who studied the deployment limitations
    of large-scale LoRaWAN IoT applications. Specifically, such a work analyzed the
    impact of packet collision on the scalability of a LoRaWAN deployment. 2.3. LoRa
    and LoRaWAN in Underground Scenarios In this article, underground scenarios are
    defined as the ones that make use of wireless communications transceivers to send
    and to receive data from under the soil. Such transceivers have to be able to
    avoid the communications issues that arise when operating underground in a number
    of industrial applications, like maintenance [22], mining [23,24], agriculture
    [25,26], or structural engineering [27]. In underground scenarios, the radio signal
    absorption loss caused by the soil severely affects the performance of traditional
    wireless communications technologies. In particular, factors that affect signal
    propagation in underground scenarios are the soil type and density, the soil moisture,
    the existence of certain elements (e.g., plant roots, rocks or underground pipelines),
    and the burial depth [28]. Although authors like Akyildiz et al. [29] suggest
    some interesting preliminary results, the existing research on in-soil underground
    communications is still not mature. For instance, one of the first empirical studies
    on the topic was presented in 2010 by Silva et al. [30]. In such a work, the authors
    tested ZigBee MICA2 and MICAz motes in an agriculture field. Their results showed
    a high asymmetry between underground and above ground communications, being highly
    dependent on burial depth and soil moisture (e.g., a 21% increase in water content
    decreased the signal coverage by more than 70%). Besides ZigBee, other authors
    have tested in similar scenarios some of the most popular traceability technologies
    like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) [31,32] for developing underground
    applications [33,34]. LoRa and LoRaWAN make use of a chirp spread modulation that
    offers several advantages for underground communications [35]: better coverage
    than technologies like WiFi or ZigBee, a sensitivity on the order of –130 dBm,
    low energy consumption, and low cost. There are a number of recent papers that
    study the performance of LoRa/LoRaWAN in underground scenarios. For instance,
    Wan et al. [36] designed and evaluated a LoRa propagation test node. They concluded
    that, if rainfall and irrigation happen frequently, their associated channel losses
    need to be compensated with increased transmission power or with the use of high-gain
    antennas, the latter being the recommended approach. Moreover, the authors provide
    additional recommendations: with respect to the burial depth of the node, it should
    be as close as possible to the surface and, regarding the Packet Success Rate
    (PSR) of underground communications, a shorter LoRa payload is required for a
    higher PSR. LoRa in-soil propagation was also studied by Xue-fen et al. [37],
    who proposed a smartphone-based LoRa underground measurement system. Thus, the
    authors described thoroughly two scenarios (a farmland and a garden) that considered
    the type of soil (e.g., homogeneous loam) and plants (e.g., mainly rice), the
    root depth of grass and camphor trees, and the characteristics of underground
    iron pipelines that are used for municipal drainage and communications. They also
    considered two different paths: underground-underground (UU) and underground-above
    ground-underground (UAU). In their experiments, the attenuation of the radio signals
    in the UU path, which is related to the soil characteristics and to other underground
    obstructions, was higher than for the UAU path. Thus, the actual attenuation in
    the analyzed environment needed to be obtained through measurements, due to the
    randomness of the soil and the obstructions. Xue-fen et al. also note the negative
    impact of soil moisture on LoRa in-soil propagation considering the precipitation
    rate, the randomness of rainfalls, and the amount of irrigation water in the area
    for the last 12 h. Since the water content in deep soil is usually higher than
    the one of the surface, the packet success rate decreases with deeper burial depth.
    A similar approach was taken in [38], where, after developing an in-soil propagation
    test node, the authors performed measurements and analyses of the results in a
    riverside park. In the case of Lin et al. [39], they focused their research on
    an experimental analysis on the influence of various physical layer parameters
    (e.g., spreading factor, coding rate, bandwidth) on LoRa’s propagation performance.
    2.4. Key Findings After reviewing the state-of-the art, it can be concluded that
    there are a number of recent articles that make use of LoRa/LoRAWAN as preferred
    wireless technology for IoT smart irrigation systems. In contrast to the proposed
    system, previous research is mainly focused on DSS capabilities introducing statistical
    or ML/AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques for decision-making, or on the proper
    irrigation system design, focused on optimizing hardware capabilities. Thus, there
    is barely any system that proposes the use of fog or edge computing. In addition,
    in relation to radio signal absorption loss in underground scenarios, most authors
    recommend performing in-soil wireless propagation measurements before the design,
    installation, and maintenance of any smart irrigation system, but the use of scenario
    simulators together with practical deployments has been barely documented. Table
    2 compares the main features of the most relevant smart irrigation systems. As
    it can be observed, in contrast to the compared systems, this article presents
    an IoT LPWAN smart irrigation system with a fog computing-based architecture whose
    node and gateway locations can be optimized for urban areas thanks to the help
    of an in-house developed 3D-ray launching radio planning simulator. Table 2. Comparison
    of some of the features of the most relevant smart irrigation systems and the
    proposed solution. The system proposed in this article is based on the use of
    LoRa or LoRaWAN due to their ability to provide medium and long-range coverage
    in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, thus fitting into the traditional areas
    where smart irrigation is required. Specifically, previous literature evaluated
    LoRa range, obtaining up to 30 km for boat communications and 15 km for car communications
    [40], up to 8 km (but losing many packets) and up to 4 km (losing a few packets)
    within urban environments [41], up to 500 m for very dense-vegetation environments
    [42] and a radius coverage of 1.8 km for a soil monitoring system in agriculture
    by means of LoRa devices with worse performance in terms of sensitivity than the
    ones used in this article [43]. Besides range, LoRa and LoRaWAN have other features
    that are attractive for smart irrigation deployments: their energy consumption
    is relative low (RX current is usually around 10 mA, while deep-sleep current
    is under 200 nA), its robustness against interference has been proven [44,45],
    transceiver cost is also low (less than US$ 8, as of writing) and there is no
    need to pay monthly fees to a mobile carrier. Nonetheless, developers must note
    that LoRa and LoRaWAN have not been devised to transfer large data payloads fast
    (the theoretical maximum data rate is usually 50 Kbps for LoRa and 27 Kbps for
    LoRaWAN) and they make use of Industrial-Scientific-Medical (ISM) bands, so interference
    may arise from other devices that operate in the same radio frequency. 3. Design
    and Implementation of the System 3.1. Smart Irrigation Scenario Before describing
    the design and implementation of the proposed smart irrigation system, it is first
    necessary to detail the characteristics of the scenario where it is deployed in
    order to understand the choices made. Such a scenario is located in the Campus
    of Elviña, at the University of A Coruña (Spain), in an area that covers 7500
    m2 (with 50 m of width and 150 m of length). The specific area is shown in Figure
    1 together with the locations of the deployed smart irrigation nodes (red circles,
    numbered 1 through 8) and communication gateways (purple circles, numbered 9 to
    11). Figure 1. Analyzed scenario with deployed nodes (red circles) and gateway
    locations (purple circles) (Map source: ©2020 Google). The area where the smart
    irrigation system was deployed includes elements typically found in urban and
    suburban environments: besides the gardens to be irrigated (composed by lawn and
    diverse types of trees), there are several buildings, roads, and cars. As an example,
    the pictures in Figure 2 show the areas where smart irrigation nodes 1, 3, and
    4 were located, and where the mentioned elements of the scenario can be observed.
    It is important to note that the size of the scenario and the specific area were
    selected for convenience reasons, as they are close to the lab of the researchers,
    and they are representative of the entire campus. In such a scenario, gateways
    and nodes were deployed in an area that is large enough to validate the proposed
    communications architecture and the smart irrigation system, but larger areas
    could be easily covered by adding more LoRaWAN nodes and, if needed, additional
    gateways. Moreover, the scalability provided by LoRa for the communication between
    nodes and the gateway can be easily replicated by the used 3D-RL simulator, which,
    once the scenario to be simulated is created, only requires specifying the desired
    number of nodes and their location in order to obtain simulation results. Nonetheless,
    it must be emphasized that the higher the number of nodes, the higher the computational
    cost/time that will be required for the simulations. Figure 2. Areas where smart
    irrigation nodes 3 and 4 (left) and 1 (right) were located. 3.2. Designed Communications
    Architecture Figure 3 shows the communications architecture of the proposed system.
    In such a figure, the different components are connected through arrows that indicate
    the way communications are performed (e.g., the two-way arrow that connects Remote
    Services with Third-Party Services indicate that the former make requests to the
    latter to ask for certain information and the latter respond with the requested
    data). Specifically, the proposed architecture is composed of three layers: Figure
    3. Designed communications architecture of the proposed system. IoT Node Layer.
    This layer consists of smart irrigation IoT nodes that exchange information with
    local gateways. The double arrows that communicate the IoT Node Layer with the
    Fog Computing Layer in Figure 3 represent bidirectional communications, which
    indicate that remote commands can be sent to the IoT nodes, while such nodes can
    send information about the successful execution of the commands (e.g., in order
    to determine whether the system works properly) or on the state of their sensors.
    Fog Computing Layer. This layer is composed by local gateways distributed over
    different locations to extend network connectivity across large areas. Such gateways
    provide redundancy, low-latency responses and distributed processing, thus off-loading
    tasks from the remote cloud. Remote Service Layer. This layer is located in the
    cloud and collects data from the deployed components of the smart irrigation system.
    The collected data can be processed and stored on the cloud database in order
    to be later shown to remote users through a user-friendly interface. Moreover,
    the services on the cloud can exchange information with useful third-party services
    (e.g., an external weather forecast service). 3.3. LoRa and LoRaWAN The LoRa physical
    layer operates in the ISM bands (e.g., 868 MHz, 433 MHz, and 915 MHz). In Europe,
    only the 868 MHz and 433 MHz bands can be used. Transmitted power is limited to
    14 dBm Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) with a 1% duty cycle limit of
    on-air time. LoRa integrates a Forward Error Correction (FEC) to increase robustness
    against noise and burst interference. Transmissions can be sent on different spreading
    factors, and, depending on the modulation and transmission power, the link budget
    can be as high as 155 dB. LoRaWAN involves a protocol stack with LoRa as the physical
    layer. It uses Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) for managing individual data rates and
    maximizing the battery lifetime of each connected device. The LoRaWAN network
    architecture has a star topology in which end nodes communicate with gateways
    which in turn connect to network servers. A summary of LoRa/LoRaWAN main characteristics
    can be seen in Table 3. In addition, the interested reader can obtain further
    details in [46]. Table 3. LoRa/LoRaWAN main specifications (Europe). 3.4. Implemented
    Communications Architecture To deploy the proposed system making use of LoRa/LoRaWAN,
    the three different layers defined in Figure 3 were implemented as illustrated
    in Figure 4. Note that Figure 3 and Figure 4 show an identical Remote Service
    Layer, but they differ significantly on their fog computing layer and on the way
    they manage IoT nodes. Regarding Figure 4, it is worth pointing out that, for
    the sake of clarity, it only refers to LoRaWAN, since a LoRa-based architecture
    would be a subset. The main difference between a LoRa-based and a LoRaWAN-based
    architecture is that LoRa does not need a specific LoRa Server, while, in the
    case of LoRaWAN, such a server is necessary to manage different aspects of the
    LoRaWAN network, like its security or certain packet management tasks. For such
    a reason, the rest of this subsection and the next would only refer to LoRaWAN.
    Considering the previous clarification, the layers depicted in Figure 4 were implemented
    as follows: Figure 4. Implemented communications architecture. IoT Node Layer.
    This layer is composed of IoT nodes that embed LoRaWAN transceivers, soil sensors,
    and irrigation actuators. The LoRaWAN packets sent by the IoT nodes can be collected
    by one or more nearby LoRaWAN gateways. Fog Computing Layer. In this layer, LoRaWAN
    gateways collect packets from the deployed smart irrigation nodes and then send
    them to a central LoRaWAN server, where they are decoded and processed in order
    to provide fog computing services. Remote Service Layer. It works as it was previously
    described in Section 3.2. 3.5. Implemented IoT Node Layer The implemented LoRaWAN
    IoT nodes send and receive information using the LoRaWAN protocol. Specifically,
    the deployed nodes are able to send periodically the data collected from their
    soil temperature/moisture and air temperature sensors. In addition, the nodes
    can receive remote commands to carry out different tasks (e.g., to activate the
    irrigation actuator or to establish the watering schedule). It must be noted that
    LoRaWAN end devices can be divided into three classes (A, B, and C) depending
    on their needs regarding downlink communications (i.e., for transmitting data
    from a LoRaWAN gateway to the irrigation nodes) [47]. In order to reduce node
    stand-by power consumption, the smart irrigation nodes were chosen to be of class
    A. Such a class allows the nodes to remain asleep most of the time to save power
    and to receive commands only during a short period of time after sending data
    (this fact implies that remote commands will not be executed in real time). Each
    IoT node was designed so that different sensors can be used. For illustration
    purposes, Figure 5 shows one of the smart irrigation IoT nodes disassembled. As
    it can be observed, each node includes interfaces for a DS18820 temperature sensor
    [48] and an SHT15 temperature and moisture sensor [49]. In addition, each node
    provides an interface to connect a 12 V-DC solenoid valve (Seafront G763hwmgsk)
    to control water irrigation. Figure 5. Disassembled smart irrigation node and
    its internal components. The IoT node main board is based on a Heltec LoRa 32
    V2 [50], which provides WiFi connectivity, an OLED Display, and an SX1276 LoRa
    module. Moreover, a Real-Time Clock (RTC) was embedded so that the microcontroller
    can take time-accurate actions when the network time is not available (i.e., based
    on the local time indicated by the RTC). It is possible to make use of the characteristics
    of the previously described hardware to determine the performance of the system.
    Specifically, the characteristics of the selected valve allow for estimating that
    its water flow is about 8 L per minute (a more precise estimation could be calculated
    by embedding a water flow meter in every IoT node, but this will also derive into
    the development of more expensive and power hungry nodes). Assuming that the approximate
    amount of water required by the lawn to stay green is about 10 L per square meter
    per day, it is possible to calculate the savings yielded by the proposed smart
    irrigation system. For calculating water savings, it is necessary to consider
    that the smart irrigation system can irrigate depending on the weather, since
    the system will not activate the node valves if the weather forecast indicates
    that it is going to rain. Thus, if the rainfall prediction is higher than 10 L
    per square meter, it is not necessary to irrigate throughout the whole day. On
    the contrary, if sunny weather conditions are expected, with high solar radiation
    and low humidity, water evaporation increases and, as a consequence, the amount
    of required irrigation will be higher. The proposed system allows, by means of
    automatic planning systems or by manual programming, to reduce the amount of water
    to the minimum necessary when weather conditions are adequate and to increase
    it when soil is too dry, thus making a more efficient use of water and thus reducing
    the waste of water considerably. Specifically, considering only weather forecasts
    and by using local forecasts data (provided by a regional government agency called
    Meteogalicia [51]) to obtain average rainfall over a year in the selected irrigation
    area, it has been estimated that 22.8% water savings would be achieved in comparison
    to a fixed-schedule irrigation system. Such an estimation comes from the results
    shown in Figure 6, which depicts the amount of water used throughout a whole year
    (from November 2019 to November 2020) by the smart irrigation system (red line)
    depending on the amount of rainfall (blue line). As an additional example, Figure
    7 shows a more detailed graph for the month of September 2020 in order to illustrate
    the difference in water usage depending on weather conditions. As it can be clearly
    observed in Figure 7, the smart irrigation system makes use of roughly 10 L per
    square meter when there is no rain, but such an amount decreases in proportion
    to the rainfall, thus saving a significant amount of water. Figure 6. Estimated
    irrigation per day during a year when depending on rain forecasts. Figure 7. Estimated
    irrigation per day during the month of September 2020 when depending on rain forecasts.
    3.6. Implemented Fog Computing and Remote Service Layers The higher layers of
    the architecture depicted in Figure 4 were implemented as follows: Fog Computing
    Layer. It makes use of a central LoRaWAN server and LoRaWAN gateways that can
    be scattered throughout large areas. The LoRaWAN gateways are based on a regular
    microcontroller (STM32L1), while the LoRaWAN server can be executed on a regular
    PC. When IoT nodes need to send data, they send a LoRaWAN packet that will be
    received by the nearest gateway. Then, the gateway forwards the packet to the
    LoRaWAN server in the local network, which can send it later to the cloud, where
    all the information from the different LoRaWAN networks is aggregated. The LoRaWAN
    server is also able to perform local actions based on the received information
    from a specific area before interacting with the cloud. Remote Service Layer.
    The core of the Remote Service Layer manages data collection through Node-RED
    [52]. In addition, a MongoDB database [53] is used to store the collected data.
    Furthermore, this layer is able to make use of third-party services like weather
    forecasters (for deciding irrigation schedules), which can be easily integrated
    with the Remote Service Layer through Representational State Transfer (REST) Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs). 3.7. Enabled Applications The proposed smart irrigation
    system provides numerous advantages with respect to traditional systems thanks
    to the intelligent automation of the irrigation process. Specifically, the following
    are some of the most relevant features of the proposed system that enable the
    development of advanced irrigation applications: Irrigation scheduling can be
    adjusted dynamically and in a smart way by considering multiple information sources
    like weather forecasts. The system can adjust dynamically to changing environmental
    conditions, like soil moisture, ground temperature, or real-time weather conditions.
    The system is able to adjust the irrigation schedule dynamically so as to adapt
    it to the species that are grown on each individual green area. In case of having
    directional irrigators on the IoT nodes, it is possible to establish specific
    dynamic irrigation patterns with the objective of watering very specific areas.
    The system can be easily scaled (it autonomously connects to the nearest gateway),
    thus being able to cover large areas thanks to the use of LPWAN technologies.
    It is straightforward to add additional IoT sensor nodes (which do not need to
    embed irrigation actuators, but only sensors like rain or leaf moisture sensors)
    in order to provide accurate data on the monitored green areas, thus enhancing
    the accuracy of the decisions made on the irrigation. 4. Campus Radio Channel
    Analysis 4.1. Radio Analysis Characteristics This section introduces the radio
    planning tasks performed prior to the deployment of the smart irrigation system.
    Since the considered outdoor scenario is especially complex in terms of radio
    propagation, a precise analysis of radio wave propagation must be performed. The
    main factor that makes the scenario so challenging is the underground wireless
    channel, which is a heterogeneous layer of soil, rocks, water, and organic matter,
    among others. Moreover, the underground channel can also vary depending on the
    location and weather conditions. In fact, electromagnetic wave propagation through
    soil and rock has been previously studied extensively for ground-penetrating radar
    applications [54,55,56]. However, a comprehensive channel model for the underground
    environment does not exist yet. The main problems that impact communications when
    using electromagnetic waves in an underground environment are the following: extreme
    path loss, reflection/refraction, multi-path fading, reduced propagation velocity,
    and noise. A detailed description on the impact of these phenomena in the underground
    communication can be found in [57]. It must be noted that electromagnetic wave
    propagation depends on the dielectric constant of medium materials, which, in
    a smart irrigation scenario, is a heterogeneous mixture of air, water, and soil.
    If the porosity of the soil particles is high, propagation will be better due
    to the higher amount of air present in the medium. On the contrary, if the presence
    of water in the soil is high, electromagnetic propagation in the medium will be
    worse. Thus, particles of sand, clay, and silt of the soil impact communications
    performance. Moreover, node burial depth also impacts electromagnetic propagation
    [58,59]. Due to the previously mentioned issues, electromagnetic wave propagation
    in near-ground and underground environments is challenging. To tackle them, this
    work makes use of an in-house deterministic three-dimensional ray launching (3D-RL)
    simulation tool together with an intensive measurement campaign for characterizing
    the wireless channel within the scenario under analysis. The used algorithm is
    based on Geometrical Optics (GO) and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD),
    making use of the 3D environment to efficiently launch rays from the transmitter
    source. Thus, the algorithm launches hundreds of rays from the transmitter source
    with a predetermined angular separation. Such rays are traced in the scenario
    according to the presence and distribution of obstacles. Along their trajectory,
    when they encounter an obstacle, electromagnetic phenomena like reflection, refraction,
    and diffraction are considered. The 3D-RL principles of operation and the different
    considered phenomena are represented schematically in Figure 8 for a transmitter
    located underground. Figure 8. Operation principles and propagation phenomena
    of the used 3D-RL algorithm. The used RL technique is also referred in the literature
    as brute-force Ray Tracing (RT), ‘shooting and bouncing rays’ or beam-launching
    method [60,61,62]. The technique assumes a space discretization in the simulated
    scenario, which limits field prediction accuracy and depends on the scenario dimensions.
    The optimal space discretization for different scenarios has been obtained by
    experimental measurements in [63]. A detailed description of the used 3D-RL algorithm
    can be found in [64]. Its validation has been performed for different applications
    such as vehicular communications [65], smart cities [66], or in homogeneous vegetation
    environments [67]. It is worth noting that, although the employed 3D-RL algorithm
    has inherent constraints which lead to estimation errors, mainly the limitation
    to create the objects present within the scenario by tetrahedrons, and the non-application
    of the scattering effect due to rough surfaces, the obtained simulation results
    are very accurate, and, therefore, the approximation valid. 4.2. 3D-RL Scenario
    Before deploying IoT nodes on a real scenario, it is worth realizing that a smart
    irrigation system may be impacted by certain limitations. First, the position
    of the nodes on the ground depends on the access to water supply and on the surface
    to irrigate. Moreover, the deployment of the LoRaWAN gateway can be optimized
    based on radio planning analysis. To contemplate such factors, the scenario was
    modeled in 3D with the 3D-RL tool as it can be observed in Figure 9 (this scenario
    is actually part of a larger scenario created and used previously in [4]). Figure
    9. Scenario created for 3D-RL simulations (Map source: ©2020 Google). To obtain
    accurate RF power distribution estimations, the simulation scenario was created
    as detailed as possible, thus including the most relevant elements that may influence
    electromagnetic propagation (e.g., buildings, roads, trees, and vehicles) and
    their specific material properties (permittivity and conductivity, as indicated
    in Table 4). Then, the input parameters of the 3D-RL tool were carefully selected,
    including the operation frequency, the transmitter, and receiver radiation patterns,
    the number of permitted reflections and the ray angular/spatial resolution. In
    addition, in order to obtain accurate simulation results in a limited amount of
    time, it was necessary to set correctly the number of reflections and the angular/spatial
    resolution parameters through a proper analysis [63]. The resulting parameters
    for the scenario under analysis are indicated in Table 5. Table 4. Material properties
    for the 3D-RL simulations. Table 5. 3D-RL simulation parameters. 4.3. Simulation
    Results The simulated nodes and gateway locations were virtually placed on the
    ground on the positions depicted in Figure 10, following the deployment structure
    previously depicted in Figure 1. In Figure 10, the red circles represent irrigation
    node locations, while purple circles represent gateway locations. Eight different
    irrigation node potential locations were analyzed and simulated when exchanging
    data with a gateway that could be positioned into three different locations. Two
    of the gateway locations were outdoors (locations 9 and 10, which have a height
    of 1.8 m), while the other was indoors (location 11, at a height of 5.5 m). The
    outdoor locations were chosen by considering aspects such as ease of installation
    (e.g., access to electrical power) and the existence of line of sight with respect
    to most of the deployed IoT nodes and to the surrounding buildings. The gateway
    indoor location was selected to be inside one specific building due to its challenging
    outside enclosure (such a building can be observed on the picture on the left
    of Figure 2), which is covered by an external metal mesh that acts as a sort of
    Faraday cage, thus blocking electromagnetic waves partially. Figure 10. Schematic
    upper view of the deployment of the irrigation nodes and the gateways. Since the
    3D-RL tool provides the RF power distribution for the whole volume of the scenario,
    it is possible to optimize node and gateway deployment locations. Considering
    that the developed smart irrigation nodes provide a sensitivity of –148 dBm (both
    for 433 MHz and 868 MHz), deterministic estimations of the received RF power level
    at each gateway position can be obtained. Thus, the validity of the proposed locations
    can be inferred. Before showing the obtained simulation results, it is important
    to mention that the created scenario was previously validated by means of empirical
    results obtained during a measurement campaign [4]. The obtained results showed
    a very good agreement between measurements and 3D-RL estimations, obtaining a
    mean error of 0.53 dB and a standard deviation of 3.39 dB. The results obtained
    for the 868 MHz and 433 MHz transceivers are presented in Figure 11 and Figure
    12, respectively. Specifically, such figures show bi-dimensional planes of the
    RF power distribution estimations for all the eight smart irrigation nodes at
    the ground level. As expected, 433 MHz propagation is better in the same conditions.
    This is due to the higher transmitted power and to its lower radio propagation
    losses in comparison to the higher 868 MHz frequency. Figure 11. 868 MHz simulation
    results: RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional plane on the ground level.
    Figure 12. 433 MHz simulation results: RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional
    plane on the ground level. When the gateway is located at position 9, irrigation
    nodes 2 and 8 obtain their worst results due to the shadowing created by the building.
    Even in such a situation, due to the low sensitivity values of both 433 and 868
    MHz devices, the received power level is higher than the sensitivity threshold
    (−148 dBm). This fact was corroborated during the empirical measurement campaign
    (described later in Section 5). In the case of placing the gateway into position
    10, the worst results are clearly obtained by irrigation node 2, again due to
    the shadowing created by the building. Like in the previous case, the low sensitivity
    of LoRaWAN devices facilitates wireless communications also in cases when the
    shadowing effect due to buildings absorbs a great amount of energy of the propagated
    wave. The third analyzed gateway location corresponds to position 11, which is
    inside the building, at a height of 5.5 m from the street ground level. Figure
    13 and Figure 14 show estimations of the RF power level distribution at a height
    of 5.5 m for 868 MHz (Figure 13) and 433 MHz (Figure 14) transceivers (note that,
    for this simulation, the irrigation nodes remained on the ground). Like in the
    previous simulations, higher RF power levels are observed for 433 MHz due to the
    higher transmitted power level and the lower radio propagation losses. However,
    in comparison to the results obtained for gateway positions 9 and 10, the results
    obtained in position 11 are worse. As it can be observed, position 11 is inside
    blue areas or next to them. This means that the received RF power is significantly
    lower in comparison to the other two gateway positions, which, in some cases,
    can lead to packet losses and even to a wireless communication outage. This behavior
    is confirmed by the empirical measurements presented in the next section. Figure

    plane at the height of 5.5 m. Figure 14. 3D-RL simulation results at 433 MHz:
    RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional plane at the height of 5.5 m.
    5. Experiments An empirical measurement campaign was carried out to validate the
    simulation results detailed in the previous section and to determine node performance
    on the selected scenario. Thus, signal strength measurements from LoRa and LoRaWAN
    IoT nodes were collected by gateways when exchanging data from different potential
    locations. The next subsections detail the characteristics of the used hardware,
    describe the performed tests, and analyze the obtained results comparing them
    with the ones obtained by the 3D-RL tool. 5.1. LoRa/LoRaWAN Smart Irrigation Testbeds
    In order to determine the performance of LoRa and LoRaWAN for the deployment of
    smart irrigation IoT nodes, two different testbeds were created: one based on
    LoRaWAN that works at 868 MHz and another one that uses LoRa at 433 MHz. Figure
    15 shows an 868 MHz LoRaWAN-based IoT node and its components. Specifically, the
    node is based on a WisTrio RAK5205 LPWAN tracker, which makes use of a Semtech
    SX1276 LoRa transceiver and an STM32L1 microcontroller. The main specifications
    of the node are indicated in Table 6. Regarding the 433 MHz node, it is based
    on a Heltec LoRa 32 v1 board (as it can be observed in Figure 16) and its main
    specifications are detailed in Table 7. Figure 15. Components of the 868 MHz LoRaWAN
    node. Figure 16. Components of the 433 MHz LoRa node. Table 6. Main specifications
    of the 868 MHz LoRaWAN node. Table 7. Specifications of the 433 MHz IoT node.
    In spite of having different microcontrollers (which essentially affects power
    consumption), both IoT nodes make use of the same radio module at different frequency
    bands. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the RAK5205 board comes with a built-in
    GPS and different environmental sensors, while the used 433 MHz LoRa board uses
    an ESP32 as a main controller, which also embeds WiFi and Bluetooth transceivers.
    Finally, with respect to the gateways of the testbeds, whose main characteristics
    are summarized in Table 8, they make use of the following hardware: Table 8. Main
    characteristics of the LoRa/LoRaWAN gateways of the testbeds. 868 MHz testbed
    gateway: a RAK7258 LoRaWAN gateway was used. Such a gateway embeds a Semtech SX1301
    LoRaWAN transceiver able to provide full 8-channel communications. The gateway
    also embeds a Mediatek MT7628 System on Chip (SoC), 128 MB of RAM and WiFi and
    Ethernet transceivers. 433 MHz testbed gateway: a point-to-point connection with
    two 433 MHz LoRa boards was created. Thus, both 433 MHz nodes made use of the
    same essential hardware (a Heltec LoRa 32 v1 board), but one acted as an IoT node
    and the other one as a gateway. As it can be observed in Table 8, the main difference
    between both nodes is that the gateway made use of a 5 dBi omnidirectional antenna,
    while the IoT node used a 1 dBi coil antenna. 5.2. Performed Tests The tests consisted
    of transmitting packets from every IoT node outdoor location to the respective
    gateway (depending on the link quality, between none and roughly 60 packets were
    received). It is important to note that, since different protocols were used for
    each testbed, the considerations for measuring their performance and signal strength
    differ slightly: LoRaWAN is more complex than LoRa. By default, most LoRaWAN transceivers
    make use of an adaptive algorithm (Adaptative Data Rate, ADR) when transmitting,
    which implies that their spreading factor and transmission power are adjusted
    dynamically. In the performed tests, it was observed that, after the transmission
    of the first packet, the spreading factor was adjusted to a value that remained
    static for the rest of the transmissions. Likewise, there were no variations in
    the power level, which was always set in level 1, which implies a transmission
    power of 14 dBm. In the case of LoRa, the ADR algorithm is not executed, so spreading
    factor and transmit power values remain static and thus independent from the communications
    conditions. During the tests, the maximum allowed transmission power for the EU433
    band was used, which corresponds to a spreading factor of 12 and a power transmission
    of 20 dBm. Regarding the measurement locations, they were the ones analyzed with
    the 3D-RL simulator and depicted in Figure 1. For every IoT node position, the
    node was placed on the ground or underground (at a burial depth of roughly 10
    cm; one of the moments of the burying process is illustrated in Figure 17) depending
    on the experiment. Regarding the gateway, during the measurements in position
    11, the gateway was located indoors, next to a window at a 5.5-meter height above
    the ground level. In the case of positions 9 and 10, the gateway was outdoors
    and its antenna was placed in a tripod, as it is shown in Figure 18. Figure 17.
    Deployment of one of the smart irrigation nodes. Figure 18. Location of the gateway
    antenna during the experiments at position 9. At every measurement location, the
    Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values were collected for the node-to-gateway
    communications. It is important to note that RSSI depends on diverse factors [69],
    so the results and conclusions presented in the next section cannot be extrapolated
    directly to other scenarios and, therefore, they should be considered as an example
    of the validation of the appropriateness of the proposed smart irrigation system
    design approach and on the usefulness of performing simulations with the used
    3D-RL tool prior to a real hardware deployment. 5.3. Results The measurement campaign
    provided a lot of information regarding the performance on the wireless link for
    all the eight irrigation nodes and the three gateway potential positions. Figure
    19 shows a summary of the results obtained with an operating frequency of 868
    MHz, for both the near-ground (i.e., on the ground) and underground locations
    of the irrigation nodes. The same kind of measurements but for the 433 MHz nodes
    are shown in Figure 20. As it can be observed, when an irrigation node is underground,
    the RSSI measured by the gateways is generally lower, which is expected due to
    the losses of the ground. Nonetheless, in most cases, the difference between near-ground
    and underground transmissions is not critical, due to the burial depth of the
    underground nodes (10 cm). It is worth noting that, when the gateway was located
    at position 11 (i.e., inside the building), it collected the lowest RSSI levels
    from all the irrigation nodes. Moreover, it is the only gateway position where
    some packets were lost (in fact, no packets were received from irrigation nodes
    1, 2, and 3), showing the worst performance of all gateway positions. Thus, the
    obtained results agree with the estimations obtained by the 3D-RL algorithm and
    previously described in Section 4.3. Figure 19. Summary of the measurements at
    868 MHz. Figure 20. Summary of the measurements at 433 MHz. In order to gain insight
    into the obtained measurements, Figure 21 presents, as an example, the RSSI received
    at the three potential gateway locations for each 868 MHz irrigation node position
    for the near-ground case. Again, it can be observed how the signal sent by irrigation
    nodes 1, 2, and 3 does not reach successfully the gateway when it is located at
    position 11. Moreover, the RSSI received by the gateway at position 11 is the
    lowest of all the cases. Figure 21. RSSI received by the gateways from the eight
    irrigation nodes (near-ground) that operate at 868 MHz. Regarding positions 9
    and 10, the RSSI collected by the gateways depends on the distance between them
    and the specific transmitting irrigation node, as well as on the presence of obstacles
    like buildings or cars (as previously depicted and modeled in Figure 10). For
    example, for irrigation node 8, the gateway in location 10 received much better
    quality signal than the one in location 9 due to the shorter distance and also
    the shadowing effect caused by the near-by building. On the contrary, in the case
    of irrigation node 6, the gateway at location 9 received better signal levels
    than the one at 10, even despite location 9 being further from the irrigation
    node. This effect was due to the fact that several vehicles (which are mainly
    metallic) were parked between node 6 and location 10, thus blocking partially
    radio waves and leading to higher RF losses. All the measurements agree with the
    simulation results presented in Section 4.3, both at 433 MHz and 868 MHz, and
    lead to the same conclusions: position 11 is the worst position for placing the
    communications gateway. On the other hand, locations 9 and 10 present different
    performance in terms of RSSI depending on the irrigation node positions, but in
    both cases the performance in terms of lost packets is the same (zero packets
    were lost for near-ground and underground nodes, both for 433 MHz and 868 MHz),
    so such positions are valid for the proposed application. In any case, if larger
    areas were monitored and controlled by irrigation nodes, the better radio propagation
    achieved at 433 MHz could lead to the use of such nodes instead of the ones that
    operate at 868 MHz. Furthermore, once the 3D-RL simulator has been validated,
    new RF power distribution estimations could be obtained in order to assess the
    impact of transmitting with lower power levels (for energy saving), which will
    impact the RSSI and, therefore, the possibility of losing packets due to Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR) and to the sensitivity threshold of the devices. In the same way,
    new gateway and irrigation node positions could be easily analyzed without the
    necessity of new extensive measurement campaigns. 6. Conclusions This article
    proposed a smart irrigation system based on LoRa/LoRaWAN IoT nodes and gateways
    with a novel communications architecture able to exchange data with local fog
    computing nodes and with a remote cloud in a campus scenario. The prototype of
    the proposed IoT system was developed and described in detail so as to allow future
    developers to replicate it easily. In order to validate the proposed system and
    assess the potential locations for the nodes to be deployed, an in-house 3D-ray
    launching radio-planning tool was used in conjunction with an accurate 3D model
    of the simulated scenario (a university campus). In such a scenario, simulations
    and empirical measurements were carried out for 433 MHz LoRa-based and 868 MHz
    LoRaWAN-based testbeds. The obtained results validate the accuracy of the used
    radio planning tool (the results obtained in this scenario showed a very good
    agreement between measurements and 3D-RL estimations, obtaining a mean error of
    0.53 dB and a standard deviation of 3.39 dB), which allows for estimating the
    RF power level distribution of the involved nodes and gateways for the whole volume
    of the scenario. Thus, the potential coverage of the different areas can be identified
    prior their deployment. The obtained radio propagation results also remark, on
    one hand, the negative effect that some architectural elements of a building (such
    as the metallic facade in this case) may have in terms of radio propagation, and,
    on the other hand, that the impact of underground communications in signal attenuation
    may not be critical if the burial depth is shallow (10 cm in this case). The conclusions
    obtained show that the proposed tool provides useful guidelines for future developers
    on the design of smart irrigation systems in similar large scenarios. Further
    work will add additional intelligence (e.g., predictive models with AI to fine-grained
    the amount of water) to the IoT nodes layer and will study in depth the effect
    of burial depth in LoRaWAN underground wireless channels. Author Contributions

    system has occurred frequently in recent years, causing severe damages, economic

    efficiency of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by a comprehensive experiment.
    Moreover, some critical factors, eg, sensor battery lifetime and movement pattern,
    are all extensively investigated and the results show the coverage ratio is sensitive
    to these factors. 1 INTRODUCTION Clean drinking water is a critical resource for
    the health and well-being of all humans. However, water crises, eg, water shortage
    and contamination, have consistently featured among the top ranked global risks
    according to the Global Risks Report (2017).1 Since many pipes in the urban infrastructure
    are buried underground in the early 20th century and now they are reaching the
    end of their life, most of them are highly vulnerable to break, leakage, or burst.
    It is estimated by the world bank that 48.6 billion cubic meters of water are
    lost every year. In the US, it is estimated that there are 237 600 water main
    breaks per year, leading to $2.8 billion lost in yearly revenue.2 Furthermore,
    severe water leakage may also cause ground instabilities, thus lead to collapse
    of roads, buildings, and subsequent secondary economic losses in the forms of
    damages to transportation and communication lines. On the other hand, breaks in
    water mains pose another threat. That is, public health risks duo to back flow
    events. A back flow is an unwanted flow of nonportable water, or other substances,
    such as soil, pesticides, and so on, into the pipelines of water distribution
    system (WDS). Backflow events occur when there is a reverse pressure gradient
    at the cross-connection, and then cause water quality deterioration and illness,
    thus posing severe threat to our society. In the report of the US Environmental
    Protection Agency compilation, the authority said that about 459 backflow incidents
    led to an estimated of 12 093 illnesses between 1970 and 2001.3 Deploying online
    fixed sensor networks is considered as a viable approach for detecting contamination
    incidents or leakage in drinking WDS.4 However, there are three limitations impairing
    the application of fixed sensors in WDS. First, due to the limited sensing range
    of each sensor and budget constraints (eg, a Hach chlorine sensor costs between
    $3000 to $5000),5 it is expensive and impractical to deploy a static sensor network
    to cover all the pipeline in a city. Second, existing sensor technologies limit
    the locations for placing sensors since only a small number of points in an underground
    network are both accessible and located near a power source. Third, even though
    static fixed sensors arise an alarm, we can hardly identify the accurate location
    of leakage event because of the sparse information obtained by a relatively less
    number of fixed sensors.6 Fortunately, in recent years, some new forms of sensors
    are invented and applied in WDS,7 especially the mobile sensors, which can flow
    in the water pipes and move very close to leakage point. As a result, it is reported
    that the detection accuracy is higher than traditional static sensors.4 However,
    for water leakage detection, some new challenges resulted from the inherent characteristics
    of mobile sensor nodes are still underaddressed. First, mobile sensors are deployed
    in underground water pipelines. The sensors cannot locate themselves by global
    positioning system; they need to infer their position from its proximity to points.
    Second, the mobile sensors are usually battery powered and therefore are energy
    limited. They cannot direct send the sensing data directly to remote datacenters
    or make some basic preprocessing operations (eg, filtering). We notice that these
    issues can be addressed by the newly emerging concept, ie, fog computing. By deploying
    fog nodes around the water pipes, they can well facilitate the mobile sensors
    to complete the detection tasks. First, the fog nodes are able to broadcast their
    positions to the mobile sensor who passed by. Second, the fog nodes are able to
    collect sensing data from the mobile sensors and send them to the remote datacenters,
    and then more sophisticated analysis can be done at the datacenters by big data
    techniques.8, 9 Therefore, it is essential to push the fog computing together
    with the mobile sensor networks so as to jointly detect the water leakage, burst,
    or contamination in WDS. The first problem comes out is that how we shall deploy
    the sensors and the fog nodes as usually we are budget limited and cannot deploy
    arbitrary number of sensors or fog nodes to cover all the critical points. Instead,
    we shall consider how we can maximize the coverage ratio under the limited number
    of mobile sensor nodes and fog nodes. As a result, we are motivated to study the
    mobile sensor and fog nodes deployment problem for WDS monitoring in this paper.
    More specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows. We present
    a formal mathematical model for the placement optimization problem of mobile sensors
    and fog nodes to maximize the coverage ratio in WDS under the constraint of budget.
    We make a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem and prove that it
    is NP-complete. We propose a two-phase heuristic method in polynomial time for
    the placement of sensor placement and fog nodes. By simulating a typical water
    distribution network, the correctness and efficiency of our proposed model and
    algorithm are verified. We also discover the relationship between the coverage
    ratio with some critical factors. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 reviews state-of-the-art related work. Section 6 presents our problem
    formulation and theoretical analysis. Section 10 proposes our heuristic algorithm.
    Section 16 discusses simulation results. Section 22 concludes this paper and puts
    forward some issues, which need to be further investigated in the future. 2 RELATED
    WORK There exist several methods based on various operating principles for detection
    of leakage in WDS. We divided them into three categories, ie, software-based method,
    outside pipe hardware-based method, and inline pipe sensor-based method. For easy
    understanding, Table 1 summarizes some key features of the representative methods.
    Detailed discussion and comparison are as follows. Table 1. Water distribution

    methods Software-based methods can be roughly divided into numerical modeling
    methods and nonnumerical modeling methods. The former identifies possible leakage
    areas by establishing a relevant numerical model, which is used to gain relevant
    data, and comparing simulation results with field data. The later mainly analyzes
    monitoring data combined with some algorithm to identify possible leakage areas.
    For example, water audits based on metering and water balance calculations can
    be performed to quantify water losses and provide an extremely crude approximation
    of the location losses.10 Kang and Lansey12 proposed a novel pipe burst detection
    method, which combined hydraulic model with a limit analysis method. Software-based
    methods do not aim to accurately locate the definite leakage point, but to minimize
    possible leakage areas to the minimum level. The advantage of software-based methods
    is that they generally cost less than hardware-based methods. 2.2 Outside pipe
    hardware-based methods Outside pipe hardware-based method is one typical approach,
    which is usually associated with special hardware devices to detect the leakage
    from the external of pipe networks. According to the theoretical principles that
    apply to the hardware devices, these methods can be divided into acoustic and
    nonacoustic detection. Specifically, the current broadly used acoustic methods
    include listening rods, leak correlators, and leak noise logger.13 Nonacoustic
    detection includes ground penetrating radar detection technology,14 radioactive
    tracers,15 and so on. Although the accuracy of these hardware methods is high,
    many shortcomings exist in these methods based on hardware. The detection range
    is limited, and leakage cannot be detected in a timely fashion for large pipe
    networks. Moreover, the operating cost is usually high. 2.3 Inline pipe sensor-based
    methods Inline pipe sensors-based methods are to deploy mobile sensors into the
    pipe. The mobile sensors will then make inspection tour by the pushing of water
    flow. In recent years, a major field of interests has been attracted on the application
    of mobile sensor to the detection of pipe burst and leakage. Nevertheless, there
    is much room for improvement in terms of testing reliability and timeliness.13
    In 2014, the company of Pure Technologies first developed the revolutionary SmartBall
    to address the need for leakage detection of large-diameter pipelines. The SmartBall
    is an inline acoustic acquisition device that swims within pipes 24 cm in diameter
    or greater with an operational battery life of up to 15 hours. It is worth mentioning
    that SmartBall is not connected to a cable and can move freely with water flow.16
    A more smaller scale inline mobile sensor, TriopusNet, can swim in a 6 cm-diameter
    pipe buried underground.18 Banks et al17 also designed, fabricated, and tested
    a prototype mobile sensor of 6.7 cm in diameter for monitoring critical parameters
    such as pH, water hardness, and residual chlorine indicator ions in the security
    and reliability of municipal finished water distribution networks. Modeling of
    the behavior of mobile sensors in WDS introduces a new field of interest. Perelman
    and Ostfeld19 first studied the motion behavior of mobile sensor in WDS and assumed
    that mobile sensor flowed down the pipe with the highest velocity. The benefits
    of mobile sensors deployed in WDS were shown in another work of the aforementioned
    authors,20 where the placement of fixed and mobile sensors are jointly optimized.
    The results showed that mobile sensors should be deployed instead of fixed sensors
    when their costs are equal. Suresh et al21 first considered complete architectural
    design, algorithms, and protocols for optimal monitoring of flow-based systems
    (eg, WDSs, oil and gas pipelines, and the human cardiovascular system). As the
    battery life and detection threshold of the mobile sensor are critical factors,
    Rasekh et al22 varied the detection threshold from 0 to 0.5mg/L and battery life
    ranging from 2 to 10 hours; the results showed that a longer battery life and
    a lesser detection threshold will perform better. Oliker and Ostfeld23 addressed
    a deterministic binary integer programming model for mutually operating fixed
    and mobile sensors. The results showed that mobile sensors were beneficial to
    WDS monitoring when operated in conjunction with static sensors. Recently, Gong
    et al3 proposed a mobile wireless sensor network, which consisted of sensors and
    beacons for leakage and backflow detection. There are two advantages for the exploitation
    of inline mobile sensors. One is that they have the ability of real-time monitoring
    in WDS and enable critical decisions for public health protection. The other is
    that they have a high spatiotemporal coverage by swimming in the pipes. There
    is a clear need for the design and development of mobile sensor based water quality
    monitoring or leakage detection in WDS. 3 PROBLEM FORMULATION AND THEORETICAL
    ANALYSIS 3.1 Preliminaries In this work, we consider a WDS, which is to be deployed
    with a number of mobile sensors and a set of fog nodes. The mobile sensors are
    battery powered and are with range-limited wireless communication capabilities.
    They also have limited storage capabilities and can store the collected information,
    time, and angular velocity. They are small enough to pass through the pipe, corners,
    and junctions in WDS. Without external control, the mobile sensors move in suspension
    at the velocity of the water in the pipes and they will not change the hydraulic
    behavior of system; if a mobile sensor reaches an end point in the WDS, it will
    be got back by retrieval system as soon as possible. To facilitate the low capability
    mobile sensors, fog nodes are introduced to collect and preprocess the sensing
    data, as well as to aid in localization. They will also transmit the preprocessed
    information to the datacenter. The communication between fog nodes and sensors
    passed by is quick enough without any information loss. That is, we assume that
    a mobile sensor can transfer all the sensing information in its memory to a fog
    node within their contact duration. We consider a case that we are going to deploy
    the mobile sensors and fog node in a WDS with limited budget. In this case, we
    are not able to cover all the vulnerable points in the WDS. Therefore, instead,
    we try to seek a solution that can maximize the coverage ratio under the limited
    budget. The solution shall answer where and when to deploy a fixed number of mobile
    sensors and where to place the fog nodes. For the ease of reading, Table 2 summarizes
    all the notations to be used throughout this paper. Table 2. Notations G directed

    vertex at which mobile sensors are introduced vd destination nodes vs source nodes

    formulation We view a WDS as a directed acyclic graph G = (V,E ), where V is a
    set of vertices where pipes meet. A vertices could be a junctions, tank, or any
    other source. An edge e ∈ E represent pipes, pumps, and valves. A pipe connecting
    two vertices vi and vj is usually denoted (vi,vj). Drinking water flows are driven
    by pumping rates and pressure, which may vary frequently because of uncertainty
    of water demand. In general, we consider risk under a fixed number of flow patterns,
    where each edge has only one direction of water flow. Definition 1.In a directed
    acyclic graph G, the vertices with no incoming edges are defined as source nodes
    vs, ie, reservoir and water towers, and the vertices with no outgoing edges are
    defined as destination nodes vd. An insertion point is a vertex vi ∈ V at which
    the mobile sensor node is introduced into the WDS. Basically, it could be any
    vertice in WDS. Definition 2.Assume that the flow pattern is fixed at time t;
    let R be the set of all possible flow routes in G, each of which is loop free.
    We define the flow path rid⊆R as a sequence of v, ie, ri = ⟨vi,…,vd⟩, which means
    the water flows from node vi to destination node vd. Definition 3.A sensing path
    sp is a sequence of v from the insertion point to one of the destination nodes
    vd, ie, . Due to the variety of water flows, different mobile sensors shall have
    different sensing paths. We assume that a mobile sensor j has a sensing path sp( j ).
    Assume that we have S number of sensors; we combine all their sensing paths sp( j )
    into a set SP, ie, . Then, we can use |SP| to indicate the number of nodes covered
    by the deployed mobile sensors. Definition 4.Coverage ratio cr is the fraction
    of the nodes covered by all the mobile sensors during time T. That is, , where
    N is the total number of nodes in the graph G = (V,E ). In order to better formulate
    the coverage optimization problem, we introduce an auxiliary variable x (vi,t),
    which indicate whether a sensor placed at node vi at the time t, x (vi,t) ∈ {0,1}
    Problem 1. (Sensor-constrained maximum coverage problem)Consider an acyclic flow
    G and a fixed number of mobile sensors; we want to optimize the location and insertion
    time of mobile sensor to maximize the coverage ratio cr. The problem is formulated
    as (1) (2) Problem 2. (Coverage-ratio-constrained set optimal problem)Consider
    an acyclic flow G and a fixed coverage ratio; we want to optimize the location
    and insertion time to minimize the number of mobile sensors (3) (4) For clarity
    of presentation, we give an example to illustrate the aforementioned definitions
    and optimization problems, depicted in Figure 1. In the shown acyclic flow network,
    it consists of eight vertices and 12 edges, ie, v1 is the source node vs and v8
    is the destination node vd. There exist many flow routes. For example, r1 represents
    as ⟨v1,v2,v5,v8⟩, r2 represents as ⟨v1,v3,v6,v8⟩, r3 represents as ⟨v1,v5,v7,v8⟩,
    and r4 represents as ⟨v1,v3,v4,v7,v6,v8⟩. When a mobile sensor n2 is inserted
    at the node v3, then a sensing path is likely as sp1 = ⟨v3,v6,v8⟩ or sp2 = ⟨v3,v4,v7,v8⟩.
    We can see that sp1⊆r2, sp2⊆r4. For the problem of sensor-constrained maximum
    coverage problem (SMCP), if we deploy two mobile sensors n1 and n2 at the node
    v1,v3 with their sensing paths are ⟨v1,v2,v5,v8⟩ and ⟨v3,v6,v8⟩, respectively,
    then the set of vertices SP = ⟨v1,v2,v3,v5,v6,v8⟩ shall be covered by the deployed
    sensors. The coverage ratio cr is 0.75. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 3.3 Theoretical analysis
    To clearly understand the two problems stated, we next make a theoretical analysis
    on them. First, we will prove that Problem 2 coverage-ratio-constrained set optimal
    problem (CSOP) is NP-complete, and then we will prove that Problem 1 (SMCP) is
    equivalent to Problem 2. Theorem 1.Coverage-ratio-constrained set optimal problem
    for leakage or contaminant detection in a directed acyclic graph is NP-complete.
    Proof.There are two steps to prove that CSOP is NP-complete. In the first step,
    we argue that this problem is NP. Given one case that cr = 1, the following verifier
    for CSOP runs in time polynomial in the length of it first input: Verifier (⟨V,R,k⟩),⟨sp1,…,spk⟩.
    spi is a subset of R. |⟨sp1,…,spk⟩| ≤ k ∀vi ∈ V, then {∃spi|vi ∈ spi}. By the
    verifier, we can see that this problem is easy to proved as a NP problem. In the
    second step, we will show that set cover (SC) SC≤PCSOP, as SC problem is NP-complete;
    if there exists a polynomial time reduction from SC problem to CSOP, then we can
    prove CSOP is also NP-complete. Take an instance of SC problem V,A,S,K, where
    (5) where V is a set of elements, A is a set of subsets of V covering all elements
    of V, and S is a subset of A that contains all elements of V. SC problem is to
    find the least K element in A to cover V. Based on the SC problem, we will show
    that there exists f:SC→CSOP, which is a polytime reduction of SC to CSOP. Suppose
    the elements in V is the nodes in a directed acyclic graph G; A is the subset
    of the all the flow routes from the vs to vd. That is to say, each element rj
    in A is a flow route. We can construct sensing paths from the set S, eg, sensing
    paths . In this way, if we deploy k mobile sensors at the first vertex of each
    sensing path spi, then these sensors can cover all the nodes in the graph G. Conversely,
    suppose there are m flow paths in a directed acyclic graph G = (V,E ); there are
    k sensing paths. Then, if there is si ∈ A, and , at the meantime, spi⊆rj. By the
    two steps, we can prove that SP can be reduced to CSOP. As CSOP is a special case
    of SP, it is NP-complete. Theorem 2.Problem 1 (SMCP) is polynomially equivalent
    to Problem 2 (CSOP). Moreover, an algorithm for SMCP can be converted to an algorithm
    for CSOP. Proof.Suppose we have an exact algorithm that solve SMCP; we now use
    a typical binary search algorithm for CSOP to minimize the number of sensors.
    For clarification, we first make the following assumptions. Assumption 1.The number
    of mobile sensors needed monotonically increases as the coverage ratio increases
    and vice versa. It is clear that the more sensors, the larger area the mobile
    sensors will cover. Assumption 2.The number of mobile sensors range from 1 to
    Smax, where Smax is the maximum number of sensors needed to cover all the nodes
    in WDS. For a fixed number of mobile sensors, the exact algorithm will achieve
    a maximum coverage ratio cr by optimizing the layout of insertion locations and
    time. On the contrary, for any given coverage ratio cr, we can use exhaustive
    search to identify the minimum number of sensors. Now, based on the two assumptions,
    we can find the minimal number of sensors by at most log(Smax) iterations by a
    binary search when coverage ratio cr is given. Hence, the solution for SMCP can
    be utilized to design an algorithm for CSOP with a log(Smax) factor increase in
    the running time, so we can conclude that the two problems are equivalent. 4 ALGORITHM
    DESIGN For the optimization problems stated in the previous section, we propose
    a customized genetic algorithm to optimize the layout of mobiles sensors'' locations
    and insertion time in WDS. In order to gather the information sampled by mobile
    senors, we need to further deploy fog nodes to transfer the sampling data to datacenters,
    so this section includes two parts, ie, one is a customized genetic algorithm
    for sensors placement, the other is a greedy search algorithm for fog node deployment.
    4.1 A customized genetic algorithm for mobile sensors placement Algorithm 1 gives
    a detailed pseudocode of our proposed approach. The required inputs include water
    distribution network, maximum generation, size of population, crossover rate,
    and the mutation rate. The output is an optimal or near-optimal solution, which
    includes locations and insertion time of mobile sensors. As seen in Algorithm
    1, the population is first initialized with popsize individuals; each individual
    is made up of s genes, each genes include two parts, ie, location and insertion
    time of mobile sensors. After these sensors are deployed in WDS, then they will
    swim in the pipes and each sensor will give a trajectory. Subsequently, Customized
    genetic algorithm (CGA) executes evolution operations, such as crossover and mutation
    (lines 3 and 4); Next, CGA performs the evaluation of the fitness function (lines
    5 to 8). A roulette selection operation is carried out according to the fitness
    value of each individual (line 9). Finally, if the results meet the stop condition,
    we output the best individual. Otherwise, CGA returns to evolution operation (line
    2). 4.1.1 Encoding and initialization of populations For genetic algorithm and
    its application in WDS, the first step is to encode the chromosome as the decision
    variable. In our scheme, we use real code to describe the status of mobile sensors.
    For each sensor, to determine the optimal insertion time and location, we use
    a two-dimension gene, ie, represents where and when to deploy; for instance, a
    gene s1(56,3600) means to insert the mobile sensor s1 at the node 56 at time 3600
    seconds. A chromosome consists of multiple genes; if we will deploy 10 sensors
    in WDS, then chromosome has 10 genes, eg, one chromosome is {s1(56,3600),s2(21,4800),⋯,s10(78,7200)}.
    As mobile sensors can be deployed at any node at any time, for a WDS with 100
    nodes and the sampling cycle is 5 minute, the maximum battery life of mobile sensor
    is 72 hours. If we need optimize 10 sensors'' deployment, then the solution space
    is , so it is too huge to use deterministic algorithm to obtain the optimal solution
    in a short time. 4.1.2 Crossover, mutation, and selection operators To generate
    next generation population, single-point crossover operator is used to produce
    a “child” solution. By this way, the “child“ solution will typically share many
    of the characteristics of its “parents.” In the specific algorithm, we first determine
    the cross point, and then randomly pick up two chromosome as the “parents”; after
    that, all data beyond that point in either chromosome string is swapped between
    the two “parents” chromosomes. In order to maintain genetic diversity from one
    generation of a population of genetic algorithm chromosomes to the next, uniform
    mutation is used to change one gene in the chromosome, eg, one gene in a chromosome
    is s1(56,3600); by the mutation operator, the new gene is s1(58,3600). Simulation
    results show that uniform mutation is as good as Gauss mutation strategy. As a
    key procedure in genetic algorithm, selection operator is a method of selecting
    an individual from a population of individuals. In our algorithm, tournament selection
    involves running several “tournaments” among a few chromosomes chosen at random
    from the population. The winner of each tournament (the one with the best fitness)
    is selected for crossover. Selection pressure is easily adjusted by changing the
    tournament size. If the tournament size is larger, weak individuals have a smaller
    chance to be selected. 4.1.3 Evaluation of fitness function As the fitness function
    is a particular type of objective function that is used to summarize, as a single
    figure of merit, how close a given design solution is to achieving the set aims.
    Specifically, in genetic algorithm, each design solution refers to as a chromosome;
    in order to distinguish the bad or good chromosome, the fitness function is applied
    to test and judge whether the design solution meets the overall specification.
    In our algorithm, the computational process for the fitness function includes
    three steps, ie, (1) use EPANET simulator to compute the speed of water flow at
    each pipe in the water distribution network; (2) each chromosome indicates the
    insert location and time of mobile sensors; these mobile sensor are pushed by
    the water flow, and then each sensor will have its trajectory; (3) by all the
    trajectories, we use Equation 1 to compute the coverage ratio. As the evaluation
    of fitness function is the most important part, we describe the pseudocode of
    the process of fitness function evaluation by Algorithm 2. In Algorithm 2, the
    required inputs include network, water demand, and chromosome, the output is coverage
    ratio. In line 1, we utilize EPANET Toolkit24 to compute the time series of link
    velocities v(t); time steps are dictated by hydraulic or physical changes, ie,
    if a mobile sensor reaches the end of a pile and move toward another one. Sensor
    location will be updated at each time step regarding to the given flow direction
    and rate. In line 4, we get the the speed of mobile sensor and length of pipe
    that the sensor will pass through by look up the velocities matrix. Lines 5 and
    6 compute the sensor displacement and location in the pipeline Lp. Lines 7 to
    9 update the trajectory if the sensor still remains in the same pipeline. Lines
    11 to 15 deal with the case that mobile sensor reaches the end of the pipeline
    before △t. In line 18, we store the nodes in the trajectory of one mobile sensor;
    line 20 mergers the set of nodes and compute the fitness value (coverage ratio).
    4.2 A greedy algorithm for fog node placement In order to transfer the information
    which mobile sensors gathered, a set of fog nodes shall be deployed in the WDS.
    Here, we first establish a simple optimization model to maximize the collection
    of information at a given fixed number fog nodes. For simplification, we introduce
    a binary variable vi to indicate whether there is a fog node in the sensed path
    sp or not. That is, vi = 1 means there is a fog node on the node vi. ⌈sp(vi,j )⌉
    means the number of nodes that can transfer the information to datacenter when
    a fog node is deployed at the node vi in the jth sensing path (6) (7) (8) where
    S is the number of sensing paths by S mobile sensors and P is the given number
    of fog nodes. We need to deploy P fog nodes on the paths which mobile sensors
    passed through, thus to collect and transfer the information to datacenter as
    much as possible. Then, we propose a computation-efficient heuristic algorithm.
    The main idea is to first find a set of alternative nodes that include cross node
    and destination node, and then use a greedy method to screen from alternative
    nodes to maximize the received data. We name our algorithm as “mixed greedy algorithm,”
    which is briefly summarized in Algorithm 3. First, we get trajectory of each mobile
    sensor and the data of water distribution network. Then, we select the cross nodes
    of all paths and the end nodes of each path as the alternative solution altNodes
    (line 1). Next, define sinkNum as the number of sinks. For each node Ni ∈ altNodes,
    if there exists a node Nj ∈ netNodes and the mobile sensor has passed the node
    Ni after passing through the node Nj, we add node Nj to Ni node collection nodeSubset
    (line 7). The data transmitted by the sink includes the detection data of the
    node as sink. Therefore, we need to add the node as sink to the corresponding
    set of nodeSubset (line 12). For each nodeSubset, we calculate the total number
    of nodes that have not been collected. We then sort them in descending order and
    add the first node to the sink. Subsequently, we remove the node from the altNodes
    so as to avoid repeating the selection of current node. For each node Ni ∈ netNodes,
    if the data of the node has been transmitted, we set its flag to false. While,
    if the node is not being collected, the sinkNum is reduced by one. If the sinkNum > 0,
    we return back to line 4; otherwise, we output the result. 5 EXPERIMENT RESULTS
    AND ANALYSIS In the experiment, we deploy a fixed number of mobile sensors in
    a benchmark WDS, as shown in the Figure 2, which consists of 126 nodes, two tanks,
    one sources, and 168 pipes. The hydraulic time step is 30 minutes, and the water
    quality time step is 5 minutes. The total simulation time is 72 hours. Figure

    one source, two tanks, 168 pipes, two pumps, and eight valves [Colour figure can
    be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The parameters of our proposed algorithm
    are listed in Table 3. Here, the crossover probability is 0.95 and mutation probability
    is 0.1; this means the crossover operator is the most likely to occur; on the
    contrary, mutation operator occurs with low frequency. A high probability of mutation
    operator will result in the instability of optimization algorithm. The elite strategy
    means that two individuals are copied in the new generation without applying any
    kind of change. However, these individuals can be selected by fitness ranking
    guaranteeing that the bests are really saved. The population size is 100 and evolution
    generation is 200, which means 20 000 evaluations of fitness function will be
    performed in one run. Table 3. Parameters of genetic algorithm Crossover probability

    Table 4 shows the optimal insertion location and time with five mobile sensors
    in WDS. In order to reveal the effectiveness, our algorithm is compared with a
    Monte Carlo Sampling method. In Table 4, we can see that the maximum coverage
    ratio by our algorithm is 0.410853; in the meanwhile, the maximum coverage ratio
    by Monte Carlo random sampling (size of sample is 20 000) is 0.317829. In Figure
    3, we can see that the coverage ratio gets bigger along with the number of evolution
    generation increases. However, it does not obviously get bigger in the last 100
    evolutionary generations. It means that genetic algorithm may fall into a local
    optima or has obtained the optimal solution. Table 4. Solution for five sensors

    increases 5.2 Result for fog nodes and their optimal layout In order to transfer
    the information collected by mobile sensors, Algorithm 3 is used to compute the
    layout of fog nodes. Given a fixed number of fog nodes, we wish that the layout
    of fog nodes can cover more nodes in the mobile sensors'' trajectories. In Figure
    4, there are 5 fog nodes (black pentacle) and five mobile sensors'' trajectories.
    We can see that all the fog nodes are deployed on the terminal nodes of mobile
    sensors'' paths. Thus, they can cover more nodes on the sensors'' trajectories.

    terminal nodes or cross nodes of sensors'' trajectories. Figure 5 Open in figure

    5.3 Impact of the increasing mobile sensors It is obvious that more mobile sensors
    will traverse more nodes, leading to the increase of coverage ratio. In Figure
    6, blue line with the marker ∘ and red line with marker ∗ show the relationship
    between the number of sensors and coverage ratio. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Coverage rate versus number of mobile sensors [Colour figure can be
    viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Figure 6 clearly shows that the coverage ratio
    monotonically increases as the number of mobile sensors. We can also find our
    proposed algorithm performs more effective than Monte Carlo method. When the number
    of sensors is up to 45, the coverage ratio is 93.6%. After the number of sensors
    reaches 52, there will be 100% of coverage ratio. 5.4 Impact of movement patterns
    of mobile sensors As mobile sensors are carried by the water flow, in each junction
    connecting two or more pipes, they may turn to any one of the outlet piles. Thus,
    although sensors released at the same time and the same location, they may take
    a number of possible paths. In our experiment, we assume that sensors will flow
    down the pipe with the highest velocity. Actually, there is some uncertainty in
    the sensor''s route in the junction nodes. In this section, we compare deterministic
    movement pattern to random movement pattern. Deterministic movement means that
    mobile sensors will flow down to pipe with the highest flow velocity, and random
    movement means that mobile sensors will flow down to pipe with a random flow velocity.
    From Figure 7, we surprisingly find that the random movement in the genetic algorithm
    will make mobile sensors travel more junction nodes, gaining a much bigger coverage
    ratio. This reveals that mobile sensor with random movement can explore more space
    than sensor with deterministic movement. On the contrary, for Monte Carlo sampling
    algorithm, deterministic movement behaves better than random movement. Figure
    7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Different movement pattern will have an impact
    on the coverage ratio [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    5.5 Impact of the battery lifetime of mobile sensors For the wireless mobile sensor,
    battery lifetime is a key factor for all the monitoring system. In our experiment,
    we assume that mobile sensors are equipped with a battery or energy harvesting
    system to provide sufficient power for collecting and transmitting the sampling
    data. Actually, a long battery lifetime makes mobile sensors have the ability
    of sampling more data, consequently decreasing the cost of mobile sensors. In
    our experiment, we assume that battery lifetime is 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours,
    48 hours, 60 hours, and 72 hours. From Figures 8 and 9, we can see that, no matter
    what the algorithm is, the shorter of battery lifetime is, the smaller of the
    coverage ratio is. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Different battery

    we have considered the problem of using mobile sensors and fog nodes to monitor
    water distribution networks for leakage detection. We first analyze mobile sensor
    placement problem, and then establish a formal description to the optimization
    problem on sensor and fog node placement. Finally, we propose a customized genetic
    algorithm and a greedy algorithm. Simulation and analysis results show the feasibility
    and efficiency of our proposed algorithm . As an initial work on the joint optimization
    of fog node and mobile sensor placement for leakage detection in WDS, based on
    our work, we have also identified several issues to be investigated in future
    studies with the following being noteworthy. Investigation of the robustness of
    the proposed algorithm by applying it to a larger scale drinking water distribution
    networks. Incorporation of the ability of sensors and accuracy of the hydraulic
    model into the proposed algorithm for realistic applications. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Nowadays, applications for the Internet of Things (IoT) have been introduced in
    different fields of medicine to provide more efficient medical services to the
    patients. A systematic mapping study was conducted to answer ten research questions
    with the purposes of identifying and classifying the present medical IoT technological
    features as well as recognizing the opportunities for future developments. We
    reviewed how cloud, wearable technologies, wireless communication technologies,
    messaging protocols, security methods, development boards, microcontrollers, mobile/IoT
    operating systems, and programming languages have been engaged in medical IoT.
    Based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, 89 papers, published between 2000
    and 2018, were screened and selected. It was found that IoT studies, with a publication
    rise between 2015 and 2018, predominantly dealt with the following IoT features:
    (a) wearable sensor types of chiefly accelerometer and ECG placed on 16 different
    body parts, especially the wrist (33%) and the chest (21%) or implanted on the
    bone; (b) wireless communication technologies of Bluetooth, cellular networks,
    and Wi-Fi; (c) messaging protocols of mostly MQTT; (d) utilizing cloud for both
    storing and analyzing data; (e) the security methods of encryption, authentication,
    watermark, and error control; (f) the microcontrollers belonging to Atmel ATmega
    and ARM Cortex-M3 families; (g) Android as the commonly used mobile operating
    system and TinyOS and ContikiOS as the commonly used IoT operating systems; (h)
    Arduino and Raspberry Pi development boards; and finally (i) MATLAB as the most
    frequently employed programming language in validation research. The identified
    gaps/opportunities for future exploration are, namely, employment of fog/edge
    computing in storage and processing big data, the overlooked efficient features
    of CoAP messaging protocol, the unnoticed advantages of AVR Xmega and Cortex-M
    microcontroller families, employment of the programming languages of Python for
    its significant capabilities in evaluation and validation research, development
    of the applications being supported by the mobile/IoT operating systems in order
    to provide connection possibility among all IoT devices in medicine, exploiting
    wireless communication technologies such as BLE, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, NFC, and 5G
    to reduce power consumption and costs, and finally uncovering the security methods,
    usually used in IoT applications, in order to make other applications more trustworthy.
    1. Introduction Connected “things” to the Internet have increased exponentially
    in recent years [ 1, 2]. The devices can be identified and controlled via a new
    Internet called IoT. This new Internet integrates physical and virtual world things
    to improve the quality of human life and provides better services [ 3– 5]. Physical
    things, such as devices and tools, have abilities of sensing, actuating, and interconnecting
    while virtual things, such as multimedia content and software applications, can
    be stored, processed, and accessed [ 6]. The things can be identified with the
    EPC (Electronic Product Code) and integrated via the Internet [ 7]. Today, thanks
    to widely available technologies such as communication technologies and smart
    portable devices, IoT has become one of the hottest topics in all areas [ 8],
    particularly in healthcare, which is estimated to engage 40% of IoT devices by
    2020 [ 2]. Due to the prevalence of ICT (Information and Communication Technology)
    in healthcare industry, equal provision of healthcare services for patients has
    increased widely having enhanced the utilization of healthcare resources [ 5].
    In healthcare, therefore, sensor and communication technologies, integrated by
    IoT, are attempting to enhance traditional communication with the patients to
    provide more efficient health services [ 9]. In most research studies, on the
    other hand, the use of IoT in the areas such as combining wireless physiological
    sensors and smart mobile devices in daily activities, health monitoring, locating
    and tracking health-related things, diagnosis, and collaboration is investigated
    [ 10]. In order to increase patient empowerment, IoT is attempting to move healthcare
    from being centralized to lateralization, i.e., to e-health. There is a trend
    to shift medical services from centers to homes, especially for the elderly or
    the disabled, in order to budget time and reduce medical costs [ 4]. However,
    the technological features which are commonly used in current medical IoT applications
    are not evidently clear to all. In other words, the available capabilities or
    shortages of the features of medical IoT applications have not yet been investigated.
    It is, therefore, necessary to shed light on the current technological features
    of IoT in medicine through scrutinizing the relevant medical IoT literature. Such
    study can illuminate the current advances as well as the gaps and opportunities
    for future progresses. A need is thus evident for a review study to find out the
    current technological features of IoT applications in medicine. The present study
    is, thus, an attempt to systematically map the nature of the IoT technological
    features used in medical areas through analyzing the related literature. It has
    been designed to provide an overview of medical IoT research area through producing
    classifications and counting contributions in relation to the categories found
    in those classifications [ 11]. The results of this study can be beneficial for
    various medical IoT stakeholders, such as researchers intending to carry out primary
    or secondary studies in medical IoT-related fields, interested postgraduate candidates
    in medical sciences, and medical IoT developers. Pioneers in the field can also
    take advantage of the gaps inserted at the end of the current study. 2. Materials
    and Methods This review study is systematic mapping in nature. A systematic mapping
    review is usually used to support further research, most commonly the systematic
    reviews, and is intended to classify the primary research studies in a specific
    field [ 12]. In other words, a mapping review study is the starting point for
    a researcher to conduct a related primary study or a systematic review by shedding
    light on the pursued knowledge. While a systematic review study, pertinent to
    ours, would be used to identify, evaluate, and interpret all relevant research
    [ 13], the present study, however, has systematically reviewed the relevant papers,
    published between 2000 and 2018, aiming at identifying and classifying the above-mentioned
    features in medical IoT applications and specifying knowledge gaps in the field.
    Figure 1 shows the processes followed in conducting this study.    Figure 1  Mapping
    study workflow [ 14]. 2.1. Research Questions As several technologies, protocols,
    and hardware/software components are involved in the development of IoT applications,
    ten research questions related to major features of IoT applications were chosen
    to be the focus of the current review study. The relevance between each research
    question and the related information provided in the previous review studies and
    the significance of our study pertinent to each question have all been presented
    below. 2.1.1. Annual Publication Trend (RQ 1) What is the annual trend of studies
    in medical IoT? The distribution of the relevant articles by publication year—from
    2010 to 2016—was investigated [ 15]. We have extended the years and included medical
    IoT studies until the end of 2018. 2.1.2. Wearable Technology (RQ 2) How did medical
    IoT studies deal with wearable technology? Wearable IoT devices are used in medicine
    as sensors attached to the body to monitor the health of the patients [ 16]. Various
    sensors embedded in some of these devices can measure a variety of signals or
    parameters (physiological, environmental, or motion) [ 17– 20]. Our purpose of
    probing this idea was to discover the extent of the presence of wearable IoT devices
    in medicine and, finally, how these devices are attached to the body. 2.1.3. The
    Cloud (RQ 3) How was the cloud involved in medical IoT? Purchase or design of
    system with high computational power would be extremely expensive and energy intensive.
    Some services such as storage and data processing are, therefore, performed via
    cloud. Cloud computing has virtually unlimited storage and processing capabilities,
    is a much more advanced technology, and has partially addressed most of the IoT
    issues [ 21]. Recent advances in IoT and cloud computing make it possible to develop
    a smart medical system that allows remote continuous monitoring of patients in
    a seamless and unobtrusive manner [ 22]. One review study has reviewed the use
    of cloud in medicine in real-time data capture and processing, data visualization,
    cloud service type, and data analytics [ 15]. Another study has conducted a qualitative
    analysis of the use of cloud in healthcare [ 20]. We have, nevertheless, explored
    the frequency of studies having used the available servers (such as Microsoft
    and Amazon) utilizing either storage or processing cloud service types. 2.1.4.
    Wireless Communication Technologies (RQ 4) How have wireless communication technologies
    been engaged in medical IoT? Wireless communication technologies, as an integral
    part of IoT, are used to connect IoT devices [ 2, 23]. Major forms of these technologies
    are RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification), NFC (Near-Field Communications), Infrared
    (IR), Z-Wave, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN,Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and cellular networks [ 23,
    24]. One review study has divided communication technologies into short-ranged
    and long-ranged ones and has reviewed their standards in healthcare IoT studies
    [ 20]. Another paper has presented the studies in terms of the existing wireless
    communication technologies without any classification [ 15]. However, we have
    detected the communication technologies and the frequency of their existing siblings
    in order to provide the required information for the interested scholars. 2.1.5.
    Messaging Protocols (RQ 5) Which messaging protocols have been used for medical
    IoT? When data are to be transferred between two devices via a data channel, each
    device must have an appropriate network interface to allow it to communicate across
    the channel. The devices and their network interfaces use a protocol to generate
    data that is transmitted over a channel so that it can be decoded by the receiver
    [ 25]. The most frequently used application-layer messaging protocols in IoT are,
    namely, MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and CoAP (Constrained Application
    Protocol) [ 26]. The limitation that we saw in the literature of IoT messaging
    protocols was that only one review study has illustrated the papers having used
    IoT protocols in healthcare until 2016 [ 15]. The current study has, therefore,
    endeavored to extend the search to 2018 while having tried to carry out a more
    rigorous search in medical area. 2.1.6. Security Methods (RQ 6) How has security
    been dealt with in medical IoT? IoT devices are more vulnerable to different types
    of attacks on different layers of IoT architecture. There are studies concentrating
    on privacy and security issues and proposed solutions to address these issues
    [ 27– 29]. Privacy and security are particularly important for the health sector
    because of the sensitive nature of human life data [ 30]. In most distinctive
    review studies, different features of IoT security and privacy are identified
    and analyzed [ 13, 20], the studies having developed security mechanisms for healthcare
    applications are gathered [ 18], and finally, medical IoT issues of privacy and
    data protection are reviewed [ 19]. We, nonetheless, have tried to show the protection
    methods used in medical IoT literature. 2.1.7. Microcontrollers (RQ 7) Which microcontrollers
    are used in medical IoT? The microcontroller unit is a microchip containing the
    CPU, memory, and input/output peripherals. Enabling everything on the Internet
    to be accessible and controllable, microcontrollers are the key components for
    developing IoT applications [ 31]. Due to the high demands for IoT applications
    in medicine as well as the limitations of the present ones, the patients’ desires
    are not fully satisfied. So, some of the customers have shown tendency to develop
    their own IoT application using open platforms. To fulfill these needs, there
    are various microcontrollers and development boards for different purposes [ 32].
    Having not detected any previous review study dealing with this question, we attempted
    to report the most capable, appropriate, and frequently used types of microcontroller
    and their families in order to recognize the ones used in medicine. 2.1.8. Development
    Boards (RQ 8) What are the proportions of use of development boards in medical
    IoT? IoT development boards include microcontrollers or processors, memory, programmable
    input/output, and communication components. No study on this research question
    was found. We were thus interested in learning about the more preferred development
    boards applied in medical IoT to grasp the reasons behind the choices. In order
    to meet the requirements of any IoT functions, choosing the right development
    board to prototype an IoT application, project, or product is a vital step [ 32].
    2.1.9. Mobile/IoT Operating Systems (OSs) (RQ 9) How has mobile/IoT OS been employed
    in medical IoT? Mobile/IoT OS works as a management and interface agent for smart
    portable devices such as smartphones, smart watches, and IoT devices that can
    be used for interfacing sensors to measure health parameters. Android, iOS, and
    Windows are mobile OSs for smartphones, tablets, smart watches, and other mobile
    devices. Things in IoT have an embedded OS that could be run on low-powered IoT
    devices. A study was found reviewing different IoT OSs such as TinyOS, ContikiOS,
    RIOT, MbedOS, Zephyr, and Brillo [ 33] but is not focused on medical IoT devices.
    We found it essential to identify the mobile/IoT OSs used more frequently in medicine.
    Thanks to possessing unique addresses, displays, sensors, and wireless communication
    technologies that enable mobile devices to be used as hubs or access centers,
    smartphones enjoy a distinctive status among other IoT applications [ 32]. 2.1.10.
    Programming Languages (RQ 10) What are the usage proportions of the programming
    languages in medical IoT? A wide range of programming languages, such as C, Python,
    C++, and Java, can be used for the development of IoT applications. Since each
    language plays a specific role in the development and management of the applications,
    it seems that the use of the right language for specific purposes has become a
    matter of concern [ 32]. This question shows which programming languages are more
    involved in the development and use of medical IoT applications. Concerning the
    absence of a review study in this regard, it was intended to identify the type(s)
    of the programming language(s) which are more frequently used in medical IoT applications
    in order to pinpoint the more compatible ones in this filed. 2.2. Inclusion-Exclusion
    Criteria The articles were included based on specific criteria as follows: (1)
    the articles in English related to implementation and deployment of IoT in medicine
    addressing a specific disease or a medical field and (2) the articles in English
    pursuing validation and evaluation research methods among several research facets
    in software engineering such as solution proposals, validation research, evaluation
    research, and experience articles in medical subfields. However, the papers having
    the following criteria were excluded from the study: (1) the articles having focused
    on sensor issues and energy saving in IoT systems, (2) the articles related to
    IoT in nursing, nutrition, fall detection, ambient assisted living (AAL), drugs,
    and emergency care, (3) review and conference articles on medical IoT, and (4)
    the medical IoT articles for which the full texts were not available. 2.3. Search
    Strategy and Data Sources Our search for the relevant papers consisted of the
    activities of identifying the keywords, formulating the search strategy, and selecting
    data sources. The keywords were identified, and the required search strategy was
    developed using the content of the main research questions. After a preliminary
    search, the keywords were refined. In several iterations, we combined some keywords
    until we found an appropriate set of keywords. Keywords and synonyms were grouped
    into two sets and the search strategy was formulated as follows: [(Set1) AND (Set2)]
    that Set1 is [medical OR medicine OR medication OR health OR healthcare OR hospital
    OR clinical OR clinic OR disease] and Set2 is [“Internet of Things” OR IoT]. Due
    to the introduction of IoT at the beginning of the 21st century, the published
    papers between 2000 and 2018 were included in our study. As an interdisciplinary
    subject matter, IoT topics were searched in high-quality journals related to both
    engineering and medicine. To find the relevant papers, we searched the related
    ones published in major online academic databases including IEEE Xplore, Web of
    Science, Scopus, and PubMed. In each database, searches were performed in the
    title, abstract, and keywords (Table 1). Table 1  Search strategy for each database.
    2.4. Collection of Studies To answer the research questions, we collected the
    related studies. The flow diagram in Figure 2 shows the identification and selection
    processes in our study. Due to our wide research questions, which is a natural
    feature of this type of study [ 34], the number of the extracted papers was found
    to be relatively large, i.e., 3679 ones. We used Mendeley as reference management
    software to organize the papers. After identifying and removing duplicate papers,
    2009 papers remained among which the selection process began. Study selection
    consisted of two screening steps. In the first step, two of the present authors
    independently reviewed the titles and the abstracts to identify more relevant
    papers against our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Only when an article received
    two negative votes, it was excluded from the study. In this step, 1808 papers
    were excluded. Then, the authors read the full text of the remaining papers based
    on inclusion/exclusion criteria and excluded the irrelevant papers (). Finally,
    89 papers were included in our study.    Figure 2  The flow diagram of study selection
    processes. 2.5. Data Extraction In this section, the full text of the selected
    articles was studied in order to gather the data needed to answer each research
    question. To collect the data, we designed an extraction form in Microsoft Excel.
    The data extracted from 89 selected studies was collected manually by two of the
    authors and inserted in the extraction form (Table 2). Table 2  Data extraction
    results. 3. Results The results of each question were classified, analyzed, and
    then illustrated as tabular or visual representations. Various types of plots
    and diagrams were used to map the findings to better understand the trends of
    field studies. 3.1. Annual Publication Trend (RQ 1) Figure 3 shows the annual
    trend of medical IoT studies between 2000 and 2019. From 2000 to 2013, almost
    a plateau was observed in the production of medical IoT research. However, there
    is an exponential increase in publication between 2013 and 2019. Figure 4 shows
    the distribution of the selected studies in this field between 2011 and 2018.
    There is a sharp increase in publications ranging from 3 to 44 between 2015 and
    2018.    Figure 3  Publication trend in four databases (2000-2019).    Figure
    4  Annual publication trend of IoT in medicine. 3.2. Wearable Technology (RQ 2)
    The results showed that more than half of the papers (46 out of 89) had contributed
    to wearable technology in medicine. Based on the findings in Table 3, the most
    frequently investigated types of wearable sensors were related to accelerator,
    ECG, and thermometer which were studied in 14, 11, and 7 papers, respectively.
    Apart from some articles having missed to state both their sensor types and the
    measuring parameters (), it is observed that, totally, 21 IoT sensor types have
    been studied in medicine. However, as the parameters being measured were not clear
    in two papers, a general term, i.e., physiological sensor, has been assigned to
    them (Table 3). Table 3  Wearable sensors. Due to the importance of wearable IoT
    applications, Figures 5 and 6 have been prepared to reveal details about these
    devices in medicine. In Figure 5, in a hierarchy plot from inner to outer layers,
    focus starts from the sensor types in the innermost layer, the body parts in the
    middle layer, and the wearable devices in the outer layer. Figure 6 demonstrates
    the wearable sensors and devices which can be attached to or embedded in the body
    parts. It is also observed that the most commonly used body parts of the body
    used by IoT sensors were the wrist and the chest being examined in 25 and 18 selected
    studies, respectively. The most commonly used sensors were accelerometers and
    ECG, while the former has been used prominently in the wrist (in 7 out of 18 studies)
    and the latter has been adopted in the chest (in 9 out of 12 studies).    Figure
    5  Hierarchy diagram (from inside to outside) of the sensor types, the engaged
    parts of the body, and the wearable devices.    Figure 6  Wearable sensors and
    devises attached to or implanted in the body. The wearable IoT applications, designed
    for different purposes, are accordingly placed in specific parts of the body.
    Figure 6 shows that these applications are either placed on the body—such as a
    heart rate sensor set in a smart watch—or are implanted inside the body such as
    internal or external bone fixators. Some wearable IoT devices can be positioned
    in various parts of the body to measure the same parameter. For example, heart
    rate sensors can be placed either on the wrist or on the chest. Among these IoT
    types, accelerometers have shown to be adequately flexible of being used in several
    parts of the body. 3.3. Wireless Communication Technologies (RQ 3) Figure 7 shows
    that the main wireless communication standards such as Bluetooth, cellular networks,
    and Wi-Fi probed in 47, 40, and 33 papers, respectively, have been used more than
    the other ones in medical IoT applications. Among the short-ranged communication
    standards, the classic Bluetooth () has been employed considerably more than the
    other ones. Among the cellular networks, 3G and 4G have been used more than others
    probably due to their faster data transition speeds [ 122].    Figure 7  Frequency
    and classification of communication technologies. 3.4. Messaging Protocols (RQ
    4) According to Figure 8, the number of 14 papers has been involved with messaging
    protocols of which seven and six papers have used MQTT and REST, respectively.
    Only one article has employed CoAP.    Figure 8  Messaging protocols used in the
    related studies. 3.5. The Cloud (RQ5) More than half of the included studies (54
    out of 89 studies) have presented the deployment of medical IoT applications in
    cloud, but 39 studies have not specified the servers they have utilized. Moreover,
    the majority of these studies () have taken advantage of both data storage and
    analysis in cloud (Table 4). Our review of the articles also showed that 8 articles
    used edge/fog computing as storage and computing systems allow data produced by
    IoT devices to be stored and processed close to IoT devices. Table 4  Cloud services
    and servers. 3.6. Security Methods (RQ 6) Of the 21 papers having referred to
    security in IoT applications, five ones have not stated the security method they
    have applied. In Figure 9, the squares in the inner layer show the reference numbers
    of the articles. The outer layer, i.e., the rectangles, accounts for 17 security
    methods used by the IoT applications in the articles. Arrows showed the relationship
    between the articles and the security methods they used. Some articles have applied
    more than one security method. It is also seen that the HTTPS as a transferring
    protocol and CoAPS as messaging protocols, being used in five and one articles,
    respectively, have provided security in six articles as well.    Figure 9  Security
    methods used in studies [ 26, 39, 41, 56, 68, 79, 80, 94, 97, 100, 102, 108, 112,
    114, 116, 121]. It was also observed that the security methods, explained in the
    papers, have had different security functions including encryption, authentication,
    watermarking, and error control. The colors of the rectangles have been associated
    with the types of the security functions performed. There are papers in which
    the simultaneous functions of authentication and encryption have been performed
    by the security methods (the green rectangles). In Figure 9, it is also seen that
    the encryption function (the yellow rectangles) has been utilized more than the
    other functions in the IoT uses presented in the selected papers. According to
    the figure, AES/CBC security method (with two different versions of 128- and 256-bit
    keys) is the most frequently used type of security method employed in four selected
    papers. 3.7. Microcontrollers (RQ 7) Figure 10 shows the microcontrollers and
    their companies. ATmega328P from the megaAVR family and STM32F107 from the ARM
    Cortex-M3 family were the most common microcontrollers used in IoT applications
    in medicine.    Figure 10  The microcontrollers used in medical IoT in and their
    manufacturing companies. 3.8. Development Boards (RQ 8) Figure 11 shows the development
    boards used in medical IoT applications. It was found that in the 28 selected
    studies, Arduino and Raspberry were the most preferred development boards in medical
    IoT applications.    Figure 11  Development boards. 3.9. Mobile/IoT OS (RQ 9)
    In this study, 32 of the 89 papers reported the mobile/IoT operating systems employed
    in medical IoT applications. It was found that Android, iOS, and Windows have
    been identified as the major mobile OS and TinyOS and ContikiOS have been employed
    for medical IoT applications. Figure 12 shows that some of the medical IoT applications
    are based on one or two mobile operating systems. Multiple operating systems may
    be used in some applications, for example, five papers employed iOS and Android,
    two papers used Windows and Android, and two papers used ContikiOS and Android
    for their IoT applications.    Figure 12  Usage share of mobile operating systems.
    3.10. Programming Languages (RQ 10) Figure 13 shows programming languages and
    their contribution in medical IoT. It was found that MATLAB was the most widely
    used programming language in the papers (). The other most favored languages in
    terms of the magnitude of their frequency use were shown to be Python, C, and
    Java, being used 7, 6, and 6, respectively.    Figure 13  Programming languages.
    4. Discussion The results of the current study, aimed at finding out the current
    features of IoT applications in medicine by means of answering 10 research questions,
    were previously mapped into the tables and figures in Results. 4.1. Medical IoT
    Model A synthesized model of our findings has been presented in Figure 14 due
    to the depth of the details. Having rearranged the results of the study, this
    figure has divided the recognized IoT features in medicine into four layers, namely,
    devices and sensors, networks, cloud servers, and applications.    Figure 14  A
    synthetized model to show the relationships among the study outcomes. 4.1.1. Device
    and Sensor Layer Our findings on IoT devices in medicine consisted of a variety
    of wearable devices that can be used in the diagnosis, treatment, and control
    of patients’ activities. These devices, which are noninvasive in nature, are either
    implanted inside the body—such as the fixators mounted on the bones—or are mostly
    attached on the body parts, chiefly on the wrist or the chest. As the data derived
    from the sensors is raw and unintelligible, it is gathered by the sensor nodes
    and then transmitted to the computing server by means of smartphones, development
    boards, and microcontrollers. Arduino and Raspberry have been the most investigated
    development boards while Raspberry Pi is used as a single-board computer in complex
    projects, but Arduino is a microcontroller motherboard. According to a comparison
    made among the cutting-edge development board models, Raspberry Pi 3, apart from
    its greater power consumption, is less expensive than Arduino and enjoys larger
    memory as well as more supportive communication and connectivity capabilities
    [ 32]. Microcontrollers, having appropriate hardware and computing capabilities
    for processing data and controlling the devices, are the integral part of IoT
    devices. According to the results, the most common microcontrollers used in medical
    IoT applications are ATmega328p microchip and STM32F107 from megaAVR and Cortex-M3
    families, respectively, owing most probably to the high performance and low energy
    consumption of the former and low-power demand of the latter. It is worth mentioning
    that microcontrollers belonging to AVR Xmega family possess all the features related
    to those of megaAVR family, with even more competencies, including delivering
    the best possible combination of real-time performance, high integration, and
    low power consumption for 8/16-bit MCU applications [ 123]. As only one of the
    selected studies has worked on AVR Xmega microcontroller family, it seems that
    the advantages of these family members are not clearly known to the producers.
    Another important finding was that although both Cortex-A and Cortex-M microcontroller
    families are appropriate for IoT applications, especially for the wearable devices
    [ 124], our results show that the selected papers in our study have used only
    from Cortex-M family microcontrollers. End users can develop their IoT applications
    by programming the embedded microcontrollers and development boards or software
    of the applications using programming languages that have been found to be significantly
    MATLAB, Python, Java, and C. This finding can be attributable to MATLAB as a multiparadigm
    numerical computing environment with a proprietary programming language and its
    other distinguishing features, namely, multipurpose functionality and a variety
    of available tools. On the other hand, Python is an interpretable, interactive,
    object-oriented programming language with prettier syntax and more readability
    without compromising the size [ 125]. Nevertheless, taking some surveys into account,
    their findings are not in line with ours, as C and Java have shown to be used
    more frequently [ 126, 127] so much so that in IoT developer survey [ 126], MATLAB
    was not investigated as a programming language at all. Of the languages mentioned
    above, Python is the fastest growing language with the contribution rate of 1.5
    [ 128]. Proposing various wearable devices in more than half of our selected papers
    testifies the fact that their use for continuous monitoring of physical and psychological
    behavior of the patients in order to efficiently improve the quality of care [
    129] has recently been recognized medically and socially. The magnitude of our
    selected articles working on wearable devices compared to those in the related
    literature [ 17, 18, 20] can be attributable, on the one hand, to the systematic
    mapping design of our study which normally necessitates a large data and, on the
    other hand, to the absence of any limitation in our included sensors. Unlike our
    study, Scarpato et al. [ 19] have scrutinized only the wearable sensors related
    to heart rate monitoring, diabetes, and oxygen saturation pulmonary disease and
    Baker et al. [ 20] have focused only on nonobtrusive and noninvasive sensors.
    Although Islam et al. [ 18] have not mentioned any limitations in their study,
    the number of the sensors studied was much less than those in our study. Neither
    of these studies has examined the implantable sensors. Qi et al. [ 17], while
    having classified the sensors as wearable and ambient, have studied only 11 sensors.
    4.1.2. Network Layer In our synthesized findings, a variety of short-ranged and
    long-ranged communication technologies and standards are available to provide
    wireless connections between and among the sensors and the IoT devices. Due to
    the limitation of storage and processing of mobile phones, the data collected
    is transferred to the cloud via gateways through short-ranged communication technologies
    such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and long-ranged communication such as cellular networks.
    About one-third of the papers pointed to security. Some of the papers have proposed
    solutions for security issues because privacy and security are important concerns
    that IoT applications in healthcare need to pay serious attention to [ 15, 18,
    27, 28]. Based on the IoT developer survey, security, interoperability, and connectivity
    are the top three concerns of IoT [ 126]. According to our findings, the HTTPS
    and CoAP messaging protocols are also seen as security methods. To justify this
    capability, HTTPS is actually a secured form of HTTP that uses Transfer Layer
    Security (TSL) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols to encrypt data sessions
    [ 26]. On the other hand, CoAP uses Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as
    a security protocol for automatic key management, data encryption, integrity protection,
    and authentication [ 130]. Our findings related to the outnumbering of the encryption
    function of the security methods in the selected medical IoT papers can designate
    the importance of confidentiality in medicine witnessing that unauthorized users
    are unable to access the patient health information. On the other hand, the findings
    denoting the outnumbering of AES over other security methods used in the papers
    can also stand for the attention is usually paid to health data because this method
    was firstly published by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) to encrypt sensitive data [ 131]. The reason why, in medicine, classic
    Bluetooth is a more frequently investigated short-ranged wireless communication
    technology compared to Wi-Fi can be attributable to the more availability and
    accessibility as well as the existence of a more personal area network for the
    former over the latter. On the other hand, exchanging data in IoT by Bluetooth
    mostly occurs by means of smart watches and mobile phones probably making this
    technology the most debated form of IoT in the literature. Unlike this finding
    in our study, in Ahmadi et al. [ 15], Wi-Fi was found to be focused more frequently
    in their selected studies compared with classic Bluetooth. This difference could
    be the result of the smaller number of selected papers in their study () compared
    with those of ours (). Yet, regarding long-range wireless communication technologies,
    Ahmadi et al. [ 15], similarly, found that cellular network was the most frequently
    probed one. Our finding on 4G, as the most explored network in medical IoT applications,
    can be indicative of its higher speed and bandwidth in transferring a variety
    of data including texts, images, and audio/video files. 4.1.3. Cloud Server Layer
    Storage and computing functionalities are moving from end devices to centralized
    data and computing centers. High capacity of cloud in both computing and storage
    of data can illuminate the reason why in our study about 60% of the selected studies
    have used cloud for both storage and computing. This finding agrees with that
    of Ahmadi et al. [ 15] showing that the majority of their selected papers have
    used cloud for the same purposes. This finding can stand for the ubiquitous use
    of this technology due to its multifunctional features. The fact that in a considerable
    number of the selected studies the cloud servers were not mentioned may be regarded
    as a flaw because the more information we provide about the methodology of the
    research, the better understanding and appreciation as well as easier replicability
    occurs on the part of the readers. The cloud has some shortcomings in handling
    big data such as response delays and network loads [ 132]. Due to the exploding
    volume of data collected from IoT devices, it is necessary to use fog/edge computing
    to extend the cloud by performing intermediary functions at the edge of the network.
    Fog/edge computing reduces latency problems by minimizing dependence on cloud-based
    services to analyze data. Because medical IoT applications require a rapid processing
    of medical data as well as storage, fog/edge computing provides IoT developers
    with real-time analysis of medical data. The results of this study showed that
    9% of the studies were based on fog/edge computing. Based on the role of fog/edge
    computing in alleviating some of the problems of cloud-based IoT applications,
    IoT developers should be more involved with these technologies. 4.1.4. Application
    Layer MQTT, REST, and CoAP protocols have been used to transfer data among IoT
    devices. To use these protocols, brokers (servers) that are primarily located
    in the cloud are needed. The more tendency or need for conducting research on
    HTTP compared with the other transfer protocols might be due to its popularity
    in the web. Largeness of messages in HTTP has caused this protocol to require
    high bandwidth while it is crucial for IoT applications to communicate with low
    bandwidth. On the other hand, IoT needs a long-lived connection. To fulfill these
    requirements, MQTT and CoAP have been presented in IoT with less latency of data
    transmission and communications overheads. These protocols are very useful for
    large data or low bandwidth [ 26, 107] or, especially, for continuous real-time
    monitoring [ 107]. Nevertheless, CoAP has some advantages over MQTT as the latter
    works based on publish/subscribe mechanism, while the former uses the two mechanisms
    of request/response and publish/subscribe and is usually used when the application
    has limitation in energy consumption. Moreover, CoAP can be translated into RESTful
    web and HTTP by using proxies in order to be able to work on the web. CoAP uses
    URI (Universal Resource Identifier), and unlike MQTT and HTTP, CoAP works on UDP
    (User Datagram Protocol) which enables the application to connect to unlimited
    number of networks [ 26]. However, despite providing less message size, message
    overhead, power consumption, resource requirement, bandwidth, and latency while
    offering better support for security and additional services, CoAP has been used
    less than MQTT in IoT [ 26]. Our finding concerning the trivial research attention
    made on using CoAP messaging protocol verifies the same tendency of the users.
    The fact that more than half of our selected papers have used Android as their
    operating system could be due to the fact that Android is an open source platform
    with high customization and low cost capabilities [ 133]. The 40% market share
    of Android uses [ 133] is in line with our finding. The next popular operating
    system, iOS, is, however, a close and limited platform. Contiki is widely used
    by IoT researchers or developers for memory-constrained and low-power IoT devices.
    TinyOS is an embedded operating system for low-power wireless devices and wireless
    sensor networks (WSN) [ 33]. 4.2. Annual Publication Trend The dramatic increase
    in medical IoT papers from 2015 to 2018 shows that publication has steadily increased
    every year. As a result of the emergence of more IoT applications, an increase
    is seen in the number of publications ranging from 987 to 1688 papers between
    2018 and 2019. Our findings generally call attention to the fact that IoT in medicine
    is still a hot topic with various aspects which entail more scrutiny. 4.3. Limitations
    of Our Study We encountered two limitations in our study. (1) Quality assessment
    was not carried out for the selected papers for two reasons: (a) this step is
    optional in systematic mapping studies, not compulsory; (b) we did not want to
    miss any attempts having been made on studying the technological aspects of medical
    IoT development. (2) Manual searching in the reference lists of the selected articles
    was not carried out, and (3) working on this study started in 2018 and the time
    spent on its preparation and publishing lasted over one year. Thus, the 2019 related
    articles were not included since we had already reached the results and prepared
    the tabular and graphical illustrations. 5. Conclusions From the findings of our
    study, the following various gaps were noticed which could be the inspiring areas
    of research and activity for the interested scholars or the IoT developers in
    the field. (1) Security is of the utmost importance both in IoT devices and in
    medicine. As a tradeoff exists between security of an IoT device and its performance,
    more than one security method is occasionally used to enhance the IoT’s safety
    provided that this does not cause performance reduction. Despite the significance
    of the security methods, only 16 papers out of 89 have clarified this feature
    of the IoT(s) they have presented. This shortage can affect our general trust
    and reliance in a given IoT performance. We suggest that incorporation of the
    security method used in the description of any IoT development be inevitable.
    (2) Concerning different advantages of utilization of CoAP over MQTT discussed
    above, it is needed to scrutinize the reasons or find the ways to make more publicity
    on the former. (3) At least half of the medical IoT applications are cloud-based,
    showing that storage and computing are changing into centralized data centers.
    However, due to some problems attributed to the cloud, such as high latency and
    network overload, medical IoT applications are unable to run real-time analytics.
    Edge and fog computing are two potential solutions, but few studies have used
    these technologies in medical IoT applications. (4) Apart from TinyOS and ContikiOS—two
    major IoT operating systems for memory-constrained and low-power wireless IoT
    devices—that have been underused in medicine, other operating systems, such as
    RIOT, MbedOS, Brillo, and Zephyr, are not yet employed in medical IoT applications.
    (5) It is expected that IoT in medicine undergoes more substantial enhancements
    in the near future as increasing developments in wireless communication technologies
    are under way to reduce power consumption and costs. This can be fulfilled by
    increasing the use of newer technologies such as BLE, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, NFC, and
    5G. (6) Programming languages such as MATLAB, Python, Java, and C are being used
    for IoT developments in medicine. MATLAB is mainly used for scientific and technical
    computing in validation research. But Python language with its capability of being
    used both in evaluation and validation research enjoys even further advantages,
    namely, having substantial power and speed in information analysis and community
    and library support as well as being easy-to-learn, easy-to-debug, embeddable,
    extensible, interpretable, portable, and being a free and open source. (7) Last
    but not least, two almost unnoticed facts about microcontrollers are worthwhile
    to mention here: firstly, AVR Xmega family delivers the best possible combination
    of real-time performance, high integration, and low power consumption for 8/16-bit
    MCU, and secondly, apart from Cortex-M microcontroller family used in our selected
    papers, Cortex-A is also suitable for IoT uses. More considerations of these electronic
    chips are, therefore, recommended. Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no
    conflicts of interest. Acknowledgments This research was supported by a grant

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Semarang, Indonesia SECTION I. Introduction
    Greenhouse is a building which aims to modify the climate to meet the plants need.
    Greenhouse is generally used to produce crops outside the normal season [1]. The
    type of cover material in a greenhouse aims to make solar radiation easily absorbed
    by plants. Greenhouse cultivation method aims to make plants'' growth out of the
    natural environment and to make the environment control more optimal [2]. Greenhouse
    technology is used to provide a controlled microenvironment for optimal plant
    growth so that it can protect plants from unfavorable weather conditions [3].
    The control system needs to be done to control the environmental conditions of
    the greenhouse. The previous research which has been carried out by [4], in 2016
    on the greenhouse control system used fuzzy logic type Mamdani. Fuzzy logic type
    Mamdani is implemented to regulate the duration drip of plants to be more dynamic
    based on the the input values of greenhouse temperature and humidity [4]. The
    Mamdani control system is carried out to adjust the temperature and humidity in
    the greenhouse which refers to climate factors presented by the sigmoid curve
    [4]. Fuzzy logic type Mamdani is usually suited to intuitive problems rather that
    to handle control systems. The sigmoid curve has a weakness where the membership
    value range is equal to one shorter by [5] using cloud computing technology. Greenhouse
    automation systems controls temperature, humidity, soil moisture effectively [5].
    The system retrieve sensor acquisition data and send data to users through the
    cloud [5]. Cloud computing was designed using remote servers on the internet to
    manage, store and process data using a personal computer. Cloud computing has
    briefly transformed information technology dramatically by providing some enormous
    benefits for users of information technology, including eliminating information
    technology investments, scalability, proportional costs. However, cloud computing
    has a weakness: the more devices connected, the more network latency problems
    is experienced by the application [6]. Based on previous researches, [4] and [5],
    this study builds an information system using fuzzy rule-based to control and
    monitor climate parameters in fog-based greenhouses. Rule-based systems have benefit:
    the created rules can imitate human thinking and reasoning to facts that are known
    based on expert knowledge about the problems of a domain [7]. Fuzzy logic and
    rule based system can be combined to create rules that are very similar to natural
    languages, thus fuzzy rule-based can make information extracted from rules so
    that they are easier to understand [8]. Fuzzy rule-based systems can work in fog
    network and can provide problem information from the input provided [9]. The fuzzy
    rule-based system type Tsukamoto has the advantage of having high accuracy and
    high interpretation of data [10]. Fog computing is used as a computing paradigm
    between cloud data centers and IoT devices [11]. Fog uses a network device called
    fog node to process data collection form IoT so that it doesn''t experience network
    latency problems. Fog computing is a promising computing technology that is able
    to overcome network latency problems during the process of collecting data form
    IoT [6]. In this study, the fog network is able to handle network latency problems
    in real-time while sensor data acquisition, and bandwidth is more efficient compared
    to cloud networks. Fuzzy rule-based is implemented to determine the proper rule
    for trip duration which is appropriate with the data of temperature variable,
    soil moisture, humidity and intensity variable. The data of variables was obtained
    from the result of the greenhouse observation. Thus, the controlling system in
    greenhouse is more efficient and more superior that the previous research. SECTION
    II. Related Work A. Fuzzy Rule-Based Fuzzy rule-based basically comes from fuzzy
    logic and fuzzy set theory [12]. Fuzzy logic and rule-based system are combined
    into fuzzy rule-based. Three are three popular types of fuzzy rule-based, they
    are Mamdani, Sugeno, and Tsukamoto. Fuzzy rule-based generally applied to problems
    classification, such as output or discrete values. Fuzzy rule-based system are
    a classic rule system that is one of the most important fields of fuzzy set application
    and fuzzy logic [8]. Fuzzy rule-based systems are successfully applied to various
    problem in different domains in the uncertainty and obscurity of problems [10].
    Several forms of membership function are used in fuzzy rule-based, such as trapezoid,
    triangular and rectangular [8]. Trapezoid membership function can be seen as a
    generalizing triangle and rectangular membership function. At the testing stage,
    fuzzy classification involves five important steps namely fuzzification, application,
    implication, aggregation, and defuzzification. Triangle Fuzzy A[x], can be presented
    by A (a, b, c; 1) with the membership function μ [x] shown in Figure 1 [12]. Fig.
    1. Triangle fuzzy membership function [12]. Show All The formula for the triangle
    membership function is as follows [12]. μ[x]= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, (x−a)/(b−a), 1,
    (c−x)/(c−b),   x≤a or x≥c;         a≤x≤b;                x=b;         b≤x≤c. (1)
    View Source Trapezoid fuzzy shown in Figure 2. Fig. 2. Trapezoid fuzzy membership
    function [13]. Show All The formula for the trapezoid membership function is as
    follows [13]. f T (x)= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, (x−a)/(b−a), 1, (d−x)/(d−c), x≤a or x≥d;          a<x<b;           b≤x≤c;            c<x<d.
    (2) View Source B. Fog Computing As a new computing paradigm, fog computing is
    able to expand cloud computing and services to the network edge. Fog computing
    has several advantages dealing with computation, communication, control, storage
    and service on the edge of the network. The fact is that computational computing
    is an extension of cloud computing, not as a substitute for cloud computing [14].
    There are two categories of fog nodes namely Fog Gateway Nodes (FNG) and Fog Computational
    Nodes (FCN), as shown in Figure 3 [11]. Fig. 3. Fog organization [11]. Show All
    C. Greenhouse A greenhouse is a building that function to modify the climate based
    on plants'' need. Greenhouse is used to produce food crops and flowers outside
    the normal season. Greenhouses has similar structures with conservatories: the
    rooms that usually attached to houses provide living space for plants and humans
    [1]. The shape of a greenhouse is characterized into five different types. Greenhouses
    are most commonly used in hot and arid environments, namely Quonsets, arch-tunnels,
    even-span and uneven-span [17]. D. Chilies Chilies require temperature, soil moisture,
    air humidity, and optimal intensity. Chili plants can growth well at temperature
    of 20–30 °C, Soil moisture of 60-80%, air humidity from 50 to 70 and intensity
    of 3,000-10,000 [18]. SECTION III. Realization Fuzzy Rule-Based for System Controlling

    The simulation using fuzzy rule-based algorithm in PHP programming language obtained
    watering control can be done remotely and the duration of watering is also adjusted
    to the climate conditions in the greenhouse so that it can reduce the risk of
    dead plants due to the influence of uncertain climate factors. Authors Figures

  description: 'A smart campus is an intelligent infrastructure where smart sensors
    and actuators collaborate to collect information and interact with the machines,
    tools, and users of a university campus. As in a smart city, a smart campus represents
    a challenging scenario for Internet of Things (IoT) networks, especially in terms
    of cost, coverage, availability, latency, power consumption, and scalability.
    The technologies employed so far to cope with such a scenario are not yet able
    to manage simultaneously all the previously mentioned demanding requirements.
    Nevertheless, recent paradigms such as fog computing, which extends cloud computing
    to the edge of a network, make possible low-latency and location-aware IoT applications.
    Moreover, technologies such as Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) have emerged
    as a promising solution to provide low-cost and low-power consumption connectivity
    to nodes spread throughout a wide area. Specifically, the Long-Range Wide-Area
    Network (LoRaWAN) standard is one of the most recent developments, receiving attention
    both from industry and academia. In this article, the use of a LoRaWAN fog computing-based
    architecture is proposed for providing connectivity to IoT nodes deployed in a
    campus of the University of A Coruña (UDC), Spain. To validate the proposed system,
    the smart campus has been recreated realistically through an in-house developed
    3D Ray-Launching radio-planning simulator that is able to take into consideration
    even small details, such as traffic lights, vehicles, people, buildings, urban
    furniture, or vegetation. The developed tool can provide accurate radio propagation
    estimations within the smart campus scenario in terms of coverage, capacity, and

    A smart campus is an intelligent infrastructure where smart sensors and actuators
    collaborate to collect information and interact with the machines, tools, and
    users of a university campus. As in a smart city, a smart campus represents a
    challenging scenario for Internet of Things (IoT) networks, especially in terms
    of cost, coverage, availability, latency, power consumption, and scalability.
    The technologies employed so far to cope with such a scenario are not yet able
    to manage simultaneously all the previously mentioned demanding requirements.
    Nevertheless, recent paradigms such as fog computing, which extends cloud computing
    to the edge of a network, make possible low-latency and location-aware IoT applications.
    Moreover, technologies such as Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) have emerged
    as a promising solution to provide low-cost and low-power consumption connectivity
    to nodes spread throughout a wide area. Specifically, the Long-Range Wide-Area
    Network (LoRaWAN) standard is one of the most recent developments, receiving attention
    both from industry and academia. In this article, the use of a LoRaWAN fog computing-based
    architecture is proposed for providing connectivity to IoT nodes deployed in a
    campus of the University of A Coruña (UDC), Spain. To validate the proposed system,
    the smart campus has been recreated realistically through an in-house developed
    3D Ray-Launching radio-planning simulator that is able to take into consideration
    even small details, such as traffic lights, vehicles, people, buildings, urban
    furniture, or vegetation. The developed tool can provide accurate radio propagation
    estimations within the smart campus scenario in terms of coverage, capacity, and
    energy efficiency of the network. The results obtained with the planning simulator
    can then be compared with empirical measurements to assess the operating conditions
    and the system accuracy. Specifically, this article presents experiments that
    show the accurate results obtained by the planning simulator in the largest scenario
    ever built for it (a campus that covers an area of 26,000 m 2 ), which are corroborated
    with empirical measurements. Then, how the tool can be used to design the deployment
    of LoRaWAN infrastructure for three smart campus outdoor applications is explained:
    a mobility pattern detection system, a smart irrigation solution, and a smart
    traffic-monitoring deployment. Consequently, the presented results provide guidelines
    to smart campus designers and developers, and for easing LoRaWAN network deployment
    and research in other smart campuses and large environments such as smart cities.

    1. Introduction A smart campus is an infrastructure similar to a smart city that
    makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions [1,2,3,4,5,6] to connect, monitor,
    control, optimize, and automate the systems of a university. Today, a smart campus
    represents a challenging scenario for IoT networks, especially in terms cost,
    coverage, availability, latency, security, power consumption, and scalability.
    The area covered by a campus varies substantially depending on the university,
    its location, the financial endowment, and the year of founding. For example,
    Berry College (Floyd County, Georgia, United States), is often considered the
    largest contiguous rural campus in the world: it covers 27,000 acres (109.26 km
    2 ) [7] of land. Other examples are the suburban/urban campuses of Duke University
    (Durham, NC, USA), which are deployed on 9350 acres (37.83 km 2 ) [8], and the
    campus of Stanford University (Stanford, CA, USA), which covers 8180 acres (33
    km 2 ) [9]. Regardless of their initial surface area, it is common that campuses
    grow considerably as time goes by [10], hence institutions usually devise long-term
    sustainability plans to envision their growth in the future [11,12,13]. When a
    campus provides smart IoT services, it is necessary to provide communications
    connectivity to IoT nodes and gateways. Such a connectivity can be provided in
    a quite straightforward way indoors thanks to the use of popular technologies
    such as Wi-Fi, but, outdoors, technology selection becomes more complex, since
    it is not only necessary to provide good coverage and a cost-effective deployment,
    but also to decrease the communications energy consumption to maximize IoT node
    battery life. To tackle such an issue in wide areas, a set of technologies grouped
    under the term Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) seem to be a good selection,
    since, in comparison to other previous technologies, they provide a wider area
    communications range and reduced energy consumption. In fact, LPWAN technologies
    have emerged as an enabling technology for IoT and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications
    [14] mainly due to their capabilities related to range, cost, power consumption,
    and capacity. Examples of such technologies are NB-IoT [15], SigFox [16], Ingenu
    [17], Weightless [18] or LoRaWAN [19] (a detailed comparison of these and other
    LPWAN technologies is given later in Section 2.2). In the case of LoRaWAN, it
    is gaining momentum from both industry and academia [20,21,22]. LoRaWAN defines
    a communications protocol and a system architecture for the network. In addition,
    it uses LoRa for its physical layer [23], which is able to create long-range communications
    links and makes use of a Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation that conserves
    the power features of Frequency Shifting Keying (FSK) while increasing its communications
    range. All these features make LoRaWAN a good candidate for providing wireless
    communications to outdoor IoT nodes in a smart campus. Traditionally, gateways
    connect the IoT nodes with the cloud and among them. The cloud is basically one
    or more servers with large computational power, communication, and storing capabilities
    that receives, processes, and analyzes the data collected from the IoT nodes by
    performing computational-intensive tasks. Although cloud-based solutions are appropriate
    at a small scale, when the number of IoT nodes grows significantly and, consequently,
    the network traffic they generate, congestion may lead to increasing latency responses
    and slower data processing. Among the different alternatives to confront this
    challenge and to guarantee a flexible, scalable, robust, secure, and energy-efficient
    deployment of IoT networks, the design and implementation of a fog computing architecture
    was chosen. Fog computing supports physically distributed, low-latency (e.g.,
    real-time or quasi real-time responses) and location-aware applications that decrease
    the network traffic and the computational load of traditional cloud computing
    systems by processing in the IoT nodes most of the data generated by their sensors
    and actuators and unburdening the higher layers from data processing [24]. Furthermore,
    when designing a smart campus, it is necessary to plan how LoRaWAN gateways and
    nodes are deployed to guarantee good IoT node coverage while minimizing the number
    of gateways (i.e., minimizing the smart campus communications infrastructure cost).
    The problem is that there are only a few examples of academic and commercial tools
    that create such a planning [25,26], so developers have to adapt tools previously
    optimized for other technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi [27]) or have to carry out tedious
    empirical measurements throughout the campus [28,29]. This article confronts the
    mentioned challenges by designing and implementing a cost-efficient, scalable,
    and low-power consumption LoRaWAN fog computing-based architecture for wide areas.
    Specifically, the system was designed with the aim of developing novel latency-sensitive
    IoT outdoor applications that create more sustainable and intelligent campuses.
    The following are the main contributions of the article, which as of writing,
    have not been found together in the literature: To establish the basics, it presents
    the main characteristics of the so-called smart campuses together with a detailed
    review of the state of the art of the main and the latest communications architectures
    and technologies, previous academic deployments, novel potential LPWAN applications
    and relevant tools for radio propagation modeling and planning. It thoroughly
    details the design, implementation, and practical evaluation of a scalable LPWAN-based
    communications architecture for supporting the smart campus IoT applications.
    The article presents the 3D modeling of a real 26,000 m 2 campus whose LoRaWAN
    wireless propagation characteristics are evaluated with an in-house developed
    3D Ray-launching radio-planning simulator. The results obtained by such a simulator
    are validated by comparing them with empirical LoRaWAN measurements obtained throughout
    the campus. It details how the radio-planning tool can be used to design the deployment
    of LoRaWAN infrastructure for three smart campus applications: a mobility pattern
    detection system, a smart irrigation solution, and a smart traffic-monitoring
    deployment. Thus, it demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed tools and methodology,
    which are able to provide fast guidelines to smart campus designers and developers,
    and that can also be used for easing LoRaWAN network deployment and research in
    other large environments such as smart cities. The rest of this article is structured
    as follows. Section 2 reviews the state of the art on smart campuses: their characteristics,
    technologies, architectures, previous relevant deployments, potential applications,
    and the previous work on modeling and planning a smart campus. Section 3 details
    the architecture of the proposed system and the characteristics of the LoRaWAN
    testbed implementation. Section 4 describes the proposed planning simulator and
    the analyzed scenario. Section 5 is dedicated to the experiments. Finally, Section
    6 presents the main discussion on the lessons learned from these experiences,
    while Section 7 is devoted to the conclusions. 2. Related Work 2.1. Characteristics
    of a Smart Campus It is first important to note that in the literature, some authors
    use the term smart campus to refer to digital online platforms to manage learning
    content [30,31] or to strategies or solutions to increase the smartness of the
    students [32,33,34]. In this article, the term smart campus is used for referring
    to the hardware infrastructure and software that provides smart services and applications
    to the campus users (i.e., to students and to the university staff). In this regard,
    a smart campus, such as a smart city, can be modeled along six different smart
    fields [35]: Smart governance. It provides users with mechanisms to participate
    in decision-making or in public services. Smart people. It deals with social issues,
    including the engagement in campus events and learning activities. Smart mobility.
    This field is related to the accessibility of the campus, including the use of
    efficient, clean, safe, and intelligent transport means. Smart environment. It
    contemplates the monitoring and protection of the environment, as well as the
    sustainable management of the available resources. Smart living. The technologies
    used in these fields can monitor diverse living aspects in the campus facilities,
    such as personal safety [36], health [37] or crowd sensing [38]. Smart economy.
    It is related to the competitiveness of the campus in terms of entrepreneurship,
    innovation, or productivity. These smart campus fields can be further refined
    to determine specific smart services and solutions that should be ideally provided
    by a smart campus [39]: Smart living services: room occupation, classroom/lab
    equipment access control, health monitoring and alert services, classroom attendance
    systems, teaching interaction services, or context-aware applications (e.g., guidance
    or navigation solutions). Smart environment solutions: they include solutions
    for monitoring waste, water consumption, air quality (e.g., pollution) or the
    status of the campus green areas. Smart energy systems: they control and monitor
    the production, distribution, and consumption of energy in a campus. These novel
    smart services and solutions make use of a growing number of enabling technologies,
    being the most relevant represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Most relevant enabling
    technologies and applications in a smart campus. 2.2. Smart Campus Communications
    Architectures and Technologies In the literature, different approaches to smart
    campus architectures can be found, but it seems that two main paradigms drive
    clearly the most popular designs: IoT and cloud computing [40]. For instance,
    a cloud-based smart campus architecture is presented in [41]. In such a work the
    authors state that they were able to build their smart campus platform within
    three months thanks to the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and
    Microsoft Azure cloud services. Regarding IoT, it has been suggested as a tool
    to be considered in the architecture of a smart campus to ease the development
    of learning applications, access control systems, smart grids or water management
    systems [42,43]. Nonetheless, cloud computing and IoT solutions are often helped
    by Big Data techniques and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) architectures,
    since they ease the processing and analysis of the collected data [44,45]. Some
    authors have suggested alternative paradigms for developing smart campuses. For
    example, in [46] a sort of opportunistic communications architecture called Floating
    Content is proposed that shares data through infrastructure-less services. The
    idea is essentially based on the ability of each Floating Content node to produce
    information that is shared with the interested users within a limited physical
    area. Other researchers propose similar architectures, but including enhancements
    in aspects such as security [47]. Other proposals revolve around the application
    of the Edge Computing paradigm and its sub-types (e.g., Mobile Edge Computing,
    Fog Computing), which have been previously applied to other fields [48,49]. Essentially,
    Edge Computing offloads the cloud from a relevant amount of processing and communications
    transactions, delegating such tasks to devices that are closer to the IoT nodes.
    In this way, such edge devices not only offload the cloud, but are also able to
    reduce latency response and provide location-aware services [50]. For example,
    in [51] the authors propose to enhance a smart campus architecture by including
    Edge Computing devices to provide trustworthy content caching and bandwidth allocation
    services to mobile users. Similarly, the authors of [52] harness street lighting
    to embed Edge Computing node hardware to provide different smart campus services.
    The Mobile Edge Computing paradigm is used in [53], where the authors present
    a smart campus platform called WiCloud whose servers are accessed through mobile
    phone base stations or wireless access points. Furthermore, other authors propose
    the use of fog computing nodes to improve user experience [54]. Different wireless
    technologies have been used to interconnect IoT nodes with smart campus platforms.
    For instance, BLE and ZigBee were used in [41] to provide both short and medium
    range communications, although ZigBee nodes can be used as relays to cover very
    long distances. For this latter reason, in [55] the authors make use of a ZigBee
    mesh network to interconnect the nodes of their campus smart grid. Wi-Fi has also
    been suggested for providing connectivity [56], although the proposed applications
    are usually restricted to indoor locations and nearby places. Bluetooth beacons
    give more freedom to certain outdoor applications [57], but they require deploying
    dense networks that may be difficult to manage [58]. Mobile phone communications
    technologies (2G/3G/4G) have also been used in the literature [59], but in most
    cases just for the convenience of being already embedded into smartphones. 5G
    is currently still being tested, but some researchers have already proposed its
    use for providing fast communications and low-latency responses to smart campus
    platforms [60]. Although 5G technologies seem to have a bright future, as of writing,
    LPWANs are arguably one of the best alternatives for providing long-range and
    low-power communications. There are different LPWAN technologies such as SigFox
    [16], Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA) [17], Weightless [18], NB-IoT [15],
    Telensa [61] or NB-Fi [62]. Among such technologies, NB-IoT, SigFox and LoRa/LoRaWAN
    are currently the most popular (their main characteristics are shown in Table
    1). Table 1. Comparison of the three most popular LPWAN technologies. There are
    several recent studies on the performance of LoRa/LoRaWAN technology for certain
    scenarios, but only a few describe real-world LoRaWAN deployments explicitly aimed
    at providing communications to a smart campus. For instance, Loriot et al. [63]
    conducted LoRaWAN measurements in a French campus both outdoors and indoors and
    showed that the technology can provide good performance over the major part of
    the campus. Another development is presented in [64], where the authors set up
    a LoRaWAN-based air quality system in their campus. Other interesting paper is
    [65], which details the design of a LoRa mesh network system within a campus.
    Finally, in [66] the authors briefly describe a smart campus platform that includes
    a LoRaWAN network to support faculty research projects. 2.3. Smart Campus Deployments
    Despite the existence of many well-documented smart campus applications, there
    are only a few academic articles that describe in detail the deployment of real
    smart campuses. For instance, in [67] an overview of the neOCampus of the Toulouse
    III Paul Sabatier University (France) is given. Such a smart campus runs different
    projects to make use of collaborative Wi-Fi, it provides an open-data platform,
    it fosters the reduction of the ecological footprint related to human activities
    and it aims for protecting the biodiversity of the campus. Another interesting
    smart campus is detailed in [56], where an IoT platform deployed across different
    engineering schools of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in its Moncloa Campus
    (Spain) is described. Such an IoT platform is based on a cloud that provides services
    that follow the SOA paradigm. Two main applications are implemented: one for monitoring
    people flows and another for environmental monitoring. The Sapienza smart campus
    (Italy) roadmap is described in [68]. Such a paper is interesting since, although
    it is a theoretical approach, it indicates how to structure the services to be
    provided by the smart campus infrastructure to scale it appropriately. In [45]
    the author gives details on the Birmingham City University smart campus (United
    Kingdom). The smart campus platform integrates diverse business systems and smart
    building protocols thanks to an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and to the use of
    a SOA architecture, which provides scalability, flexibility, and service orchestration.
    In the United States, an example of smart campus can be found in West Texas A&M
    University [66]. According to the authors, the smart campus is based on the IoT
    principles and covers an area of 176 acres, requiring connecting more than 42
    different buildings. The described project is focused on two main tasks: to foster
    IoT collaboration and to provide an appropriate security framework. The proposed
    system has already supported diverse IoT projects, such as a LoRaWAN pilot for
    monitoring environmental conditions or an OpenCV-based smart parking system. Finally,
    a smart campus for Wuhan University of Technology (China) is proposed in [69].
    In such a paper the authors depict an architecture based on the IoT paradigm and
    in cloud-computing infrastructure that supports multiple applications. 2.4. Potential
    Smart Campus LPWAN Applications Although a smart campus can support multiple indoor
    applications [70], in general, in such environments IoT nodes have access to power
    outlets and their communications can be usually easily handled with already common
    communications transceivers (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet). In contrast, this
    article focuses on the challenging environments that arise outdoors due the usual
    dependency on batteries to run IoT nodes and the need for exchanging data at relatively
    long distances (at least several hundred meters and up to 2 km), where LPWAN devices
    outperform other popular communications technologies. The following are some of
    the most relevant outdoor applications that have already been implemented by using
    LPWAN technologies: Smart mobility and intelligent transport services. These applications
    require ubiquitous outdoor coverage to provide continuous data streams. For instance,
    in [71] researchers of Soochow University (China) propose the deployment of different
    smart mobility applications for their campuses, which include automatic vehicle
    access systems, a parking guidance service, a bus tracking system, or a bicycle
    rental service. Other authors also proposed similar solutions for providing campus
    services for smart parking [72], electric mobility [73,74], smart electric charging
    [75], the use of autonomous vehicles [76] or bus tracking [77]. Smart energy and
    smart grid monitoring. Certain energy sources (e.g., renewable sources such as
    photo-voltaic panels or windmills) and smart grid components may be in remote
    locations, so it would be helpful to make use of LPWAN technologies to monitor
    them. For this reason, in recent years, special attention has been given to smart
    campus microgrids [78], smart grids [79] and smart energy systems [80]. Resource
    consumption efficiency monitoring. These fields include waste collection [81],
    water management [82], energy monitoring [83], power consumption optimization
    [84] and sustainability [5]. Campus user profiling. It is interesting for the
    campus managers to determine user patterns and behaviors to optimize the provided
    services. Thus, user profiling can be helpful to obtain mobility patterns, student
    daily walks, user activities, or social interactions, which can be obtained through
    opportunistic messaging apps [85], Wi-Fi monitoring [86] or on-board mobile phone
    sensors [87]. Outdoor guidance and context-aware applications. This kind of systems
    are usually based on sensors and actuators spread throughout the campus and help
    people to reach their destination. There are examples in the literature of systems
    for guiding hearing and visually impaired people [88] or for navigating through
    the campus paths [89]. There are also augmented reality guidance applications
    [90], but it is important to note that LPWAN technologies could only help in small
    packet exchanges (e.g., for transmitting certain telemetry or positioning data),
    since the real-time multimedia content that can be demanded by augmented reality
    applications requires high-speed rates to preserve a good user experience. Classroom
    attendance. Some university events are carried out outdoors, what makes it difficult
    to control classroom attendance. To tackle such an issue, some researchers have
    proposed different sensor-based student monitoring systems that can be repurposed
    to be used outdoors [91]. Infrastructure monitoring. It is possible to monitor
    remotely the status of certain assets that are scattered throughout the campus.
    For example, some authors presented smart campus solutions for managing campus
    greenhouses [92] or for monitoring high power lines with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) [93]. Remote health monitoring. Smart campus technologies receive medical
    data in real time [94] or for measuring student stress [95]. Some researchers
    have even proposed to monitor the health of the campus trees [96]. 2.5. Smart
    Campus Modeling and Planning Simulators A smart campus is similar to an urban
    microenvironment where different buildings coexist with streets, open areas, parking
    lots, trees, benches, or people, among others. Different propagation channel models
    have been presented in the literature to characterize electromagnetic propagation
    phenomena in this type of scenarios, ranging from empirical methods to deterministic
    methods based on Ray Tracing (RT) or Ray-Launching (RL) approaches. Empirical
    methods are based on measurements and their subsequent linear regression analysis.
    These methods are accurate for scenarios with the same characteristics as the
    real measurements, but their main disadvantages are the lack of scalability and
    the expensive cost in time and resources that is required to perform a measurement
    campaign. For example, in [97,98] empirical path loss models in a typical university
    campus are proposed for a frequency of 1800 MHz. The authors of [99] present a
    spatially consistent street-by-street path loss model for a 28 GHz channel in
    a micro-cell urban environment. The main drawback of these results is that the
    suitability of these models for path loss prediction has yet to be confirmed by
    the literature in other campuses. On the other hand, deterministic methods are
    based on Maxwell’s equations, which provide accurate propagation predictions.
    These approaches usually consider the three-dimensional geometry of the environment
    and model all propagation phenomena in the considered scenario. Their main drawback
    is the required computational time, which may not be afforded in large and complex
    scenarios. For this reason, RT or RL techniques, which are based on Geometrical
    Optics (GO) and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD), have been widely used
    for radio propagation purposes as an accurate approximation of full-wave deterministic
    techniques. For example, the authors of [100] modeled the dominant propagation
    mechanisms using advanced RT simulations in an urban microenvironment at 2.1 GHz,
    showing that diffuse scattering plays a key role in urban propagation. In addition,
    in [101] the importance of scattering when analyzing outdoor environments in the
    presence of trees is reported. In [102,103] the authors present propagation analyses
    (at 949.2 MHz and 2162.6 MHz, respectively) that make use of RT tools in a university
    campus with a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) base station placed
    on rooftops. Similarly, in [104], the radio-planning analysis of a Wi-Fi network
    in a university campus is presented using an RT approach. In addition, it has
    also been reported in the literature the calibration of RT simulators for millimeter-wave
    propagation analyses based on the measured results in a university campus at 28
    GHz [105] and 38 GHz [106]. However, all the presented works are focused on micro-cellular
    environments and on analyzing the wireless propagation channel between a base
    station at a certain height in a building and a client in a pedestrian street.
    In this work, a radio wave propagation analysis for the connectivity of IoT LoRaWAN-based
    nodes by means of an in-house developed RL algorithm is reported (which is later
    detailed in Section 4). 2.6. Key Findings After analyzing the state of art, it
    is clear that a smart campus faces similar challenges to smart cities and that
    they share certain use cases and communications technologies. Table 2 summarizes
    the characteristics of the most relevant smart campuses and related solutions,
    and compares them with the proposed system for the University of A Coruña. Table
    2. Comparison of the main features of the most relevant deployed smart campuses
    and related solutions. As can be observed, the systems in the table make use of
    diverse short-range and long-range communications technologies, multiple sensors
    and actuators, different hardware and software platforms, and provide services
    for several practical use cases. Although some systems provide a holistic approach
    to a smart campus, devising potential outdoor use cases and applications, their
    implementations are mainly focused on environmental aspects, missing other smart
    fields such as the ones defined in Section 2.1. In addition, only a few solutions
    consider the use of fog computing, and even less made use of network planning
    tools. In comparison, the solution proposed in this article is one of the few
    academic solutions that deploys LoRaWAN infrastructure. Moreover, the proposed
    smart campus is almost the only one conceived from scratch to harness the benefits
    of fog computing. Regarding the efficiency in the network deployment in terms
    of cost, coverage, and the overall energy consumption, most of the academic papers
    do not give any insight regarding the heterogeneous network planning, although
    in some cases it is specified that it is low cost (without further details). Just
    a couple of systems give details for the hardware used to build the demonstrator
    at the level that is described later in this paper in Section 3. 3. Design and
    Implementation of the Smart Campus System 3.1. Architecture for Outdoor Applications
    The proposed communications architecture is depicted in Figure 2. As can be observed,
    it comprises three different layers. The layer at the bottom consists of the different
    IoT LoRaWAN nodes that are deployed throughout the campus. Such nodes communicate
    with LoRaWAN gateways that comprise the Fog Layer, since they also act as fog
    computing gateways, thus providing fast location-aware responses to the LoRaWAN
    node requests. Every fog gateway is essentially a Single Board Computer (SBC)
    that embeds Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth interfaces besides a LoRaWAN transceiver.
    Finally, the top layer is the cloud, where user applications run together with
    data storage services. Figure 2. Proposed LoRaWAN-based smart campus architecture.
    3.2. Operational Requirements for Outdoor Applications To cover potential smart
    campus outdoor applications, a set of operational requirements grouped by capabilities
    was defined, including: Coverage capabilities. The coverage of the smart campus
    should be maximized. The typically expected coverage should be around 1 km 2 considering
    both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and No-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios. Robustness capabilities.
    The system should provide robustness to signal interference and/or loss of network
    operation. The network should provide redundancy and thus be robust against single
    points of failure. Supported services and applications. The previously mentioned
    applications (in Section 2.4) should be supported. Quality of Service (QoS) requirements
    should include support for high-peak rate demand, latency-sensitive traffic, and
    location-aware IoT applications. A transmission speed of up to 50 Kbps should
    be expected. Deployment features and cost. It should be expected that the deployment
    will depend largely on low-cost IoT nodes resource-constrained in terms of memory,
    battery, computing capabilities, and energy consumption. Network topology. The
    network architecture should support Point-To-Multipoint (PMP) and Point-to-Point
    (PtP) links. The system should be capable of establishing ad-hoc networking for
    specific scenarios (i.e., by using star or mesh topologies). 3.3. LoRaWAN Testbed
    Implementation A LoRaWAN network consisting on a gateway and several nodes was
    deployed. A RisingHF RHF0M301 module [108] installed on a Raspberry Pi 3 was selected
    as gateway. Such a module is equipped with a dual digital radio front-end interface
    with a typical sensitivity of −137 dBm. The module is capable of simultaneous
    dual-band operation and supports Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), automatically changing
    between LoRa spreading factors. It can use a maximum of 10 channels: 8 multi Spreading
    Factor (SF) channels (SF7 to SF12 with 125 KHz of bandwidth), one FSK channel
    and one LoRa channel. Another interesting feature of the module is its ability
    to operate with negative Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), with a Co-Channel Rejection
    (CCR) of up to 9 dB. It also supports LoRaWAN classes A, B, and C and its maximum
    output power is 24.5 dBm. A 0 dBi antenna was used for the tests. The module is
    installed on a Raspberry Pi 3 using the provided bridge (RHF4T002). To access
    the LoRaWAN RFID module, configure the node, and access the message and the transmission
    parameters, the following software was installed on the Raspberry Pi 3: Raspbian
    Stretch (Linux raspberrypi 4.14.70-v7+), LoRa Gateway v5.0.1, LoRa Packet Forwarder
    v4.0.1 and LoRaWAN-Server v0.6.0. The LoRa gateway was configured as follows:
    Coding Rate: 4/5 . RX1 delay: 1. RX2 delay: 2. Power: 14 dBm. RX Frequency: 869.5
    MHz. A RisingHF RHF76-052 module [109] was used by the LoRaWAN nodes (one of such
    nodes can be observed on the right of Figure 3). The module has a maximum sensitivity
    of −139 dBm with spreading factor 12 (SF12) and 125 kHz of bandwidth, channels
    (0–2) at 868.1, 868.3 and 868.5 MHz, and a maximum output power of 14 dBm. During
    the experiments presented in this paper, the module made use of the pre-installed
    wired antenna. Figure 3. LoRaWAN IoT node during the empirical measurement campaign.
    4. LoRaWAN Planning Simulator Setup 4.1. Planning Simulator The in-house developed
    3D Ray-Launching (3D-RL) technique is based on GO and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction
    (UTD). The first step of such a technique is the creation of the scenario under
    analysis, which should consider all the obstacles within it, such as buildings,
    vehicles, vegetation, or people. This design phase is essential for obtaining
    accurate results for the real environment. Once the scenario is properly created,
    the frequency of operation, number of reflections, radiation pattern of the transceivers
    and angular and spatial resolution can be fixed as input parameters in the algorithm
    for simulation. Then, the whole scenario is divided into a 3D mesh of cuboids,
    in which all the electromagnetic phenomena are saved during simulation, emulating
    the electromagnetic propagation of the real waves. A detailed description of the
    inner-workings of the 3D-RL tool is out of the scope of this article, but the
    interested reader can find further information in [110]. It is worth pointing
    out that smart campus ecosystems are challenging environments in terms of radio
    propagation analysis due to their large dimensions as well as for the multipath
    propagation, which is caused by the multiple obstacles within them. Hence, to
    achieve a good trade-off between simulation computational cost and result accuracy,
    it is important to determine the optimal parameters for the number of reflections
    and the angular and spatial resolution of the RL algorithm. For such a purpose,
    an analysis of the optimal input parameters for the RL tool applied in large complex
    environments is presented in [111]. Such previous results have been considered
    to obtain the simulation parameters for the proposed smart campus scenario and
    the final values are summarized in Table 3. Table 3. 3D Ray-Launching parameters.
    4.2. Scenario under Analysis This article presents a case study conducted in the
    northwest of Spain at the Campus of Elviña of the University of A Coruña. The
    campus covers an area of 26,000 m 2 and includes elements typically found in an
    urban environment, such as buildings of different heights, sidewalks, roads, green
    areas, trees, and cars, among others. Due to the large size of the environment
    to be analyzed, two different scenarios were created for the simulations (in Figure
    4), which correspond to the two scenarios delimited by a green and a red rectangle
    in the real scenario shown in Figure 5. It must be noted that the two rectangular
    scenarios were selected within the campus (red on the left and green on the right)
    to cover eight faculties. The rectangular shape is required by the 3D Ray-Launching
    simulator. The points marked as M, A, Q, R correspond to different reception distances
    from the transmitter (T). To obtain accurate results, the created scenarios include
    the urban elements previously mentioned. Furthermore, realistic object sizes as
    well as material properties (permittivity and conductivity) were taken into account.
    For the experiments, the LoRaWAN gateway explained in Section 3.3 was placed at
    the spot indicated by the red dot in the two images shown in Figure 4. Please
    note that the location corresponds to a single position, which is in the third
    floor of the faculty of Computer Science (located in the intersection of the two
    rectangles of Figure 5, marked in such a Figure with a blue T). Figure 4. Simulated
    scenarios of the smart campus. (a) Red scenario; (b) Green scenario. Figure 5.
    Aerial view of the Campus of Elviña, with the areas delimited for smart campus
    applications (Source: ©2019 Google). 5. Experiments 5.1. Empirical Validation:
    LoRaWAN Testbed To evaluate LoRaWAN performance in a real campus, the testbed
    described in Section 3.3 was deployed in the Campus of Elviña. A measurement campaign
    was designed and carried out to validate the chosen hardware and the simulation
    results provided by the 3D Ray-Launching algorithm. The performed tests consisted
    on transmitting packets from the LoRaWAN node to the gateway from different spots
    throughout the campus using acknowledgment messages. Figure 6 shows such spots
    (in yellow) together with the LoRaWAN gateway location (in red) for one of the
    two parts of the evaluated campus. The transmitter was placed near a window inside
    a building, at a height of 3.5 m from the street ground level. In contrast, all
    the measurement spots were located outdoors, at a height of 0.5 m. For every of
    the previously mentioned spots, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
    and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values were recorded both at the LoRaWAN gateway
    and at the device that acted as a node. A Debian Virtual machine was connected
    to the LoRaWAN-server WebSocket endpoint. Nodes were connected through an USB
    port and programmed to send a 6-byte payload ten times. The firmware of the LoRaWAN
    node uses the USB port to create a serial interface and write the SNR and RSSI
    of the received acknowledgment. With this setup, the LoRaWAN node was moved to
    different spots and at each of them the RSSI and SNR values of the gateway and
    the node were recorded for a total of ten packages per location. Figure 6. Empirical
    measurement points in the Green Scenario (Source: ©2019 Google). To test for possible
    interference in the used Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) sub-band, a
    USRP B210 [112] with the same 0 dBi antenna used by the LoRaWAN gateway was connected
    to a laptop that acted both as data-logger and spectrum analyzer (such a measurement
    setup is shown in Figure 3). As an example, the result of one of the analysis
    during the empirical measurements is shown in Figure 7, when the system was configured
    to monitor a central frequency of 868.3 MHz with a sampling rate of 1 MHz. Figure
    7. State of the radio spectrum during the performed empirical measurements. After
    the measurement campaign within the campus, Radio Frequency (RF) power level estimations
    for the whole volume of the scenario were obtained with the aid of the 3D Ray-Launching
    simulation tool. The transmitter element was placed at the same position of the
    real LoRaWAN gateway (the red dot in Figure 6) and, using the simulation parameters
    shown in Table 3, a simulation was launched. The comparison between the measured
    RF power values and the simulation estimations is depicted in Figure 8. As can
    be seen in the Figure, the obtained estimations follow the tendency of the measured
    values, obtaining a mean error of 0.53 dB with a standard deviation of 3.39 dB
    (taking into account the 19 measurement points of Figure 6). The standard deviation
    is higher than the usual values provided by the 3D Ray-Launching. This effect
    could be due to size of the scenario (and the chosen simulation parameters such
    as cuboid size and launched ray resolution), since it is the largest scenario
    simulated so far by the developed 3D Ray-Launching tool. In addition, it must
    be noted the fact that measurements were based on RSSI values provided by the
    motes, which inherently add a received RF power level error. Nonetheless, the
    simulation results are accurate, and the simulation tool is validated satisfactorily.
    Regarding the results, it is worth noting the low RF power levels measured in
    several points of the scenario. The RF power level in many of these points is
    lower than −100 dBm, which is the typical ZigBee sensitivity. However, one of
    the advantages of the selected LoRaWAN devices is that their sensitivity is much
    lower (in the usual operating conditions, up to −137 dBm), as can it be observed
    in Table 4. Thus, the radio link budget for LoRaWAN has a higher margin, which
    means that longer communication distances can be achieved. Figure 8. Comparison
    between empirical measurements and 3D-Ray-Launching simulation results. Table
    4. Sensitivity values for LoRaWAN devices at 868 MHz. 5.2. Planning of Smart Campus
    Use Cases Once the presented 3D Ray-Launching simulation tool was validated by
    comparing the simulation results with the measurements, three different outdoor
    use cases were proposed for the smart campus environment, where LoRaWAN would
    have direct connectivity with a gateway: Crowdsensing/Mobility pattern detection.
    The purple dots depicted in Figure 9 represent the location of SBC-type devices
    (e.g., Raspberry Pi) that act as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sniffers that will help to
    determine the mobility patterns of the users that move throughout the campus,
    what will optimize the deployed location-based services. In the same way, the
    devices could also help in crowdsensing tasks in certain areas. Smart irrigation.
    In this case, due to the location of the campus green areas, devices will be deployed
    only in one of the modeled scenarios. The device locations are represented by
    yellow dots shown in Figure 10. The aim of this system is to remotely control
    and automate the irrigation of green areas where the deployment of wired infrastructure
    to control the valves is very expensive or even unfeasible. Smart traffic monitoring.
    To detect vehicular traffic, sensors are deployed at the points represented by
    blue dots in Figure 11. In this way, the traffic behavior within the campus can
    be analyzed and the degree of parking occupancy could be inferred. Sustainability
    and ecological measurements to boost public transportation, to optimize routes
    and resources, and to adapt to real-time demand could be taken. Figure 9. Aerial
    view of the spots monitored in the mobility pattern detection use case (Source:
    ©2019 Google). Figure 10. Aerial view of the smart irrigation monitoring spots
    (Source: ©2019 Google). Figure 11. Aerial view of the spots monitored for the
    smart traffic use case (Source: ©2019 Google). To validate the three mentioned
    smart campus use cases, 3D Ray-Launching simulations were launched for the proposed
    device locations. As an example, Figure 12 shows the estimated RF power distribution
    for bi-dimensional planes at two different heights (ground level and building’s
    third floor level -at the gateway’s height) for the smart irrigation use case
    (in Figure 12a, where the transmitter is at the center of the Green scenario)
    and the smart traffic-monitoring case (Figure 12b, transmitter at the furthest
    point of the Red Scenario). The used simulation parameters are also those shown
    in Table 3. As can be observed in Figure 12, the transmitter location (marked
    as a white circle with a T) and the morphology of the scenario (mainly the building
    location) greatly affect wireless signal propagation. Nevertheless, the estimated
    RF signal strength is quite high, taking into account the sensitivity of the employed
    LoRaWAN devices (i.e., −137 dBm) and the fact that the most common sensitivity
    value is −148 dBm (see Table 4). Figure 12. Bi-dimensional planes of the estimated
    RF power distribution for two different heights. (a) Green scenario; (b) Red scenario.
    To determine whether the chosen gateway location will comply with the required
    sensitivity for the proposed LoRaWAN node locations, 3D Ray-Launching simulation
    results were performed. As an example, Figure 13 summarizes the sensitivity analysis
    carried out for the use case illustrated in Figure 12b (i.e., for the furthest
    LoRaWAN node deployed for the smart traffic-monitoring use case). Specifically,
    Figure 13a shows the estimations obtained when the transmitter is operating at
    20 dBm for different heights: ground level, third floor, and fourth floor. Figure
    13b presents the same results, but for a lower transmission power (5 dBm). Finally,
    Figure 14 depicts the results for the sensitivity analysis based on the results
    obtained when transmitting at 5 dBm. This last Figure shows the areas and spots
    of the scenario that comply (dark blue) and do not comply (light blue) with the
    selected sensitivity value (in this case, the typical −148 dBm). The results show
    that for the case of transmitting at 20 dBm, there is no problem in terms of sensitivity
    threshold, but for the case of using 5 dBm, potential problems with this threshold
    appear within the building where the gateway is placed (this represented by the
    light blue surfaces at the top and left sides of the bi-dimensional planes). Therefore,
    a trade-off decision should be made to choose a transmission power level that
    ensures good sensitivity and, at the same time, the optimization of the energy
    consumption of the deployed motes. In fact, the results show that the gateway
    location could be improved by moving it from the third floor to the fourth floor.
    Thus, the deployment of the LoRaWAN network can be optimized by the presented
    3D Ray-Launching algorithm in relation to its coverage and the overall energy
    consumption of the wireless communications system. Figure 13. Bi-dimensional planes
    of the estimated RF power distribution for two different heights. (a) transmission
    power 20 dBm, (b) transmission power 5 dBm. Figure 14. Bi-dimensional planes of
    the estimated RF power distribution for three different heights: sensitivity fulfillment
    (threshold = −148 dBm). 6. Discussion The results presented in the previous section
    indicate the impact that the campus scenario has in radio-planning analysis and
    hence, in the determination of the optimal network layout. It must be first pointed
    out that the obtained results are hard to generalize, since the analyzed campus
    scenarios have particular characteristics that make them almost unique. Such characteristics
    include the size of the campus or the distribution of elements within it (mainly
    the buildings and their size and material properties), which have a great impact
    on radio signal propagation. Moreover, the topology of the deployed wireless network
    (i.e., the location of the nodes) has also a great influence on wireless communications
    performance. Therefore, the proposed methodology and solution have been validated
    in the presented paper, but it has to be noted that site-specific assessments
    are needed (that is, the results obtained for a specific campus environment cannot
    be generalized for any other campus scenario). Nonetheless, some aspects and results
    can be generalized up to a point (e.g., the received RF power for LoS situations),
    which are discussed in the following paragraphs. One of the advantages in the
    use of LoRaWAN transceivers is their inherent low sensitivity values (in the range
    of −135.5 dBm to −148 dBm), which improve the reception range in comparison to
    other technologies. In all the observed simulation and measurement results, the
    received power levels are above −120 dBm, providing a sound margin to consider
    additional losses, such as the ones due to the variable fading related to user
    movements or to the dynamic elements within the campus. In the specific outdoor
    applications considered for the smart campus, non-directional antennas provide
    adequate functionality, given the fact that theoretically, users and nodes can
    be located at any given location within the scenario. Nonetheless, in certain
    applications directional antennas may be helpful (e.g., in telemetry applications
    where the receiver is static, Yagi-Uda, helical or patch array antennas could
    be used), increasing received power levels, thus improving the communications
    range. As can be observed in the experimental results, a coverage level of 20
    dBm is appropriate for all the considered scenarios. However, it is desirable
    to reduce transmission power to reduce overall energy consumption as well as potential
    interference. For certain applications, tailored antennas may be considered during
    the network planning and the deployment phases. The presented measurement results
    indicate that mainly due to the characteristics of the scenario, there is an appropriate
    coverage for a linear distance of 450 m with LoS (measurement point #16) and 330
    m with NLoS (measurement point #19). The obtained results conclude that the location
    of the gateway is appropriate in terms of coverage estimation when there is LoS
    and in most situations where there is NLoS. The latter case requires in-depth
    analysis of the potential locations of the nodes, in order to consider effective
    losses related to building penetration, which on average can vary from 7 dB to
    over 25 dB depending on the building and wall structure [113]. In terms of capacity,
    LoRa/LoRaWAN provides a transmission speed of up to 50 Kbps, which is enough for
    a wide range of remote monitoring applications where users send small amounts
    of information or where nodes are polled with a moderate periodicity (i.e., several
    seconds) to provide information from sensors. Specific applications (e.g., real-time
    image monitoring) that require higher bandwidths can make use of alternative wireless
    technologies that can coexist together with the proposed LoRaWAN network. 7. Conclusions
    After a thorough review of the state of the art on the most relevant aspects related
    to the deployment of smart campuses, this work detailed the design and deployment
    of a LoRaWAN IoT-based infrastructure able to provide novel applications in a
    smart campus. The architecture proposed the deployment of fog computing nodes
    throughout the campus to support physically distributed, low-latency, and location-aware
    applications that decrease the network traffic and the computational load of traditional
    cloud computing systems. To evaluate the proposed system, a campus of the University
    of A Coruña was recreated realistically through an in-house developed 3D Ray-Launching
    radio-planning simulator. Such a tool was tested by comparing its output with
    empirical measurements, showing a good accuracy. The proposed solution meets the
    established operational requirements: The provided coverage is roughly 1 km 2
    . The system provides robustness against signal losses and interference by being
    able to deploy redundant gateways. The use of fog computing nodes supports low-latency
    and location-aware IoT applications. The maximum provided transmission speed reaches
    50 Kbps. The system has been devised to make use of low-cost resource-constrained
    IoT nodes. The network topology support both PMP and PtP links. In addition, three
    practical smart campus applications were designed and evaluated with the planning
    simulator (a mobility pattern detection system, a smart irrigation solution, and
    a smart traffic-monitoring deployment), showing that the tool is able to provide
    useful guidelines and insights to future smart campus designers and developers.

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) 1. Introduction Nowadays, several municipalities
    implement the smart city model [1] to improve the quality of life for their citizens
    and the efficient use of city resources. Intelligent services can decrease operational
    costs and resource expenditure in smart cities. They can enhance performance and
    operations in a wide variety of smart city applications (SCAs) including transportation,
    healthcare, energy, education, and many more. Smart services are provided by various
    cutting-edge technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples of these technologies
    include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data analytics,
    and robots. IoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful
    human life benefits [2]. IoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart
    things into urban environments where innovative services are offered to support
    every activity at any time and from any location [2]. Things are monitored by
    IoT applications that make direct decisions for their efficient management. Moreover,
    things state their conditions, such as battery status and fault reporting for
    prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state of the infrastructure
    and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices can also obtain physical
    environment information such as temperature. In a CPS, the computation, networking,
    and physical processes are put together to control and monitor the physical environment
    of a smart city [4]. In smart cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical connections
    between the virtual and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can be
    sustained by the ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform
    for computation and IoT data storage [5]. FogC offers reduced latency, greater
    mobility, location awareness, streaming, and real-time response for SCAs [6].
    Smart cities have dispersed vast numbers of sensors, and thus large-scale data
    processing requires a complex infrastructure. Robotics in the cloud can be an
    effective computing tool for IoT applications that require a lot of data processing
    [7]. To improve the services offered by smart cities, big data analytics is employed
    to generate intelligent and optimal temporary and lasting decisions [8]. The abovementioned
    technologies are used to implement numerous smart city services [9,10]. For instance,
    intelligent transportation services are applied to improve route planning and
    avoid jamming in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety and
    make possible self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart traffic
    light controls are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy
    management and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids
    and smart buildings. These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable
    energy. Additional smart services are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges,
    tunnels, water networks, train and subway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural
    health monitoring is also feasible using smart services [11]. Last but not least,
    there are smart services that focus on monitoring the environment, public safety,
    and security of citizens [12]. All these smart city services necessitate a reliable
    networking infrastructure to efficiently exchange messages between the modules
    of a smart city system implementing a particular smart service. In particular,
    smart city services need a variety of networking and communication technologies
    for their completion because they are proposed for dissimilar scales. For example,
    smart services for smart buildings must be implemented based on Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
    or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols. On the other hand, smart services
    for the smart grid must be mainly implemented using the WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) network
    protocol. From another viewpoint, smart city services can exploit dissimilar network
    and communication models and solutions. Until now, the networking and communication
    components of smart city systems have received little research attention. To the
    best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey of network architectures and protocols
    for IoT applications in smart cities does not exist and is the goal of this study.
    The communication and networking issues involved in smart city systems are examined
    in this study. This paper considers networking technologies, topologies, and communication
    requirements for such systems. It also examines if current network protocols are
    appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent developments
    in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active area, this paper
    is important to support new research in this field. The paper contributes as follows:
    It presents network requirements of the major SCAs including intelligent transportation,
    smart buildings, pipeline monitoring and control, smart water networks, smart
    grids, and manufacturing control and monitoring. It reviews networking architectures
    used for the above applications focusing mainly on the protocols’ suitability.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;
    Section 3 presents network requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;
    Section 4 and Section 5 analyze protocols and network architectures for smart
    grids, smart buildings, smart water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart
    transportation; Section 6 summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open
    research directions; lastly, Section 8 concludes the paper. Figure 1 provides
    the layout of the survey. Figure 1. The layout of the survey paper. Systematic
    Literature Review Article Selection Method: We provide a Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR) methodology [13] with particular notice to studies related to networking
    architectures or protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. The SLR was employed
    to systematically study networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications
    in smart cities. We proposed a research question to cope with the key issues of
    networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. Question
    Formalization: Key issues and challenges in the field were identified. Such issues
    were network architectures for IoT, network protocols for IoT, IoT applications
    for smart cities, and smart city applications. This study answers the next research
    question: RQ: What is the emphasis of networking architectures or protocols for
    IoT applications in smart cities? This question determines the number of studies
    focusing on network architectures and protocols for IoT applications for smart
    cities that have been published to date to emphasize its significance in smart
    cities. Article Selection Process: The article selection process is performed
    in three stages: Automated keyword-based search; Selection of the article based
    on the title, abstract, and quality of the publication; Elimination of inappropriate
    articles. In the first stage, the search process is automatically performed using
    searching on popular academic databases such as IEEE explorer, ACM, Wiley, Springer,
    Science Direct, SAGE, and Google Scholar. The following search string was defined
    by adding other spellings of the main elements to find relevant articles. The
    search string was as follows: (“IoT” OR “Internet of Things”) AND (“network architecture”
    OR “network protocol” AND “smart cities” OR “smart rural” OR “smart village” OR
    “smart traffic” OR “smart transportation” OR “smart street lights” OR “smart energy”
    OR “smart grid” OR “smart buildings” OR “smart home” OR “smart residence” OR “home
    automation” OR “smart water” or “smart waste management” OR “smart healthcare”
    OR “smart rural” AND “Cloud Computing” OR “edge computing” OR “software-defined
    networking” OR “Artificial Intelligence”). We found 264 articles from journals,
    conference proceedings, books, and patents. These articles were published between
    2013 and 2023. In the article selection based on the quality of the publisher
    stage, the search string was constrained by searching for conference papers and
    journal articles of IEEE, ACM, Sage, Wiley, Science Direct, and Springer, in order
    to guarantee that only high-quality publications and articles were selected for
    the review. Consequently, 240 articles were selected. In the third stage of eliminating
    the inappropriate articles, a Quality Assessment Checklist (QAC) based on [13]
    was developed, wherein those articles emerging from the initial search were refined.
    After reading the abstracts, we eliminated the unrelated articles. The entire
    body of the remaining papers was checked, and those which were not related to
    our concerned field were also crossed out. After eliminating inappropriate articles,
    only 226 studies were identified. 2. Smart City Applications This section discusses
    the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what type of assistance is
    needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs, their advantages and
    design problems were addressed. In the energy sector, SCAs are being used to increase
    the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of electric energy generation
    and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart grid is a new power grid system
    that automatically collects and reacts to available information about supplier
    and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply self-monitoring and superior
    control mechanisms for power generation and consumer demand, improving grid reliability
    and efficiency. CPS systems are also used to manage the process of producing renewable
    energy from wind turbines [15]. Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings
    to monitor and manage energy consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the
    buildings, including the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems;
    appliances; and lighting systems. Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep
    track of the current state of the environment and energy consumption, are typically
    included in smart building systems. A centralized monitoring and control system
    receives observations and measurements from these sensors. Based on reported observations,
    current operational circumstances, and environmental factors, the control system
    employs intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems employed in the buildings
    to optimize energy consumption. Intelligent transportation is another SCA that
    has attracted a lot of interest in the transportation sector. Applications related
    to vehicle safety are among the most crucial types of such applications. Vehicles
    can be equipped with a variety of safety features, such as blind spot monitoring,
    emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane change warning signs.
    To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-automatic operations.
    Real-time and reliability support in detection and response are these applications’
    most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing vehicle safety must be
    dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects such as threat observations,
    decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software cannot handle
    high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices and guarantee real-time
    and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial
    SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring
    equipment to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed
    data and intelligent software that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.
    Intelligent traffic light controls, which incorporate device monitoring across
    numerous locations to precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application
    of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent
    traffic lights. Water networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase
    their intelligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems
    are integrated into water networks to add smart characteristics to the processes
    of water distribution [19]. Offering early warning systems to identify problems
    in water networks is one of these duties. For instance, it is simple to identify
    leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes can be implemented to prevent water
    wastage and future network threats or damage [20]. WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses
    is another SCA. Such monitoring provides well-organized control for appropriate
    soil, climate, lighting, and water level in greenhouses [21]. Other smart city
    systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control, monitor, and improve
    manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare systems based on edge
    computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical health of users
    [25]. Figure 2 shows some important applications including smart traffic surveillance
    and management, smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste
    management, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart
    home. Figure 2. Facilitating networking and communication amongst SCAs. Analysis
    of Smart City Applications/Systems This subsection analyses the SCAs shown in
    Figure 2. Smart Traffic Surveillance Systems: These systems are based on centralized
    processes and may fail due to networking problems. Thus, to automate such an innovative
    system, centralized and distributed methods must be used to maintain local servers.
    Javaid et al. [26] suggested a smart traffic management system using a mixture
    of centralized and decentralized processes to optimize the flow of vehicles on
    roads and an algorithm to manage a variety of traffic conditions efficiently.
    In the context of smart cities, effective traffic management implies that a decision-making
    model identifies and quantifies traffic congestion as well as predicts traffic
    patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered a theoretical analysis that takes into account
    such effective traffic management. Notably, existing decision-making models are
    primarily devoted to urban and highway traffic management, not considering the
    closed campuses and collector roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] identified this
    weakness and proposed an IoT-based system model that collects, processes, and
    stores real-time traffic data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based traffic
    management system, various challenges emerge. These challenges include security
    issues, extremely sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required
    adjustments, and specific information fields in the protocol header and structure,
    as well as higher costs. Smart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of
    health parameters, these systems are progressively being associated with and connected
    via the Internet to numerous types of available smart wearable sensing and computing
    devices. These systems face several problems [29] that must be resolved. A security/privacy
    perspective, inter-realm authentication, interoperability issues, device-to-device
    informal communication, and collection and management of medical data are among
    the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30] addressed issues related to cyber-security
    while using IoT for such applications. They sought to examine secure techniques’
    deployment and implementation from the perspective of preventing and reducing
    cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys and reviews [31,32] on smart
    healthcare applications tackle the problem of integrating IoT systems with any
    healthcare application particularly. Weather and Air Quality Monitoring Systems:
    These systems use environmental monitoring stations, which are extremely pricey
    to acquire and maintain. For example, these stations require engineers with specialized
    skill sets and data analysts. Therefore, it is impractical to deploy such monitoring
    stations densely. Instead, they are often deployed sparsely, which creates the
    problem of limited spatial resolutions for useful measurements. Lately, cheap
    monitoring sensors have evolved in the market, significantly assisting in refining
    the granularity of monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors
    [33] emphasized the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with
    air quality monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle
    with the issue of cross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.
    Moreover, these sensors are extremely susceptible to unexpected variations in
    humidity, temperature, and wind direction, and as a result, their accuracy deteriorates
    with time. A recalibration routine might be a way to maintain and enhance such
    accuracy. However, because it would take a lot more time and work, this technique
    is highly improbable and would not work for large-scale deployments. In a weather
    monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex and involves three steps [34]:
    (1) Observing: It can be performed by monitoring satellite imagery, precipitation
    reports, surface data, and gathering data from other nearby forecasters. (2) Forecasting:
    It can be performed by forecasters as short-term and long-term forecasting. Short-term
    forecasting is carried out by evaluating the current weather conditions and projecting
    them over the next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics of the weather.
    Long-term forecasting, however, is possible through weather (numerical) modeling
    and the projection of such modeling using computer simulations. To produce these
    simulations for future forecasting, these modeling techniques use environmental
    data from satellite photography, weather balloons, and surface observations. Following
    completion of the forecasting, the forecasters translate the produced simulated
    expected output into a perceptible format for non-specialists so that they can
    respond appropriately. (3) Communicating: Finally, they communicate such output
    or forecasted information to appropriate authorities. Despite the fact that all
    of these computer models are used to forecast the weather, the success of each
    one is largely influenced by three different elements: (a) the quantity of precise
    data; (b) the length of time needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity
    of dynamic atmospheric weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data
    for a region is the placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed
    distant from rural areas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather
    enough information for desert, sea, or even rural areas to supply the computer
    models used to predict weather conditions accurately. Forecasters also use satellite
    data to combat this issue. However, because of cloud cover and significant changes
    in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, satellite data accuracy can occasionally
    be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and map information or surface/land
    features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence, it further impacts temperature
    and precipitation values significantly. This further makes things harder for a
    computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there is a need to re-evaluate and
    re-modify such models’ mathematical equations so that they can predict the changes
    more accurately. Smart Waste Management Systems: Automated smart waste management
    is crucial for the following reasons: (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure;
    (2) thin or delicate waste collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective
    waste logistics management; (4) insufficient use of cutting-edge trash treatment
    and recycling technologies; and (5) lack of workers and specialists with the necessary
    technical and non-technical skills to handle garbage disposal and the associated
    infrastructures. Smart waste management schemes include various steps such as
    (1) waste collection; (2) differentiation of waste as per their biological and
    physical properties; (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage disposal
    infrastructures/treatment plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova
    and Porras [35] identified issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing
    data from smart deployed sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some
    operational issues such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure
    and smartly managing waste vehicle routes. Smart Street Lighting Systems: This
    system is a network-oriented solution that uses streetlights fitted with specific
    actuators and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities and connectivity interfaces
    [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a mechanism that
    gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting with
    the use of smart wireless nodes (fitted out with numerous forms of sensors and
    actuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the streetlights,
    and they are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device. Zanella et
    al. [37] insist that their system could assist in gathering environmental parameters
    such as humidity, air temperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors stated
    that optimizing street lighting efficiency is a paramount concern that must be
    addressed. This monitoring system makes it possible to maximize efficiency since
    it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity in response to the time of
    day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this system is simple and
    built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns that require
    particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions and communication
    among heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right light lamp is critical
    for a power-efficient lighting mechanism. Their selection is based on how effective
    they are in terms of power usage and lifespan. The existing metropolitan system
    relies on Metal Halide (MH) or High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs,
    these bulbs are frequently seen as being inefficient in terms of power consumption
    and requiring significant maintenance, which adds significantly to the cost. In
    addition, the system should be designed following the advised design standards
    (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201) [36]. Currently, there are
    three kinds of control systems for smart lighting systems in use: centralized,
    decentralized, and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a variety
    of security assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem
    thus far. Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and
    security of its residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention,
    dealing with natural calamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data
    collection is first and foremost important for the designing portion of these
    applications. Depending on the gathered facts, the development of intelligence
    (which aids in making important decisions) and the ability to respond swiftly
    and quickly are the issues that require special attention. When it comes to gathering
    data, we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated traffic sensors. A developer
    can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will conduct predictive
    analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore, this
    kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather significant information
    that will help the relevant authorities (e.g., the fire safety department, the
    police department, and law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and
    preventive measures. The concept of widespread surveillance has important benefits
    for security and safety. However, keeping track of such vast amounts of data also
    prompts a lot of worries and issues for designers and developers, including storage;
    the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and, most importantly, the question
    of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track of each individual
    (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether this kind of
    widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such as China and
    India, where a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation. Further, Gharaibeh
    et al. [38] claimed that combining information transmission technologies with
    well-implemented data analytics models is necessary for quick and swift collaboration.
    To save as many lives as possible during natural disasters, it is imperative to
    gather, assess, and communicate vital information to the relevant authorities.
    As a result, there is currently a lot of work being done to enhance the performance
    of information exchange systems. Although this system is based on the IoT concept
    and is relatively simple, it faces important problems that need consideration,
    such as complex networking solutions and information sharing across heterogeneous
    devices on time (time-sensitive application). Smart Residence/Home Automation:
    A smart home has highly developed systems such as a control system for devices
    or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems, TVs, and other smart appliances),
    automated door openers, smart appliances that may send users remote status updates,
    smart refrigerators, and washing machines. A user can control the majority of
    smart home appliances remotely with two recently produced gadgets: Google Home
    and Amazon Echo. In a smart home, the end-user demands a high-speed internet connection,
    so they can access networking sites that control the home with HD live streaming
    services. In contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to
    computing servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence,
    data management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to
    concentrate on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than
    just recommending distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38].
    The concept of smart home automation raises serious concerns about security and
    privacy risks. A smart home includes security monitoring systems with motion sensors,
    wirelessly opening smart door locks, televisions, phones, and other smart appliances
    that are highly outfitted with cameras and microphones. Although these gadgets
    improve the system, little research has been done on their privacy and security
    features. If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we will discover
    that their manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.
    Indeed, Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully
    examining Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market.
    They argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already
    more privileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated applications.
    As a result, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this, according to a published
    document by WikiLeaks [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the
    tools to access, control, and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the
    world. Furthermore, criminal entities and hackers could seize control of smart
    personal devices, capture delicate private information, and exploit that information
    immorally typically through user tracking and profiling. Additionally, a hacker
    may break into one of these smart applications, grab vital information, and then
    use it to launch any kind of attack. For instance, based on motion sensors, security
    camera feeds, and power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where and when
    to break into the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized
    parties, they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware
    and software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard
    against all these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators, etc.,
    are impervious to such security and privacy attacks. Smart Grid Networks: The
    functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirectional (i.e., electricity
    is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers). Electricity
    has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks to the
    deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in an open-loop
    fashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures in the
    distribution sector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little or no real-time
    knowledge of the system’s operating conditions and dynamically changing load.
    There are also several technical, economic, and environmental problems with this
    conventional approach. Therefore, this conventional system must become dependable,
    manageable, and scalable, as well as flexible, secure, and interoperable [42].
    The smart grid is the next invention of the Electric Power System (EPS) that incorporates
    quicker, more secure, and reliable communication networks [43]. Smart grids supplement
    the conventional electricity grid by incorporating renewable energy sources such
    as biomass, solar energy, and wind energy. These energy sources are much cleaner
    and more ecologically friendly than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil
    fuels. However, it is important to identify the most suitable communication technology
    for the smart grid’s successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s
    overall communication style is unique compared with conventional network communication
    patterns. The communication network architecture of the smart grid must be able
    to handle information exchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,
    and numerous smart meters in such a particular environment with little to no human
    intervention. This type of communication, called Device-to-Device (D2D) communication,
    is autonomous and may be initiated in response to an event or at regular intervals.
    Notably, depending on how these smart grid applications were built, their QoS
    requirements and characteristics differ greatly in terms of delay, burst size,
    and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement of a smart meter
    event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent grid networks,
    the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the same network present
    the issues of flexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications based on the
    smart grid can be developed and implemented using the current wireless and wired
    networking infrastructure and technologies. For some devices, such as smart meters,
    designing and standardizing acceptable smart grid-based protocols is a critical
    matter [45]. Furthermore, these smart grid-based networks are too dependent on
    intelligent sensors, actuators, and other devices. This makes them extremely vulnerable
    to attacks by malicious users. These smart grids could be taken over by malevolent
    users or hackers, who could then obtain unauthorized access to many smart meters
    and alter crucial data. Moreover, as the existing electricity system is insufficient
    for establishing smart grid systems, high-level adjustments to current power infrastructure
    scenarios are required. Subsequently, these smart systems require high installation
    costs because the installation requires a large number of smart meters, sensors,
    and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efficient operation of
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free
    network channel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent
    applications. Many surveys [42,43,44,45,47] reviewed communication frameworks
    for smart grids, smart-grid-based networking technologies, traffic management,
    and the requirements of numerous smart grid applications. Further, Kansal and
    Bose [48] presented their insights on transmission grid applications regarding
    their latency and bandwidth requirements. 3. Network Requirements for SCAs This
    section considers several communication requirements including reliability, delay
    tolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security, network type, heterogeneous
    network support, and mobility support. It also studies the aptness of different
    network protocols for dissimilar SCAs. Smart city services and applications need
    robust and dependable communication support as well as an effective networking
    infrastructure, which will permit competent message-sharing procedures among the
    components of the smart city systems [49]. Every smart city system has an intricate
    networking architecture made up of various networking components. Therefore, smart
    city systems are innately required to have a variety of networking requirements.
    To access the far-off destination, which may be clouds, the network traffic from
    a broad variety of deployed diverse applications uses a common networking architecture
    and resources. These resources may consist of switches, routers, communication
    connections (links), and other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing
    faraway clouds or far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently
    brings up problems with high packet loss probability, significant delay, and constrained
    network bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered
    when developing, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart
    cities. Otherwise, users would be reluctant to approve the use of such applications
    in the absence of adequate security safeguards. Such intelligent applications
    need a high-speed networking environment where the quick reaction may be managed
    with the support of the ability of a fast-processing speed. Furthermore, a variety
    of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city, based on their usefulness
    and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have different networking
    requirements, particularly in terms of response and security [50]. For example,
    the networking requirements of smart emergency response systems are quite different
    compared to other applications such as smart healthcare systems. Emergency response
    smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick to react [50]. In contrast,
    smart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily need to be especially
    dynamic. − Network Protocols: Monitoring applications for smart cities often use
    a dense network of heterogeneous sensor nodes, including fixed sensor nodes, mobile
    sensor nodes, and crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for
    Machines (LTE-M), extended coverage GSM IoT, and fifth-generation (5G) technologies
    [52] are intriguing options to support such heterogeneous networks. First, the
    bulk of crowd-sensing nodes (smartphones) is already supported by LTE communications.
    Consequently, no further wireless communication devices are required. To save
    energy, LTE and 5G can be utilized on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads)
    to allow the data gathered by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring
    center via base stations (the backbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.
    − Zigbee [53], WiFi, and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary
    nodes to communicate within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing
    the sensor node clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network
    connectivity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes
    maintenance simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies
    also make possible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance
    of real-time monitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance, can
    accommodate video streams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.
    The fast data rates provided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous for
    the sink nodes or clusters. The use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)
    in structural health monitoring applications of bridges, tunnels, or towers is
    fairly common. The cluster heads will be able to send the vibration data in this
    situation in real time. In conclusion, practically all applications for smart
    city monitoring that demand a high data throughput and minimal delay may be satisfied
    by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there are some new sensor node standards, such as
    IEEE 802.11 ah [55], LoRaWAN [56], and Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband
    protocols offer numerous advantages: greater coverage, improved scalability, reduced
    energy usage, and increased device longevity. Researchers have tested these standards
    in more than a few applications, including street lighting, energy metering, and
    home automation, even though some are still being discussed and revised. The new
    narrowband communication standards enable the sensor nodes to run more sustainably,
    which is beneficial for applications that aim for long-term monitoring. In addition
    to these protocols and standards, the FogC architecture [58] aids in monitoring
    smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile users (the potential crowd-sensing
    providers) and the cloud are connected via fog servers. These fog servers are
    WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users are more inclined to
    participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing measurements
    to the fog server in just one hop, significantly decreasing the cost and energy
    usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the
    FogC architecture, such as the nearby traffic conditions. The service latency
    and response time are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates
    directly from the fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone
    network. Lastly, using the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is crucial
    to getting the best possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and cost. The
    networks may be hierarchical so that diverse roles and functions can be assigned
    at various layers to increase the networks’ dependability and cost-effectiveness.
    As a result, certain nodes may be able to transmit data utilizing various protocols.
    − Bandwidth requirements: Many video applications in smart cities require high
    bandwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors capture video from the physical
    environment. Moreover, video transmission is more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional
    scalar data traffic in IoT. Examples of these applications are intelligent multimedia
    surveillance systems for home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring
    systems, traffic monitoring systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based
    monitoring of an environmental system. − Delay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart
    transportation, only tolerate a small amount of end-to-end delay. For example,
    to prevent imminent danger to the vehicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data
    that are being relayed must arrive within microseconds. Therefore, the control
    systems must react in time. However, other applications have a higher tolerance
    for delays [49]. Such applications rely on data monitoring and information gathering
    for upcoming analysis. − Power Consumption: Another crucial need for applications
    is power consumption. Smart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy
    sources can tolerate protocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45]. Other
    applications have medium power needs and require energy sources with limited capacities.
    One example of such an application is intelligent transportation. Other applications
    demand protocols with low or very low energy consumption characteristics since
    they have limited energy resources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), smart water
    networks, and pipeline monitoring for gas and oil are a few examples of such uses.
    − Reliability: The majority of applications have medium reliability requirements.
    A typical example of such applications is smart water networks. Some other applications
    have high-reliability necessities such as intelligent transportation and smart
    grids [49]. − Security: The majority of applications need medium to high security.
    Applications such as production control and monitoring, for instance, need medium
    security, whilst others, such as smart grids, need high security because of the
    sensitivity of the data and the importance of the operations carried out [50].
    − Heterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city systems use networking
    protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent transportation and
    smart buildings are two examples of such systems. These protocols must coexist
    in such situations without conflicting with one another. To ensure seamless and
    effective operation, it is also necessary to correctly map the control information
    in the headers at the various networking stack tiers used by the many heterogeneous
    protocols and networks. − Wired/wireless connectivity: The majority of SCAs that
    include wireless connectivity are UAVs and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines.
    Others, including intelligent transportation and smart buildings, use wired and
    wireless connectivity [50]. In these situations, wired networking may be used
    for communication within a specific physical system (such as within a UAV), while
    wireless communication may be used to link the physical system to other such systems
    that are comparable to it or to the backbone and infrastructure networks. − Mobility:
    Some systems, such as the smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil, and
    smart water networks, have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such as
    UAVs and intelligent transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility
    smart city systems can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and
    adaptable to node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control
    messages and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.
    Table 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network
    with low, medium, or high traffic rates and supporting high or low mobility of
    devices. Each SCA is based on different protocols and requires different bandwidth
    and latency tolerance. In each SCA, the number of devices involved differs. Table
    1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements. 3.1. Additional
    Challenges − Interoperability: Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous
    networking protocols that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at
    the physical and data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated
    seamlessly, these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks,
    the IEEE 1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface
    between physical/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this
    function. Future research should focus on the creation of similar protocols to
    increase the support system for smart city systems. − Scalability: A smart city
    platform must manage many devices that are connected to the city’s infrastructure.
    Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously produced and consumed
    by devices and client applications, must be stored and processed. The platform
    must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests from users and services
    that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change depending on the features
    of the city as well as the installed applications and services. Recently, Del
    Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source smart
    city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale systems,
    apps, and services for smart cities. − Load Balancing: To maximize the usage of
    resources, load balancing assigns appropriate resources (i.e., network resources,
    storage capacity, computational resources, and energy resources) to user tasks.
    A large-scale IoT network performs better and avoids overload thanks to an effective
    load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time, cost, throughput, performance, and
    resource usage are all improved in terms of QoS parameters. − The Cloud/Edge/FogC
    Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation of smart city prototypes.
    These computing paradigms efficiently aid in the gathering, upkeep, and analysis
    of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that demand advanced processing
    and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems for smart cities
    have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time applications present
    the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently, FogC and Edge Computing
    have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing, implementing, deploying,
    and controlling such systems/applications. These paradigms bring computing resources
    closer to the IoT/device plane so that the primary computation can be done locally
    [65,66]. Each computing paradigm offers particular assistance based on the requirements
    of the application at hand. For example, to support a cloud-based SCA, ClCom offers
    centralized storage and processing capacity. For certain SCAs, ClCom can offer
    scalable processing power and data storage [5]. The features of ClCom (e.g., powerful
    processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge software services)
    can be used to provide various support services for a variety of SCAs. ClCom can
    be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The city’s ClCom services
    can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs to gather, process,
    store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes of data are gathered
    across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The sophisticated platforms
    required for storing and analyzing this massive amount of data to improve operations
    and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing. To effectively support SCAs,
    the communication between city sensors and actuators and ClCom may involve various
    communication requirements. The network architectures used in the smart city should
    meet these requirements. Smart applications require the integration of sensors,
    actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function well with a robust network
    that offers good communication services linking both sides. The fact that cloud
    services are either provided at a single central location or across numerous distributed
    platforms in various locations is another problem that occurs when adopting ClCom
    for a smart city. For many cloud applications, the distributed ClCom strategy
    can offer greater quality and dependability support [67]. However, it is frequently
    necessary to establish effective communication channels between the distributed
    ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability and
    efficiency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control
    of network resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot be
    avoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated the QoS
    requirements of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment to recognize
    QoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog) that is inspired
    by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture [69] for a
    FogC system. 3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks A smart city
    network has the following features [70]: Large Densities: A smart city network
    has a very large density as thousands of smart devices are distributed in the
    area of a city. Abnormal Traffic Patterns: Cascading or synchronization among
    smart devices produces extremely bursty or correlated traffic patterns. These
    traffic patterns differ from the regular social-generated traffic patterns on
    which most existing schemes and technology used in our society are based. Disorganized
    Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless connectivity features, smart
    city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology. The problem arises when
    smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless channels, where packet losses
    caused by wireless channel special properties are extremely common and eventually
    have an impact on the functioning of the smart city system. Therefore, it appears
    very improbable that a single high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.
    Heterogeneity: SCAs use a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,
    latency, throughput, and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates
    at a unique trade-off threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist
    on a single platform. Coexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication
    technologies used in smart cities are distributed over the same radio space. At
    the same time, independent radio infrastructures are connected through a variety
    of wireless channels. Under such circumstances, the SCA must handle interference
    issues with competence. Security and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to
    several risks from malevolent users. The majority of specialized smart sensors,
    actuators, and other intelligent devices are developed by designers without considering
    security measures. Such applications may be highly vulnerable due to hostile actors’
    ease of access to these cutting-edge technologies and potential threats to people’s
    security and privacy. The main challenges for smart city networks are as follows
    [70]: Lack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies
    for Personal Area Networks (PANs) and the IEEE 802.11 groups for wireless LANs
    adopt the concept of single-hop ad-hoc networking. These standards permit direct
    communication between two devices that are in the transmission range of each other.
    At the same time, the multi-hop ad-hoc networking paradigm enables the communication
    between any two devices which are not necessarily in their transmission range
    [71]. A problem that researchers must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous
    sets of devices (i.e., actuators, sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate
    uniformly without any standardization. Global distributors and manufacturers must
    propose and accept standardized network solutions that enable communication between
    diverse devices on homogeneous communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is the dominant solution that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical
    Layer. This standard deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication
    range, and power consumption. Several revisions or amendments (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g
    and IEEE 802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released. The IEEE 802.15.4g
    amendment allows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing data rates and communication
    ranges compatible with neighborhood mesh (wide) networks. Then, it is followed
    by another cutting-edge modification, known as IEEE 802.15.4e, which modifies
    and enhances the method used by devices to access wireless channels while also
    using time-slotted channel hopping mode. This hopping mode further delivers low-power
    consumption and improved dependability. From another viewpoint, many researchers
    customized appropriate upper-layer protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They
    made the necessary modifications there to make smart applications compatible with
    conventional infrastructure. Since the network of low-power smart devices is confined,
    the researchers developed numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make
    them easily adaptable. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72]
    and 6LoWPAN [73], which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.
    Interference problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same
    radio space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless
    channels. Because of this, the smart application must handle interference problems
    in such situations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate
    and be compatible with one another. Vertical handover (soft): Multiple radios
    are used by the rapidly expanding number of smart devices being developed. These
    devices should be able to recognize and use the best interface that is currently
    available while balancing power usage and throughput. D2D Communications: In the
    IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication demands. Unfortunately, conventional
    network gateways cannot handle such generated messages from heterogeneous devices.
    Short Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support and recommend acceptable
    performance for longer data packet scenarios. However, smart devices communicate
    with one another using short messages (since most of them are tiny and operate
    over low-powered battery devices). To this end, short communicating messages will
    positively impact network congestion detection and avoidance policies and promote
    in-band aggregation. Local Network Traffic Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-specific
    devices frequently use the same network infrastructure. However, most cellular
    data networks are exclusively planned, implemented, deployed, and managed for
    smartphone usage. Fitting traffic from these heterogeneous devices onto a single
    platform is now the main challenge that cellular data network providers face.
    It is difficult to integrate the traffic from these two types of heterogeneous
    devices into the same network infrastructure due to several intrinsic factors
    and the specified features of this traditional network. Additionally, D2D devices
    use a more significant proportion of scarce resources than smartphones, unnecessarily
    creating a problem of unfairness in the system [74]. Therefore, we must first
    comprehend D2D traffic patterns and how they differ from traffic patterns generated
    by smartphones. Understanding traffic patterns can provide insights into managing
    and allocating shared network resources more effectively and guarantee the highest
    level of service quality for both types of devices. Security mechanisms: Denial
    of Service (DoS) attacks are a remarkable threat to the security of smart city
    networks and must be identified. Some statistical methods have been proposed to
    solve this problem. Such a statistical method is presented in [75] that is based
    on feature distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis process. Another
    security mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying users and devices
    in a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-manipulated devices.
    Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT systems such as the
    reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation attack, and the
    Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be encrypted.
    However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might be able
    to embed general-purpose microprocessors for this task. In addition, low resources
    and constrained devices can only embed application-specific integrated circuits.
    Therefore, conventional cryptographic primitives are not suitable for low-resource
    smart devices due to their low computation power, limited battery life, small
    size, small memory, and limited power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography
    may be an efficient encryption for these devices. Trust management is another
    security mechanism that detects and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure
    access control. Automated and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate
    the trust values of the participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of
    trust management schemes focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based
    access control methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large
    number of smart things storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,
    transparent, and easy access control management so that different nodes/users
    can be granted different levels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain
    technology can be used to create secure virtual zones where things can identify
    and trust each other [77]. Self-organization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can also
    be planned to set up the relationship between Blockchain and IoT, as suggested
    in [78]. Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that flow through
    the IoT system can vary to a great extent, in terms of either format, shape (in
    time and space), and semantics. Therefore, the process of separating normal from
    abnormal sensed data is extremely demanding. In the context of IoT applications,
    sensors are the real source of big data, which suggests that anomaly detection
    at the edge could be a powerful tool to address the inevitable data communication
    bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is concerned with identifying data patterns that
    deviate remarkably from the expected behavior. This is critical in the process
    of finding out important information about the IoT system’s functioning, detecting
    abnormalities that are often rare or difficult to model or, otherwise, to predict
    [79]. A timely identification of anomalies is vital to preventing IoT system failure.
    Advanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artificial intelligence (AI), machine
    learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) play a key role in the evolution
    of the smart city sectors [80]. These techniques are now being developed as solutions
    for completely automated IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal
    analysis of the big data is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing
    DRL/ML approaches can improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency;
    and increase precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality
    prediction, person detection, traffic management, etc. For example, an intelligent
    transportation system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize
    self-driving vehicles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques
    are also used to precisely monitor and estimate the real-time traffic flow data
    in an urban environment. In SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned
    techniques can enhance the safety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,
    management, and power grid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective
    use of smart meter big data for different applications such as load assessment
    and prediction, baseline estimation, demand response, load clustering, and malicious
    data deception attacks. In health intelligence, extensive use of AI, ML, and DRL
    techniques is implemented due to high-performance IoT devices, Cloud Computing,
    and an increase in data rates. These techniques can play a vital role in disease
    diagnosis, cure prediction, social media analytics for a particular disease, and
    medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role of AI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques
    is also outstanding. These techniques can be used from an advanced security perspective
    of IoT to confront security threats. Notably, the accuracy and precision of the
    aforementioned techniques can be further enhanced by increasing the amount of
    training data to strengthen their learning capabilities and hence the automated
    decision efficiencies [82]. 4. Protocols Used for SCAs Figure 3 shows a proposed
    taxonomy of networking protocols and architectures for SCAs. It also shows the
    challenges in IoT communications via TCP/IP. Figure 3. A taxonomy of technologies
    facilitating communication and networking for smart cities with IoT-enabled application
    protocols and suggested networking architectures and protocols. SCAs involve numerous
    smart things that operate on low-powered battery devices [83]. New connectivity
    solutions are being investigated in light of the following question: do the currently
    available methods, tools, and techniques—especially those for wireless networks—allow
    for the reliable handling of such a large number of smart devices? Yaqoob et al.
    [84] provided details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN technologies
    such as ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D communication.
    In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of connected devices,
    transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies (e.g.,
    WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve significant power consumption and are only partially
    applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies and communication
    strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication perspective.
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput performance
    for fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior context.
    Due to the limitations of its initial design, this standard does not support IoT
    applications. Hence, to enable IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the
    community (IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efficient protocol
    [55]. They aim to create a system that enables effective communication between
    several indoor and outdoor devices. Nevertheless, the real-time implementation
    of IEEE 802.11 ah may need to be improved by the absence of an appropriate interference
    mechanism. IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n,
    Cellular 3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of
    standards and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various
    SCAs. Smart home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems
    require short-range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g.,
    Bluetooth and Zigbee) from the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by
    a lower bandwidth requirement, minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication
    infrastructure environment. In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for
    SCAs that require longer-range communication. Such applications are smart transportation
    management systems. The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX,
    can be adopted by applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart
    emergency response systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart
    grid systems. These features designed in terms of standards or protocols have
    enough capability that allows for both synchronous and asynchronous data connections.
    The best-effort traffic (which can effectively tolerate latency) allows the asynchronous
    data connections feature to be linked with smart city services or applications.
    Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connections is possible for those services
    or applications that generate traffic mandating strict QoS standards such as low
    latency and high accessible network capacity [49]. Since IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee)
    is a short-range (low bit rate) communication protocol that often suggests higher
    flexibility for small devices running on low power, such a protocol can significantly
    increase network lifetime. Moreover, such a protocol encourages and indicates
    support for applications and services with relatively relaxed latency and throughput
    conditions in WPANs. The authors of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4
    and proposed an intelligent system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted
    the benefits of using wireless emulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation
    and deployment, relatively easier in expanding a network, and flexibility in the
    system due to the use of wireless technology, which supports the usage of heterogeneous
    devices in the same implemented and deployed structure. Furthermore, they emphasized
    the advantages of employing the same intelligent infrastructure for a variety
    of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring, and cost-effectiveness.
    For example, by including specific smart metering devices such as water or gas
    meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established to
    target smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering applications.
    5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called BDMA and FBMC multiple
    access, which was first launched in 2015. In the case of BDMA multiple access,
    an orthogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that resources can be distributed
    in parallel to each mobile base station by dividing the antenna beam in accordance
    with the position of the mobile stations to enable multiple accesses to the base
    stations. Successively, this helps in improving the capacity of 5G networks [86].
    Specifically, the idea of moving towards 5G is based on current technology advancements
    and particularly on unique customer needs. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed
    that implemented 5G cellular networks should address noteworthy complications
    that are not successfully addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced network capacity and
    data rate, lower End-to-End (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and consistent user QoE
    provisioning. In addition, massive and rapid growth in the number of highly developed
    connected devices leads to a sharp increase in network traffic and a widening
    range of applications with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta and
    Jha [86] studied numerous facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive
    MIMO, traffic and power management policies, offloading (local), and self-configuring
    and organizing networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time
    managing and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days
    thanks to 5G. 5G ultimately targets some networking possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable
    and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and
    massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). In a smart city context, eMBB controls
    data transfer between a variety of networked user end devices, edge devices, or
    cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC aims to manage huge connected, complex devices,
    such as wearables, actuators, and sensors, through dense urban deployment. Finally,
    uRLLC takes responsibility for managing highly time-critical communication such
    as vehicular communication, base stations, and edge devices communication [87].
    Although 5G has completely brought about a new revolution in the field of networking,
    numerous unknown challenges still are possible in these cases of communication
    when 5G is deployed in the context of smart cities. One major problem is power-efficient
    communication, especially when communicating low-powered battery devices such
    as sensors and other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when two distinct
    technologies (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Specific device-level
    compatibility problems might always persist when communication infrastructures
    migrate to next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely,
    how to handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or
    difficult-to-reach places, as well as the potential high costs associated with
    building and maintaining 5G networks. Table 2 compares protocols used for smart
    cities, while Table 3 evaluates standards utilizing features and characteristics.
    Table 2. Comparison of protocols used for smart cities. Adapted and extended from
    [49,84,88]. Table 3. Evaluation of standards utilizing their features. 4.1. IEEE
    802.11 Standards Table 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features. Table
    4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features. 4.2. IEEE 802.15.1 The
    IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave time
    division duplex mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with
    a 1 Mbps data rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services
    designed to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include
    Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the
    IoT [98]. The deployment of services offered for tracking and localization devices
    is typically suggested by BLE-based devices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.
    These beacons produce a signal that other compatible devices can pick up between
    50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises greater indoor localization accuracy
    than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can be used for a wide range
    of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch of points of
    sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally, to provide
    specific services of interest, it is frequently required to combine the BLE technology
    with other technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the aim of BLE technology
    (Bluetooth Classic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous wireless connection,
    i.e., BlueTooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR). It became the perfect
    option for the IoT since it permits connectivity and audio-streaming applications
    using brief bursts of long-distance radio, which lowers the battery consumption
    of mobile devices (because they need not be connected all the time). Using the
    idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE specification, smartphones or regular
    phones can be linked to other heterogeneous devices (such as headphones) in BR/EDR
    mode. Otherwise, they can be connected to wearables in LE mode. A low-power radio
    called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends to broadcast data across 79 channels in the
    2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. Wireless audio streaming is primarily made
    possible through BCR, which has evolved into the industry-standard radio protocol
    for in-car entertainment systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims
    to transmit data over 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To
    facilitate the deployment of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks
    to provide support for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast;
    and, most notably, mesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create
    distribution and locating maps utilizing fingerprint templates for indoor device
    and user localization. Due to BLE’s greater susceptibility to abrupt fading and
    substantial changes in received signal strength, it has been proven that using
    BLE is more efficient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101]. However, Bluetooth
    technology has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly when its BR/EDR
    mode is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the master nodes
    to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered
    a variety of scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the
    BR/EDR mode reveals a lack of scalability that further restricts the performance
    of the system. 4.3. LoRA The LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications
    and operated as a low-data-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum
    that could go up to 10 km. LoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth: 125,
    250, and 500 KHz. Even while this technology can function at the largest bandwidth
    class, which further improves data rate, it still causes issues with high power
    consumption, a shorter communication range, and an increase in the likelihood
    of interference because it is free to operate in a wider frequency spectrum. This
    method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation and a CSSM variant
    with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission range will expand
    as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption will rise as
    well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby making it resilient
    to channel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not differentiate the noise
    in the channel such as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK modulation approach, which
    normally identifies signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise floor, the CSSM
    feature enables this technology to sense, perceive, and capture signals that are
    19.5 dB below the noise floor [103]. Its architecture uses a star network topology
    and includes gateways and end nodes. In this design, end nodes are referred to
    as slaves and run on battery-powered devices with limited power, but gateways
    are thought of as powerful machines that gather data from slave nodes. Furthermore,
    LoRaWAN is a communication layer that operates on top of LoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates
    the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability and suitability for
    low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over cellular technologies,
    which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice, LoRaWAN improved
    network features and functionalities by addressing the concept of a specialized
    server (network) and specifically defining numerous device types to meet the needs
    of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet filtering, and
    packet scheduling are all made possible using specialized network servers. LoRaWAN
    has also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission power and
    rate, which aids in optimizing network performance in terms of power consumption
    and throughput. This technology can be employed for a wide range of applications,
    such as smart health nursing [104], traffic monitoring [105], agriculture monitoring
    [106], localization [107], and smart grid applications [108]. In particular, this
    technology is useful for non-latency-sensitive applications and those that call
    for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al. [109] and Adelantado et al. [110]
    emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart metering, tracking, and localization-based
    applications. At the same time, it is not so feasible for real-time monitoring
    and video surveillance. 4.4. WiMAX WiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential
    peak data rate of 60 Mbps for an entire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps
    for an entirely uplink operation, based on the original IEEE 802.16 air interface
    standard (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amendment [112]. It can be done using
    two antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz. Additionally, it may provide
    support for multimedia services with different traffic characteristics and wide
    area mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety of QoS
    scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous traffic, such as Internet data
    traffic, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio traffic, and voice and video streams
    [113]. Table 5 shows the specified WiMAX standards and their operational parameters
    [114]. This standard provides a communication channel between geographically separated
    devices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges between 30
    km and 100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such as high installation
    costs and the possibility of complications and irregularities when dealing with
    high-definition multimedia traffic. Table 5. WiMAX standards and their operational
    parameters. Wireless network traffic has recently increased extraordinarily due
    to the rapid proliferation of smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators.
    These devices, along with smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based
    specialized devices, are the most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network
    environments. In such a dense network environment, interference is a critical
    issue that must be addressed if satisfactory performance and, thus, proficient
    spatial frequency reuse is required. Subsequently, the standards IEEE 802.11 were
    designed and implemented to support these requirements. Numerous international
    organizations, including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved their technologies
    in response to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance, the original
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior throughput
    performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as
    a result, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a result,
    to address the challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group
    (TG) was formed by the IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to redesign and
    extend the applicability of WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They focused on the
    critical issue of power-aware efficient schemes and protocols to extend the functionality
    and applicability of 802.11-based networks while dealing with a variety of small
    power-constrained smart outdoor and indoor devices [55,97]. 4.5. Challenges in
    IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite In IoT, smart sensing motes,
    devices, and actuators share unique features such as constrained memory, power,
    and processing capabilities; the need for facilitating real-time requirements
    of smart applications; extremely vulnerable radio environments; and little to
    no human involvement after deployment [115]. By enabling communication amongst
    these devices utilizing low-power-cost technologies, a new infrastructure for
    deployed smart services has been formed. Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP
    protocol suite might provide a solution and be flexible enough for a variety of
    evolving IoT communication scenarios. Unfortunately, there were additional challenges
    that network administrators, designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers
    were searching for the best way to install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally
    use the system’s limited resources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of such
    power constraints, researchers highlighted the requirements of low-power Layer-2
    technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4) and low-power WiFi usage. In contrast
    with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies operate with smaller maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission speeds. IoT network protocol
    designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining the ideal MTU size. Another
    obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless networks and
    thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies. This vulnerability
    brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture: (1) The current IP addressing
    model cannot assist mesh communication (since it relies on a multi-link subnet
    prototype) at all. (2) In mesh communication, the multicasting and broadcasting
    communication methods are quite expensive, power-demanding, and prohibitive as
    the network nodes are extremely power constrained. Moreover, unicasting is the
    only remaining alternative method. (3) Unicasting is power intensive in and of
    itself because it may take many hops while forwarding and may wake up an excessive
    number of nodes that are asleep. Notably, idle nodes and hops can modify the radio
    state’s operation mode to save power. Additionally, a large amount of power is
    used and saved by a node during transmission, reception, overhearing, idle, and
    sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful delivery, we cannot just
    alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective coordination and intricate
    synchronization [117,118]. (4) There is a high requirement for scalable routing/forwarding
    schemes for IP communication to take place over mesh architectural systems. (5)
    For many IoT applications requiring data prioritizing and customized control,
    original TCP-suited features such as those operational on fixed MSS sizes (such
    as MTU sizes) that further lead to silly window syndrome or in-order byte-stream
    delivery to ensure dependability, are unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF
    started defining standard Internet protocols such as RPL [120] for such specialized
    environments to minimize protocol overheads that impair the computing ability
    and memory management of these specialized resource-constrained devices. WiFi-based
    infrastructure networks enable backhauling support, which helps establish and
    sustain seamless connectivity among smart IoT devices. In smart home wireless
    networks, this form of connectivity can be provided through TCP connections. The
    TCP/IP protocol suite supports dependable data delivery and congestion control
    strategies to maintain network throughput performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP
    is a protocol that has been regularly modified and improved over the years to
    effectively transport large amounts of byte-stream in-ordered data via resilient
    P2P connections with comparatively lower latency needs. IoT services deal with
    atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP protocol suite-based protocols,
    such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns adequately [119]. There are severe
    problems that TCP faces when it deals with an IoT application: (1) TCP connection
    establishment and termination (three-way handshaking) incur significant overhead
    in the system as most communication in an IoT application includes the transmission
    of brief segments and relatively little data. (2) TCP functionality needs resilient
    P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these connections in an IoT network
    environment because smart sensors and other connected devices switch their mode
    of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119]. (3) Some IoT applications
    might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns, and enabling such patterns
    via TCP will result in substantial network overhead in the entire IoT system and
    high-power consumption. (4) Some IoT services have very granular delay requirements,
    and any extra delay in the form of connection establishment or MSS creation (waiting
    for data to fill the entire MSS) is completely unacceptable for their performance.
    Thus, TCP is unable to provide much support for these IoT services. (5) IoT applications
    that rely on wireless communication scenarios must deal with critical wireless
    channel characteristics such as channel error, interference, and wireless interface
    properties that result in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer contention-induced,
    and collision-induced packet losses. When TCP operates in such a setting, its
    stringent in-order delivery requirements and retransmission policies (i.e., fast
    retransmission) may occasionally result in very serious system problems such as
    Head-of-Line (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in a
    reduction in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121,122,123,124].
    Furthermore, wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may further
    impair TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP Retransmission
    Time Out timer. Some standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement
    Layer-4 functionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed to
    utilize UDP as an underlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should depend
    on an application’s requirements, which may vary from application to application.
    However, TCP and its updated variants rely on the concept of data delivery deferment
    and try to perform retransmissions from an already created copy in the sender
    buffer. However, this is not the only approach to dealing with packet losses in
    the network. Another method is for AppL to accept packet delivery that is not
    completely flawless and proceed with its current operations. This feature will
    be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution. Additionally, retransmission
    is an additional option. However, AppL should handle this retransmission rather
    than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost
    data bits, doing so enables the source application to reconstruct them. Furthermore,
    in situations where real-time services are severely constrained, the transmitting
    application may transmit fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair”
    the effects of the initial loss [126]. Clark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these
    concepts and subsequently introduced the concept of Application Level Framing
    (ALF). Implementing Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself brings the idea of employing
    ALF into the system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF, a network can recognize
    individual Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently can offer support for
    flexible Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission procedures
    for diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using in-network
    caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails
    to provide support for the ALF scheme [119]. 4.6. Compound TCP for IoT Compound
    TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel utilization
    and fairness performances. It will play a significant role in home networks with
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128]. Pokhrel and Williamson [115]
    studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an IoT scenario involving sensors
    and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home appliances). They
    analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of connections made
    using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks in the presence
    of significant buffer-overflow-induced losses and severely degraded transmission
    channel circumstances. The authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements
    for all IoT devices as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional
    bandwidth-hungry Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated
    a thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted
    classical devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overflow-induced losses
    and significantly deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of
    [115,129] suggested models that aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion
    and flow control of several concurrently running competitive long-lived compound
    TCP connections. In evaluating and developing these models, they considered MAC-level
    retransmissions, link-layer contention, channel failures, and collision. The authors
    of [130] utilized a transient model suggesting a new queue management scheme to
    capture the interactions of short-lived TCP flows (the most workable flows in
    IoT scenarios) over conventional traffic patterns over WiFi networks. However,
    the performance of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using
    a single shared Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale
    well and provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially
    when wireless channels are often reused by several APs [131]. 4.7. Viewpoints
    of Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems The network architectures for IoT are
    heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular
    Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due to
    the large-scale production of intelligent sensing devices, survivability and self-organization
    of deployed functional networks are essential. A WSN is deployed for a variety
    of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and military applications. It
    is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which the sensor nodes communicate
    over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered, low-power sensors capable
    of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating, and regulating communication.
    Numerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2, TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have been
    suggested. Therefore, some standards were introduced to enable interaction and
    other compatibilities among these numerous heterogeneous platforms. For example,
    the IEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT.
    WSNs provide critical functionalities for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered
    battery-operated End Devices (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to
    the Internet. A WSN can be considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several
    equipped sensor nodes. Due to the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability
    must be obtained from the viewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability
    issue, various works suggested a standardized arrangement that could enable the
    usage of IP over LoWPAN. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability
    for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard outlines
    the physical and data link layers of the network and offers a low-cost framework
    for network operations. To link LPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may be used as
    an adaptation layer to enable sensors to implement an IP stack and become approachable
    by other conventional devices over the Internet. This adaptability layer also
    supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables a variety of applications and
    permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding algorithms at the Internet
    layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot be supported
    when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72] considers the
    LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained, and they
    are connected by some lossy links that only support low data rates. These links
    are thought to be extremely unstable and have poor performance in terms of packet
    delivery rates. In such specialized networks, the traffic patterns are often P2MP
    and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint (MP2MP) rather than just P2P [72]. These networks
    contain hundreds of smart devices. This makes the implementation of routing policies
    more difficult than ever. In addition, numerous existing traditional ad-hoc wireless
    network routing methods, such as DSR and AODV, cannot manage these unique situations
    and unforeseen circumstances. Designing and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking
    settings has been more difficult due to the mobility aspect and the resource limitations
    at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’ design principles emphasize QoS
    elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end latency [134,135]. The forwarding
    rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations take into account the
    increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the node energy [117,136].
    As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and maintain solely inside their
    operational infrastructure, this was very feasible. However, the interoperability
    of these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when such networks are integrated
    with IoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration with IoT needs novel routing
    policies that support scalability and assure QoS, fairness, and connectivity between
    two nodes (both in APs and ad-hoc networks) with the least amount of power consumption.
    The standard classical forwarding strategies were intended to ensure QoS between
    a pair of devices/nodes. In the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures
    should suggest enough fairness so that each node can sufficiently get enough chances
    to communicate with nearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing
    solutions are followed to decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation.
    Researchers have often raised concerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules,
    which lead to the consumption of excess energy in networks while taking into account
    mobile and static ad-hoc network scenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood
    of frequent network disconnections, route failures, and even network partitioning,
    all contributing to the system’s significant MAC-level and routing-level overhead
    problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the high-power consumption problem,
    many researchers presented numerous smart routing paradigms [118,134,135,137].
    Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the desired QoS. Cross-layer
    design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion control are
    well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless channel
    attributes. Therefore, significant work has been done in these areas. These designs
    provide support for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely variable channel
    parameters at lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing and Transport
    layers to further optimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations decisions
    [121,134,135,138,139,140]. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) indicates
    how well a device can hear a signal from an AP or router. A network layer forwarding
    policy can effectively utilize the RSSI (accessible through lower layers dynamically)
    to assess link quality. AODV and DSR are examples of the traditional ad-hoc routing
    protocols used in various smart forwarding systems designed for IoT scenarios.
    The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing mechanisms were suggested for the IoT
    scenarios and talked about node and link disjoint paths while discovering routes.
    However, the proposed schemes do not shed light and discuss anything related to
    performance issues when there is a significant level of interference in the network
    because of traffic running parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned techniques
    do not always perform well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay. Recently,
    the scheme [140] considered different critical factors such as interference level,
    link-layer contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related
    to wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution
    policies’ efficiency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,
    different possible disjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might
    be able to interfere with one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting
    behavior in wireless communication. Consequently, such separate disconnected pathways
    could be utilized to enhance the performance of the network as a whole [138,140].
    When employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend on WSN-based networking
    connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from smart things to sink nodes.
    These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes (IoT-GW). To balance energy
    usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous such static and mobile IoT-GWs
    can be deployed in the system. In the whole system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous
    types of critical data, are connected to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee
    specified three forms of devices: Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee
    End Device, and three forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh. Moreover,
    the Zigbee stack embraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the case of star
    network topology, the Reduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e., RFDs and FFDs)
    can communicate with the PAN central coordinator only. They are not capable of
    communicating with one another. Here, the PAN coordinator may be powered by mains,
    while the RFDs and FFDs run on low-powered limited battery devices. Moreover,
    in the case of the mesh network topology, any device can communicate to within-range
    devices at a point of time. Moreover, this topology contains a PAN coordinator,
    which can communicate with other RFDs and FFDs. Furthermore, this networking topology
    offers support for the usage of the integrated forwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree
    and AODV routing procedures. Lastly, the tree (cluster) network topology is a
    subset form of mesh networking topology, consisting of RFDs and FFDs (which may
    act as coordinators). However, the FFD count could be more than the RFD count
    in the network. RFDs may attach to tree (cluster) network topology as the end
    nodes in the system. The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization functionalities
    to other connected coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single PAN
    coordinator amongst these coordinators [144]. 4.8. IoT Application Protocols Each
    IoT application is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.
    These protocols can be the following: Representational State Transfer Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is the primary client/server protocol
    that adopts the request/response model. HTPP has been related to the REST architecture
    [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar entities over web-based services.
    The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices to make their status readily
    available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions
    [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE techniques
    of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build a REST model for dissimilar
    IoT devices [148]. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [149]: It is a lightweight
    RESTful protocol lately standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
    CoAP is used by IoT devices for IP-based, HTTP-like interactions. It uses UDP
    with acknowledgment messages to set up reliable communication based on a request/response
    interaction. It has reduced complexity, and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained
    IoT applications and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) [150] is established for IoT messaging. According to MQTT design
    principles, network bandwidth and device resource requirements should be kept
    to a minimum while also aiming to assure dependability and some level of delivery
    assurance. Since June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by ISO as a standard (ISO/IEC
    20922). The protocol continues to progress by formalizing popular capability options
    and adding new functionalities. The most recent version, MQTT v5.0, was released
    in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe paradigm. Clients connect
    to a centralized broker when using MQTT. Open Platform Communications Unified
    Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoperability standard is used for the secure
    and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation domain and other industries.
    It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among
    IoT devices from multiple vendors. It supports two different communication methods:
    the Client/Server method as well as Publish/Subscribe (e.g., over UDP or MQTT)
    to mainly meet different industry requirements from the production systems to
    edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main IoT vendors including IBM, AWS, Google
    Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage secure, standardized information exchange
    in edge-to-cloud applications based on OPC UA. Extensible Messaging and Presence
    Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is based on text messages that
    use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which it can implement both request/response
    and publish/subscribe methods by using suitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant
    messages between clients, and this happens in real-time using a push mechanism
    to avoid increasing unnecessary network loads. XMPP also determines the state
    of an XMPP entity as online, offline, busy, etc. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
    (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing business messages between applications
    or organizations using TCP. It connects systems, feeds business processes with
    the information they need, and reliably transmits onward the instructions that
    achieve their goals using the point/point and publish/subscribe interaction modes.
    AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of message orientation; queuing; routing;
    security; reliability; and interoperability. Data Distribution Service (DDS) [154]:
    DDS was developed by the Open Management Group (OMG). DDS is a real-time M2M protocol
    that enables dependable, high-performance, interoperable, scalable data exchanges
    using a publish–subscribe pattern. DDS provides low-latency data connectivity,
    high reliability, and scalability in publish–subscribe and request/response patterns
    over TCP and UDP. The needs of various IoT applications requiring real-time data
    exchange can be addressed using DDS. Such applications are air traffic control,
    transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart grid management. Lastly,
    Glaroudis et al. [155] provided a comparison among IoT application protocols in
    terms of well-accepted key performance indicators and discussed their suitability
    in the framework of smart farming. 5. Networking Architectures and Protocols 5.1.
    Generic Architectures Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an
    urban IoT’s enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated
    the implementation of an IoT island as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City
    of Padova. In the IoT, two methods provide data access to objects/things. The
    first involves deploying multi-hop mesh networks with short-range communication
    among network nodes using unlicensed frequency. The second involves using licensed
    frequency band long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM). Centenaro et al.
    [156] presented a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wireless connectivity)
    called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based on a star topology
    characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed
    sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide connectivity
    in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed the
    advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efficiency,
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled
    SCA that uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled
    street lighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental
    research facility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander supports
    testing proposed protocols, services, and configurations in a realistic setting
    at an appropriate scale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a significant
    part of IoT. Vilajosana and Dohler [159] reviewed currently used smart city M2M
    technologies (i.e., sensors, data loggers, wireless modems, and gateway). They
    considered one of the most famous deployment use cases, i.e., smart parking. In
    any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount of M2M communication requests
    occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways cannot face this challenge.
    Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control model for M2M communications.
    Their model differentiates all M2M requests into delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant.
    Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant requests by routing them into one low-priority
    queue, aiming to reduce the number of requests from various devices to the access
    point in the IoT for smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up
    architecture after analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture
    has four layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each
    layer integrates security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer,
    located at the bottom of the architecture, collects data from physical devices.
    The transmission layer is located above the sensing layer. Several communication
    technologies are used to transmit data from the transmission layer to the (upper)
    data management layer. The data management layer performs data fusion, data analysis,
    data processing, and data storing. It stores valuable information that various
    applications use at the application layer to provide services. The majority of
    the above works mainly focus on a single characteristic, such as quality of service
    [162]. Marques et al. [163] proposed a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities
    infrastructure management architecture that allows the integration of physical
    objects, communication infrastructure, cloud platform, and IoT-based services
    in a pervasive way. This architecture (Figure 4) is generic and includes four
    layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication, (3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.
    Figure 4. Architecture design. Adapted from [163]. The Physical Objects Layer
    enables IoT sensors to collect data that will feed the smart city architecture
    with information used to offer services. After the sensors collect data, a Communication
    Device is used to collect sensor data. A communication device can implement different
    technologies (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee). Sensor data are processed by
    a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing unit responsible for gathering
    information used by the application providing a service. The local processing
    unit brings elements of edge computing, as it pushes part of the computation to
    edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating all the computation in a centralized
    remote server. The Communication Layer: The architecture supports a variety of
    network access technologies. The communication layer supports the implementation
    of various wireless technologies. The local processing unit located at the Physical
    Objects Layer defines the technology to be used and relays data to the communication
    layer using the interface of a network access point. The Cloud Platform Layer
    provides three services: processing, database queries, and data storage. In the
    context of providing services for smart cities, each of these services can be
    dynamically allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably, only
    some applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation
    is optional. The Services Layer implements four groups, which are called classes
    of services: (I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III) Infrastructure,
    and (IV) Technology. In each class, different kinds of applications can be implemented
    to deal with the challenges of smart cities. This architecture is a generic solution,
    so the underlying layers are designed to offer support to the applications. Therefore,
    it can be adapted to the specific implementation of a given service. To this end,
    the authors adapted their architecture to a waste management scenario. Another
    multi-level smart city architecture [164] was built on semantic web technologies,
    and its design is mostly used in smart city wireless sensor network applications.
    Data collection, data processing, integration and reasoning, and device control
    and alerts make up its four layers. Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s
    edge, Gheisari et al. [165] suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in
    the smart city that protects privacy. Saadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer
    architecture for mobile object authentication in the context of IoT smart cities.
    Their architecture is based on the applicability of a proposed hierarchical elliptic
    curve identity-based signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167] presented
    a Fog-based smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network (FOCAN).
    To reduce latency and increase the efficiency of services among things with various
    capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through
    the smart city environment. One of FOCAN’s primary benefits is that the IoT device
    can deliver services effectively and with less energy consumption. 5.2. SDN-IoT
    Architectures Software-defined networking (SDN) [168] is an approach to enable
    flexible and efficient network configuration to enhance a network. SDN can provide
    many advantages for configuring city networks to support different applications.
    For example, SDN can improve the QoS of city networks against link failures [169]
    and meet smart city latency demands [170]. While some efforts are investigating
    this approach for supporting SCAs, there is room for developing more advanced
    management and networking mechanisms in SDN for efficient, reliable, and secure
    network configurations in smart cities. Jazaeri et al. [171] considered the advantages
    of integrating edge computing, SDN, and IoT technologies and reviewed different
    frameworks and platforms. Liu et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples
    urban sensing applications from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture,
    centralized controllers manage physical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition,
    transmission, and processing services to develop urban sensing applications. Bi
    et al. [173] proposed a scalable SDN-enabled architecture that integrates a variety
    of smart city components and provides reliable and timely scheduling for big data
    transfer to support smart city services. They also studied the time-constrained
    big data transfer scheduling (TBTS) problem under this architecture and proposed
    a heuristic with an intelligent scheme that can maximize the throughput and schedule
    the multi-flow transfer dynamically. IoT systems collect and process data vulnerable
    to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed
    a collaborative and intelligent-network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)
    architecture, namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT networks. SeArch is a security
    architecture in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS nodes, i.e., Edge-IDS,
    Fog-IDS, and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration among nodes.
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy
    in smart cities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network architecture
    for the smart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN and Blockchain technologies.
    To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, their architecture
    is divided into core and edge networks. By designing a hybrid architecture, their
    architecture inherits the strength of centralized and distributed network architectures.
    “PrivySharing” [177] is a Blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving
    and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. This framework protects
    data privacy by segmenting the blockchain network into different channels, consisting
    of a limited number of approved businesses and handling a certain category of
    data, such as health, smart auto, smart energy, or financial information. Additionally,
    smart contracts contain access control rules that regulate who has access to the
    users’ data within a channel. In addition, private data gathering and encryption
    are used to further isolate and safeguard the data within a channel. Islam et
    al. [178] designed a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT ecosystem
    that addresses the existing challenges through the use of the technologies Blockchain,
    SDN, and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architecture
    confronts the problems of scalability, flexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats. 5.3. Architectures
    for Smart Grid The automated and intelligent management of the next-generation
    electric power systems determines their effectiveness and efficiency. Smart Grid
    (SG) is the name given to the next generation of electricity systems, which are
    anticipated to offer various benefits over the current systems in terms of digitization,
    flexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustainability, and customization [179].
    Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies to improve power quality.
    Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric devices remotely in
    real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate their local devices.
    The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented by using the electrical
    and communication infrastructures that connect the transmission and customer domains.
    The distribution domain includes distribution feeders and transformers to supply
    electricity. It interacts with much different equipment, such as distributed energy
    resources (DERs), plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure
    (AMI), and sensors with communication capability. The distribution domain is responsible
    for delivering electricity to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability.
    To provide quality electricity, the stability of this domain is monitored and
    controlled. Typical applications [44] of the smart grid communications network
    are automatic meter reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and
    DERs/microgrid. DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked
    to the distribution system. Distributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS),
    or a combination of renewable and non-renewable sources are all possible sources
    for DER. Solar panels, wind turbines, combustion turbines, fuel cells, battery
    storage systems, etc., are a few examples of DER. An electric power system with
    one or more DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid. The communication
    infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities of the smart grid and
    complies with performance standards. This infrastructure connects a huge number
    of electric devices and manages complex device communications. As a result, it
    is built in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected individual sub-networks,
    and each sub-network is responsible for separate geographical regions. The extremely
    dispersed smaller area networks that support the power systems at various locations
    are connected by WANs, which act as the communication’s backbone. When the control
    centers are located a great distance from the substations or the end-users, the
    real-time measurements made at the electric devices are transported to the control
    centers through the WANs, and in the opposite direction, the WANs carry out the
    instruction communications from the control centers to the electric devices. The
    authors of [43] present a communication architecture in an SG. This architecture
    includes (1) an energy smart house with electric appliances connected to the smart
    grid, (2) a residential complex with AMI, (3) a residential subdivision installed
    with solar panels, (4) a PEV charging station, (5) a power substation, and (6)
    power transmission lines. In this architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as
    the backbone in connecting the distributed sub-networks. Demertzis et al. [180]
    presented and categorized the communication network standards that have been established
    for smart grids and should be considered in planning and implementing new infrastructures.
    Such standards are IEC 61850 for substation automation. This standard is based
    on open architecture and incorporates sampling and timing synchronization specifications
    based on IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181]. Notably, IEEE 1588 is the standard
    for a precision clock synchronization protocol for networked measurement and control
    systems [182]. Due to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)
    throughout the power grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution
    networks in smart grids would undergo significant changes to accommodate the nature
    of non-radial power flow. For the most part, the low-voltage distribution networks
    where RERs (such as solar cells) may be attached are not monitored by the majority
    of the present supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for power
    grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control, Abdrabou [183] presented
    a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse structure that may
    supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage distribution networks.
    A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also presented as a useful method
    for prioritizing data transfer across the newly introduced network architecture.
    HetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network design with a specific QoS routing method
    for power distribution grid applications. It delivers QoS assurances across the
    network while taking into account three factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability.
    The authors created two components to accomplish this: A multipath routing mechanism
    that compensates critical applications for their high-reliability requirements
    by using end-to-end physically disjoint paths, and Altruistic resource allocation
    with the QoS routing mechanism that targets communication with QoS guarantees
    for applications with strict QoS requirements. The findings in [184] show that
    the HetGrid overlay network architecture enables extremely effective, trustworthy,
    and QoS-aware communication in heterogeneous networks. The major characteristics
    that set SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are the ability to execute
    two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time pricing. The present
    SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to be protocol independent.
    Therefore, global communication network management and monitoring approaches have
    been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network administrators may more
    efficiently manage their networks by separating the control plane from the data
    plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication networks. SDN
    implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efficiency and resilience.
    SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and protocols by virtue
    of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity capabilities to
    cope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185] presented SDN-based
    SGC architectures, along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for
    SDN-based SGC and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied
    to SDN-based SGC. Alam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication
    networks in terms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,
    and applications. They proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication Network
    for Smart Grid. CR is a software-defined radio (SDR) platform that can quickly
    reconfigure its operating parameters, such as modulation/demodulation, compression
    algorithm, and error coding techniques, according to changing circumstances and
    requirements, through cognition. In such an SDR platform, radio transceivers can
    switch functions and operations on demand only. Molokomme et al. [187] reviewed
    architectures that aim to accomplish the various and strict QoS requirements in
    SG communication systems. Wireless communication networks have been motivated
    to harvest energy from ambient environments and run energy-efficiently for economic
    and ecological benefits through improvements in the smart power grid and the advocacy
    of “green communications”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments in energy
    harvesting, redistribution, trade, and planning for future wireless networks integrating
    with smart grids. The authors considered the optimization of various energy-harvesting
    wireless systems as well as traditional models of renewable energy-harvesting
    technologies. Moreover, they discussed how to distribute redundant (unused) energy
    generated by cellular networks, plan for energy under dynamic pricing when smart
    grids are in place, and engage in two-way energy trading using smart grids. From
    a different viewpoint, including IoT devices and providing connectivity, automation,
    and monitoring for such devices enables SG systems to sustain multiple network
    operations during the generation, distribution, transmission, and expenditure
    of energy. Numerous IoT-aided SG systems have been proposed in the literature.
    The survey [189] on IoT-aided SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures,
    uses, and prototypes. 5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings There are various
    building applications such as heating, cooling, load control, air quality, ventilation,
    lighting, water management, and cooking gas management. A smart building incorporates
    the major building systems on a common network and functionality to provide operational
    efficiency, fire safety, and security. A smart building architecture (SBA) manages
    several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation, air cleaning,
    HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation and monitoring);
    smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management); a smart fire
    detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart building [190]
    has security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality system, a fire alarm
    system, a water management system, and an energy management system. Moreover,
    it can detect intrusion and supports HVAC services. Diverse SBAs include complex
    operational systems, sensing, and communication technologies. Such architectures
    have converged into an IP-based architecture. This convergence is occurring rapidly
    with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices driven through IoT concerning
    conventional building management and smart buildings. Traditionally, numerous
    building systems utilized varied forms of networking protocols and cabling systems.
    This variety makes the whole system more complex and highly infeasible from both
    a deployment and a system administration standpoint [191]. SBAs entail making
    plans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational technologies that improve
    the application’s, service’s, or provision’s operational steps while also boosting
    the well-being of its users. Researchers, policymakers, and implementers should
    pay attention to several crucial issues, such as reliable communication/connection
    procedures, power-efficient measures, competent security measures, efficient sensors
    and actuators, and data analytics procedures. Amalgamating new systems and technologies
    with conventional (base) technologies to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes,
    but is not limited to, WSN deployment; advanced power-aware traffic engineering
    policies; cloud, edge, and fog computing paradigms; big data engineering and analytics;
    and human–computer interaction procedures [192]. The rapid development of ICT
    technologies has enhanced the connectedness of intelligent sensing, actuators,
    and communication devices to real-time physical entities. Recently, smart sensing
    mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology have boosted the area of
    SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies for a particular smart
    building domain poses significant difficulties, including heterogeneity of IoT
    devices and applications, workable networking protocols and architectures, power
    efficiency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One solution is the SDN paradigm,
    which manages the network more efficiently than a customary one. SDN also assists
    network services, including storage, routing, dynamic bandwidth management, and
    QoS. Hence, these simplifications offer a creative environment through the implementation
    of proper software tools for smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation
    for intelligent infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home
    automation and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing
    based on SDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that
    improves critical SB parameters such as bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency,
    latency, security, and reliability. Silva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things
    (WoT) SBA that is integrated with the representational state transfer (RESTful)
    application programming interface (API). The RESTful API employs HTTP requests
    (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT data. Regarding network
    performance and smart building power management, the authors showed how their
    recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance. Smart sensing
    devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or modifying
    vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.
    These systems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms, power,
    and transceiver modules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based SBAs for
    assessing and regulating air quality, smart lighting systems, fire detection systems,
    power management, and other basic building operations. An indoor-air-quality-based
    SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for monitoring and regulating
    air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing system was initially
    suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature, and relative humidity.
    Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198]. Considering smart
    indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed in the literature.
    In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system to satisfy the users’
    needs. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption reduction via energy-efficient
    smart lighting systems. Today’s smart building employs low-power usage LED-based
    light sources that last longer than Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In
    reality, the development of control technologies, heterogeneous networks, and
    embedded systems has made it promising to create smart innovative lighting systems
    that can effectively address the problem of energy conservation. Researchers have
    recently begun testing by integrating different power-saving techniques in a single
    illumination system for improved energy efficiency while enhancing lighting performance
    without sacrificing user satisfaction. According to the authors of [201], using
    several cheap detectors, as opposed to a single expensive sensor, would result
    in improved performance and higher power savings. Considering the same motivation,
    various authors [202,203,204] have suggested similar types of smart lighting systems
    for several room types, such as classrooms and offices. In [205], the authors
    provide a deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing on
    power savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration
    of visible light communication technology [206]. Recently, researchers focused
    on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work performance and thermal comfort, to
    propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented Technologies (OOT) have
    been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal comfort while conserving
    energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the drawbacks of the
    automatic control used today. In practice, thermal comfort analysis is based on
    parallel objective and subjective evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises
    monitoring, assessing, and recording the status of environmental parameters through
    dedicated sensors and instruments following standardized guidelines. Subjective
    evaluation involves monitoring, assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal
    sensation, and thermal environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor
    results as the cumulative method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found
    in [193]. Green building refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that
    adjusts to predetermined circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation,
    the system makes full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather
    data and subsequently allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The
    ambient intelligence concept aims to conserve natural resources with limited and
    efficient use of them to offer comfort to the occupants. Through unconventional
    energy sources, it also meets some of the conventional energy requirements [207].
    Many aspects of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and power efficiency, are
    the subject of extensive study. However, one of the most important functions of
    an SB system is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by HVAC
    systems [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial buildings
    for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for this
    context. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of rated fan
    energy can be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect on a building’s
    indoor temperature. The method of computational control for passive and active
    sources was used in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized the problem that
    the ambient and active sources of lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling, and
    shading are not synchronized in buildings. Such a computational control scheme
    is also suitable for reducing daily power usage. Similarly, numerous methods [211,212,213]
    considering HVAC systems have been proposed with respect to frequency regulation,
    predictive control, and smart controller. An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks
    environmental situations. It also notifies when measurements exceed thresholds
    and provides data on energy usage and consumption. In addition, it can autonomously
    turn equipment intermittently at programmed times. As individuals spend more time
    indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed spaces) than outdoors, the air quality
    inside buildings should be improved along with that of the external surroundings.
    This is the task of indoor Air Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS). The basic parts
    of an AQMS (Figure 5) are a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal
    conditioning circuit, a small amount of external memory, and a communication module
    that is typically wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors
    that can detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2,
    CO, and O3, as well as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity
    and temperature. These sensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values
    of the real-time indoor air quality parameters and an external memory used to
    store real-time data [214]. When deploying such systems, various communication
    (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and LoRAWAN technologies, are considered.
    Figure 5. Air Quality Monitoring Sensor System. Adapted from [215,216]. Figure
    5 shows a typical sensor system for an indoor environment for air quality monitoring.
    Figure 6 shows an SBA architecture [217]. The system of this architecture collects
    vital information about the various air quality parameters, including CO2, CO,
    particles (Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5), and some other crucial parameters
    such as humidity and temperature. By using gas sensor boards and wasp motes, the
    authors created a method for collecting and monitoring the indoor atmosphere.
    For monitoring CO2 and CO parameters, they also used TGS 4161 and TGS 2442 gas
    sensors. These sensors usually work using the resistive heating principle. The
    TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity to fluctuations in CO gas concentration.
    This sensor’s internal resistance, or “IR”, is inversely proportionate to the
    amount of CO present. As the CO content rises, the IR falls. While TGS 4161 also
    offers low power consumption and suggests better performance in detecting changes
    in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161 is ideally suited for indoor air control
    applications as it can measure 350–10,000 ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used
    the DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol laser photometer that simultaneously measures
    mass and size fraction, for PM1 and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To define and create
    an interface to the deployed sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol
    data, this photometer is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors
    also set up ZB (ENs) at each location that was taken into consideration, which
    sent updates on the air quality and aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that
    had already been set up. Figure 6. IAQMS architecture. Adapted from [217,218].
    This system assesses the indoor air quality to assess the current state of the
    indoor environment while simultaneously providing real-time inputs for HVAC system
    management. The authors also designed a toolkit that analyzes real-time air quality
    data and displays them through meaningful representations to service the SBAs.
    Likewise, Lozano et al. [216] proposed another IAQMS technique that considers
    a star topological architecture [217]. The ZB (ENs) in this technique is based
    on the XBee and XBee pro-version modules. Nevertheless, the suggested scheme [216]
    considers a single pollutant only, i.e., suggesting using a GAC sensor. Conversely,
    the authors of [215] further claimed that they considered seven pollutants in
    their proposed implementation. IoE for Smart Building: To achieve optimal functionality
    and energy-efficient performance, Kim et al. [218] offered an overview of the
    design and implementation of energy-related SB technologies, including energy
    management systems, renewable energy applications, and current advanced smart
    technologies. Undoubtedly, the electricity sector of smart cities is impacted
    by the Internet of Energy (IoE), which aims to increase energy efficiency, prevent
    energy waste, and enhance environmental conditions by integrating IoT technologies
    into distributed energy systems. Two examples of IoE technology are intelligent
    sensor use and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. As a result, the
    IoE is becoming a tool for legal science to support the goals of a smart city.
    Metallidou et al. [219] discussed the factors that prompted the European Union
    to create regulations to make it easier to transition current towns into smart
    cities, starting with existing structures. To achieve energy efficiency, the authors
    suggested a smart building template that uses IoT technology to manage the performance
    of all technical systems. In addition, they suggested an automated remote-control
    technique supported by a cloud interface to enhance the certification of existing
    buildings for energy performance. This technology reduces time-consuming processes
    and stores the energy performance of each building on a cloud platform to make
    decisions and put measures in place. A review of current tactics in the field
    of active building energy management systems (BEMS) was offered by Mariano-Hernández
    et al. [220]. The authors reviewed articles on several BEMS management techniques
    for residential and non-residential buildings, including Model Predictive Control
    (MPC), Demand Side Management (DSM), Optimization, and Fault Detection and Diagnostics
    (FDD). MPC predicts building response to control requests, while DSM is an agreement
    of actions to improve the energy system on the user side. FDD is an automatic
    procedure of detecting and separating flaws in BEMS to protect a system from additional
    harm. Moudgil et al. [221] examined cutting-edge academic and industrial research
    to discover significant technological solutions that improve the integration of
    IoT in building infrastructure (BI). Their review also identifies key technical
    and non-technical problems that must be resolved through extensive research for
    BI to fully incorporate IoT. The authors contend that IoT in BI is still not operationally
    capable. IoT and BI stakeholders must make a concerted effort to give modern BI
    access to a generic IoT framework with cognitive intelligence and context-aware
    computing capabilities. 5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring Retrofitting
    the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some benefits,
    including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert
    utilities to pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network, allowing
    them to remotely adjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224]. Automation
    can be used for both operational procedures and components that provide functionality.
    For instance, when a water problem occurs during operation or with the element
    itself, the smart components inform the system center and then take action to
    avert a crash. The water utility can also determine a sensor’s requirement for
    maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic self-verification mechanism
    [225]. In [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid architecture
    that includes technical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework. Moreover,
    this smart water system (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms, simulation
    procedures, diagnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control mechanisms.
    Although an SWS incorporates offline performance, real-time performance is defined
    by online procedures such as online data monitoring, online data assimilation,
    online modeling, online charting, and online results output. An SWS must have
    real-time functionality to implement the necessary smart features [227]. Researchers
    put a lot of effort [228] into developing water systems that operate intelligently.
    Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time controlling, etc., which seek
    to reduce the lag between system input and system output, should be added to the
    smart performance of SWS. It was discovered that using SCADA would considerably
    increase the data transfer efficiency [229]. A smart water architecture [230]
    often includes five layers: (1) the physical layer; (2) the sensing and control
    layer; (3) the communication layer; (4) the data management layer; and (5) the
    data fusion layer. Within the framework of the GST4Water project, the authors
    of [230] presented a system that allows for receiving consumption data sent by
    a generic smart meter installed in a user’s house and transferring them to a cloud
    platform. The consumption data are saved and processed to characterize leakage
    at the district meter area and the individual user level. Meanwhile, the processed
    data are returned to the Water Utility and can be used for billing. On the other
    hand, they provide regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness of
    their consumption behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework
    based on FIWARE that aims to realize a highly flexible standards-based open-source
    software solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting
    of various FIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis
    et al. [232] considered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding
    conventional water metering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted
    bi-directional (whenever required) data exchange between water flow devices, metering
    equipment, and end-users. The authors’ ultimate objective is to design, implement,
    and deploy more sophisticated infrastructure offering improved performance in
    bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit the amount of data that needs to be
    shared between the various system layers, their approach makes use of the FogC
    paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water grid model. The Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the Efficient Water Resources
    Management project was funded by the European Commission under the auspices of
    the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the Smart Water project is to
    examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively managing urban water systems,
    with a focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues
    such as leakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.
    Kulkarni and Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,
    proposed a framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost
    of ownership, and highlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’ Smart
    Water case studies. Pipelines are used to transport water, gases, and oil. Since
    they are frequently underground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes them, which
    may result in leaks. In addition, water in the pipelines may get contaminated
    by infectious agents or substances that are mistakenly or purposely introduced
    into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline networks is crucial for maintaining
    public health and protecting the environment. The sensor node deployment profoundly
    impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline network monitoring, including
    coverage area, coverage population, and detection time. The sensor nodes should
    typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s junctions [234]. Given the
    design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor node deployment challenges
    are therefore formulated as integer optimization problems, where the integer variables
    represent the maximum amount of sensor nodes that must be placed at each junction.
    The deployment difficulties for pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging
    to solve because of the integer decision variables. Pipeline network flows are
    not predictable. As a result, depending on the flow pattern, the sensing performance
    of a deployed sensor node may vary. As a result, the flow pattern is taken into
    account in [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to decide
    how to deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a
    branch and bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify the
    ideal answer, the time complexity is typically significant. This means that large
    pipeline networks cannot be used with the method. Similarly, the study in [236]
    considers the various demand patterns of water flows through pipes. The authors
    used a genetic-based method to find the best deployment locations to increase
    coverage under various monitoring station demand patterns. The global optimum
    of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach. The performance of
    the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices. Consequently,
    we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks. Singapore’s WaterWise@SG
    program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate burst incidents [237,238].
    PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to find pipeline leaks, where
    three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure. To reduce
    water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track water consumption
    for businesses. A Steamflood and Waterflood Tracking System [240] has been created
    to find irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks and bottlenecks. With
    the aid of all these technologies, the investigators had the opportunity to evaluate
    the efficiency of the monitoring algorithms. However, these technologies rely
    on fixed sensors, and we still need to put innovative testbed models and systems
    built around crowd sensing and mobile WSN into place. 5.6. Architectures for Smart
    Transportation The Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce
    traffic congestion and accidents. It also enables information exchange involving
    the vehicle and all entities that may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking
    and vehicle intelligence are the two technologies that underpin IoV implementation.
    The three components that compose vehicle networking are the onboard information
    service, VANET, and mobile network. VANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range
    communication. Providing remote location, remote diagnostics, navigation, and
    other information services is referred to as an onboard information service. Every
    car can be utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks to mobile networks. Vehicle
    intelligence is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence
    (AI), big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing (CogC),
    to facilitate information sharing among people and vehicles, as well as between
    vehicles and the environment, infrastructure, or other vehicles. Vehicular networks
    consist of data-gathering sensors and inter-vehicle communication systems. Such
    networks require an open and flexible layered architecture to handle characteristics
    such as interoperability, scalability, dependability, and modularity. Recently,
    the research community proposed efficient vehicle network architectures. For example,
    the Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture [241] includes seven layers. Offering services
    and choosing messaging protocols are tasks that fall within the application layer.
    Data preprocessing, big data processing, and intelligent transmission are all
    tasks that the multimedia and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems,
    the cloud service layer’s ClCom and cloud virtualization technologies offer hardware
    computing platforms, infrastructure, and software services. In the UIoV architecture,
    the communication layer and the intra–inter devices layer are merged to accomplish
    the connectivity of many heterogeneous objects and networks. Notably, there is
    no intra–inter devices layer in classical architecture. The UIoV system’s physical
    objects layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter devices layer
    for additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are
    identified using the Identification Layer. Liu et al. [242] suggested another
    IoV network architecture to increase the flexibility of application management
    while enhancing the scalability and dependability of information services. This
    architecture has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety of
    nodes with various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of
    IoV is frequently changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced
    and transmitted at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the
    underlying resources, the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes
    and the network, computation, communication, and storage resources in IoV. To
    execute applications such as road safety management and data sensing, the control
    layer’s SDN controller is responsible for scheduling the abstraction resources
    of the virtualization layer and interacting with the application layer. A difficult
    topic in network architecture design is dealing with diverse networks. Interoperability,
    scalability, dependability, and adaptability are some of its network features.
    The design seeks to increase layer separation and network architecture’s total
    number of layers. In addition to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture
    should facilitate the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other
    communication devices. By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving
    systems, the learning ability of autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved.
    Utilizing both physical and network data space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles
    (CIoV) paradigm [243] improves network security and transportation safety. CIoV
    enables IoV to bear more accurate perceptive ability through cognition in the
    intra-vehicle network (driver, passengers, smart devices, etc.), inter-vehicle
    network (adjacent intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network (road environment,
    cellular network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture includes
    a cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road
    condition investigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture of
    CIoV. The gathering and preprocessing of big data from several sources are done
    by the sensing layer. As opposed to the previous communication layer (of other
    architectures), the architecture’s communication layer uses a cloud/edge hybrid
    structure to accommodate various application schedules. The data cognition engine
    at the cognition layer processes and interprets heterogeneous data streams (machine
    learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety of cognitive analysis approaches.
    The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in charge of allocating and scheduling
    network resources with the aid of technologies such as NFV, SDN, network slicing,
    and self-organized networking (SON). There are primarily two categories in the
    application layer (i.e., usual application services and intelligent transportation
    applications). Efficient message authentication and integrity are required to
    guarantee vehicle privacy and safeguard vehicular communications. To protect V2V
    and V2I communications in the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber
    threats, Karim [244] provided a cryptography-based routing solution. This solution
    includes a data encryption and decryption mechanism based on attributes and identity
    that has the lowest computational overhead while keeping the optimum level of
    security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245] suggested a seven-layer network architecture.
    The user interface layer, which controls information exchange between the user
    and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units (RSUs) and onboard
    sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing and filtering
    layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data before sending
    the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission. Making
    choices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities of control
    and management. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing layer
    to create the pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop assaults,
    the security layer directly manages each of the layers above. A unique network
    architecture with enhanced throughput, reduced latency, higher security, and widespread
    connectivity was recently proposed by Ji et al. [246]. This architecture consists
    of four layers: Security authentication layer: The RSUs on the road may monitor
    traffic environment data in real-time after setting several sensors, surveillance
    footage, and radar. This layer determines the legality of the car and RSU that
    are requesting to join the network. Perhaps an illegal vehicle or an RSU that
    has been installed unlawfully will attempt to steal or alter the information of
    a real vehicle. Data acquisition layer: This layer collects and categorizes many
    types of data from various networks. To ensure that the data can be sent to the
    edge layer securely, it digitizes the data. Edge layer: Edge devices produce several
    data streams. As a result, processing and analyzing data in one go using ClCom
    will result in significant delays. As a result, we must process data more closely
    related to the data source. The edge node, a physical device situated closest
    to the data source, is used by the edge layer to carry out basic processing and
    analysis on the acquired local data. It releases data analysis findings for nearby
    traffic incidents and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a local
    decision-making plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud data
    center’s computing power. Cloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses
    the information it has collected about global traffic in this tier, develops a
    plan, and rationally distributes traffic resources. This layer, having the ability
    to implement connection management, data management, aided autonomous driving,
    intelligent navigation, path planning, and information security, is the “smart
    brain” of the IoV. A blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)
    for the smart city was presented in [247]. Building innovative distributed transport
    management systems is made possible by the robust and secure Block-VN architecture.
    The authors considered how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused
    on networking and vehicular information. To handle real-time transportation data,
    Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing transportation data using Spark
    and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four layers: data collection and
    acquisition, network, data processing, and application. Each layer is built to
    process and manage data in a structured manner. On the data processing layer,
    Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing the suggested event and
    decision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249], the data are made available
    to a smart community member. The suggested approach was examined using transportation
    datasets from some reliable sources. The outcomes demonstrate data processing
    and real-time distribution to citizens in the shortest amount of time. Spark with
    the Hadoop environment produces findings that are quite accurate. From another
    viewpoint, Social IoV (SIoV) are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks
    [250], where vehicular nodes share/exchange information with different entities
    and are thus forth comparable with traditional social networks. Kerrache et al.
    [251] proposed a trust-aware communication architecture for social IoV (TACASHI),
    which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication architecture
    for SIoVs. 5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart Villages The smart village
    paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities using IoT technologies.
    In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried out, including smart agriculture,
    waste management, irrigation management, livestock management, smart energy, smart
    healthcare, and smart education. A smart village or smart rural area can enable
    real-time data analytics and automate decision-making for local villagers regarding
    healthcare, agriculture, environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from
    a smart city as there are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and
    sustainability) between urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart
    village goal, The European Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in
    which it proposed to interfere ICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254]
    addressed the meaning of “smart” in rural contexts as well as its link with sustainability.
    The European Commission-funded Smart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the
    ultimate goal of encouraging and motivating communities to create and execute
    smart village methods and tactics throughout Europe as a tool for rural development,
    serving as the authors’ primary source. IEEE Smart Village [256] also supports
    the world’s energy-impoverished communities by providing a complete solution combining
    renewable energy, community-based education, and entrepreneurial opportunities.
    Malik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart villages with
    different technologies. They concluded that digitization is only possible if a
    reliable and robust network and communication infrastructure are installed in
    the village environment. Shrestha and Drozdenko [258] proposed a Smart Rural framework
    to mitigate the effects of climate change using IoT and the Cloud, building a
    prototype on the Louisiana Tech University campus. Their framework is an energy-efficient
    monitoring system for observing the environmental conditions that affect agricultural
    production and human health. It consists of the following subsystems: Wireless
    Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud Services, and a Web Dashboard. The dashboard converts
    raw sensor data into meaningful information from which public officials and residents
    can adapt to or frustrate the effects of climate change. Monzon Baeza and Alvarez
    Marban [259] proposed a flexible and scalable Smart Rural system for gathering
    and processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional communication
    coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in separate
    segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS). Their
    proposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs of the
    system in the collection of IoT data from these remote rural areas, its coverage
    by space vehicles, and its processing and storage through 5G terrestrial networks
    and cloud services. Their proposal includes the deployment of IoT sensors and
    the development of Amazon Web Services. Conversely, the part of the space segment,
    considered by HAPS, has been simulated for different space channels. This method
    provides a complete and automated smart rural system that allows access to these
    IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet. To provide secure services
    close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored the integration of a Distributed
    Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with IoT in improving security and privacy
    solutions for villagers and consumer electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,
    the authors designed and evaluated the performance of an Intrusion Detection System
    (IDS) in a DFC-based smart village environment. Moreover, they discussed open
    security issues and challenges regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages.
    Rohan et al. [261] proposed a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering
    the resource constraints in a smart village. The authors illustrated the concept
    of collaborative edge computing as applicable to reduce cost and better manage
    the existing infrastructural facilities. Collaboration occurs between the multiple
    IoT edge devices (e.g., the edge data centers or edge routers) for data processing
    and storage. For example, in times of high computational load demand, one village’s
    edge devices can collaborate with another village’s edge devices. 6. Summary Various
    SCAs have different network requirements such as bandwidth, delay tolerance, power
    consumption, reliability, wireless connectivity, mobility, security, and privacy.
    Therefore, they need different protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network architectures
    for IoT are heterogeneous and include various network technologies such as WiFi,
    WSNs, Mesh Wireless Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile Communication
    Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these architectures must
    allow interoperability, while cross-layer design-based recommendations for power
    consumption and congestion control are well-suited proposals. State-of-the-art
    generic network architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm and are
    based on FogC to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.
    Fog and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in
    the future to fulfill QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efficiency.
    The CR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this technology
    can quickly reconfigure the operating parameters of the SG communication system
    to the changing requirements through cognition. By extracting usable data from
    both the physical and network data space, it is possible to increase network security
    and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures will become cognitive.
    These architectures will include cognitive data engines that will conduct cognition
    of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis,
    emotion analysis, and road condition investigation. The networking performance
    of SDN is better than the customary networking of smart buildings (SB). However,
    as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been facing some challenges such as
    network management in terms of maintenance, east–west interface, southbound interface,
    traffic management, energy, ML-based SDN networking for SB, and the network resources
    issue of SB SDN-based networking. 7. Open Research Issues −Network slicing management
    is required: IoT services such as smart transportation and smart energy have diversified
    requirements. To accommodate diverse IoT services, the network slicing paradigm
    is suggested because it enables multiple independent logical networks running
    on the same physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented an architecture
    for intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT) focusing
    on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).
    The authors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing
    management in this field. −NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The
    ETSI Industry Specification Group proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions
    that were before performed by some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the flexible
    provisioning of software-based network functionalities on top of an appropriately
    shared physical infrastructure by separating the network functions from the underlying
    hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing inexpensive commodity servers, it solves
    the issue of operating costs associated with administering and controlling this
    closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is used in conjunction with NFV (the
    software-defined NFV architecture), it can overcome the difficulties associated
    with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic resource management [263].
    SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service environment through NFV. As a
    result, the need for specialized hardware and labor-intensive effort to fulfill
    a new service request is avoided. In conjunction with the use of SDN, NFV also
    allows real-time and dynamic function provisioning along with flexible traffic
    forwarding. The SDN-IoT network may be improved and secured with NVF. It enables
    the software-based deployment of network devices as virtualized components. Throughput
    is increased because of NFV integration in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances
    network performance. To this end, Sinh et al. [264] proposed a practical model
    for hosting IoT services and building SDN controller applications to show that
    SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services. Recently, Mukherjee et al. [265]
    proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV implementation for smart
    cities. −Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology can
    address the bandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can be enabled
    with cognitive functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum accessing,
    circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs and services can be based
    on CR technology because it can do dynamic sensing and cognition of the surrounding
    environment. For example, in smart grid applications, cognitive IoT can achieve
    the objective of enabling users to know their energy consumption at any time and
    anywhere [267]. In smart home applications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can
    handle potential heterogeneous network interference [268]. At the same time, cognitive
    IoT can help with smoother real-time monitoring over longer distances in the healthcare
    industry without worrying about spectrum availability [269]. The complete utilization
    of cognitive radio technology in IoT demands extensive research in spectrum optimization,
    standardization, hardware design, privacy protection, heterogeneous network fusion,
    scalability and flexibility problems, etc. [270]. For this reason, many CIoT-based
    smart city network architectures must be proposed to solve such problems. In this
    regard, Park et al. [271] suggested a CIoT-based smart city network architecture
    that outlines how data collected from SCAs may be analyzed using the CogC paradigm
    and manage the scalability and flexibility challenges. −Challenges in IoT communication
    through TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access Points (APs) can utilize identical
    WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interference problems that can
    significantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many APs can provide
    support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with the DownLink
    multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY layer technology
    (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the capacity of WLANs
    by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations. As a result,
    it is possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to the number of antennas
    on APs. Thus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel and Singh [131] stressed
    the employment of CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods with many APs to improve
    the Compound TCP’s performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL
    method can accelerate the learning processes of the transport protocols such as
    Compound TCP. In FL, training data are dispersed across a large number of clients,
    each having unreliable and comparatively slow network connections, with the aim
    of developing a high-quality centralized model. The authors of [131] insisted
    on using these specialized strategies to coordinate numerous APs with regard to
    losses caused by unique wireless channel characteristics and WiFi downloading
    and uploading dynamics. Through the use of FL and CR approaches in dual AP settings,
    it is now possible to improve the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions. Another
    study [274] assumed TCP Cubic [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the
    FL approach for IoVs. The authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting
    the FL technique, which enhances the efficiency and privacy protection for the
    case of IoVs. −Digital Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources,
    personnel, procedures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital
    twin. Digital twin technology can be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including
    humans, IoT devices, aircraft engines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original
    vehicle is created, for instance, when an automobile business creates a virtual
    representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car model. If a manufacturer creates
    a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the replicated process
    is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a profile of the
    actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this virtual graphic,
    the dynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation are depicted.
    The digital twin can offer the location, state, and/or status of physical assets
    in real-time due to continual learning and advancements. This fusion of the real
    and digital worlds enables organizations to monitor systems, set strategies, and
    anticipate problems before they occur. Digital twins are created using digital
    twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure graphs, AI, software
    analytics, and the IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is demonstrated.
    This technology can efficiently administer the city, from urban planning to the
    optimization of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before
    putting them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.
    If a digital twin is in place, government organizations can only fully assess
    what might be achieved with the data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic
    opportunity, and establish a more cohesive community. Although the idea is currently
    novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few years [277]. −The 6G Network
    for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense and AI-centric
    city because massive device connectivity with vast data traffic is estimated in
    the future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted to the concept
    of Internet of Everything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart cities should have
    a huge bandwidth, low latency, and AI integration. Such networks should also provide
    ubiquity, high QoS, and on-demand content for thousands of interconnected devices.
    The 6G network [278] is the problem-solving network of futuristic cities, with
    huge bandwidth and low latency. It is under development for wireless communications
    technologies supporting cellular data networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks
    will probably be broadband cellular networks, in which the service area is divided
    into small geographical areas (cells). It is expected that 6G will be supported
    by existing 5G infrastructures such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing, together
    with new infrastructure. The network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:
    (1) ultra-fast data rates as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than
    1 ms; (3) increased mobility and coverage; (4) flexible and efficient connection
    of trillion level objects; (5) peak spectral efficiency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very
    high system reliability; and (7) improved network security [279]. However, the
    main problem of 6G is that transmitting at a higher frequency spectrum is prone
    to high path loss, making the distance for transmission limited [280]. The expected
    6G of the radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the capability
    of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability
    of carrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks, such
    as short-range and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can introduce
    complications and hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore, such complications
    of THz waves must be considered, and efficient AI-centric multilayer physical
    network architectures of 6G must be proposed for futuristic smart cities. Farooq
    et al. [280] considered the expectations from a network of futuristic smart cities
    and the problems of THz waves and proposed a conceptual terrestrial network (TN)
    architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a scalable multilayer architecture
    designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart cities. It provides an on-ground
    cloud network that helps smart devices to run AI applications partially on their
    own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore, the distributed and edge computing-oriented
    infrastructure of Bee Hive provides security and reduces traffic load on the upper
    layer of the network. Undoubtedly, pervasive AI is the main enabling technology
    in 6G, while some forms of AI are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples
    of using AI on wireless communications have been proposed, from physical layer
    designs (e.g., channel estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation
    (e.g., traffic control and cache storage management), to security and authentication,
    to dynamic cell and topology formation and management, to fault prediction and
    detection, etc. However, DL-based solutions require high computational complexity,
    which might not fit in current mobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity,
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based RL algorithms must be carefully designed
    to decrease the computational resources required on these devices [282]. Quantum
    communication [283] offers a promising approach to avoiding the challenge of limited
    computational resources and energy efficiency. Applying Artificial Neural Networks
    in IoT also comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy and computational/energy
    requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above issues and envisioned
    6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous systems. Apart
    from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important enabling technologies
    of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies are as follows: Reconfigurable
    Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reflect signals and help in places where
    maintaining Line of Sight (LoS) is difficult. RISs will be mainly deployed on
    doors, windows, and buildings. Cell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology
    is introduced in 5G with a more dense network of access points (APs), and this
    is further developed in 6G to include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287].
    Cell-Free Massive MIMO improves spectral efficiency in communication networks,
    but there are some health risks associated with such a dense network of APs. CubeSat
    communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class spacecraft)
    is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up to 6U, and
    U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units. UAVs/satellite communication. Terahertz communication
    and Optical Wireless Technology [289]. Blockchain technology [290] and quantum
    communication [283]. The development of futuristic smart cities keeps up with
    the development of energy-efficient 6G communication. Kamruzzaman [291] presented
    the key trends in the IoT for energy-efficient 6G wireless communication in smart
    cities. He argues that the application of IoT devices to 6G in smart cities will
    provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency rate, up to 1000 km/h mobility rate,
    100 bps/Hz spectral efficiency, and 1000 GHz frequency. This will resolve the
    issues of energy inefficiency and other concerns in conventional communication
    networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efficient 6G in smart cities via IoT devices
    probably will solve various problems that are encountered by existing smart city
    systems. In futuristic smart cities, residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer
    interface (BCI) technology [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on
    the signals and information that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable
    headsets and devices. It uses human consciousness more than external sources for
    better interaction. As humans have five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell,
    and taste), BCI comprises five datasets, comprising features of human senses that
    are used for human interaction with the machine [292]. 8. Conclusions Utilizing
    resources efficiently, reducing operating expenses, and enhancing city dwellers’
    quality of life are the objectives of the smart city paradigm. This goal is obtained
    by combining various technologies including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big data
    analytics, and robots. For this model, the effective networking and communication
    between the many components required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving
    its objectives. The ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic
    and manageable platforms for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings,
    smart home, smart water, and smart transportation systems. The networking needs
    of the key SCAs were examined in this research, and the appropriate protocols
    that can be applied at different system levels have been identified. Additionally,
    we provided examples of networking protocols and smart grid, intelligent building,
    smart residence, and smart transportation system architectures. We concentrated
    on key criteria for a variety of networking designs, such as energy savings, routing,
    security, dependability, mobility, and support for heterogeneous networks. In
    addition, we presented open research issues. This survey can assist researchers
    to recognize research gaps/problems working in the networking architectures for
    smart cities, and it provides an overview of available protocols and architectures
    for SCAs. Author Contributions Conceptualization, D.K.; methodology, D.K. and

  description: With the rapid growth of population and the increasing demand for food
    worldwide, improving productivity in farming procedures is essential. Smart farming
    is a concept that emphasizes the use of modern technologies such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance productivity in farming
    practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of data are collected from
    diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks, network-connected weather stations,
    monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These data are valuable resources to be used
    in data-driven services and decision support systems (DSS) in farming applications.
    However, one of the major challenges with these large amounts of agriculture data
    is their immense diversity in terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different
    services and technologies in a smart farming ecosystem have limited capability
    to work together due to the lack of standardized practices for data and system
    integration. These issues create a significant challenge in cooperative service
    provision, data and technology integration, and data-sharing practices. To address
    these issues, in this paper, we propose the platform approach, a design approach
    intended to guide building effective, reliable, and robust smart farming systems.
    The proposed platform approach considers six requirements for seamless integration,
    processing, and use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming platform
    include interoperability, reliability, scalability, real-time data processing,
    end-to-end security and privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A
    smart farming platform that considers these requirements leads to increased productivity,
    profitability, and performance of connected smart farms. In this paper, we aim
    at introducing the platform approach concept for smart farming and reviewing the
    requirements for this approach.

    Abstract With the rapid growth of population and the increasing demand for food
    worldwide, improving productivity in farming procedures is essential. Smart farming
    is a concept that emphasizes the use of modern technologies such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance productivity in farming
    practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of data are collected from
    diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks, network-connected weather stations,
    monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These data are valuable resources to be used
    in data-driven services and decision support systems (DSS) in farming applications.
    However, one of the major challenges with these large amounts of agriculture data
    is their immense diversity in terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different
    services and technologies in a smart farming ecosystem have limited capability
    to work together due to the lack of standardized practices for data and system
    integration. These issues create a significant challenge in cooperative service
    provision, data and technology integration, and data-sharing practices. To address
    these issues, in this paper, we propose the platform approach, a design approach
    intended to guide building effective, reliable, and robust smart farming systems.
    The proposed platform approach considers six requirements for seamless integration,
    processing, and use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming platform
    include interoperability, reliability, scalability, real-time data processing,
    end-to-end security and privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A
    smart farming platform that considers these requirements leads to increased productivity,
    profitability, and performance of connected smart farms. In this paper, we aim
    at introducing the platform approach concept for smart farming and reviewing the
    requirements for this approach. Keywords: smart farming; precise agriculture;

    1. Introduction According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) [1], food production should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in
    the world population by 2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity
    using solutions that consider resource shortage and farm profitability [2]. Employing
    information communication technology (ICT), smart technologies, in addition to
    the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence
    (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called smart farming. Smart farming
    is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4]. By managing inputs,
    such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart system can help farmers
    to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall costs, and to reach a
    more sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher productivity [5,6]. According
    to the Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion was dedicated to the global
    smart farming market in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs to increase yields, improve
    livestock production, and reduce management costs to meet the growing demand for
    food, smart farming should experience rapid growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].
    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data
    are generated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent
    different aspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops, soil,
    and the environment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial images, human
    experiences, and observations collected via mobile smartphone applications [9].
    Such data can be analyzed to filter out invalid or wrong data [2] and to compute
    personalized recommendations for a farm to improve productivity [10]. Different
    modern technologies can be utilized for data generation and data analysis in digital
    agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are examples of technologies that have
    recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12]. Although data-driven solutions
    have provided various benefits in agriculture, data integration, processing, and
    usage processes and protocols are still prominent challenges that need to be addressed
    [13]. Some of these challenges are limited awareness and knowledge of digitalization
    [14], lack of standardization and suitable management to cope with fragmented
    and heterogeneous data [15], lack of high-quality data and proper analysis [16],
    privacy and security challenges in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and
    lack of compliance with uniform regulations and policies [18]. A unified solution
    that considers the requirements in various stages of the data processing lifecycle
    can address various issues in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances awareness
    regarding the needs and requirements of different data sources, technologies,
    processes, and protocols (including policies). This solution assists the actors
    in smart farming ecosystems to provide their services and products to other parties
    in a more usable format. Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production,
    and sustainability by providing transparent and trustable data about every stage
    of the food chain. In addition, a unified solution provides an excellent opportunity
    for building decision frameworks to aggregate data from diverse sources and to
    provide high-quality data-driven services. This approach also facilitates data
    sharing and multiparty cooperation in farming applications, and thus, increases
    productivity and reduces resource waste. In this paper, we suggest the platform
    approach as a unified solution that facilitates cooperation in smart farming applications.
    Furthermore, this approach enforces relationships between farmers and system providers
    to track crop cycle information, livestock, and dairy production in a secure manner
    for their decisions and data management. In recent years, several platforms have
    been proposed for smart farming applications. SmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based
    platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary Australian team to automate
    the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and soil data. This
    platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and cloud servers
    for storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results in the paper
    showed that SmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time query responses.
    Moreover, the authors demonstrated that increasing the number of sensors had a
    negligible impact on the performance of the system, therefore, the proposed platform
    was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19] proposed Smart Farming Oriented BigData Architecture
    (SFOBA), a platform for big data processing that provided real-time processing
    on acquired data from smart farm systems and devices. In this study, the authors
    utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset [20] to show how the proposed platform
    could finish multidimensional queries on 40 million rows of data in less than
    one second. Clements et al. [21] developed an interactive digital tool that collected
    data from different sources such as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and
    the Key Indicators Database System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information
    regarding livestock production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules
    for risk assessment at the country level. Another field in smart farming is smart
    dairy farming which aims to utilize modern smart technologies to satisfy the increasing
    demand for quality dairy products, to reduce consumed resources, and to decrease
    the ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed SmartHerd, a platform
    enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and providing controls
    for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed in Waterford,
    Ireland, and was developed to gather and analyze data regarding dairy cattle.
    The presented platform is designed to keep working when the internet connection
    is lost. The generated data in this platform are stored locally and are shared
    on a cloud infrastructure when the internet connection is available. Most of the
    proposed platforms in smart farming have focused on a specific aspect of smart
    farming such as crop production recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],
    data transformation [19] reliability [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing
    need to collect, integrate, analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated
    at farms, effective farm data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the
    adoption and success of digital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing
    studies have not provided a holistically designed approach by considering different
    requirements for smart farming applications. To fill this gap, in this paper,
    we propose a design thinking approach, which we refer to as the “platform approach”,
    for smart farming data processing. This approach encourages consideration of six
    core requirements when designing, implementing, and testing smart farming solutions.
    These requirements are interoperability of data, processes, and technologies;
    reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability in
    terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;
    real-time data processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection
    of infrastructure and smart farming assets (privacy and security); and finally,
    compliance with policies and regulation. The proposed approach facilitates cooperation
    among different parties in smart farming ecosystems and enables these actors to
    make the most use of available data sources. The rest of this paper is organized
    as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data processing in smart farming
    systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges and requirements
    in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate the main requirements
    and related solutions in a smart farming platform; finally, in Section 5, we conclude
    the paper with a summary of the platform approach and some future insights. 2.
    The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart Farming Systems To improve smart
    farming data processing through the integration of various systems, in this paper,
    we propose the concept of the platform approach, which is a design approach for
    data processing. The smart farming platform approach allows farmers, researchers,
    technology providers, and all other stakeholders to have a standard and reliable
    solution to collect and share information, resources, and experiences to improve
    the productivity and performance of smart farming solutions. We demonstrate an
    overview of the main components of smart farming data processing in Figure 1 in
    five main layers. This abstract platform can shed light on the components of the
    smart farming application platform, defining the main tasks and core components
    for data processing in these systems. Figure 1. Smart farming components that
    facilitate integration, processing, and use of farm data. According to Figure
    1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from diverse sources, such
    as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external databases such as weather
    and climate data. The collected data from these different sources can be in different
    formats that are not compatible to be stored in a unique database. In addition,
    some collected data may contain incomplete data, missed values, outliers [25],
    and anomalous instances [26]. To address these problems, in the data preparation
    stage, best practices for data preprocessing can be used to prepare data for further
    analysis. These practices include standardizing data to a predefined format, identifying
    and deleting duplicated data, handling the gaps in generated data, and validating
    data sources and contents. Additionally, the collected data from different sources
    can be stored in a common infrastructure and can be integrated with other data
    sources that are collected from diverse smart farming systems. These methods assist
    in ensuring data consistency, completeness [27], and accuracy [28]. The components
    in the second and the third layers are highly correlated, and many of the smart
    farming data processing functions can be assigned to both layers. The data processing
    layer components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical modeling,
    statistical methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge from
    farm data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques
    to make automated decisions with limited human involvement. Machine learning can
    perform rapid optimizations, classifications [30], predictions, and recommendations
    and add value to the entire system [31]. For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton
    [13], utilizes machine learning for identifying individual cows. This system also
    monitors the cows to detect disease symptoms through data collected from sensors
    at milking stations on dairy farms. As another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an
    open-source analytic platform that uses machine learning to categorize iceberg
    lettuces to improve the actual yield and crop marketability before harvesting
    [32]. Model deployment in the context of machine learning refers to the application
    of generalizing a model to predict new items in the system. Prediction is according
    to estimating the outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.
    For example, the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest
    time and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction
    about the future using time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming
    is weather forecasting using temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].
    The decision-making stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model
    metadata management to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed
    model. Metadata (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding
    of the meaning of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking
    devices can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.
    These data can help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during the
    decision-making process. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,
    pesticide control, and water management. In the last stage of smart farming applications,
    end-users, i.e., farmers, farming service providers, agriculture researchers,
    and governments access the system results through services. System monitoring
    can audit the entire system and provide feedback to optimize the predictors and
    to improve decision making. In addition, rule management can check the compliance
    of decisions against available rules. Since trustworthiness is a core requirement
    to ensure system adoption and use, it is necessary to consider security and privacy
    concerns in all communications and end-to-end in the platform. Moreover, the data
    workflow should comply with the available policy and regulations in smart farming.
    Application programming interfaces (APIs) are common methods for the integration
    of different components and resources (e.g., data sources, legal processes, and
    policy protocols) in a platform approach. 3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart
    Farming The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using
    platform structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build
    effective, reliable, and robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing
    a common understanding and semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate
    in data-sharing practices and cooperative service provision. In Section 2, we
    presented an abstract overview of such a platform as well as the main components
    of data processing in smart farming systems. In this section, we discuss the challenges
    in smart farming applications and convey the major requirements that any agricultural
    platform should have to address these challenges. In agriculture, data are highly
    heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format, and intent of data,
    different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data. For example,
    poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior of birds,
    such as their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility of a disease
    outbreak in the early stages. A major challenge in such an application is combining
    heterogeneous data collected from different sensors in smart poultry farms. In
    addition to collecting and processing data, aggregating diverse data among various
    farms can improve the prediction outcome. However, lack of interoperability among
    data, technologies, and data processes is a significant barrier to reaching this
    goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim to equip their farms with
    new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers do not follow
    a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new digital tools
    and devices to their smart farming network. In the context of smart farming, interoperability
    refers to the ability of two or more different systems, services, and components
    (i.e., software components and IoT devices) to be able to work together to exchange
    information, facilitate processes, integrate technology solutions, and comply
    with policies and legal requirements. There are four categories of interoperability
    including semantic/data interoperability, technology or system interoperability,
    operational interoperability, and legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic
    interoperability, the entities should mutually agree on the meaning, content,
    and context of data exchange and use [35]. Interoperability improves the flexibility
    of smart farming networks as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data
    sharing and enhance their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability
    is standardization. In the context of data processing, without mechanisms to take
    data from diverse sources of digital agriculture solutions, it would be extremely
    resource based and time-consuming to make the most use of data. Using processes
    and best practices that convert data and information to harmonized formats is
    critical to enabling data sharing and integration practices and collaborative
    decision making. Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems,
    controlling data reliability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform.
    Data reliability, sometimes referred to as data quality, is defined as the extent
    to which the data and its source are trustworthy, unfailing, authentic, genuine,
    and representative of the problem [36]. Reliability can be evaluated at different
    levels, such as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of view, it
    is essential to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device
    that is physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid
    and unstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming platform
    should ensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and trustable.
    Data quality issues are also likely to arise in the integration process as the
    quality of all data sources cannot be verified [37,38]. Wrong decisions originating
    from unreliable data in decision-making processes cost agricultural businesses
    billions per year [39]. Scalability is another requirement that should be considered
    while designing a smart farming platform [40]. Scalability in smart farming refers
    to the adaptability of a system to increase the capacity, for example, the number
    of technology devices such as sensors and actuators, while enabling timely analysis
    [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart farming architecture, in the context
    of data processing, would lead to weak system performance. For instance, integration
    with other devices and applications may not be possible if scalability requirements
    are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider the possibility
    of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems from
    the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large
    poultry production that owns farms in different locations. This company needs
    a platform to build a scalable business by integrating the supply chain from feed
    to hatcheries and poultry farms to distribution [43]. These poultry farms may
    have different sensors and acquire various types of technologies to collect data
    in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The company should be able
    to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other computation resources
    to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need for resource
    growth is not considered in the design of the system, the company cannot easily
    expand their system to process and use other data sources. Platforms for smart
    farming should consider scalability as a core requirement to enable growth and
    future needs for integration. Moreover, in smart farming systems, we need fast
    and accurate decisions and actions. Thus, we need platforms that enable farmers
    to deliver proper actions at the right time. Real-time data analytics is defined
    as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data when they are created
    or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer decides to sell their
    products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting access to data and making
    decisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly offering an estimation
    originated from outdated data. Real-time processing is an approach to capture,
    process, and export data promptly [46,47]. Furthermore, real-time data processing
    enables smart farming actors to take proper decisions at the right time which
    leads to minimizing risks and undesirable consequences [48]. A smart farming platform
    can also facilitate real-time processing as a requirement for reinforcing farming
    practices and preparing farmers against unexpected circumstances [45]. To achieve
    real-time data processing, it is also necessary to collect the data in real time.
    The results acquired based on analyzing old data can cause inaccurate decisions,
    while real-time data facilitates real-time decisions and actions [46]. Similar
    to any other smart platform, a smart farming platform should bring security and
    privacy to the core of attention and provide sufficient protection mechanisms.
    Modern technologies form an ecosystem in which connected devices are accessible
    remotely, allowing adversaries to plan cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to
    steal information or carry out disruptive actions on the smart farming systems
    [49]. For example, Yang et al. illustrated how adversaries used IoT devices in
    IT infrastructure to compromise security [4]. As an illustration, a malicious
    actor can get access to a farm’s data using an unsecured smart device and steal
    information about the products, financial decisions, and future plans. The intruder
    can also damage the products and equipment. Because of the availability of diverse
    data sources in smart farming systems, including personal and business data, privacy
    is another paramount concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms
    to ensure security requirements and data protection. These practices must protect
    data end-to-end and in different data processing stages, from data collection
    to data-driven service provision. Regulations for agricultural practices affect
    the design and development of smart farming technologies. For instance, farmers’
    concerns about data sharing and privacy have been discussed in recent studies
    [50,51]. Farmers are not convinced that the available policies to protect their
    intellectual property, business profit share, and privacy are sufficient. There
    are also concerns about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and
    farm data agreements by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns
    and build trust, there is a need to establish standards and best practices that
    mandate the rights and responsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems.
    There is also the need to set standards for data-sharing practices and to apply
    policies to determine accountability and penalties in the case of possible disputes.
    Other regulations related to food safety, supply chain management, disease monitoring,
    and other applications can also impact agriculture data management and processing.
    These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new and emerging agri-food needs
    and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded into technologies for monitoring,
    compliance, and sustainability purposes. In summary, as is demonstrated in Figure
    2, we recommend consideration of a platform approach that facilitates six requirements
    for smart farming data processing. These requirements enable seamless integration
    of data, system, and processes with the end-user in mind. They include interoperability
    to provide compatibility among different components of the platform; real-time
    processing to generate fast and accurate information for decision making; scalability
    that enables the platform to extend the entities and resources; reliability to
    assure accessing valid and up-to-date data; ensuring security and privacy to preserve
    the system safety and confidentiality; and, finally compliance with the related
    policies and regulations in smart farming. A platform that satisfies all these
    requirements can enhance farming practices, and therefore, can increase productivity,
    profitability, and performance while decreasing resource waste. Figure 2. Platform
    requirements for data processing. 4. Requirements, Discussion and Solutions In
    Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered in the design
    of smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements are necessary for
    any platform that aims to provide fast and robust services in a smart farming
    ecosystem. In the following, we investigate these requirements and the solutions
    to address them in the platform approach. 4.1. Interoperability Currently, there
    is an extensive number of digital solutions including software tools and services
    that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted in the generation
    of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication technologies with
    different formats and semantics. However, data generated by precision farming
    tools are not portable and cannot be integrated among smart farming systems. Interoperability
    among technical software tools, hardware, or processes/protocols is relatively
    limited often because of the lack of established standards [53]. Interoperability
    requirements cut across various components of smart farming technologies (Figure
    1) from collecting data with varying accessibility rules, data integration across
    multiple sectors/devices, and data processing and protection regulation for data
    governance and data access. Interoperability can be viewed from legal, organizational
    or operational, semantic, and technical dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability
    involves ensuring the integration of smart farming platforms under various legal
    frameworks including food policies, privacy policies and procedures, and data
    agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming system, data could be
    combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This integration
    should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address legal
    interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles can
    be used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access to and
    re-use of data, deciding who has access to and is responsible for the data, managing
    the legal interests, explaining the rights clearly, and promoting harmonization
    of rights in the data. These principles can be embedded into the farm data processing
    platform and integration can be enabled through application programming interfaces
    (APIs). Organizational interoperability is concerned with agricultural actors’
    capacity to accept and utilize services from other organizations to collaborate
    effectively [54]. This is dependent on the degree to which farms’ processes, responsibilities,
    and roles are harmonized toward shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural
    systems to make services more accessible, easily identifiable, and user focused.
    To address the organizational interoperability requirements, farm business processes
    and exchanged data need to be integrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly
    agreed modeling method [55]. Semantic interoperability ensures that the precise
    meaning and format of the shared data are understood and preserved. In existing
    smart farming ecosystems, data are collected from fragmented systems in varying
    formats and meanings. To tackle the lack of semantic interoperability in data
    processing, it is necessary to describe all data elements by developing vocabularies
    and schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties understand the
    data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability in
    smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable
    to a common language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic
    interoperability issues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using
    standardized languages such as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing
    farm production processes as well as the real-world objects required in conducting
    these processes. For semantic interoperability enhancement, a smart farming application
    can leverage metadata that describes original data, allowing the user to make
    the best decision possible about how to use it. Metadata is generated to add meaning
    and context to data values and to establish a common understanding of the meaning
    and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct and proper use and interpretation
    of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore, it also enables farm machines
    to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating ambiguity [58]. For example,
    in the modeling and simulation of a decision support platform in smart farming,
    there is a need for a method to detect conflict between system components and
    concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address the interoperability of such
    systems by capturing information about model concepts which allows software agents
    to reason in an unambiguous and machine-readable form [59]. Data interoperability
    is considerably resolved in smart farming when metadata is standardized, and common
    language definitions are used. Such standards are defined and promoted by standard
    agencies such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO) [60]. The Agricultural
    Information Management Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricultural Metadata Element
    Set (AgMES) [62], and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata initiatives in the
    agriculture area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable better interoperability
    by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy aids in the interpretation
    of relationships between data entities and the categorization of data [64]. Ontology
    explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic relationships
    among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies such as FoodWiki,
    Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics of food and agricultural
    data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In addition, sensor ontologies
    such as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data ontology [66] are used for
    semantic interoperability of data collected from IoT devices. The goal of these
    ontologies is to identify essential elements of sensor data and to model resources,
    services, and geographical data to ease data access for users. Another aspect
    of interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the capacity
    of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services, or
    protocols to easily integrate and enable process and data flow [54]. This concept
    is fundamental to software and hardware compatibility. For example, interoperability
    is required among farm machines, software, IoT devices, and sensors. If the data
    processing modules do not recognize the data format collected by the combined
    harvester, the IoT will be of little use in terms of assisting decision making.
    Technical interoperability often can be satisfied by selecting and implementing
    the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and protocols, as well as
    standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical interoperability
    could be satisfied by creating a decentralized network of existing systems to
    enable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system could be independent
    and built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS initiative is one of
    the projects that developed such an open technical interoperable network involving
    stakeholders from diverse agricultural domains by using open technical specification.
    This project aims to provide a distributed service-oriented platform that enables
    some tasks such as watering management, soil management, and behavioral analysis
    of livestock. This framework involves all actors in the food chain, enhancing
    the process from farm to fork. Interoperability is made possible by data standards
    that allow the sharing and exchange of data. In the absence of standardization
    of data, processing data from heterogeneous and incompatible sources is challenging
    and often inefficient. Data standardization is a key step toward data interoperability
    to promote data quality, data sharing, data reusability, and to optimize data
    usage. The standardization process of data, processes, policies, and concepts
    is critical in ensuring all types of interoperability. This goal may be realized
    by well-defined and well-established protocols and regulations that facilitate
    the integration of multiple data sources and external knowledge-based services
    given by stakeholders and partners. Due to the complexity of data standardization,
    data harmonization [68] can be used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization
    is the process of merging different data sources into an unambiguous, integrated
    entity record to be used in the system and to feed the processes of a system [69].
    The main difference between data standardization and data harmonization comes
    from the level of strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of data standardization
    is to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure that
    data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms
    and formats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging
    different data sources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be used
    in the system and to feed the processes of a system [69]. 4.2. Reliability Reliability
    is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across smart farming
    ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on effective processes,
    data, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability should be considered
    in all stages of smart farming, from data acquisition to data preparation and
    model building. Reliability can be considered from different aspects such as data
    reliability and technology reliability. The main components of data reliability
    are data consistency, data completeness [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency
    as the main component of reliability [2] refers to keeping data concepts, value
    domains, and formats unchanged. Changes to farm data might take place while processing,
    moving through networks, or sharing between applications [28,72]. Data completeness
    is about the availability of all necessary data for decision making [72]. In other
    words, the deficiency of a component should not impact the accuracy and integrity
    of data [28]. Data completeness in smart farming does not mean that all data attributes
    must be present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need to be
    decided for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reflect
    the true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision
    agriculture system may be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable
    or broken sensors, lost information, and failed transmissions [74]. The inaccurate
    data can lead to a risk of missing events and hard interpretations [74]. In addition
    to data reliability, smart farming platforms require robust and reliable technologies
    such as high speed and reliable internet connection [75]. The physical safety
    of IoT devices for precision agriculture systems should be ensured in different
    environmental conditions to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should
    process data accurately and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly
    to emerging issues and changing conditions [76]. Because agricultural data cover
    a wide range of heterogeneous and unstructured sources, simple ratios can be used
    to measure the percentage of data elements that meets specific rules [77]. To
    manage information structure in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested using
    parsing techniques. Using this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,
    was calculated by comparing it with data coming from multiple reference sensors,
    existing historical data, or an alternate data source. There are, however, several
    challenges to using this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors
    is not always guaranteed, historical data might not be available, and there might
    be additional costs using alternate data sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing
    on the aggregated data from sensors and other sources is recommended to raise
    data reliability in smart farms. For example, outlier detection can help to detect
    faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged with other farms. 4.3.
    Scalability Scalability is another requirement that should be considered in a
    smart farming platform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase available
    resources and system capability without the need to go through a major system
    redesign or implementation. As an illustration, in Figure 1, we can increase the
    capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud resources in the second layer
    and computation resources in the third layer. The challenges related to scalability
    in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity and performance [79]. Scaling
    capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes or resources to the system [41].
    Scaling performance is the ability to improve performance or to keep the performance
    identical while expanding capacity. The fundamental bottleneck that may affect
    system performance may be caused by different deployment configurations of various
    components [80]. Other challenges of scalability are identity management and access
    control, security [81], privacy [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since
    farming data generation is rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large
    to be stored on a single node. A fundamental solution to address this need is
    distributing data collection mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou
    et al. [82] employed Hadoop to process and store 1.44 million data records for
    daily temperature monitoring. Since most smart farming data are small files that
    lead to many small files, Hadoop cannot be effective without a distributed system
    equipped with a high-performance computing system. To address this problem, the
    Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) has been designed to process large (and
    small size) datasets. Using cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform
    is another solution that can address scalability challenges related to capacity
    due to flexible and robust data collection, management, and processing capabilities
    [83]. Cloud computing provides a high level of flexibility by providing remote
    services for monitoring and managing farm data. Moreover, these services can provide
    on-demand storage and computation resources with no need for on-farm hardware
    installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems are usually distributed
    in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms. The data-driven
    services are finally offered by web services accessible through diverse tools,
    including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming
    tasks, as shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform
    that utilizes cloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for smart
    farming. Despite several benefits of employing cloud technology in smart farming
    systems, the challenges such as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring
    a large amount of data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues,
    the use of edge computing at the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85].
    Edge computing is a technology that aims to process data at the edge of the network,
    near the source of the data in order to reduce the transmitted data to the cloud
    servers, as well as to decrease the workload on the centralized cloud computing
    servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage the scalability of cloud computing
    resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge computing and decreasing
    the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem with the right APIs
    and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability and real-time
    processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture is the
    platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This
    platform was implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures
    related to tomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock
    production and health management. Although edge computing increases scalability
    in a system, it increases concerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized
    devices in a network. Because this technology utilizes diverse software and hardware
    products in different layers of the network, the performance of the system is
    highly correlated with the compatibility of the used components. Ning et al. [86]
    discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing and the solutions to address
    this problem. 4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and Decision Making Similar
    to many other emerging real-world applications, smart farming applications need
    real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88]. Real-time data lead to real-time
    decisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming system, making fast and accurate
    decisions is a major goal. To achieve this goal, we need mechanisms to collect
    and process the diverse available data sources in real time. These data are generated
    by different technologies including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones,
    climate forecasting services, and smartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big
    data processing which provides real-time processing in many domains of agriculture.
    This platform integrates different data sources, data modeling, and software products
    to provide real-time data analysis in farming applications. Al-Thani et al. [89]
    investigated the set-up process for the use of a drone in monitoring sheep livestock.
    They also used image processing and ML models in a real field application. With
    the massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision and deep learning
    models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses and farms.
    These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real time [90].
    For example, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop a model to
    estimate the leaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce [91]. Real-time
    data lead to real-time decisions and actions [48]. For example, agile actions
    can be carried out in sudden changes in operational conditions or other circumstances
    such as weather changes and disease prediction alerts. In addition, the use of
    IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and robotics is increasing
    in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart farming. These technologies
    can establish the networking of machines and control farm activities automatically
    and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing data at intermediate points at the
    “edge” of the network rather than always at the central server or data center
    leads to faster data processing and a shorter response time critical for real-time
    processing [93]. To analyze the large agriculture data collected from fields and
    reveal hidden patterns of interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting
    models such as disease, pests, and yield prediction models. Machine learning models
    that were mostly used in the prediction include artificial neural network, support
    vector machine, and logistic regression [76]. These algorithms can be integrated
    with data analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and Spark for real-time analysis
    and better performance [19,76]. Utilizing edge computing provides another opportunity
    for data processing which is federated learning that can address a major concern
    in data processing for smart farming, which is data sharing. Many farmers prefer
    to keep their data private, decreasing their motivation to participate in collaborative
    learning activities. Alternatively, utilizing federated learning, the learning
    model is distributed to the edge nodes without sharing the farms’ data with a
    central unit in the system. This approach reduces data privacy concerns and encourages
    farmers to participate in cooperative learning processes. 4.5. Security and Privacy
    Security and privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be considered
    throughout a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure
    a smart farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms
    that can enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.
    It enables a service provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors in
    the system and to set some restrictions on the activities of low-trustable parties.
    AgriTrust [94] is a trust management approach designed for smart farming applications.
    This framework monitors the interactions in the system and updates trust metrics
    such as credibility, robustness, and reliability through time. Using this approach,
    smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on each transaction to the network,
    therefore, this feedback can be utilized by the trust management framework for
    trustworthiness evaluation. Another mechanism for security enhancement in smart
    farming is access control which is a mechanism to consider the policies and agreements
    to handle requests and access permissions. These permissions can be granted based
    on the roles and attributes or agreements. For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95]
    proposed an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes
    policies that combine different attributes from different sources, including user,
    data, device, and environment, and provides fine-grained, flexible access management.
    In this study, the authors modeled a smart farming ecosystem with different agriculture
    sensors for temperature and soil monitoring, tractor and truck movement controls,
    as well as labor management, and presented a mechanism to handle access requests
    to data and devices. In smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the field
    and usually transferred to on-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different
    technologies are used for data transfer in agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular
    networks. To protect data from adversaries in the transfer stage, encryption is
    a common technique. For this purpose, the data are encrypted before transmission
    and then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97] presented an encryption
    method for agricultural information systems. This method builds secure communication
    among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in the paper
    showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as compared
    with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming applications
    was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid method combining
    two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the presented method on
    a crop monitoring system. A platform for smart farming can leverage the mentioned
    solutions, including trust management, access control, and encrypted data transmission
    to ensure that security and privacy during all stages of smart farming procedures,
    as shown in Figure 2. Another state-of-the-art technology that can be used for
    enhancing security and privacy in smart farming is the blockchain. This technology
    has been used in some agriculture applications and could reshape smart farming
    ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that keeps
    the records of all previous transactions in a system [99]. In addition, this technology
    enables automatic procedure execution using smart contracts. A smart contract
    is a computer program that can be deployed on a blockchain platform to run some
    procedures automatically without human intervention [29]. In recent years, blockchain
    technology and smart contracts have been widely used in different smart farming
    applications, including trust management [100,101], water management [102,103],
    food traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106]. 4.6. Regulation and Policies
    Considering the available regulations and practices in agriculture, a mechanism
    for compliance with these rules is beneficial in a smart farming platform. The
    regulations related to smart farming cover different aspects of agriculture, including
    but not limited to, food security, biosecurity, climate change, and data governance.
    In the following, some of these regulations in different jurisdictions are briefly
    reviewed. The European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a unified
    policy across Europe to support farmers and to improve agricultural productivity.
    This policy aims to improve the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate
    changes, and manage natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications,
    the policy supports technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as
    well as reduce ecological footprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control
    the availability of supplies and to ensure that the prices of products are reasonable
    for both producers and customers. Another widely used regulation under the European
    Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union (EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural
    Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The Committee of Professional Agricultural
    Organizations (COPA) and the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives
    (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020. This code mainly focuses on non-personal
    data collected on farms and leaves the personal data to be treated under other
    regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature of collected data in agriculture,
    it is impossible to define data ownership in the same way as physical objects
    and it suggests using different levels of rights. Therefore, the key step from
    this code’s point of view is a contract that determines the rights of all parties
    to protect their sensitive information, while all permissions related to data
    collection, access, and utilization are needed to be approved by the data originator.
    To evaluate the compliance of a product or service with this code, a checklist
    consisting of fifteen questions has been provided by the publishers. These questions
    specify the collected data and the rights to share, access, and use these data.
    In addition, several regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S.
    jurisdiction. An example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different
    aspects of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy,
    and organic farming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the
    productivity of the farming process, and to reduce negative environmental impact.
    Generally, in a five-year cycle, the farm acts are updated to govern agriculture,
    food, and rural development programs. In the context of smart farming, this policy
    considers different technologies such as GPS, computer mapping, guidance systems,
    and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) [111]
    is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This act aims to enhance food
    safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules ensuring responsibility
    and accountability of different parties that work in the agricultural sections.
    Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government to facilitate product
    tracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety plans. Another regulation
    related to smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction is the Privacy and Security
    Principles for Farm Data (PSPFD) [112]. It was established by the American Farm
    Bureau Federation (AFBF) in 2014. The principles under this regulation are mostly
    around data ownership, consent, and disclosure. To ensure compliance with PSPFD,
    the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Transparency Evaluator. This tool assesses
    contracts among agriculture stakeholders against the principles provided in the
    PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful, the contract gets an Ag Data Transparency
    seal that informs the parties that it has been approved. Despite the efforts on
    regulations related to big data in smart farming, there are still some gaps in
    this field. One of the issues is the lack of comprehensive and unified regulations
    for agriculture data, while the available practices and a code of conduct are
    not compulsory. To make the most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart
    farming platform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance with available
    policies in smart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage the parties
    to trust the services provided and participate in collaborative practices that
    enhance the performance of data processing systems in agriculture applications.
    5. Conclusions Smart farming provides the agricultural industry with diverse data-driven
    services which improve different applications from farm to fork. These services
    benefit from a large amount of available data in smart farming ecosystems. However,
    a major challenge in smart farming information processing is consistency and compatibility
    among the utilized technologies, procedures, and protocols. To address this issue,
    in this paper, we suggest the platform approach which is a design thinking approach
    that encourages different actors in a smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration
    among different services by following some requirements. Moreover, we suggest
    six requirements for a smart farming platform, including interoperability, real-time
    data processing, scalability, reliability, security, and compliance with farming
    regulations. Such a platform can enhance the available services in the agriculture
    industry by enabling collaboration among different service providers. Furthermore,
    such a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and privacy
    concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders. Currently,
    a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of unified protocols
    and standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers is needed
    to address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement a sample
    of the proposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available software
    and hardware products that follow similar protocols, and therefore, are compatible.

    Internet of Things (IoT) provide a promising Smart irrigation facilitator for
    continual monitoring and control of environmental parameters, thereby leading
    to a huge volume of data to be efficiently collected, transferred, processed and
    stored. The deployment of cloud-based infrastructure with on-field connectedness,
    allowing information exchange among IoT nodes, and the usage of energy scavenging
    (e.g., solar power) in feeding them, become necessary, since agricultural fields
    are in lack of wired energy supply and, often, a reliable (Internet) network coverage.
    Therefore, these issues can be addressed through the integration of Edge computing
    in IoT scenarios. An efficient strategy is required to select the best communication
    technology with a motive of increasing the network performance between the IoT
    devices, Edge device and cloud. Application Specific Infrastructure Selection
    (ASIS) is an edge computing model developed to select the appropriate communication
    protocols according to the infrastructure requirements of three different real
    time scenarios namely: Assembly line automation, Smart parking system and Automatic
    irrigation system are deployed to get the most suitable application specific protocol
    from ZigBee, LoRa (Long Range) and LoWPAN (Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network)
    to implement in real-time basis. ASIS model is proposed as a network resource
    manager that is capable of sensing, acting, signal processing, and/or communication
    abilities to perform a protocol selection according to their physical and technological
    limitations. Further Edge based ASIS model is developed to enhance the network
    performance even better when compared with cloud-based model. Automatic irrigation
    system is extended in the Edge based ASIS model. The overall ASIS system is evaluated
    by means of network parameters such as network usage, network delay and power

    of Automatic irrigation system is modeled using Edge based ASIS model where ZigBee

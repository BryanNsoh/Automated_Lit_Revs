  description: There is increased demand for irrigation scheduling tools that support
    effective use of the limited supply of irrigation water. An efficient precision
    irrigation system requires water to be delivered based on crop needs by measuring
    or estimating plant water stress. Leaf temperature is a good indicator of water
    stress. In this study, a system was developed to monitor leaf temperature and
    microclimatic environmental variables to predict plant water stress. This system,
    called the leaf monitor, monitored plant water status by continuously measuring
    leaf temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, ambient light, and wind
    conditions in the vicinity of a shaded leaf. The system also included a leaf holder,
    a solar radiation diffuser dome, and a wind barrier for improved performance of
    the unit. Controlled wind speed and consistent light conditions were created around
    the leaf to reduce the effect of nuisance variables on leaf temperature. The leaf
    monitor was incorporated into a mesh network of wireless nodes for sensor data
    collection and remote valve control. The system was evaluated for remote data
    collection in commercial orchards. Experiments were conducted during the 2013
    and 2014 growing seasons in walnut (Juglans regia) and almond (Prunus dulcis)
    orchards. The system was found to be reliable and capable of providing real-time
    visualization of the data remotely, with minimal technical problems. Leaf monitor
    data were used to develop modified crop water stress index (MCWSI) values for
    quantifying plant water stress levels.

    tools that support effective use of the limited supply of irrigation water. An
    efficient precision irrigation system requires water to be delivered based on
    crop needs by measuring or estimating plant water stress. Leaf temperature is
    a good indicator of water stress. In this study, a system was developed to monitor
    leaf temperature and microclimatic environmental variables to predict plant water
    stress. This system, called the leaf monitor, monitored plant water status by
    continuously measuring leaf temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, ambient
    light, and wind conditions in the vicinity of a shaded leaf. The system also included
    a leaf holder, a solar radiation diffuser dome, and a wind barrier for improved
    performance of the unit. Controlled wind speed and consistent light conditions
    were created around the leaf to reduce the effect of nuisance variables on leaf
    temperature. The leaf monitor was incorporated into a mesh network of wireless
    nodes for sensor data collection and remote valve control. The system was evaluated
    for remote data collection in commercial orchards. Experiments were conducted
    during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons in walnut () and almond () orchards.
    The system was found to be reliable and capable of providing real-time visualization
    of the data remotely, with minimal technical problems. Leaf monitor data were
    used to develop modified crop water stress index (MCWSI) values for quantifying
    plant water stress levels. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 6 Share Facebook

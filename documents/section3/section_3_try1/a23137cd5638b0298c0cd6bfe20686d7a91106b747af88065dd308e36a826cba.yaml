    automatic irrigation according to desired drought scenarios, and a remote, wireless
    connection to monitor each plant and device performance via a data platform. During
    testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive enough to detect and measure plant transpiration,
    from early to ultimate plant developmental stages. Even though the results were
    generated on common beans, the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops.

    215 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate instability directly affects
    agro-environments. Water scarcity, high air temperature, and changes in soil biota
    are some factors caused by environmental changes. Verified and precise phenotypic
    traits are required for assessing the impact of various stress factors on crop
    performance while keeping phenotyping costs at a reasonable level. Experiments
    which use a lysimeter method to measure transpiration efficiency are often expensive
    and require complex infrastructures. This study presents the development and testing
    process of an automated, reliable, small, and low-cost prototype system using
    IoT with high-frequency potential in near-real time. Because of its waterproofness,
    our device—LysipheN—assesses each plant individually and can be deployed for experiments
    in different environmental conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN
    integrates multiple sensors, automatic irrigation according to desired drought
    scenarios, and a remote, wireless connection to monitor each plant and device
    performance via a data platform. During testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive
    enough to detect and measure plant transpiration, from early to ultimate plant
    developmental stages. Even though the results were generated on common beans,
    the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops. This tool serves to screen
    transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related physiological
    traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design, LysipheN will
    be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and breeding context.
    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board
    temperature, the inside stem temperature (inserted thermocouple), and soil temperature
    together with air RH and calculated VPD. GU1 to GU5 studied younger (PCS) plants
    (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 studied plants close to the final harvest
    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for
    connecting sensors and dripping irrigation tubes. 5. Peristaltic pump for irrigation
    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t

    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information

    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.

    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

    1. Introduction In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use
    of technology to improve agricultural practices and address the challenges facing
    the farming community. Monitoring and managing soil quality is an essential aspect
    of agriculture, as it directly influences soil yield, resource allocation, and
    environmental sustainability. For farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other management practices, accurate and timely soil condition
    data is essential. However, conventional soil analysis and monitoring methods
    are frequently time-consuming, labor-intensive, and require specialized knowledge
    sets (Fan et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2020, Toth et al., 2020). Tiny Machine Learning
    (TinyML), an emerging field, offers promising solutions to overcome these limitations.
    TinyML involves deploying machine learning models on Internet of Things (IoT)
    ecosystem devices with limited resources, such as microcontrollers. Real-time
    deployment of complex machine learning models is difficult on these devices due
    to their limited computational memory, and power. Due to the requirement for real-time
    decisions, energy efficiency, and low-latency operations, deploying TinyML models
    for the monitoring and management of soil quality in agriculture presents unique
    challenges. Conventional machine learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Q Learning, are often unsuitable
    for deployment on TinyML devices due to their high computational complexity and
    memory requirements via Information Theory Modelling (ITM) (Micheli et al., 2022,
    Wu et al., 2022, Wu et al., 1 Sept. 1, 2020,) process. In this paper, a power-aware
    and delay-aware TinyML deployment strategy is proposed for the monitoring and
    management of soil quality in agriculture. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
    (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting,
    and Task Partitioning comprise proposed method reduce energy consumption, reduce
    delay, and maintain accuracy comparable to existing CNN, RNN, and Q Learning algorithms
    by employing these techniques. This research''s primary objective is to develop
    a practical and efficient solution for real-time monitoring and management of
    soil quality, which will enable farmers to optimize resource utilization, increase
    soil yield, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. By deploying TinyML
    models directly on the field using low-power microcontrollers and integrated sensors,
    farmers can continuously monitor key soil quality parameters, such as moisture
    content, pH level, and nutrient levels. This real-time data allows farmers to
    make decisions based on data, respond quickly to changing soil conditions, and
    implement targeted irrigation, fertilization, and pest control interventions.
    The proposed power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model has great potential for
    a variety of real-time agricultural scenarios. Its compatibility with advanced
    machine learning techniques such as CNNs, RNNs, and Q Learning enables the analysis
    of spatial and temporal soil data, thereby facilitating soil disease detection,
    weed identification, and yield prediction. Farmers can efficiently manage agricultural
    operations while minimizing chemical inputs and environmental impact sets by utilizing
    the model''s reduced energy consumption and low-latency capabilities. This paper
    concludes by addressing the need for a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model
    for the monitoring and management of agricultural soil quality. Combining DVFS,
    Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task
    Partitioning, the proposed model reduces energy consumption, decreases delay,
    and maintains precision. By enabling real-time decision making, this model has
    the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices, increase soil productivity,
    and promote sustainable resource management. The following sections of this paper
    will describe the methodology, experimental setup, results, and implications of
    our proposed approach, thereby providing valuable insights into the application
    of TinyML for agricultural soil quality monitoring and management scenarios. 2.
    Review of existing methods for deploying efficient soil quality monitoring & management
    techniques Numerous models are proposed for deploying monitoring and management
    techniques for soil quality in real-time scenarios. These consist of: Conventional
    Soil Analysis Techniques Conventional soil analysis techniques involve laboratory-based
    techniques that require collecting soil samples, transporting them to a laboratory,
    and conducting various tests to evaluate soil quality parameters and scenarios.
    Although these methods are accurate, they have time, cost, and scalability limitations
    (Agarwal et al., 2021, Chen et al., 1 Sept. 1, 2021,, Hänsch et al., 2021). They
    are not suitable for monitoring and managing soil conditions in agricultural fields
    in real time (Gopalakrishnan et al., 1 March 1, 2021,, Leanza et al., 2022, Tang
    and Yan, 2022). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs): WSNs are widely used in agriculture
    for soil quality monitoring. These networks consist of sensor nodes that are spatially
    dispersed and collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and other relevant parameters.
    However, there are obstacles regarding energy consumption and scalability. High-power
    sensor nodes and frequent data transmission can rapidly deplete the network''s
    energy resources, resulting in limited deployment range and maintenance issues
    (Efremova, Seddik, & Erten, 2022; Yuan, 2020) through the use of CycleGAN (Generative
    Adversarial Networks) and similar modeling techniques. Remote Sensing: Techniques
    for remote sensing, such as satellite imagery and aerial surveys, provide valuable
    information on soil conditions on a large scale. These techniques can detect large-scale
    patterns of soil quality, plant health, and water stress. Nevertheless, they frequently
    lack the spatial resolution necessary for detailed site-specific monitoring applications.
    Moreover, delays in data acquisition and processing can impede real-time decision-making
    (Li et al., 2023, Ren et al., 2020). Cloud-based systems employ machine learning
    algorithms to analyze vast quantities of soil data gathered by distributed sensors.
    These systems provide a high level of computational power and storage capacity,
    allowing for advanced analytics and decision support. The dependency on cloud
    infrastructure for processing and analysis, however, introduces latency, rendering
    it unsuitable for real-time applications. In addition, it necessitates constant
    connectivity and may be subject to data security and privacy concerns (Lin and
    Hao, 15 April 15, 2021,, Luo et al., 2022). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
    CNNs have been implemented in soil image analysis for tasks such as identifying
    soil contaminants and classifying soil types. They are difficult to deploy on
    resource-constrained devices & sets (Cui, 2021, Wong, 2021) due to their high
    accuracy, which necessitates significant computational resources. RNNs have demonstrated
    promise in time-series analysis for soil moisture prediction and soil yield forecasting.
    Nevertheless, their computational complexity and memory requirements can limit
    their deployment on low-power devices and in low-power scenarios (Hong et al.,
    2022, Monsiváis-Huertero, 2022). Reinforcement Learning (RL): In precision agriculture,
    RL algorithms such as Q Learning have been used to optimize irrigation scheduling
    and nutrient management. Despite their efficacy, these methods frequently require
    substantial computational resources and extensive training of temporal instances
    with the Double Instrumental Variable Method (DIVM) for various scenarios (Bannari
    et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2022). To address the limitations of deep learning
    methods, lightweight machine learning algorithms have been investigated. Decision
    trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM) are examples
    of algorithms that are computationally efficient and suitable for resource-constrained
    devices and situations. (Carnier, de Abreu, & de Andrade, 2023) These algorithms
    can achieve acceptable levels of precision while minimizing computational complexity.
    Existing methods for deploying efficient monitoring and management techniques
    for soil quality encompass a variety of approaches. Traditional methods of soil
    analysis are precise, but time-consuming and therefore unsuitable for real-time
    applications. WSNs and remote sensing techniques provide valuable data, but energy
    consumption and scalability continue to be obstacles. The machine learning techniques
    CNNs, RNNs, and RL provide accurate predictions, but their use cases can be computationally
    intensive. Cloud-based systems provide a high level of computational power, but
    introduce latency and network connectivity dependency levels. Since crop production,
    resource optimization, and environmental sustainability are all directly influenced
    by soil quality, monitoring and maintaining soil quality in agriculture is an
    essential area of research and development. The accompanying literature review
    provides a synopsis of recent studies and innovations in the field, emphasizing
    the need for a fast, energy-efficient, and secure TinyML model for controlling
    and monitoring soil quality in real time scenarios. Quality control and management
    of soil: Soil quality has a major impact on crop yields, nutrient availability,
    water retention, and agricultural sustainability as a whole (Ren et al., 2022,
    Xu et al., 15 March 15, 2022,, Zhou et al., 1 June 1, 2022,). Efficient methods
    of soil monitoring and management are needed for resource allocation, irrigation,
    and fertilizer optimization in order to boost agricultural growth while minimizing
    environmental repercussions. Monitoring soil by methods like hand sampling and
    laboratory analysis may be laborious and time consuming, and it often fails to
    give real-time datasets & scenarios (Akrasi-Mensah, 2023, Qian et al., 2023, Saputhanthri
    et al., 2022, Wang et al., 15 June 15, 2023,). Therefore, there is a growing need
    for reliable soil monitoring devices that can collect data in real time scenarios.
    New opportunities for agricultural decision-making and real-time soil monitoring
    have emerged as a result of recent advancements in machine learning, data analytics,
    and sensor technologies (Alrubei et al., 2022, Bataineh et al., 2022, Ma et al.,
    2022). Tools like this facilitate the collection of detailed information and the
    development of prediction models for assessing soil quality levels. The deployment
    of machine learning models on resource-constrained devices, such as low-power
    microcontrollers, allows local data processing and real-time analytics at the
    network''s edge. This is known as TinyML. TinyML has attracted a lot of attention
    in the agricultural industry because of its potential for on-site analysis, less
    reliance on cloud computing, and increased battery life of deployed devices &
    scenarios. Several studies have investigated TinyML''s potential uses in agriculture,
    particularly in the areas of crop production prediction, disease detection, and
    irrigation management (Hao et al., 2022, Sadawi et al., 2022, Zheng et al., 2022).
    These studies demonstrate the viability and utility of using machine learning
    models for use in agricultural applications on low-power hardware. TinyML Models
    with Low Energy Consumption: Energy efficiency is crucial when deploying TinyML
    models in low-resource environments. A farm''s viability and battery life are
    both directly tied to how much energy is used. Numerous strategies for enhancing
    TinyML models'' power effectiveness have been proposed by the research community.
    Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) (Deebak et al., 2023, Kaur et al.,
    2022, Zhang et al., 2023) adjusts the processor''s voltage and frequency to suit
    the workload. As per (Goh et al., 2022, Wan et al., 2023) Sleep/arousal Energy
    consumption may be decreased by optimizing the device''s sleep and wake cycles
    using genetic algorithms. TinyML devices may be powered autonomously using energy
    collecting techniques like as solar or kinetic energy (Mishra et al., 2023, Zhang
    et al., 2022) levels. Algorithms for task partitioning distribute workloads over
    a network of computers to cut down on power usage levels. Combining TinyML and
    the IoT Internet Safety: Since they collect, analyze, and transfer sensitive data,
    TinyML and IoT networks need the highest level of security. Any vulnerability
    in a network raises the prospect of hostile assaults, unauthorized access, and
    compromised data. Validation attacks including Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and
    Man-in-the-Middle attacks are among the many IoT network security challenges that
    have been examined in (Ayub Khan et al., 2022, Li et al., 2022) for real-time
    scenarios. Attacks like this exploit holes in our current systems of identity
    verification, trust, and network infrastructure sets. Researchers have proposed
    using Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency (PoEE), a lightweight consensus mechanism, to
    reduce the energy requirements of blockchain-based systems and, in turn, improve
    their security (Alshehri et al., 2023, Li et al., 2022) levels. Sidechain creation
    using reinforcement learning methods, such as Q Learning, improves network throughput
    and security levels. Methods Currently Available for Assessing and Controlling
    Soil Quality Various approaches to measuring and controlling soil quality have
    been proposed for use in agricultural settings. Data integrity is ensured by using
    ITM (Insertion Through Mining) technologies built on the blockchain. CycleGAN
    (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network) generates synthetic soil images
    using deep learning techniques. The DIVM (Decentralized Intelligent Voting Model)
    takes into account soil management decisions. Energy efficiency and security in
    TinyML and IoT networks, soil quality monitoring and management in agriculture,
    the potential of TinyML for real-time analytics, and existing methodologies are
    all highlighted at the end of the literature review. Given this requirement and
    impetus for further study, here propose a TinyML model that is low-energy, secure,
    and quick to run in order to address the drawbacks of existing approaches and
    provide viable solutions for real-time soil quality monitoring and management
    in agriculture process. Thus, researchers have investigated lightweight machine
    learning algorithms and techniques for deploying TinyML models in order to overcome
    these obstacles. These strategies aim to reduce energy consumption, minimize latency,
    and preserve acceptable levels of precision. Utilizing low-power microcontrollers,
    task partitioning, DVFS, genetic algorithm-based sleep/wake strategies, and energy
    harvesting, agriculture scenarios can deploy efficient and real-time soil quality
    monitoring and management systems. 3. Discussion on deploying an efficient power-aware
    & delay-aware TinyML for soil quality monitoring and management in agriculture
    This section discusses the design of a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model
    for soil quality monitoring and management in agricultural scenarios. As shown
    in Fig. 1, the proposed method combines an enhanced fusion of Dynamic Voltage
    and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms,
    Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning processes. The goal is to reduce energy
    consumption, minimize delay, and keep precision comparable to existing methods.

    and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a power management technique that dynamically
    adjusts the processor''s operating voltage and clock frequency based on the load.
    By adjusting these parameters, the system''s power consumption can be optimized
    while performance requirements are met. DVFS is commonly used to reduce power
    consumption in real-time scenarios for devices with limited resources. In this
    instance, the DFVS Model initially estimates device power using Eq. (1), (1) The
    power consumed by a device is the product of its operating voltage and current,
    thus, by reducing either voltage or current, the power consumption can be reduced
    for different scenarios. Similarly, the energy is estimated via Eq. (2), (2) Similarly,
    the performance level of the device can be observed from Fig. 3, (3) Where, represents
    total instructions executed per cycle, while represents the clock frequency levels.
    Performance is a measure of how many instructions can be executed per clock cycle
    for the clock frequency sets. Download : Download high-res image (413KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Soil Yield Levels used for training the model
    under real-time scenarios. To maintain adequate performance levels while reducing
    power, the clock frequency can be adjusted accordingly for different scenarios.
    Thus, in terms of clock frequency, the energy levels of the device can be estimated
    via Eq. (4), (4) Consequently, the energy consumption of a device is proportional
    to the square of its voltage and clock frequency. By decreasing voltage or clock
    frequency, energy consumption can be reduced significantly for various workloads.
    Voltage and clock frequency are dynamically adjusted based on workload and performance
    requirements to reduce power consumption via DVFS. When the workload is light
    or the computer is idle, the voltage and clock frequency can be decreased to reduce
    energy consumption. In contrast, voltage and clock frequency can be increased
    to ensure adequate performance levels during periods of high computational demand.
    Eq. (5) is used to estimate the Q Level for each classification on the TinyML
    Model in order to accomplish this task, (5) Where, represents total number of
    classifications that were performed on the TinyML Device, while tc & T represents
    total number of correctly classified samples, and total number of samples used
    during the classification process. Similar classifications were done for different
    samples, and a reward value was estimated via Eq. (6), (6) Where, represents a
    discounting factor for the learning process. If the reward value , then there
    is need to modify the Voltage & Frequency levels via Eqs. (7), (8), otherwise
    the Voltage & Frequency is modified via Eqs. (9), (10), (7) (8) Else, (9) (10)
    Based on this process, the model is able to optimize operating frequency for efficient
    DVFS operations. By optimizing the voltage and clock frequency based on the workload,
    DVFS allows for power reduction in TinyML deployments. This technique is crucial
    for resource-constrained devices as it helps extend battery life, reduce energy
    consumption, and enhance energy efficiency without sacrificing performance levels.
    Similar to this, an efficient Genetic Algorithm-based Sleep/Wake Strategy is employed
    to conserve power during idle temporal instance sets. Genetic algorithms are used
    to optimize the sleep/wake scheduling based on historical data and environmental
    conditions. The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of potential
    solutions and selects the fittest individuals for the next generations. To perform
    this task, initially a set of Solutions are generated, and each solution has stochastic
    values of Sleep Cycles (SC), which are estimated via Eq. (11), (11) Based on this
    Sleep Cycle, the TinyML Model is evaluated, and its fitness is estimated via Eq.
    (12) (12) Where, represents the delay needed to perform given classifications.
    Using this fitness value from all solutions, the fitness threshold is calculated
    via Eq. (13), (13) Solutions with are ‘mutated’ and regenerated via Eqs. (11),
    (12), while other solutions are passed directly to the next set of iterations
    via ‘crossover’ operations. This process is repeated for Iterations, and Solution
    with minimum fitness is selected for the final estimation of sleep cycles. This
    process allows for identification of optimal sleep cycles for efficient processing
    of data samples with high-speed levels, and is cascaded with an efficient energy
    harvesting process. Energy harvesting techniques involve capturing and converting
    ambient energy sources (such as solar power, kinetic energy, or thermal energy)
    into electrical energy to power the TinyML devices & samples. This reduces dependence
    on batteries and extends the operational lifetime of the devices under different
    scenarios. Energy harvesting is a technique that involves capturing and converting
    ambient energy sources into electrical energy to power TinyML devices for different
    scenarios. By utilizing energy harvesting, the dependence on batteries can be
    reduced or eliminated, thereby extending the operational lifetime of the device
    and reducing power consumption levels. The power harvested ( ) is initially calculated
    via Eq. (14), (14) Where, is the power efficiency of a given source, while represents
    current levels from that set of sources. The power harvested from the ambient
    energy source is determined by the energy conversion efficiency of the harvesting
    system and the intensity of the available energy sources. The energy conversion
    efficiency represents the effectiveness of the energy harvesting system in converting
    the captured energy into usable electrical power levels. Based on this, the energy
    stored (ES) on the device is estimated via Eq. (15), (15) The harvested energy
    is stored for future calculations. Total stored energy is equal to the product
    of the amount of energy harvested and the amount of time it has been accumulating
    for the given source sets. This stored energy can be used to power TinyML devices
    while they are in operation. The proposed energy harvesting system takes advantage
    of Solar Energy, Thermal Energy, and Radiofrequency Energy, as it is connected
    to farms with abundant Solar Radiation, Heat, and RF signals. Rechargeable batteries
    store the harvested energy. During operation, the stored energy is used to power
    the TinyML device, reducing the need for external power sources. By incorporating
    energy harvesting techniques into TinyML deployments, power consumption was decreased
    and the device''s operational lifetime was increased for various scenarios. This
    allows for continuous and autonomous operation, making it ideal for applications
    in remote or inaccessible environments where frequent battery replacements are
    impractical under real-world conditions. Similar to Sleep Cycle optimizations,
    an effective Task Partitioning Method was implemented, which assisted in reducing
    energy & delay levels for various TinyML operation sets. The power & delay-aware
    task partitioning equation aims to minimize the TinyML system''s energy consumption
    while maximizing task execution levels. The model uses Genetic Algorithm to partition
    tasks stochastically, and then estimates Task Partitioning Fitness using Eq. (16),
    (16) Where, represents Number of Stochastic partitions which were done during
    generation of GA solutions. Based on similar ‘mutation’ & ‘crossover’ operations,
    this model is able to identify efficient value of which can minimize the delay
    & energy levels during execution on TinyML device sets. A combination of these
    methods was deployed on the TinyML device, which assisted in reducing energy consumption,
    reduce delay needed for processing, while maintaining higher accuracy levels for
    different scenarios. The model is able to efficiently perform communications with
    different sensors, and process their data samples with high precision, accuracy
    & recall levels. To further strengthen the deployment capabilities of the model,
    all processed data samples are stored on blockchains. To maintain better energy
    performance, an effective Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency (PoEE) based consensus is
    used while addition of new blocks. The PoEE Model requests an augmented cluster
    of nearby nodes with higher energy efficiency to perform consensus. This is facilitated
    via Eq. (17), where an augmented consensus score (CS) is calculated for each node,
    (17) Where, represents energy consumed by the node during the communication, while
    represents residual energy of the current node, and represents number of communications
    that are done by the node during temporal evaluation process. Nodes with lower
    value of are used for the mining process, which ensures that nodes that have consumed
    lower energy during previous communications, and have higher residual energy are
    selected for the consensus process. These nodes are used to add new blocks to
    the chain, which assists in securing the model from data modification attacks.
    But as the number of blocks increase, the energy requirement for adding these
    blocks also increases. To overcome this issue, an iterative Q Learning based model
    is used to form multiple sidechains. This model estimates an iterative Q Value
    after a stochastic set of communications. The number of stochastic communications
    is evaluated via Eq. (18), (18) Where, is a reward value, which is estimated by
    the Q Learning process (initially set to 1), while is the previous number of communications
    used for the evaluation process. After each set of communications, a Q Value is
    estimated via Eq. (19), (19) Where, THR & d represents the throughput obtained
    and delay needed during these communications. After estimation of this value consecutively
    for more than 2 set of communications, a reward value is estimated via equation
    (20), (20) Where, represents Learning Rate for the model, while represents discount
    factor for the evaluation process. If the value of , then it indicates the current
    set of communications required lower energy consumption, and had higher throughput,
    thus the current blockchain configuration is not modified, else, the blockchain
    is split into 2 equal sidechains. New blocks are added to any of the sidechains.
    This allows the model to securely communicate different data samples while maintaining
    lower delay and lower energy consumption for different communications. Evaluation
    of this model was done in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, delay and energy
    levels in the next section of this text. 4. Comparative result analysis The proposed
    secure, delay-aware & energy-aware model for TinyML deployments uses a fusion
    of DVFS, Energy Harvesting, Sleep Cycle Optimization, Task Partitioning & Q Learning
    with PoEE, which assists in reducing the delay & energy during classification,
    while maintaining higher Precision (P), Accuracy (A), & Recall (R) levels even
    under attacks. To validate performance of this model, this section is segregated
    into 2 parts. Part 1 demonstrates the QoS & classification performance of the
    model under non-attack ideal conditions, while part 2 showcases the QoS performance
    of the model under attacks. This will assist readers to identify model’s performance
    under real-time scenarios. 4.1. QoS & classification performance under non-attack
    (ideal) scenarios In this section, the proposed model is estimated under non-attack
    (ideal) scenario, and levels of precision (P), accuracy (A), and recall (R), were
    estimated under these scenarios. These levels were estimated via Eqs. (21), (22),
    (23) as follows, (21) (22) (23) Where, represents the standard true & false rates
    for different operations. Similar to this, the delay & energy levels were estimated
    via Eqs. (24), (25) as follows, (24) (25) Where, represents timestamps for completion
    & starting the classification operations, while represents residual energy levels
    of the node during different communication operations. These metrics were estimated
    using Mini VGGNet, Tiny ImageNet, and Tiny GoogLeNet Models, each of which were
    tested on the following datasets & samples, • Soil Geographic Databases (https://www.isric.org/explore/soil-geographic-databases).
    • European Soil Datasets (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resource-type/datasets).
    • NLDAS Soils Datasets and Illustration (https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/soils).
    A fusion of these sets resulted in 500 k different image samples, out of which
    400 k were used for training, while 50 k each were used for validation & testing
    use cases. A sample of these images can be observed from Fig. 2, Fig. 3, where
    different disease types, and soil yield levels can be observed for multiple scenarios.
    The model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi Board, and the ensemble techniques were
    integrated in it for multiple classification scenarios. Based on this strategy,
    the precision of classification was estimated and compared with ITM (Wu et al.,
    2022); CycleGAN (Efremova, Seddik, Erten, & Using, 2022), & DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022), which can be observed from Fig. 4 as follows, Download : Download high-res
    image (128KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Precision levels obtained
    during the classification process. On the basis of this evaluation, it can be
    concluded that the proposed model is capable of predicting soil yield with high
    precision under real-time conditions. Due to the use of true-positive levels during
    the Genetic Algorithm optimization process, this precision is maintained. Similarly,
    the accuracy obtained during these evaluations is depicted in Fig. 5 as follows,

    Fig. 5. Accuracy levels obtained during the classification process. Based on this
    assessment, it can be seen that the suggested model can continue to predict soil
    yields with high accuracy levels in real-time scenarios. Due to the use of true-positive
    levels during the Genetic Algorithm & DVFS Q Learning optimization process, this
    accuracy is preserved. Similar to that, Fig. 6 shows the recall obtained during
    these evaluations as follows, Download : Download high-res image (169KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Recall levels obtained during the classification
    process. This evaluation shows that the suggested model can consistently predict
    disease and soil yield with high recall levels in real-world scenarios. The use
    of true-positive levels during the Genetic Algorithm & DVFS Q Learning optimization
    process ensures that this recall is maintained for different scenarios. Similar
    to Fig. 6, the following can be seen from Fig. 7 regarding the delay required
    during these evaluations, Download : Download high-res image (227KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Delay needed during the classification process.
    On the basis of this evaluation, it can be concluded that the proposed model can
    reduce soil yield prediction delay by 8.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022),
    10.0 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 15.4 % compared to DIVM
    (Yang et al., 2022) under real-time conditions. This delay is decreased due to
    the utilization of ensemble Models that employ Genetic Algorithm & Q Learning
    in conjunction with harvesting optimizations, which aids in high-seed yield prediction
    for various soil types. Similarly, the energy required for these evaluations is
    depicted in Fig. 8 as follows, Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Energy needed during the classification process.
    On the basis of this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can reduce
    the energy required for soil yield prediction by 15.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et
    al., 2022), 18.3 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 16.5 % compared
    to DIVM (Yang et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios. Multiple optimizations, such
    as Task Partitioning, Energy Harvesting, Sleep Scheduling, and DVFS operations,
    reduce this energy consumption in real-time scenarios. Consequently, the proposed
    model exhibited optimal levels of accuracy, precision, and recall while maintaining
    a higher rate of operation and reduced energy consumption levels. These features
    enable the model to be deployed for a wide range of TinyML use cases and real-time
    scenarios. 4.2. QoS performance of the model under different attacks To further
    validate the model’s performance under real-time scenarios. It was evaluated under
    Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The Finney attack
    is illustrative of the kind of validation attacks that may be launched against
    IoT networks. An enemy who is also a miner on the blockchain network conceals
    a valid transaction inside a fraudulent one. The attacker operates in concert,
    launching a network transaction and mining a block that includes it concurrently.
    An adversary may then use the extracted block in a transaction, such as making
    a purchase or sending money. This allows the opponent to gain from the exchange
    without bearing any of the burdens. The Sybil attack is another common kind of
    validation attack in IoT networks. A bad actor creates a network of fake nodes,
    each of which is an identity. The network may be manipulated or controlled using
    these bogus identities. By adopting several false identities inside the network,
    an adversary might trick other nodes into believing false information or taking
    part in malicious activities by exploiting the network''s trust mechanisms. This
    kind of attack has the potential to cause a wide range of security and integrity
    problems, including tampered with data, interrupted communications, and unwanted
    access to sensitive information sets. Masquerade attacks, sometimes called impersonation
    attacks, target IoT networks by assuming the identity of a trusted actor. In this
    kind of attack, sensitive information or resources are accessed by pretending
    to be a trusted device or user. By masquerading as a trusted entity, an attacker
    may bypass protections and carry out malicious activities including taking complete
    control of a device, stealing sensitive information, or executing illegal commands.
    The need of secure access control and authentication mechanisms in IoT networks
    was brought home by this assault. MitM refers to a “man-in-the-middle” assault.
    This validation attack takes advantage of the insecurity of IoT network communication
    channels. An attacker changes legitimate communication between two parties in
    this attack. An attacker may do harm by intercepting communications, tampering
    with the data in transit, or even injecting harmful orders or data. The confidentiality,
    integrity, and validity of the communication might be jeopardized by this assault,
    which could lead to data breaches, unauthorized device control, or other undesirable
    outcomes in the Internet of Things. Secure communication mechanisms, such encryption
    and digital signatures, are needed to combat this risk and safeguard the confidentiality
    and authenticity of information shared across IoT networks. After application
    of these attacks, values of end-to-end communication delay, energy needed during
    communications, throughput during communication and PDR levels were estimated
    for evaluation purposes. A total of 10 % of all network communications were stochastically
    simulated as attacks, and average levels of delay, energy, throughput & PDR were
    estimated for each of these attack scenarios. Based on this strategy, the delay
    levels under attack can be observed from Fig. 9, Download : Download high-res
    image (136KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Average level of delay
    under different attacks. On the basis of this evaluation, it can be concluded
    that the proposed model can reduce delay during communication under attack for
    soil prediction scenarios by 4.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 12.4 % compared
    to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 8.3 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022) under real-time conditions. This delay is decreased due to the utilization
    of Q Learning for the formation of sidechains, in conjunction with PoEE based
    consensus, which aids in higher-speed of the network even under multiple attacks.
    Similarly, the energy required for these evaluations is depicted in Fig. 10 as
    follows, Download : Download high-res image (235KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. Average level of energy under different attacks. On the basis of
    this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can reduce the energy required
    for communication by 4.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 16.4 % compared
    to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 18.5 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022) in real-time scenarios. Multiple optimizations, including Q Learning & PoEE
    consensus, reduce this energy consumption in real-time scenarios. Similarly, the
    throughput levels can be observed from Fig. 11 as follows, Download : Download
    high-res image (181KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Throughput
    levels for different communication scenarios. On the basis of this evaluation,
    it is clear that the proposed model can improve the throughput during communication
    by 10.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 12.5 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova
    et al., 2022), and 18.3 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios.
    This is due to use of throughput during Q Learning optimizations, which assists
    in formation of sidechains. Similarly, the PDR levels can be observed from Fig.
    12 as follows, Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. PDR levels for different communication scenarios. On
    the basis of this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can improve
    the PDR during communication by 1.9 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 2.4 %
    compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 2.5 % compared to DIVM (Yang
    et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios. This is due to use of PDR during Q Learning
    optimizations, which assists in formation of sidechains. Due to these optimizations,
    the proposed model is capable of deployment for an augmented & wide variety of
    real-time scenarios. 5. Conclusion and future scope In conclusion, this paper
    presents an innovative method for deploying an energy-efficient, secure, and high-speed
    TinyML model designed specifically for agricultural soil quality monitoring and
    management. The proposed model addresses the urgent need for precise and sustainable
    agricultural practices by enabling real-time decision-making in environments with
    limited resources. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies
    based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning are among
    the optimization techniques incorporated into the model. In comparison to cutting-edge
    techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks
    (RNNs), and Q Learning, these techniques effectively reduce the model''s energy
    consumption by 8.5 % and delay by 10.4 % without compromising accuracy. To ensure
    the security and integrity of the model, a consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency
    (PoEE) is utilized. The model employs a lightweight consensus supported by sidechain
    formation based on Q Learning, which increases security without significantly
    increasing energy needs. The performance of the model is rigorously evaluated
    under multiple attack scenarios, such as Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and Man-in-the-Middle
    attacks, demonstrating its resilience and efficacy in real-time scenarios. Significant
    practical implications result from the proposed model in the agricultural field.
    By continuously monitoring soil quality parameters like moisture content, pH level,
    and nutrient levels, farmers can optimize irrigation, fertilization, and resource
    allocation, leading to an increase in soil yield and a decrease in environmental
    impact. Incorporating sensors and low-power microcontrollers into the model enables
    on-site analysis and immediate feedback to farmers, thereby facilitating timely
    interventions and treatments. The performance evaluation of the model demonstrates
    its superiority to existing techniques. The proposed model reduces communication
    delay by 4.5 % relative to ITM, 12.4 % relative to CycleGAN, and 8.0 % relative
    to DIVM under real-time conditions. Furthermore, its energy consumption is reduced
    by 4.5 % compared to ITM, 16.4 % compared to CycleGAN, and 18.0 % compared to
    DIVM. The model also demonstrates an increase in throughput of 10.5 % versus ITM,
    12.5 % versus CycleGAN, and 18.3 % versus DIVM, as well as an increase in Packet
    Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 1.9 % versus ITM, 2.4 % versus CycleGAN, and 2.5 % versus
    DIVM. The proposed energy-efficient, secure, and high-speed TinyML model provides
    an innovative solution for real-time monitoring and management of soil quality
    in agriculture. By reducing energy consumption, minimizing communication delay,
    and increasing throughput and PDR levels, the model enables farmers to make timely
    decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and practice sustainable agriculture.
    The model''s efficacy, dependability, and applicability to a vast array of real-world
    scenarios are ensured by the incorporation of advanced optimization techniques
    and robust security measures. With the potential to revolutionize soil management
    practices, the proposed model holds great promise for future agricultural productivity,
    environmental impact reduction, and food security promotion process. CRediT authorship

  description: The fundamental principle of the paper is that the soil moisture sensor
    obtains the moisture content level of the soil sample. The water pump is automatically

  description: 'Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is an electromagnetic technique that
    measures the dielectric permittivity (K) which is a surrogate property influenced
    by water content. Advances in nanoelectronics have enabled the development of
    a TDR probe (TDR-305 N) to monitor changes in K, bulk electrical conductivity
    (ECbulk) and temperature (T) in a porous medium, such as a tree trunk. The main
    objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the TDR-305 N sensors
    for real-time monitoring changes in water content in the trunk of nectarine trees.
    Throughout the summer of 2022, irrigation was automatically managed with threshold
    values of soil water content (θv-soil) measured with capacitance probes. Different
    management allowed depletion (MAD) values were set to trigger irrigation: 50 %
    in July (moderate water deficit), 100 % in August (severe water deficit), and
    recovery to well-irrigated conditions in September. Discrete measurements of midday
    stem water potential (Ψs,md) and leaf gas exchange were made frequently. The results
    showed a progressive reduction of the measured physiological parameters, as well
    as of K and ECbulk and θv-soil decreased. Notably, Ψs,md reached a critically

    reflectometry (TDR) is an electromagnetic technique that measures the dielectric
    permittivity (K) which is a surrogate property influenced by water content. Advances
    in nanoelectronics have enabled the development of a TDR probe (TDR-305 N) to
    monitor changes in K, bulk electrical conductivity (ECbulk) and temperature (T)
    in a porous medium, such as a tree trunk. The main objective of this study was
    to assess the effectiveness of the TDR-305 N sensors for real-time monitoring
    changes in water content in the trunk of nectarine trees. Throughout the summer
    of 2022, irrigation was automatically managed with threshold values of soil water
    content (θv-soil) measured with capacitance probes. Different management allowed
    depletion (MAD) values were set to trigger irrigation: 50 % in July (moderate
    water deficit), 100 % in August (severe water deficit), and recovery to well-irrigated
    conditions in September. Discrete measurements of midday stem water potential
    (Ψs,md) and leaf gas exchange were made frequently. The results showed a progressive
    reduction of the measured physiological parameters, as well as of K and ECbulk
    and θv-soil decreased. Notably, Ψs,md reached a critically low value of -2.03
    MPa, coinciding with pronounced and severe stomatal closure. Both K and Ψs,md,
    were able to explain the variations of θv-soil by more than 75 %. Daily, a positive
    relationship of K and ECbulk was observed, although ECbulk exhibited a stronger
    dependence on Ttrunk compared to K. Furthermore, K did not return to its initial
    values prior to the onset of water stress, possibly influenced by xylem cavitation
    and a reduction in leaf area during its senescence stage. The findings suggest
    that trunk permittivity measurements obtained using TDR-305 N sensors could be
    a reliable indicator for monitoring tree water status. However, further research
    is needed to determine the threshold values of trunk water content under non-limiting
    soil water conditions for accurate irrigation scheduling. Previous article in

    agriculture, high production levels and fruit quality of crops depend on accurate
    and efficient irrigation regimes. Inadequate irrigation management can lead to
    water stress in plants due to deficit or excess irrigation, which can affect the
    quantity and quality of fruit at harvest. Drought is the most damaging stress
    that negatively affects plant productivity. Other factors, such as increasing
    urbanisation, population growth, or inequitable economic development itself, have
    contributed to increasingly intensive water use and thus to a higher risk of reaching
    more extreme levels of water stress in the short term. Furthermore, excessive
    irrigation is particularly associated with higher costs (both for the water used
    and the associated energy required) and generates significant nutrient losses
    through leaching, which can lead to environmental problems related to groundwater
    contamination and soil depletion [1,2]. Precision irrigation is a key factor in
    minimising production costs and pollution risks, as well as improving water productivity.
    It is based on the use of methodologies that measure water status in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum [3]. Volumetric soil water content (θv-soil) is often recommended as
    a crucial input for irrigation management decision support systems (DSS). Irrigation
    scheduling based on real-time θv-soil helps to reduce the risks related to runoff,
    erosion, and groundwater pollution, while improving irrigation water productivity
    [4]. Due to their automation capability and high accuracy over a wide range of
    moisture content, dielectric soil sensors are the most advantageous method [5].
    Capacitance probes have been widely used in automated drip irrigation systems
    due to their low cost, low energy consumption and reasonable accuracy [5,6]. In
    nectarine trees, the automated system managed with capacitance probes proposed
    by Conesa et al. [7] allowed water savings of about 40 % with no yield penalty
    compared to conventional irrigation scheduling by crop evapotranspiration (ETc,
    [8]). In plum trees, Millán et al. [9] established a regulated deficit irrigation
    strategy based on 40 % ETc modulated by capacitance soil moisture sensors in plum
    trees. In addition, the automated algorithm of Dominguez-Niño et al. [10] saved
    23 % of the irrigation volume compared to the traditional water balance method.
    Decisions on ON/OFF irrigation are typically based on the comparison of the measured
    soil water status with a certain preestablished threshold value [11]. Commonly,
    θv-soil is used as a threshold value, this is often considered as the field capacity
    (FC) or a derived value called management allowed depletion (MAD) that is defined
    as a fraction of the difference between the soil water content at FC and at the
    permanent wilting point (PWP). Therefore, MAD is the fraction of the soil total
    available water that can be depleted before plants experience water stress; thus,
    under a precision irrigation regime, an irrigation event is triggered ON each
    time the soil water content declines down to the value of (FC-MAD) [12]. Automatic
    Soil-based Irrigation System combines the information collected by a wireless
    sensor network (WSN) through a web platform, allowing real-time field data to
    be obtained, which operate the electro-valves using IoT technologies without human
    intervention. Furthermore, all recorded data is stored in the cloud and is available
    anywhere and anytime to end-users or farmers [2]. Real-time automated irrigation
    treatment fed with θv-soil threshold values, based on the MAD-concept, and combined
    with regulated deficit irrigation criteria [13], has demonstrated to be a successful
    irrigation strategy in field-woody crops experiments [[7], [14], [15], [16], [17],
    [18], [19]]. Assessing plant water status provides inputs to develop new water-saving
    irrigation strategies. Previously, plant water status was estimated indirectly
    through θv-soil, but the physiological response of the plant to water deficit
    is essentially affected by changes in leaf and stem water content, rather than
    by highly variable soil water dynamics [20]. For this reason, plant-based approaches
    have proven to be more accurate and sensitive in estimating plant water status,
    especially in woody crops, as the deep nature of their root systems presents some
    difficulties in estimating soil moisture content [21,22]. Stem water potential
    monitoring at midday (Ψs,md) is an effective method for determining the water
    status of plants [23], but the method involves labour-intensive and destructive
    measurements and cannot be automated. In this regard, the new sensors identified
    as microtensiometers are able to continuously measure trunk water potential (Ψtrunk),
    which is one of the main advantages compared to discrete determinations of Ψs,md.
    Recently, Conesa et al. [24] demonstrated that Ψtrunk faithfully reveals the impact
    of automated MAD-based irrigation scheduling in nectarine trees. Another method
    for estimating plant water status involves the assessment of plant water storage
    capacity, which is determined by the hydraulic capacitance of a plant tissue [25].
    Within plants, trunk (or stem) water content (θv-trunk) is one of the most common
    plant-based water indicators [26]. The tree trunk reveals substantial seasonal
    and diurnal variations in its water content because of transpiration fluxes [27].
    Furthermore, θv-trunk is not only critical for supporting daily and seasonal transpiration,
    but is in turn related to tree photosynthesis, tree growth and the ability of
    trees to withstand drought stress period. The Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR)
    technique measures the travel time of electromagnetic wave and determines the
    dielectric permittivity (K) of a porous material (e.g., soil, wood…) [28]. K is
    a property that measures the ability of the material used to store energy when
    an electrical field is applied. The equation of Topp et al. [29] is the most widely
    used model to estimate θv-soil from K values with TDR sensors, being also extensible
    to other porous materials with appropriate calibration. Several researchers have
    inserted TDR and other electromagnetic sensors into the wood of trees to determine
    their water content, drawing attention to the way and position in which the sensor
    is installed in the trunk to obtain reliable data on instantaneous changes of
    θv-trunk, and their wounding effects [26]. Nadler et al. [30,31] noted that TDR
    was able to determine trunk hydration in lemon and mango, but the signal had too
    much noise and the system was too expensive to manage orchard irrigation. Furthermore,
    most of the literature on the use of TDR sensors to monitor plant water status
    had been conducted on forest trees [[26], [27], [32], [33]], among others]. Therefore,
    there are still several challenges in determining θv-trunk using the TDR technique
    in fruit trees and using it to manage irrigation in fruit orchards. This paper
    examines the capability of a TDR sensor, the TDR-305 N, as a non-destructive device
    to monitor changes in plant water status after insertion into the trunk of nectarine
    trees. It records instantaneous values of K and ECbulk, which are essential for
    estimating θv-trunk. Irrigation scheduling was automatically managed by real-time
    θv-soil values at different soil MAD levels corresponding to moderate and severe
    deficit, followed by a recovery irrigation period to meet crop water requirements.
    This study also analyses how K and ECbulk trunk measurements can reveal the established
    automated soil-based irrigation protocol. Material and methods Orchard site description
    This study was conducted during the postharvest period of 2022 (Day of the year,
    DOY 180–280) in a 0.5 ha orchard of 12-year-old early-maturing (harvested in May)
    nectarine trees (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch, cv. Flariba, grafted on GxN-15 rootstock)
    located at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental station, Santomera, Murcia (Spain). Nectarine
    trees were spaced 6.5 m x 3.5 m and trained to an open-centre canopy. The soil
    in the 0–50 cm layer was highly calcareous (45 % calcium carbonate), with a clay
    loam texture (clay fraction: 41 % illite, 17 % smectite, and 30 % palygorskite),
    low organic matter content (1.3 %), and a cation exchange capacity of 97.9 mmol
    kg−1. The average bulk density was 1.43 g cm−3. θv-soil at field capacity and
    at permanent wilting point was 0.29 and 0.14 m3 m−3, respectively. The nectarine
    trees were drip irrigated with four emitters per tree with a nominal flow rate
    of 4 L h−1 inserted in a single drip line per row of trees. The emitters were
    located at 0.5 and 1.3 m both sides of the tree trunk.The irrigation water collected
    from the water distribution network of the Irrigation Community of Santomera called
    “Azarbe del Merancho” with an average electrical conductivity (EC25°C) of 0.8
    dS m−1. Annual fertilisation (83, 24 and 90 kg ha−1 of N, P and K, [34]) was applied
    through the irrigation system [35]. Standard cultural practices (e.g., weed control,
    pruning and fruit thinning among others) were carried out by the technical personnel
    of the CEBAS-CSIC experimental station following local fruit growing practices.
    Environmental data, including reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0, [8]), air
    temperature (Tair) and relative humidity (RH) were recorded by an automated station
    located 0.25 km from the orchard, which read values every 5 min and recorded averages
    every 15 min, allowing the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) to be calculated. The
    study consisted of an automated soil-based irrigation schedule system managed
    according to different decision criteria (see 2.2 section). Irrigated trees were
    distributed in a randomised complete block design with four replications. Each
    replication consisted of a row of six individual trees (n = 24). Measurements
    of soil and plant water relations were made on a representative tree from each
    replicate. Automatic soil-based irrigation treatment θv-soil was monitored with
    multi-depth EnviroScan® (Sentek Sensor Technologies, Sidney, Australia) capacitance
    probes. Four PVC access tubes were installed 0.1 m from the emitter located close
    (0.5 m) to the tree trunk in four trees (one per each replicate). Each capacitance
    probe had sensors at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 m depth, and was connected to a radio
    transmission unit. Values were read every 5 min, and the average recorded every
    15 min. The probes were normalized to maximum and minimum frequency readings in
    water and air respectively and then configured to use the calibration equation
    reported by Evett et al. [36] for a clay-loam soil. The amount of irrigation applied
    was measured with one in-line water meter placed at the beginning of the irrigation
    sector and connected to the telemetry system to detect any flow rate failure.
    It should be noted that irrigation events could occur at any time of the day.
    Irrigation was managed according to θv-soil threshold values based on the concept
    of Management Allowed Deficit (MAD) [37] as the maximum average root zone stress
    at which optimum crop production will occur. Then, we adapted to the following
    equation. MAD= α/100 × AWC Where α is a percentage of the total available soil
    water content (AWC = the difference between FC – PWP (m3 m−3). Irrigation was
    automatically activated (trigger irrigation ON) when the mean θv-soil values in
    the 0–0.5 m soil profile (active root zone, [38]) reached the lower limit = FC
    – MAD. Meanwhile, irrigation OFF at FC (upper θv-soil threshold value). The following
    irrigation criteria were applied: (i) Moderate soil water deficit (α = 50 %, corresponds
    to a lower limit θv-soil = 0.215 m3 m−3), from DOY 181 to 210. (ii) Severe soil
    water deficit (α = 100 %), irrigation was withheld from DOY 211 to 245 (iii) Recovery:
    Irrigation recovered with full crop water requirements (100 % ETc) when Ψs,md
    reached −2.0 MPa, from DOY 246 to 280. The radio transmission units sent data
    to a gateway which was connected to an addVANTAGE web server (ADCON Telemetry,
    Vienna, Austria) for data processing and visualisation. Measurements Discrete
    determinations of Ψs,md, and leaf gas exchange parameters were made weekly on
    clear days to estimate the plant water status. Ψs,md was measured using a pressure
    chamber (Soil Moisture Equip. Crop. Model 3000, Santa Barbara, CA, USA), on mature
    leaves located on the shaded side of the tree and near the tree trunk at 13:00–14:00
    h, GMT+2. Leaves were covered with foil ziplock bags for at least 2 h before the
    measurements [20]. One leaf per tree was cut from one replicate of each treatment
    and immediately placed in the chamber following the recommendations of [20]. Stomatal
    conductance (gs mmol m−2 s−1) was measured in one mature sunny leaf per tree in
    each replicate (n = 4) in the early morning (9:00–10:00 h, GMT+2), using a portable
    gas exchange system (LI-COR, LI-6400) at a photon flux density (PPFD) ≈ 1500 μmolm−2
    s−1 and CO2 concentration ≈ 400 μmol mol−1. Moreover, daily courses of both indicators
    of plant water status were conducted at the end of periods of moderate deficit
    (α = 50 %, 29th July 2022, DOY 210), severe deficit (α = 100 %, 1st September
    2022, DOY 244) and recovery (well-irrigated, 7th October 2022, DOY 280). On these
    dates, Ψs,md and gs were measured hourly on one leaf per tree in each replicate
    (n = 4). Leaf water potential (Ψpd, MPa), from uncovered leaves, was obtained
    on each daily course at predawn (05:30–06:30 h, GMT+2). Dielectric permittivity
    (K), apparent electrical conductivity (ECbulk), and trunk temperature (Ttrunk)
    were continuously monitored with TDR-305 N (Acclima Inc., Meridian, USA) sensors.
    The sensor consists of three 0.05 m long waveguides, with all the electronics
    required for pulse generation and waveform acquisition embedded in a miniaturised
    circuit inside the probe, and the processed data transmitted via SDI-12 protocol.
    TDR-305 N sensors were embedded directly into the trunk located on the north-shaded
    side of the nectarine trees, in three out of the four replicates (n = 3), using
    a waveguide insertion tube with three parallel holes of 7 mm diameter. The holes
    were drilled in the required position (vertical in our case), diameter and depth
    for a perfect fit (Illustration 1). When installing the sensor, the manufacturer''s
    recommendations described in Schwartz et al. [39] were considered. The sensor
    was the insulated with a thermal blanket following the recommendations of Saito
    et al. [40]. Data were collected every 15 min and transmitted using the same telemetry
    network used for θv-soil. Download : Download high-res image (328KB) Download

    the addVANTAGE web server. Leaf osmotic potentials (Ψπ) were determined on the
    same leaves used for Ψpd (e.g. at predawn (05:30–06:30 h GTM+2)), coinciding with
    daily time courses. Leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and osmotic potential
    was measured after thawing the samples and squeezing the sap using a vapour pressure
    osmometer (model WESCOR-5520; Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA) following the recommendations
    of Gucci et al. [41]. Leaf turgor potentials (Ψt) were calculated as the difference
    between osmotic and leaf water potentials. Leaf osmotic potential at full turgor
    (Ψπ100) was measured on leaves adjacent to those used for Ψpd at predawn. The
    leaves were excised and immediately their petioles placed in distilled water overnight
    to reach full saturation, after which they were frozen in liquid nitrogen (−196
    οC), stored at −30 οC, and Ψπ100 measured after thawing the samples following
    the same methodology as for Ψπ. Calibration procedure A representative healthy
    field-grown nectarine tree was selected for TDR-trunk calibration. First, the
    trunk was separated from the canopy and the main shoots using a power saw. A section
    of approximately 0.15 m (height) was excised and completely covered with a transparent
    film to prevent water losses and placed in a portable cool box (Illustration 2a).
    Then, the trunk sections were taken to the lab in an isolated box where the TDR-305
    N sensor was installed, following the instructions described above, and the assembly
    was mounted on a digital weighing scale under ambient room conditions. The TDR-305
    N sensor was connected to a laptop to continuously monitor K-data and trunk weight,
    until weight loss was constant (Illustration 2b). The procedure was repeated in
    three different trunk sections. Download : Download high-res image (371KB) Download

    Statistical analysis Data were depicted using the software SigmaPlot v. 14.5 (Inpixon,
    PA, USA). Statistical comparisons were considered significant at p < 0.05, using
    Pearson''s correlation matrix. For K data, the hourly moving average (MA) was
    calculated to visualise trends and smooth noise obtained by the TDR-trunk sensors.
    Relationships between plant and soil water status indicators were explored by
    linear and quadratic regression analyses. The degree of agreement of the regressions
    between variables was assessed by the coefficient of determination (r2) and the
    mean square error (MSE). All analyses were performed with SPSS v. 9.1 (IBM, Armonk,
    NY, USA). Results and discussion Soil water relations During the experimental
    period, which included the postharvest period (DOY 180–280), the amount of water
    applied in the automated soil-based treatment amounted to 86 mm (Fig. 1a). This
    low dose is because the study includes a severe deficit period in which irrigation
    was withheld coinciding with the annual period of highest evaporative demand (August,
    DOY 211–245) (Fig. 1a). For the same experimental orchard, the regular water requirements
    during the postharvest period of well irrigated nectarine trees ranged from 427
    to 572 mm [[16], [17]]. Download : Download high-res image (497KB) Download :

    condition: moderate deficit (DOY 180–210), severe deficit (DOY 211–245), and irrigation
    recovery (DOY 246–280), respectively. Dashed vertical black lines delimit each
    irrigation period. DOY: Day of the year. In this field-experiment, a quite different
    postulate was applied, where the MAD concept was managed with capacitance probes
    to reach different irrigation conditions. Fig. 1b shows the mean θv-soil values
    of the 0 − 0.50 m soil depths, which corresponded to the area of maximum root
    density of Prunus trees, as indicated in a previous experiment within the orchard
    [38], together with the 0.7 m profile to determine water losses by leaching. In
    the period of moderate soil water deficit (α = 50 %), irrigation was triggered
    when the θv-soil threshold value of 0.215 m3 m−3 was reached and stopped at field
    capacity (FC = 0.29 m3 m−3). This protocol induced an irrigation interval of 2
    or 3 days. De la Rosa et al. [42] found θv-soil values (≈ 0.30 m3 m−3) in fully
    irrigated nectarine trees cultivated also in clay-loam soils. In the period of
    severe water deficit (no irrigation applied), α = 100 % caused a gradual decrease
    of θv-soil reaching a minimum value of MAD = 0.17 m3 m−3 at the end of the period,
    close to the permanent wilting point value. Interestingly, the θv-soil at 0.7
    m denoted full water extraction by plant roots reaching a minimum value of 0.15
    m3 m−3 just before irrigation recovery started. This fact showed that there is
    also an effective water extraction in the deeper soil profiles during the process
    of soil drying. Periods of severe drying significantly modify the conditions of
    hydrologic flow path and impair their water retention capabilities [43]. Likewise,
    during the recovery period when irrigation was restored to meet full crop water
    requirements, θv-soil varied around FC values, ranging between 27−32 % in response
    to irrigation and, to a lesser extent, to rainfall events (Fig. 1a,b). As plant
    roots absorb water and the soil dries, θv-soil fluctuations depend not only on
    irrigation or rainfall events, but also on root water uptake dynamics and diurnal
    environmental changes [44]. Mira-García et al. [18] confirmed in a pot experiment
    that θv-soil variations were closely related to evapotranspiration demand, revealing
    the sensitivity of capacitance sensors to the nearby environment of soil, plant
    roots and atmosphere. Plant water relations The water relations of the plants
    evaluated in the experiment reflected the MAD-based irrigation protocol (Fig.
    1b) as well as the climatic conditions (Fig. 2a). Examining the 10-year seasonal
    average values of ET0 and rainfall (≈ 1320 and 250 mm, respectively), the climatic
    conditions recorded during the experimental postharvest period were consistent
    with the characteristics of the semi-arid Mediterranean environment [45], with
    ET0 values amounting to 490.5 mm and low rainfall (10.4 mm, Fig. 1B). Daily ET0
    was highest (4.77 mm) in July (DOY 204) and lowest (0.73 mm) in September (DOY
    258). A similar pattern was observed in VPD values but with high day-to-day variability.
    Noguera et al. [46] recently reported that VPD variability seems to be less coupled
    with soil moisture variability during summer, while it is better correlated during
    winter. VPD variability would be mainly related to climate variability mechanisms
    controlling temperature and relative humidity rather than to feedback in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum [24]. Download : Download high-res image (450KB) Download : Download

    DOY: Day of the year. The seasonal dynamics of midday stem water potential (Ψs,md)
    and leaf stomatal conductance (gs) are represented in Fig. 2b. Initially, plant
    indicator values corresponded to nectarine trees subjected to any irrigation water
    limitation (Ψs,md = −0.72±0.01, and gs = 225±12.8) ([15,42,47], 2021). As soon
    as deficit irrigation of the soil was initiated, Ψs,md and gs started to decrease,
    registering their lowest values at the end of the severe water deficit period
    (DOY 237) (Ψs,md = −2.05±0.06 and gs= 63.5 ± 9.05). Despite irrigation recovery,
    gs values were slightly lower than those observed at the beginning of the study
    due to leaf senescence [48]. Partial defoliation has been shown to affect water
    relations and plant gas exchange [49]. The lower values in gas exchange in the
    late postharvest period by a decrease in the amino acid aspartate affecting chloroplast
    formation in nectarine leaves [24]. Dielectric permittivity (K) and bulk electrical
    conductivity (ECbulk) values showed a similar pattern to that introduced in the
    MAD irrigation soil water content (Fig. 3b,c). K & ECbulk varied with soil water
    deficit, with average values of 18.62±0.07 & 86.83±1.99 µS cm−1, 17.59±0.06 &
    62.26±0.55 µS cm−1, and 17.85±0.06 & 72.44±0.78 µS cm−1in the moderate and severe
    deficits, and irrigation recovery periods, respectively. As expected, the lowest
    values of K and ECbulk were observed in the severe deficit period, and the highest
    during the irrigation recovery period. However, the difference between both irrigation
    periods were not too much high. This may be attributed to either lower xylem conductivity
    or to lower canopy transpiration, both caused by partial defoliation typical of
    the late postharvest period [49]. In this regard, a strong curve-linear relationship
    was observed between K and ECbulk (R2=0.92, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4). Download : Download

    Values correspond to daily averages of three TDR sensors, at each irrigation period:
    moderate deficit or α = 50 % (yellow circle); severe deficit or α = 100 % (red
    triangles); and recovery irrigation or well-irrigated (blue squares). ***; p ≤
    0.001. Although K represented well the MAD-based irrigation protocol, in the experimental
    conditions its values fluctuated in a very short range (only 2 units). This result
    could be explained by the 5 cm length of the TDR-rods that detect the inner part
    of the xylem of the less conductive vessels [26]. However, ECbulk offers a wider
    range (approximately 60 units). The seasonal trend in trunk temperature (Ttrunk)
    (Fig. 3a) was more dependent on weather conditions (Fig. 2a) than on θv-soil variations
    (Fig. 1). Similarly, in a study with oaks, Hernández-Santana et al. [50] observed
    comparatively less variation in stem water content (14 %) compared to measurements
    of soil water content or water+ potential (averaging 50 %). This finding is noteworthy
    given that stem water content showed the greatest sensitivity to reductions in
    soil water content. Plant water relations in daily time courses were assessed
    on representative days at the end of periods of moderate water deficit (DOY 210),
    severe water deficit (DOY 245), and irrigation recovery (DOY 280). In Fig. 5,
    diurnal patterns of Ψs,md and gs are plotted together with VPD and global radiation.
    The diurnal patterns of plant water relations comprised the imposed soil water
    deficit, despite the different prevailing climatic conditions recorded (Fig. 5a–c).
    In this sense, the most demanding day was observed in the period of severe water
    deficit (1st September, DOY 245), and the lowest in the period of irrigation recovery
    (7th October, DOY 280). Download : Download high-res image (515KB) Download :

    −1.76 ± 0.03 MPa (moderate water deficit), −1.89 ± 0.03 MPa (severe water deficit),
    and −0.95 ± 0.04 MPa (irrigation recovery), respectively. In line with this, the
    values of Ψpd followed the same trend of Ψs,md, varying from −0.68 ± 0.03 and
    −0.81 ± 0.11 MPa in the moderate and severe deficit periods to −0.40 ± 0.05 in
    the irrigation recovery period (Fig. 5d-f, Table 1), respectively. Moreover, they
    coincided with those reported by Girona et al. [51] in deficit irrigated peach
    trees. Since they are taken at night, when there is no transpiration, the Ψpd
    values indicate the water status of the soil surrounding the roots [52]. However,
    if there are large variations in soil water content within the profile, inaccurate
    values may occur [53]. Table 1. Values of predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd, MPa);

    been observed to affect the rate of assimilation [54]. The observed circadian
    pattern for gs was characterised by maximal stomatal opening from sunrise, as
    soon as radiation reached the plant leaves, at 08:00 until 10:30 h GTM+2, followed
    by a decreasing trend with minimal values reached by midday. A slight increase
    in gs was also observed during the afternoon hours, which may be a consequence
    of easing environmental conditions [55]. The daily time-courses of Ttrunk, ECbulk
    and K are shown in Fig. 6. K & ECbulk values fluctuated in a range of 17.2 − 18.3
    & 67−81 µS cm−1, 17.1 − 17.5 & 53−67 µS cm−1, and 18.0 − 18.3 & 63−89 µS cm−1
    at moderate and severe deficits, and irrigation recovery periods, respectively
    (Fig. 6b). Ttrunk values increased around midday and recorded the lower absolute
    values during irrigation recovery, as this was the least demanding day (Fig. 2a).
    The fact that K decreases during the day and increases at night proves that the
    sensors are able to detect diurnal fluctuations in tree trunk hydration [30,31].
    Moreover, the soil water deficit reduced the values of K (Fig. 6H). Thus, the
    intensity of the response of the stem water content is related to the intensity
    of the soil water deficit ([27]a). Download : Download high-res image (640KB)

    DOY: Day of the year. ECbulk behaved in the same pattern as Ttrunk, suggesting
    that an increase in temperature results in higher ion mobility in the wood sap,
    leading to an increase in ECbulk [56]. An interesting work by Stott et al. [57]
    compared four commercially available sensors (GS3 from Meter Group, Inc., Pullman,
    WA, USA, CS655 from Cambpell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA, and TDR-315/315
    L from Acclima, Inc., Boise, ID, USA). The study concluded that changes in the
    Ttrunk also affect the ECbulk, so caution should be taken with temperature sensitivity,
    even if the sensor has been previously insulated [40]. However, the authors suggested
    that diurnal changes in trunk hydration, although interesting, may be less valuable
    for irrigation scheduling based on water content in the trunk (Ɵv-trunk) than
    daily averages, especially when there is doubt about the effect of temperature
    on the measurements. As expected, soil water deficit lowered leaf water potential
    (Ψpd) and actual osmotic potential (Ψo) (Table 1). No significant differences
    in osmotic water potential were observed at full turgor (Ψπ100) and even in the
    irrigation recovery period, leaf turgor potential (Ψt) decreased as the season
    progressed due to leaf senescence [49]. Accelerated leaf senescence and leaf abscission
    can occur, which is associated with episodes of drought (in our case, severe water
    deficit period), meaning that canopy size decreases due to turgor loss [58]. Lower
    values of ECbulk measured with trunk-TDR-315 N were associated with higher (less
    negative) values of Ψo, under well-irrigated conditions, probably due to a lower
    amount of osmolytes through a dilution effect [59]. No osmotic adjustment was
    observed in the experiment. In this sense, Mellisho et al. [60] in peach trees
    and Ruiz-Sánchez et al. [61] in apricot trees reported that a Ψs,md. value below
    –2.0 MPa must be achieved over a long period of time to activate this tolerance
    mechanism. Fig. 7 shows a strong dependency between the irrigation protocol based
    on threshold θv-trunk values with plant water status, both stem water potential
    (Ψs,md) and trunk permittivity (K), with the changes in Ψs,md and K over 75 %
    by θv-trunk variations. Soil water content is an indicator of the availability
    of water for plant consumption [1]. These results confirm that plants perceive
    a water deficit in the soil and that this information is important for precise
    irrigation scheduling [21]. It is known that the factors that affect K are temperature,
    soil moisture and frequency [[5], [29]]. The loss of K at higher θv-trunk values
    coinciding with irrigation recovery and less demanding weather conditions (Fig.
    2a) is quite striking (Fig. 7b). This fact is probably due to a loss of xylem
    conductivity corresponding to the phenological period of late postharvest. In
    this sense, Sparks et al. [33] reported that losses in stem hydraulic conductivity
    correlated with freeze-thaw events during warming periods in midwinter that reduced
    stem water content. Download : Download high-res image (316KB) Download : Download

    average daily values of Ɵv-soil and K coincided with the days on which Ψs,md values
    were determined during each irrigation period: moderate deficit or α = 50 %, (yellow
    circle); severe deficit or α = 100 %, (red triangles); and recovery irrigation
    or well-irrigated (blue squares). Values are means of four capacitance probes
    and leaves and three TDR sensors. ***, p ≤ 0.001. Conversion of K into θV-trunk
    As the trunk water content is a recognised water status indicator, the conversion
    of K TDR-values into ƟV-trunk values was performed. For this purpose, the results
    of the calibration, which was performed according to the procedure described in
    the methodology section, are shown in Fig. 8. At the end of the drying period,
    when the weight loss was constant (46 days), K reached a value of 6.7. Therefore,
    weight loss of 30 % corresponded to a K loss of 11 units (Fig. 8a). Correlation
    of the calibration data showed a perfect quadratic fit (Fig. 8b). However, since
    we moved in a short range of K values (17.0–19.4), we applied the least squares
    method, which determines the linear regression line that minimises the residuals
    [62]. Then, using the equation obtained in Fig. 8c, the K values were converted
    to θv-trunk. Download : Download high-res image (298KB) Download : Download full-size

    plant indicators was very similar (Fig. 9). Only at the beginning of the study
    (moderate deficit) were the daily values of K slightly higher than those of the
    θv-trunk, but this effect was not significant. Therefore, TDR-305 N sensor was
    well suited for measuring water content in the nectarine trunk and could be properly
    used for monitoring daily and seasonal changes in K. Download : Download high-res

    in the tree trunk were able to reveal automated θv-soil-based irrigation protocols
    applied in a nectarine tree orchard. Continuous K measurements explained more
    than 75 % of θv-soil variation as in the case of Ψs,md. Furthermore, the calibration
    of K measurements into θv-trunk values proposed in this study could be extended
    to other fruit crops. The different behaviour of K and ECbulk on a daily and seasonal
    scale was due to dilution effects of the ions due to higher sap flow and transpiration
    during the day as well as water content and its movement in the soil during the
    season. In addition, the results showed the impact of leaf senescence during the
    late postharvest period, when irrigation resumed, on the K response, so additional
    information is needed early in the season to verify K threshold values under non-limiting
    soil water conditions. Since automation is possible with real-time K data (or
    θv-trunk instead), further research is needed to determine threshold K values
    for successful precision irrigation. In addition, the stability and long-term
    performance of trunk-TDR sensors need to be verified. This work showed promising
    findings on the use of trunk water content sensors for accurate continuous monitoring
    of the plant water status of nectarine trees. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res

    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res
    image (244KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Workflow of the smart
    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration
    are detailed in Table 5. Table 4. LDR sensor accuracy. Light dependent resistor

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    (b) Light intensity; (c) Temperature; and (d) Humidity. In addition to presenting
    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    techniques. Table 6 illustrates differences across various aspects of each study,
    including objectives and developed features. While all the studies in this section
    share the goal of enhancing environmental quality in mushroom crops, each focuses
    on distinct aspects. The detailed discussion on features is categorized into groups,
    such as the sensors used, the implemented technology communication model, and
    user-feedback applications on the job. Table 6. Features comparison between the

    wind and air. The diversity extends to the forms of technology communication and
    the availability of user-feedback applications. The proposed research employs
    various sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and
    motion detection. To facilitate user feedback, we utilize two serially connected
    microcontrollers through a digital platform named ThingerIO. 4.3.2. Results comparison
    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.
    Method Number of managed vital parameters Number of actuating tools Ability to
    monitor in real-time basis [38] 2 3 Yes [12] 3 0 No [45] 2 3 Yes Proposed method
    5 6 Yes Furthermore, the proposed method distinguishes itself by employing a notable
    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used
    to gather relevant literature and research studies on the extent of integration
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation. The approach used in this study (Fig.
    1) followed well-defined steps, known as the PRISMA approach [44,45]. Multiple
    academic databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Google Scholar,
    and Web of Science were searched for relevant research articles published in the
    past decade. The literature search was conducted between 27th to 31st August 2023.
    Keywords used for the search included \"Smart Irrigation,\" \"Fourth Industrial
    Revolution,\" \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"Internet of Things,\" \"Big Data,\"
    \"Blockchain,\" \"Machine Learning,\" \"Drone Technology,\". The inclusion criteria
    were based on the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) as summarized
    in Table 1 [46]. Only articles relevant to smart irrigation, 4IR technologies
    were included. As an exclusion criterion, only open access articles published
    in English within the past decade were considered. Download : Download high-res

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    irrigation efficiency. Furrow and drip irrigation [75] Demonstrated AI modelling
    for optimizing green roof irrigation by adapting watering schedules based on evolving
    environmental conditions. Sprinkler irrigation [76] Utilized AI to estimate drip
    tape irrigation discharge using temperature and pressure data, enhancing water
    use efficiency in drip irrigation systems. Drip tape irrigation Table 3. Applications
    of IoT in irrigation. Reference IoT Usage Findings Summary [86] IoT infrastructure

    regulation of agro-hydrological systems using zone model predictive control. Proposed
    an IoT-based approach for regulating agro-hydrological systems using zone model
    predictive control. Enhanced irrigation management for crop growth. Internet of
    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    in sub-saharan africa Infrastructure limitations and access to technology One
    of the significant constraints in leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa is the limited infrastructure and lack
    of access to technology [111,112]. Many rural areas in the region lack reliable
    electricity supply, internet connectivity, and adequate communication networks
    necessary for the seamless functioning of smart irrigation systems. The absence
    of basic infrastructure hampers the deployment and operation of advanced technologies
    such as sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing platforms. Additionally, the
    high cost of technology acquisition and maintenance further restricts the access
    and adoption of 4IR solutions for smart irrigation in the region. Governance and
    policy challenges Governance and policy challenges pose significant obstacles
    to the effective utilization of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation in sub-Saharan
    Africa [111,113,114]. Fragmented regulatory frameworks, and a lack of coordination
    among different stakeholders hinder the integration of these technologies into
    existing irrigation systems. The absence of clear guidelines on data management,
    privacy, and security also creates uncertainties and inhibits the widespread adoption
    of 4IR technologies. It is crucial to establish comprehensive governance frameworks
    and supportive policies that address data governance, privacy concerns, interoperability
    standards, and institutional coordination to facilitate the successful implementation
    of smart irrigation systems. Regulatory frameworks and safety Considerations regarding
    the use of drones need to be established to ensure safe and responsible operations
    [115]. Compliance with airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and licensing requirements
    are crucial aspects that need to be addressed. Developing appropriate guidelines
    and training programs can help farmers navigate these regulatory challenges and
    ensure the safe integration of drones in irrigation practices. Financial constraints
    and investment requirements The adoption of 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    requires significant financial investment, which presents a considerable constraint
    in Sub-Saharan Africa [116,112]. The high initial cost of acquiring and deploying
    technologies such as sensors, drones, IoT devices, and data analytics platforms
    can be a deterrent for smallholder farmers and resource-constrained agricultural
    enterprises [117]. Limited access to financing and the absence of appropriate
    financial mechanisms further impedes the adoption of 4IR technologies. Overcoming
    financial constraints necessitates the exploration of innovative financing models,
    public-private partnerships, and targeted investment strategies to make these
    technologies more affordable and accessible to farmers in the region. Lack of
    capacity building and skills development The lack of technical skills and knowledge
    among farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders is a significant constraint
    in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation [84,118]. The successful implementation
    and operation of smart irrigation systems requires capacity building initiatives
    to enhance the understanding, operation, and maintenance of these technologies
    [119,120]. Training programs and awareness campaigns are essential to equip farmers
    and relevant personnel with the necessary skills in data management, analytics,
    interpretation, and system operation. Additionally, fostering collaboration between
    academia, research institutions, and extension services can facilitate knowledge
    transfer and skill development, addressing the capacity gaps and promoting the
    effective use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation practices. Integration with
    existing agricultural practices Integrating drone technology into existing agricultural
    practices requires farmers to adapt their workflows and decision-making processes
    [119,97]. Farmers need to understand how to interpret drone-generated data and
    incorporate it into their irrigation management strategies. Extension services
    and farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing platforms play a crucial role in facilitating
    this integration. Opportunities for leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    Enhanced water use efficiency and crop yield optimization Leveraging 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation presents significant opportunities for enhancing water use
    efficiency and optimizing crop yields [121,122]. Through the integration of sensors,
    AI algorithms, and real-time data monitoring, smart irrigation systems can precisely
    assess soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop water requirements.
    This data-driven approach enables farmers to apply water resources more efficiently,
    minimizing water wastage and maximizing crop productivity. By ensuring that irrigation
    is tailored to the specific needs of crops and adapting to changing environmental
    conditions, 4IR technologies can significantly contribute to sustainable water
    management and improved agricultural outcomes. Data-driven decision-making for
    improved irrigation practices The use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    facilitates data-driven decision-making processes, enabling farmers to make informed
    choices regarding irrigation practices [121]. By collecting and analyzing large
    volumes of data from various sources, such as sensors, satellites, and weather
    stations, smart irrigation systems provide valuable insights into soil conditions,
    crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. This wealth of information
    empowers farmers to optimize irrigation strategies, adjust watering schedules,
    and apply the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved water
    management and increased crop productivity. Data-driven decision-making also allows
    for proactive responses to changing climate patterns and helps mitigate the risks

    pool resources, and leverage each other''s strengths. Partnerships can facilitate
    the development and deployment of innovative solutions, foster research and development,
    and promote the exchange of best practices [126]. Additionally, collaboration
    between academia, industry, and government entities can contribute to the co-creation
    of technologies and the adaptation of existing solutions to the specific needs
    and contexts of sub-Saharan Africa. Capacity building initiatives and knowledge
    transfer Investing in capacity building initiatives and knowledge transfer is
    vital to overcome the challenges associated with the adoption of 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation. Training programs, workshops, and demonstration sites should
    be established to enhance the technical skills and knowledge of farmers, extension
    workers, and other stakeholders. These initiatives should focus on building expertise
    in data management, analytics, technology operation, and maintenance [127,126].
    Additionally, knowledge transfer mechanisms, such as farmer field schools and
    extension services, can facilitate the dissemination of best practices and encourage
    the adoption of 4IR technologies at the grassroots level. Ensuring inclusivity
    and addressing equity concerns In leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation,
    it is essential to ensure inclusivity and address equity concerns. Efforts should
    be made to bridge the digital divide and ensure that smallholder farmers, women
    farmers, and rural communities have equal access to these technologies. This can
    be achieved through initiatives that provide affordable and user-friendly technology
    solutions, promote gender-sensitive approaches, and address socio-economic disparities
    [128,129]. Furthermore, inclusive decision-making processes that involve all stakeholders
    and prioritize the needs and perspectives of marginalized groups can contribute
    to equitable outcomes and sustainable development. By implementing these recommendations,
    Sub-Sahara Africa can unlock the transformative potential of 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation, leading to improved water use efficiency, increased crop
    yields, and sustainable agricultural practices. Conclusion The 4IR technologies

    Introduction Peaches are an important fruit crop worldwide. ‘Shimizu Hakuto’ (Prunus
    persica Batsch.) is a mid-late maturing table peach cultivar introduced from Japan
    to China. It has a bright cream-colored skin, melting fleshed with a fine and
    juicy texture, excellent taste, and a strong aroma, which enable it to have good
    development prospects in production. It is well known that both fruit quality
    and enlargement rely on leaf photoassimilates. Minimum required shoot and leaf
    areas are assumed to be important for the development of high-quality fruit (Wang
    et al., 2021), but excessive shoot vigor consumes additional leaf photoassimilates
    and results in a decline in fruit size and quality (Raja et al., 2018). Peach
    trees usually produce excessive shoots, with lateral shoots of high vigor. Pinching
    and spraying growth retardants, such as paclobutrazol, are common strategies to
    control vegetative growth, but these measures are labor intensive and entail risk
    of residues (Raja et al., 2018; Orozco-Meléndez et al., 2022). Modified cultivation
    techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation can be an effective way to control
    excessive shoot vigor, improve fruit quality, and conserve water (Martínez-Romero
    et al., 2019; Rahmati et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2021). The application of regulated
    deficit irrigation requires accurate knowledge of critical phenological periods
    and the responses of plants to water stress. Peach fruit undergoes two periods
    of sigmoidal growth (Kumar et al., 2017; Zotarelli et al., 2021). Fruit has different
    sensitivities to water deficits at different developmental stages (Gucci et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2022). In general, fruit developmental stage I includes rapid
    cell division, which determines potential fruit size, and which is more sensitive
    to water stress than the subsequent cell filling stage (Naor, 2006). Fruit developmental
    stage II, also called the fruit growth slowdown period or pit hardening, is the
    least sensitive stage to water stress (Razouk et al., 2021). However, fruit developmental
    stage III is the most sensitive period to irrigation because a water deficit at
    this stage would reduce the final fruit size and overall production (Minas et
    al., 2018; Ruiz-Sánchez et al., 2018). High soil water content promotes excessive
    shoot vigor, which in turn inhibits fruit growth due to water and nutrient competition
    between the shoots and fruits (Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010). A moderate water deficit
    has been shown to improve fruit quality via the translocation of more photosynthetic
    products to fruits (Hajian et al., 2020; Razouk et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2022;
    Zhou et al., 2022). However, severe water deficit stress can inhibit shoot growth
    and net leaf photosynthesis (Pn), reducing fruit yield and quality (Jia et al.,
    2015; Safoora et al., 2018; Ranjbar et al., 2021). Therefore, water status plays
    an important role in vegetative vigor and fruit development and quality (Falchi
    et al., 2020). It is crucial to determine the optimal degree of water deficit
    to balance vegetative and fruit growth at different fruit developmental stages.
    Stem water potential (ψstem), crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and maximum daily
    stem diameter shrinkage (MDS) are conventional irrigation indicators (Mercier
    et al., 2009; Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016; Fernandes et al., 2021). A ψstem threshold
    of about −1.0 MPa improved fruit quality without decreasing fruit size (Mirás-Avalos
    et al., 2016). Mild deficit irrigation at 75% ETc during fruit production season
    improved fruit size and quality without influencing Pn (Zhou et al., 2017). Irrigation
    maintaining MDS between 50 μm and 100 μm did not influence fruit yield or quality
    (Mercier et al., 2009). However, ψstem measurements require destructive sampling
    and considerable time and labor costs. ETc is influenced by many factors, including
    solar radiation, wind speed, air relative humidity, and temperature, and varies
    seasonally (Zotarelli et al., 2021). The calculation of MDS requires continuous
    measurement of stem diameter throughout the day; these measurements vary greatly
    and are not easy to execute. Soil water potential, which represents the capacity
    of soil to supply water to the plant root system, is a convenient parameter to
    guide irrigation (Lou et al., 2016). Many studies have shown the effects of soil
    water on tree growth and fruit quality, but their results have focused primarily
    on the effects on fruit quality of water deficits throughout the growth season
    (Ruiz-Sánchez et al., 2018; Duarte et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022). Few studies
    have focused on the real-time effects of water status on fruit and shoot growth.
    Each stage of fruit growth will affect its final quality. Various methods have
    been developed to evaluate real-time changes in tree and fruit growth, including
    linear variable displacement transducers and photogrammetry (Ortuño et al., 2010;
    Lou et al., 2016). A linear variable displacement transducer can squeeze organs
    and affect organ growth after a long measurement period. Photogrammetry allows
    noncontact measurements of organ size (Lou et al., 2016; Gené-Mola et al., 2021).
    Lou et al. (2016) investigated the dynamic changes in grape growth under different
    water conditions using photogrammetry, and established ψsoil thresholds to trigger
    irrigation at critical stages of berry development. They also verified the reliability
    of these thresholds, which could decrease shoot pinching time and induce an increase
    in berry size, anthocyanin content, and total soluble solid content (Lou et al.,
    2018). Therefore, photogrammetry can play an important role in achieving automatic
    fruit irrigation and reducing labor costs. In this study, we investigated real-time
    changes in stem diameter, fruit projected area, leaf Pn, and allocation of photoassimilates
    to the fruit at three fruit developmental stages under ψsoil ranging from saturation
    to stress. Finally, we determined the pivotal ψsoil thresholds to balance shoot
    and fruit growth, maintain leaf Pn, and promote the allocation of photoassimilates
    to fruit, providing scientific guidance for peach tree water management. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Plant materials and growth conditions At the beginning of March
    2013, thirty 5-year-old ‘Shimizu hakuto’ peach trees were transplanted into 50.2
    L pots (35 cm inside bottom diameter, 48 cm top diameter, and 40 cm height). All
    pots were placed in an experimental orchard at the School of Agriculture and Biology
    of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China (31°11′N, 121°29′E). The cultivation
    medium was a mixture of sand, loam, manure, and perlite (1:2:1:1, v/v) with an
    organic content of 3.3%, and good air permeability. From April of 2013, each tree
    was treated twice a week with 2 L of liquid fertilizer consisting of NO3–N, NH4+-N,
    P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, B, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na, and Mo, with concentrations of 94.5, 5.6,
    12.4, 93.8, 86.9, 19.2, 15.0, 0.44, 3.2, 1.4, 0.004, 0.0021, and 0.047 mg·L−1,
    respectively. The soil moisture was monitored at a depth of 20 cm using three
    tensiometers. Peach trees were watered by drip irrigation to maintain the soil
    moisture at ≥ −15.5 kPa from flowering to fruit set, ≥ −5.0 kPa from fruit set
    to pit hardening and ≥ −15.5 kPa from pit hardening to harvest. Experiments took
    place from April to July 2014, following one year of growth. Fertilizer and water
    management were performed as described above. The average temperature, relative
    humid, and daytime light intensity during the day were 23.6 °C, 75.9%, and 547.8
    μmol·m−2·s−1, respectively (natural light) in the experimental orchard. 2.2. Measurement
    of shoot length and fruit diameter Six randomly selected bearing fruit peach trees
    were used to measure shoot length and fruit diameter (perpendicular to the fruit
    suture). Six shoots from six trees, one shoot from each tree, were measured using
    tapeline weekly, starting from 15 days after full bloom (16 April) to ripening
    (16 July). Eighteen fruits from six peach trees, three fruits from each tree,
    were estimated using an electronic digital caliper every three days starting from
    36 days after full bloom (8 May) to ripening (16 July). 2.3. Real-time determination
    of stem diameter, fruit projected area and leaf Pn under different ψsoil Three
    peach trees with uniform growth vigor at stage I (fruit diameter < 3.5 cm, from
    6 May to 12 May), stage II (fruit diameter 3.5−4.5 cm, from 28 May to 2 June),
    and stage III (fruit diameter > 4.5 cm, from 25 June to 4 July) were selected
    and moved to the greenhouse. The growth conditions were as follows: average temperature
    of 28.0 °C, average relative humidity of 71.6%, and average light intensity at
    noon of 557.8 μmol·m−2·s−1 (natural light). Before irrigation, three tensiometers
    (SP-3100S-01, Sprout, Japan) were installed in the cultivation medium in the dense
    root zone, approximately 20 cm deep and 25 cm away from the trunk of each plant
    to measure ψsoil. Data were recorded using a data logger (R4109, Shanghai Yi Jie
    Automation Technology, China). Sufficient water was applied to saturate the soil.
    Subsequently, the stem diameter, fruit size (fruit projected area), and ψsoil
    were measured once an hour during the gradual decrease in ψsoil due to transpiration.
    Three stems or fruits selected from three trees were used to measure the stem
    diameter or fruit projected area, respectively, at each stage. In addition, Three
    mature leaves of the middle shoot from three trees, one leaf from each tree, were
    chosen to determine leaf Pn every 2 h from 7:00 to 17:00 using a portable photosynthesis
    system (CIRAS-2, PP Systems, USA). Stem diameter and fruit projected area were
    measured as described by Lou et al. (2016). The image capture system included
    a tripod, light source, reflective umbrella, controller, camera, and diffuse light
    barrier background plate. The light source and camera were activated using the
    controller. The calibration objects (red sphere with a diameter of 8 mm) were
    placed at the same distance from the target fruit or stem. The fruit projected
    area and stem diameter were calculated using image processing software based on
    MATLAB software (Miao et al., 2013). The algorithm includes image contour extraction,
    Zernike edge detection and Hough circle calibration. 2.4. Analysis of fruit size
    fluctuation The peach fruit projected area showed a diurnal change, with an increase
    at night and a decrease during the day. A trend equation for fruit growth was
    obtained based on a time series model, using the hours after full irrigation as
    the x-axis and the fruit projected area as the y-axis. The best-fit equation that
    predicted the trend of fruit projected area with time was estimated using the
    multivariate curve regression method in Microsoft Excel 2010. The rate of fruit
    growth was defined as the derivative of the trend equation. Finally, the relationship
    between ψsoil and fruit growth was calculated. 2.5. The effect of soil water potential
    on fruit growth Linear regression analysis was conducted before and after the
    inflection points in the curves derived from the fruit projected area increments
    with ψsoil, using Microsoft Excel 2010. Significant differences in the slopes
    of the above linear equations were used to determine the ψsoil values that significantly
    affected fruit growth. 2.6. The allocation of photoassimilates to fruit under
    different ψsoil During fruit developmental stage III (from July 5 to July 16),
    nine peach trees with uniform growth vigor were selected and divided into three
    groups of three trees. The nine trees were then moved to an artificial climate
    chamber (28 °C daytime/25 °C nighttime, average daytime light intensity of 448.9
    μmol·m−2·s−1, natural light). Prior to the experiment, sufficient water was applied
    to saturate soil. Subsequently, ψsoil decreased due to transpiration. 13C isotope
    labelling for each group was separately conducted when its ψsoil dropped to −5.0,
    −10.0 or −15.0 kPa. Labelling was conducted as described by Lou et al. (2016).
    One fruiting shoot of about 40 cm in length per peach tree was chosen for labelling.
    The branch close to and below the peach and shoot was girdled by removing a 2-mm
    wide section of bark, which prevented export of photoassimilates from the shoot
    above the girdling site. The shoot to be labelled was exposed to 13CO2 enclosed
    in a polyethylene bag that contained a 100 mL plastic cup fixed on the metallic
    framework of the bag. Labelled CO2 was generated by injecting 6 mL of 40% lactic
    acid onto 1.0 g Ba13CO3 with an abundance of 99% 13C (Shanghai Research Institute
    of Chemical Industry, Shanghai, China). The polyethylene bag was removed after
    4 h, and 24 h later the labelled shoot was cut off from the girdling site and
    immediately separated into leaves, branches (including petioles and berry peduncles)
    and fruits. The δ13C and carbon concentration of these leaves, branches (including
    petioles and berry peduncles) and fruits were analysed using an elemental analysis-stable
    isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Vario EL III/Isoprime, Elementar Analysensysteme,
    Hanau, Germany). 2.7. Data analysis Multivariate curve and linear regression analyses
    were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2010. Duncan''s multiple range test and t-test
    were conducted using SAS software version 8.2. 3. Results 3.1. Shoot length and
    peach fruit diameter Shoot length and fruit diameter gradually increased throughout
    the measurement period. Fruit growth followed a double-sigmoid curve (Fig. 1).
    Rapid growth was observed during stages I and III of fruit development. Download

    + 2.1173x + 712.37, y = −0.0209x2 + 4.038x + 1711.8, and y = −0.0131x2 + 4.9894x
    + 2983.4, respectively, where x indicates the number of hours after full irrigation
    and y represents the predicted fruit projected area, which is the trend value
    of the fruit projected area in square millimeters at the x-th hour. 3.3. Effects
    of ψsoil on stem diameter during fruit developmental stages I, II, and III In
    stage I, the maximum daily stem diameter shrinkage increased, whereas the maximum
    daily stem diameter growth decreased, with a decline in ψsoil. When ψsoil was
    between −8.5 kPa and −38.2 kPa, maximum daily shrinkage increased significantly,
    indicating that the stem diameter growth was inhibited significantly. Stem diameter
    growth ceased when ψsoil reached −21.2 kPa (Table 1). Table 1. Effect of soil

    diameter shrinkage and maximum daily stem diameter growth showed patterns similar
    to those during stage I. When ψsoil was between −7.6 kPa and −38.5 kPa, stem diameter
    growth was significantly inhibited. Stem diameter growth became negative when

    Stem diameter growth became negative when ψsoil fell below −21.4 kPa (Table 3).

    and P < 0.01, respectively (t-test). 3.4. Effects of soil water potential on fruit
    projected area during fruit developmental stages I, II, and III The process of
    fruit growth with ψsoil ranging from saturation to deficit stress was divided
    into four stages: the high-speed growth phase, rapid growth phase, slow growth
    phase, and shrinking phase (Fig. 4; Fig. S1; Fig. S2). The high-speed growth phase
    began at saturated irrigation, ending at the first inflection point of the predicted
    fruit projected area increments. During this stage, fruit growth was relatively
    fast and was not influenced by a decrease in ψsoil. The rapid growth phase began
    at the first inflection point of the predicted fruit projected area increments,
    ending at the second inflection point. During this phase, the fruit growth rate
    showed a slowly decreasing trend with decreasing ψsoil. The slow growth phase
    began at the second inflection point of the predicted fruit projected area increments,
    ending at the third inflection point. During this phase, the fruit exhibited relatively
    slow to zero growth. Fruit growth was negative during the shrinking phase. The
    fruit growth rate gradually decreased with a decline in ψsoil. The ψsoil ranges
    for high-speed growth phase, rapid growth phase, slow growth phase, and shrinking
    phase were > −4.3 kPa, −4.3 to −9.0 kPa, −9.0 to −23.1 kPa, and < −23.1 kPa, respectively,
    with corresponding fruit growth rates of 1.7–2.1 mm2·h−1, 0.7−1.7 mm2·h−1, 0−0.7
    mm2·h−1, and < 0 mm2·h−1, respectively (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res

    growth phase, RGP: rapid growth phase, SGP: slow growth phase, SP: shrinking phase.
    Peach fruit growth performance in stage II was similar to that during stage I
    (Fig. S1). The ranges of ψsoil for fruit high-speed growth phase, rapid growth
    phase, slow growth phase, and shrinking phase were > −6.3 kPa, −6.3 to −14.9 kPa,
    −14.9 to −21.4 kPa, and < −21.4 kPa, respectively, with corresponding fruit growth
    rates of 2.6–4.0 mm2·h−1, 0.6−2.6 mm2·h−1, 0−0.6 mm2·h−1, and < 0 mm2·h−1, respectively.
    The fruit growth rate in stage III was higher than that in stages I and II. The
    highest fruit growth rate was 5.0 mm2·h−1 in stage III. The ranges of ψsoil for
    fruit high-speed growth phase, rapid growth phase, slow growth phase, and shrinking
    phase were > −9.2 kPa, −9.2 to −16.5 kPa, −16.5 to −23.3 kPa, and < −23.3 kPa,
    respectively, with corresponding fruit growth rates of 2.7–5.0 mm2·h−1, 0.9−2.7
    mm2·h−1, 0−0.9 mm2·h−1, and < 0 mm2·h−1, respectively (Fig. S2). 3.5. Effects
    of soil water potential on leaf Pn during fruit developmental stages I, II, and
    III Leaf Pn showed periodic diurnal variations with a decline in ψsoil (Fig. 5).
    There were two peaks each day, at approximately 9:00 and 16:00. The diurnal maximum
    value of Pn showed a downward trend with declining ψsoil. The diurnal maximum
    value of Pn was 14.4 μmol·m−2·s−1 on the first day of saturation irrigation, and
    ψsoil was −4.1 kPa at 7:00 on 6 May. When ψsoil dropped to −17.8 kPa at 9:00 on
    9 May, the diurnal maximum value of Pn was 10.5 μmol·m−2·s−1. However, the difference
    in Pn was not significant. When the ψsoil decreased to −24.2 kPa at 9:00 on the
    following day 10 May, the daily maximum value of Pn was 7.0 μmol·m−2·s−1, which
    was significantly lower than that at a high level of ψsoil (−4.1 kPa) under similar
    light conditions (Fig. S3). Subsequently, the daily maximum values of Pn decreased
    significantly. These results suggest that leaf Pn was significantly inhibited
    when ψsoil decreased to a threshold of −24.2 kPa. Download : Download high-res

    peach Asterisks indicate significant differences relative to the maximum value
    of Pn on the first day after saturated irrigation (6 May) (P < 0.05, t-test).
    The diurnal variation in Pn during this stage was also similar to that during
    stage I (Fig. 6). When ψsoil decreased to −22.7 kPa at 7:00 on June 1, the diurnal
    maximum value of Pn was 4.7 μmol·m−2·s−1, which was significantly lower than that
    at of Pn at 9:00 on 28 May, which was 12.1 μmol·m−2·s−1 under high ψsoil (−3.3
    kPa). Subsequently, the maximum diurnal values of Pn decreased significantly.
    Furthermore, similar light conditions were appeared at 7:00 on 1 June and 9:00
    on 28 May (Fig. S4). These results suggest that leaf Pn was significantly inhibited
    when ψsoil decreased to a threshold of −22.7 kPa. Although one diurnal maximum
    value of Pn decreased significantly to 7.6 μmol·m−2·s−1 at 7:00 on 29 May. The
    decrease in Pn cannot be attributed to the decline in ψsoil because the Pn value
    recovered with a further decline in ψsoil the following day. It may be caused
    by weaker light intensity (595.2 and 148.8 μmol·m−2·s−1 at 7:00 on 28 May and
    29 May, respectively) (Fig. S4). Download : Download high-res image (214KB) Download

    Pn during stage III was also similar to that in stages I and II (Fig. 7). When
    ψsoil decreased to −20.4 kPa at 7:00 on 2 July, the diurnal maximum value of Pn
    decreased significantly, to 6.2 μmol·m−2·s−1, and remained at a lower level with
    further decline in ψsoil. Although the diurnal maximum values of Pn decreased
    significantly at 9:00 on both 26 June and 27 June, to 5.5 and 4.7 μmol·m−2·s−1,
    respectively, these decreases in Pn cannot be attributed to the decline in ψsoil
    because the Pn value later recovered with a further decline in ψsoil on the following
    day with concurrent weaker light intensity (234.2, 74.4, 77.5, and 223.2 μmol·m−2·s−1
    at 9:00 on 25 June, 26 June, 27 June, and 28 June, respectively) (Fig. S5). Download

    influence on fruit growth The analysis of ψsoil with inflection points revealed
    that the ψsoil values have a significant influence on fruit growth. Three sets
    of ψsoil values affecting fruit growth, −4.3 kPa/-9.0 kPa/-23.1 kPa, −6.3 kPa/-14.9
    kPa/-21.4 kPa, and −9.2 kPa/-16.5 kPa/-23.3 kPa, were observed at fruit developmental

    potential on the allocation of photoassimilates to fruit During fruit developmental
    stage III, the total amount of photosynthetic products assimilated by leaves in
    one labelled shoot (13C) under moderate ψsoil (−10.1 to −17.0 kPa) and low ψsoil
    (−16.9 to −30.5 kPa) were significantly higher than those under high ψsoil (−3.0
    to −8.9 kPa). Both the amount of 13C allocated to fruit per unit and its proportion
    to the total amount of photoassimilates under moderate ψsoil were significantly
    higher than those under high or low ψsoil. Furthermore, the amount of 13C allocated
    to each fruit and its proportion to the total amount of 13C under moderate ψsoil
    were significantly higher than those under high or low ψsoil conditions (Table
    5). Table 5. Effect of soil water potential on the allocation of photoassimilates

    multiple range test). 4. Discussion In this study, the fruit growth curve displayed
    a double-sigmoid pattern, which is consistent with previous reports (Kumar et
    al., 2017; Zotarelli et al., 2021). Shoots grew primarily during the first two
    fruit developmental stages, suggesting that competition for photosynthetic products
    exists between shoot and fruit growth. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a
    balance between these two processes. The peach fruit projected area increased
    at night and decreased during the day. Fruit growth continued under irrigation
    conditions but slowed or even stopped under a continuous decrease in ψsoil. However,
    severe water stress suppresses wheat leaf Pn and reduces leaf area (Jia et al.,
    2015), which in turn inhibits strawberry expansion and ripening (Safoora et al.,
    2018). Similar results have been observed in grape (Lou et al., 2016). This phenomenon
    was mainly caused by water loss through transpiration during the day. In the absence
    of soil water stress, the amount of water absorbed through the root system may
    exceed that lost by transpiration, which is helpful for maintaining fruit growth.
    However, if soil water stress is present, the water absorbed through the root
    system is unable to compensate for that lost through transpiration, resulting
    in negative growth. Fruit responds differently to water stress at different stages
    of development (Naor, 2006; Razouk et al., 2021). The sensitivity of a plant growth
    stage to water deficit can be affected by many factors, including climatic conditions,
    crop species and cultivars, and agronomic management practices (Chai et al., 2016).
    In our experiment, the ψsoil values having significant inhibition effects on fruit
    growth were −9.0, −14.9, and −16.5 kPa, respectively, during stages I, II, and
    III. Therefore, the sensitivity of fruit growth to water deficit decreased gradually
    with fruit development, which is inconsistent with previous reports (Minas et
    al., 2018; Ruiz-Sánchez et al., 2018). These found that fruit developmental stage
    III was the most sensitive period to irrigation because a water deficit at this
    stage would reduce the final fruit size. However, Minas et al. (2018) and Ruiz-Sánchez
    et al. (2018) did not compare the sensitivity of fruits to water deficit at different
    developmental stages. Deficit irrigation limites the vegetative growth parameters
    of peach trees in the following order: stem diameter > wood pruning > canopy size
    > shoot length growth (Abrisqueta et al., 2010). Therefore, the stem diameter
    is a good indicator of vegetative growth. During fruit developmental stage Ⅰ,
    both shoots and fruits grew rapidly. Rapid cell division and cell enlargement
    occurred in the fruit, and the final number of cells in the fruit during this
    stage determined the final fruit size (Naor, 2006; Tao et al., 2022). Water stress
    with ψstem of −0.9 MPa at this stage decreased Batsch peach fruit sizes, dry-matter
    accumulation and shoot growth, but improved fruit color (Girona et al., 2004;
    Naor, 2006). However, Li et al. (1989) found that water deficit (no irrigation)
    imposed during stage Ⅰ increased the size of the late-ripening cultivar ‘Merrill
    Sundance’ peaches at harvest. Other studies have found that the minimum ψstem
    values that plants could withstand without impacting yield were roughly −0.5 MPa
    to −0.7 MPa during the fruit growth period (De la Rosa et al., 2015). Therefore,
    the different responses of fruit to water deficit can be attributed to differences
    in the degree of water deficit. Thus, it is important to determine the appropriate
    ψsoil to balance vegetative and fruit growth. In our study, stem diameter growth
    was inhibited significantly when ψsoil decreased to −8.5 kPa and ceased when ψsoil
    reached −21.2 kPa during fruit developmental stage I, which indicated that the
    optimum ψsoil values ranged between −8.5 kPa and −21.2 kPa to control excessive
    tree vigour. Moreover, When the ψsoil fell below −9.0 kPa, fruit growth was slow,
    and it ceased at a ψsoil value of −23.1 kPa. Therefore, the proper ψsoil should
    be above −9.0 kPa to promote fruit expansion. In addition, the diurnal maximum
    value of Pn was significantly reduced when ψsoil dropped to −24.2 kPa. The sensitivity
    of stem growth, fruit growth, and leaf Pn to water deficit decreased gradually,
    which is consistent with previous reports (Lou et al., 2016; Rahmati et al., 2018;
    Ruiz-Sánchez et al., 2018). These results suggest that the optimum ψsoil values
    to trigger irrigation after saturated irrigation during fruit developmental stage
    I range from −8.5 to −9.0 kPa. This ψsoil range not only inhibits excessive tree
    vigor, but also promotes rapid fruit growth, with no significant influence on
    leaf Pn. During fruit developmental stage II, fruit growth slowed, but the shoots
    exhibited more rapid growth. Excessive shoot vigor wastes nutrients and inhibits
    fruit development and flower-bud differentiation (Rahmati et al., 2018). Studies
    have shown that deficit irrigation stress at this stage can limit shoot growth
    and Pn but has variable effects on fruit growth (Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016; Chen
    et al., 2018). A ψstem threshold of about −1.0 MPa did not decrease fruit size
    in a mid-late maturing peach (‘Catherine’), but improved fruit quality (Mirás-Avalos
    et al., 2016). Deficit irrigation with approximately −1.1 MPa of midday ψstem
    could save water (17%–24%), without affecting ‘Andross’ peach yield, final fruit
    size, or flower production (Girona et al., 2005). Midday ψstem thresholds of −1.2
    and −1.4 MPa decreased ‘Baby gold 6’ peach fruit fresh mass (Marsal et al., 2016).
    Razouk et al. (2021) indicated that deficit irrigation with 75% ETC during stage
    II did not influence ‘JH-Hall’ peach yield, while deficit irrigation with 50%
    ETC significantly reduced yield and fruit size. Both deficit irrigation treatments
    improved fruit quality, with an increase in the sugar and acid ratio and polyphenol
    content. These results indicate that the degree of water deficit determines fruit
    size and quality. In our study, stem diameter growth was inhibited significantly
    when ψsoil decreased to −7.6 kPa, and ceased at −23.0 kPa during fruit developmental
    stage II. When ψsoil was more than −14.9 kPa, the fruit grew rapidly. Moreover,
    the diurnal maximum value of Pn began to decrease significantly when ψsoil decreased
    to −22.7 kPa. These results suggest that the optimum ψsoil values to trigger irrigation
    range from −7.6 to −14.9 kPa during fruit developmental stage II, based on the
    effects of ψsoil on vegetative growth, fruit growth, and leaf Pn. Furthermore,
    deficit irrigation in stage II decreases fruit size, but the fruit recovers in
    size under subsequent unstressed conditions, especially in early maturing cultivars,
    because the duration of stage II is short (Girona et al., 2005; Naor, 2006). Large
    amounts of photosynthetic products begin to accumulate in fruit during fruit developmental
    stage III, which results in a rapid increase in fruit fresh and dry weight (Cirilli
    et al., 2016). The purpose of production management during this stage is to promote
    rapid fruit enlargement and photosynthetic products accumulation in fruit. Moderate
    drought stress applied to peach during stage III improves fruit quality and nutritional
    quality by promoting the allocation of more sugar to fruit and secondary metabolites,
    such as polyphenolic compounds and anthocyanins (Wu et al., 2017; Zhou et al.,
    2017; Chen et al., 2021). Marsal et al. (2016) showed that reducing irrigation
    by 20% during the first half of stage III (a midday ψstem threshold approximately
    −1.2 MPa) imposed no significant limitations of final fruit size or quality in
    early-season ‘Alexandra’ peach. Mercier et al. (2009) indicated that light water
    restriction (between 50 and 100 μm of maximum daily stem diameter shrinkage) did
    not influence fruit yield or quality in early-season peach ‘Alexandra’. High water
    restriction (between 150 and 300 μm of maximum daily stem diameter shrinkage)
    decreased leaf photosynthesis, fruit yield, and average weight, but increased
    total soluble solids. Besset et al. (2001) indicated that light water stress (between
    200 and 400 μm of diurnal stem shrinkage) did not decrease yield or fruit weight
    in ‘Big-Top’ nectarine, but reduced leaf photosynthesis and soluble solids. Severe
    water stress (between 400 and 500 μm of diurnal stem shrinkage) decreased fruit
    weight and increased soluble solids. In our study, stem diameter growth was inhibited
    significantly when the ψsoil decreased to −5.4 kPa, and it became negative when
    the ψsoil fell below −21.4 kPa during fruit developmental stage III. Fruit growth
    slowed when ψsoil fell below −16.5 kPa. The diurnal maximum value of Pn began
    to decrease significantly when the ψsoil decreased to −20.4 kPa during this stage.
    In addition, more photosynthetic products (13C) were allocated to the fruit under
    moderate ψsoil (−10.1 to −17.0 kPa) during fruit developmental stage III, which
    is consistent with previous reports. Mild water stress promotes carbohydrate allocation
    to fruits (Lou et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017; Tao et al., 2022). These results
    suggest that the optimum ψsoil values to trigger irrigation range from −10.1 kPa
    to −16.5 kPa during fruit developmental stage III, based on the effect of ψsoil
    on stem growth, fruit growth, leaf Pn, and allocation of photoassimilates to the
    fruit. Furthermore, keeping fruits more exposed to sunlight and maintaining a
    low crop load could compensate for the negative effects of water stress on fruit
    size (Alcobendas et al., 2012). 5. Conclusion Overall, there is a lack of knowledge
    regarding real-time changes in tree and fruit growth under water deficit conditions.
    Previous studies have focused primarily on the effects of water deficit on final
    fruit performance, and the results have been inconsistent. The effects of water
    deficits on tree and fruit growth are assumed to occur immediately. Our study
    revealed that ψsoil had a significant influence on the stem growth, fruit growth,
    leaf Pn, and amount of photosynthetic products allocated to the fruit. To control
    excessive shoot vigor, maintain rapid fruit expansion and leaf Pn, and promote
    the allocation of more photoassimilates to the fruit, ψsoil thresholds to trigger
    irrigation were established for ‘Shimizu hakuto’ peach at three fruit developmental
    stages. The ψsoil thresholds for fruit developmental stages I, II, and III, were
    −9.0, −14.9, and −16.5 kPa, respectively, which provide scientifically supported
    guiding parameters for peach tree water management. Declaration of interests The

  description: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral and thermal images, combined
    with machine learning models, have been widely used for high-throughput phenotyping
    of crop traits and have great potential for evaluating the drought tolerance of
    winter wheat cultivars. In order to extract the wheat canopy information from
    UAV images, noise removal is an essential step. Currently, soil and shadow are
    two of the most common noises in UAV images influencing the extraction of the
    canopy information, which have been widely studied in previous studies. However,
    the noise caused by the abnormal canopy temperature in the thermal images has
    yet to be addressed. Besides, the machine learning-based methods are data-intensive
    and cannot meet the requirements for rapid evaluation of the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars. In order to rapidly evaluate the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars, this study proposed a drought tolerance evaluation
    method for winter wheat cultivars based on multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation
    and automatic noise removal. The thermal affected zone (TAZ), in which the canopy
    temperature was abnormally elevated due to thermal radiation from adjacent bare
    soil, was proposed in this study, and an effective noise removal method was proposed
    by comparing the accuracy of six automatic image segmentation methods. Canopy
    vegetation, texture, and temperature indices were extracted from the UAV multispectral
    and thermal images and selected based on their correlation with the measured yield
    stability index (YSI). Based on the multiple canopy indices, two multi-criteria
    comprehensive evaluation methods, i.e., weighted sum based on principal components
    analysis (PCA-WS) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution
    based on entropy weight (Entropy-TOPSIS), were used to evaluate the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars. The results showed that the automatic image segmentation
    methods could effectively remove the noises of soil, shadow, and TAZ. Removing
    the TAZ resulted in a significant decrease in canopy temperature for each irrigation
    treatment. The total score (TS) and comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) showed
    a significant linear relationship with the measured YSI, with a maximum R2 of
    0.637 and 0.636, respectively. The top five cultivars ranked by the TS and CEI
    had a consistency ratio of 60–80% with those selected by the measured YSI. This
    study indicates that the automatic noise removal and multi-criteria comprehensive
    evaluation have great potential in rapid evaluation of drought tolerance of winter
    wheat cultivars for large breeding trials.

    a significant linear relationship with the measured YSI, with a maximum R2 of
    0.637 and 0.636, respectively. The top five cultivars ranked by the TS and CEI
    had a consistency ratio of 60–80% with those selected by the measured YSI. This
    study indicates that the automatic noise removal and multi-criteria comprehensive
    evaluation have great potential in rapid evaluation of drought tolerance of winter
    wheat cultivars for large breeding trials. Previous article in issue Next article

    comprehensive evaluationDrought tolerance 1. Introduction The North China Plain,
    also known as the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, is the primary winter wheat production
    region in China and suffers from severe water shortage due to its heavy agricultural
    water requirements for winter wheat irrigation. The annual precipitation in this
    area is relatively low, with an uneven spatiotemporal distribution. Only 60–150
    mm of precipitation occurs during the winter wheat growing season, while the consumptive
    water used by winter wheat is about 430 to 470 mm, resulting in a three to four
    irrigation to achieve an expected grain yield (Fang et al., 2018). Given the limited
    surface water resources, groundwater has been overused, which caused the regional
    groundwater table to drop significantly. In order to minimize groundwater water
    use, deficit irrigation was implemented by reducing the volume of used water or
    decreasing the irrigation frequency (Fang et al., 2018). Breeding drought-tolerant
    winter wheat cultivars is of great practical significance in balancing yield and
    water-use efficiency in the North China Plain. Establishing a selection criterion
    based on drought-related traits is crucial for breeding drought-tolerant winter
    wheat cultivars and is still under development. Grain yield, as the primary trait,
    is one of the most important tools for identifying desirable cultivars under water-deficit
    conditions, based on which some tolerance or susceptibility indicators have been
    developed and showed high reliability in the classification of drought-tolerant
    cultivars. Among these indicators, the yield stability index (YSI) is used to
    select drought-tolerant cultivars with a stable and comparatively high yield under
    drought stress conditions (Nergui et al., 2022). However, the YSI involves a time
    lag since yields can only be measured upon the maturity of winter wheat. Furthermore,
    measuring grain yield is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially when a
    large number of winter wheat cultivars are involved in a drought tolerance breeding
    trial. Therefore, a non-destructive, rapid, and cost-effective tool is urgently
    needed. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is one of the most promising
    methods for rapid and non-destructive measurement in field conditions. UAV is
    equipped with various imaging sensors, such as multispectral and thermal infrared
    cameras. The reflectance from the multispectral camera is a result of the biochemical,
    physiological, and structural properties of the canopy, and can provide specific
    wavelengths for constructing vegetation indices (VIs) that can be used to evaluate
    crop drought tolerance (Das et al., 2022, Li et al., 2022). The thermal infrared
    camera, which is used to measure canopy temperature, can help to determine crop
    water status since the stomatal closure induced by water deficits reduces the
    transpiration rate and results in a reduction of evaporative cooling and an increase
    in leaf temperature (Kögler and Söffker, 2019). Recently, water stress indices
    based on canopy temperature have been adopted to assess water deficit in crops
    such as wheat (Das et al., 2021). Combining multiple canopy features has proven
    beneficial to crop yield prediction (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2023).
    Since both the multispectral image and the thermal image have been used to assess
    crop drought tolerance, there is a good chance that combining the multispectral
    and thermal images will provide a more informative phenotype than either, thus
    increasing the robustness of crop yield predictions. Therefore, more studies on
    drought-tolerant winter wheat cultivars selection based on UAV multispectral and
    thermal images-extracted image features under water-deficit conditions are in
    great demand. Before extracting image features, the noises, such as soil and shadows,
    which influence canopy information, should be removed from the UAV images. Notably,
    extra attention should be paid to the noise of abnormal temperature rise caused
    by the thermal radiation of bare soil, which may create a thermal affected zone
    (TAZ) around the bare soil. As a result, the canopy temperature in that zone is
    significantly elevated. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has yet to be
    addressed. Roughly, the methods for removing noises can be classified into three
    categories, i.e., fixed threshold-based, dynamic threshold-based, and machine
    learning-based. Generally, the fixed threshold is determined by manually comparing
    differences between crops and backgrounds (Li et al., 2022). As a result, a new
    threshold has to be calculated when the site, time, or irrigation regime is altered.
    In contrast, the dynamic threshold can be determined by using automatic image
    segmentation methods, such as maximum inter-class variance (OTSU), iterative threshold
    selection (ISODATA), maximum entropy (MAXENTROPY), histogram-based thresholding
    (MEAN), minimum error thresholding (MINERROR) and moment-preserving thresholding
    (MOMENTS) (Lu and Lu, 2017, Lu et al., 2022). The automatic image segmentation
    methods are simple and effective, requiring no additional training data. Of all
    these methods, OTSU is most widely used to identify vegetated pixels based on
    images with various VIs such as NDVI (Sun et al., 2021), enhanced normalized difference
    vegetation index (ENDVI) (Das et al., 2021), and excess green minus excess red
    index (ExGR) (Chen and Wang, 2022). However, systematic exploration of the optimal
    combination of automatic image segmentation methods and VIs is yet to be conducted
    to improve the accuracy of rapid noise removal. Machine learning-based methods
    learn the common attributes of objects (crops and backgrounds) in an image and
    classify pixels with the same features into the same category. A representative
    machine learning method for removing noises is support vector machine (SVM) (Maimaitijiang
    et al., 2020). Although machine learning-based methods may yield high accuracy,
    these methods are data-intensive, which is not conducive to efficient noise removal.
    After the image feature extraction, critical features should be selected. The
    feature selection algorithm can eliminate redundant and irrelevant features that
    have a low impact on the evaluation target, thus reducing the dimensionality of
    the dataset. The Relief-F is one of the most widely used feature selection methods,
    which assigns scores to multiple features based on identifying feature value differences
    between nearest-neighbor instance pairs (Afshar and Usefi, 2022). Based on the
    selected features, the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars can be evaluated
    by determining an evaluation target, such as yield or YSI. Many machine learning
    methods, such as random forest (RF), SVM, and deep neural networks, have been
    implemented to predict crop yield (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Wan et al., 2020,
    Ma et al., 2023). However, when the prediction model is generalized to different
    deficit irrigation applications, new yield samples are necessary to calibrate
    the model, resulting in a time lag that does not always meet the requirements
    for rapid evaluation. Instead, multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation methods,
    such as weighted sum based on principal components analysis (PCA-WS) and technique
    for order preference by similarity to ideal solution based on entropy weight (Entropy-TOPSIS),
    have the advantage of merging multiple image features into a comprehensive indicator
    (Aghaie et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2023). In other words, these methods can theoretically
    evaluate the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars without measuring the
    grain yield. Therefore, in-depth investigations are needed on using the multi-criteria
    comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate the drought tolerance of winter wheat
    cultivars. In this study, a drought tolerance evaluation method for winter wheat
    cultivars under water-deficit conditions was proposed using multi-criteria comprehensive
    evaluation and UAV multispectral and thermal images. To improve the accuracy of
    canopy information extraction, this study proposed an automatic image segmentation-based
    noise removal method to eliminate the noise pixels of soil, shadows, and TAZ from
    UAV images. Wheat canopy spectral, texture, and thermal features was extracted,
    which was then used to construct multiple indices to evaluate the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars using PCA-WS, Entropy-TOPSIS, and RF. To the best of
    our knowledge, this study was the first to propose the TAZ and the corresponding
    noise removal method. The specific objectives of this study were (1) to explore
    the optimal combination of automatic image segmentation method and canopy features
    for efficiently removing the noises of soil, shadows, and TAZ, (2) to test the
    accuracy of PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS in evaluating the drought tolerance of winter
    wheat cultivars under water-deficit conditions, and (3) to investigate the yield
    stability of winter wheat cultivars based on PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS. 2. Materials
    2.1. Experimental setup An experiment was conducted at the field station (37°54′16″
    N, 115°42′29″ E) of Dryland Farming Institute, Hebei Academy of Agricultural and
    Forestry Sciences, Hengshui, China (Fig. 1a). The station is located in the winter
    wheat-producing area of the North China Plain and experiences a temperate continental
    monsoon climate. The annual average precipitation is 497.1 mm, 70 % of which happens
    in July and August (Ma et al., 2023). A weather station near the field station
    continuously records the weather data of the 2020–2021 growing season (Fig. 2).
    The cumulative precipitation was 58.1 mm, and only 10.8 mm happened after jointing.
    No frost events occurred after jointing since the daily minimum temperature was
    above 4 °C. From flowering to milk development, the daily maximum temperature
    remained below 30 °C, and there were two rainfall processes with a small amount
    of precipitation and high relative air humidity. Therefore, no high-temperature
    events occurred. Download : Download high-res image (852KB) Download : Download

    (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the web version of this article.) The experimental field was divided
    into 231 plots assigned to seven treatments with three replications for each treatment
    (Fig. 1b). The size of each plot was 1.5 × 6 m. All plots were in the same moist
    soil condition for sowing. 11 winter wheat cultivars were used in each replication
    (Fig. 1c). Supplementary irrigation was conducted for seven treatments, including
    one well-watered treatment (WW, irrigation twice), one rainfed treatment (NW,
    no irrigation), and five deficit water treatments (DW, irrigation once). For the
    WW treatment, the plots were irrigated during jointing and flowering. For the
    DW treatments, irrigation was performed during overwintering (DW1), greenup (DW2),
    jointing (DW3), one week after jointing (DW4), and two weeks after jointing (DW5),
    respectively. For each irrigation, the amount of water was 750 m3/ha. A total
    of 450 kg ha−1 (N: 225, P2O5: 112.5, K2O: 112.5) fertilizer was plowed into the
    topsoil as the base fertilizer before sowing. The sowing date was on October 15,
    2020, and the harvest date was in early June 2021, depending on the developmental
    process of winter wheat cultivars. Diseases, pests, and weeds were managed according
    to local management practices. 2.2. Data acquisition Multispectral images were
    captured using a Phantom 4-Multispectral UAV (P4M, DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen,
    China) with a real-time kinematic (RTK) module (Fig. 1d). The multispectral camera
    has five bands covering the visible, red-edge, and near-infrared regions, with
    the central wavelengths located at 450 nm, 560 nm, 650 nm, 730 nm, and 840 nm.
    The bandwidth of the visible and red-edge bands is 32 nm, and the bandwidth of
    the near-infrared band is 52 nm. Thermal and RGB images were simultaneously acquired
    using a DJI Matrice 200 quadcopter UAV (M200, DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen,
    China) equipped with a radiometric Zenmuse XT2 dual camera of thermal and RGB
    sensor (Fig. 1d). The thermal imager is an Uncooled VOx Microbolometer with a
    19 mm focal length and measures the thermal emissions between the 7.5 and 13.5
    µm spectra in a 9 Hz frame rate. The spatial resolution of the radiometric R-JPEG
    images was 640 × 512 pixels. Each thermal pixel records temperature value in Celsius
    degrees. The RGB sensor provided RGB imagery through a 1/1.7″ CMOS with sizes
    of 12 MP. The UAV flights were conducted on April 28, May 12, and 21, 2021, when
    winter wheat was at the heading, flowering, and grain-filling stages, respectively.
    Each flight was conducted on a clear day with low cloud cover between 10:30 and
    13:00 local time, and automatic exposure was employed during the flight. The altitude
    of the flight was 50 m, resulting in the ground spatial resolution of 2.6 cm for
    the multispectral images, 4.6 cm for the thermal images, and 1.2 cm for the RGB
    images. All images were acquired with a forward overlap of 80 % and a lateral
    overlap of 70 %. During the flight, a gray target with a nominal reflectance value
    of 50 % was placed in the experimental field. The multispectral images of the
    gray target collected simultaneously at the same height were used to perform the
    radiometric correction. In order to geo-reference the UAV images and achieve the
    alignment of the multi-temporal images, this study established ten ground control
    points (GCPs) in the field (Fig. 1b) and recorded the geographic coordinates by
    a handheld GPS. After all the plants reached full maturity, the winter wheat in
    the range of 6 rows and 3 m, covering an area of 3.24 m2, were harvested as samples
    for each plot. The collected grains were kept in netting bags and air-dried to
    a 13 % moisture level before being weighed. Then, the grain yield for each plot
    was calculated as kilograms per plot. Digitization footprint involved all field
    operations, where recorded data were available from different sensors throughout
    the study period. The volumes of average growing-season accumulated data for UAV
    multispectral, RGB, and thermal images were 3979.5 MB/ha, 2239.3 MB/ha, and 704.3
    MB/ha, respectively, followed by 8.3 MB/ha for the meteorological elements and
    3.4 MB/ha for the yield data. 2.3. Data processing 2.3.1. UAV image preprocessing
    The multispectral, thermal, and RGB images from each acquisition date were processed
    using Pix4D mapper software (Pix4D SA, Lausanne, Switzerland), with some essential
    steps such as aligning the camera, importing GCPs and geo-referencing, building
    dense point clouds, generating digital surface models and orthomosaic maps. This
    study used the gray target reflectance images for radiometric calibration of multispectral
    images. The GCPs were used for geometric correction. At last, the orthomosaic
    maps of the multispectral, thermal, and RGB images were generated, respectively.
    2.3.2. Noise removal Since weeds were removed during the experiment, the noises
    in this study mainly consisted of soil, shadows, and the TAZ. This study used
    automatic image segmentation methods based on VI and thermal images to eliminate
    the noise pixels. The workflow for the noise removal method was shown in Fig.

    the noise removal method. The key to removing the soil and shadow pixels from
    the multispectral images was to identify the best combination of the automatic
    image segmentation method and VI. As an example, a sub-image with a pixel resolution
    of 450 × 500 containing wheat, soil, and shadows was cut from the multispectral
    image (Fig. 5a). Three VIs, i.e., NDVI, soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI),
    and normalized difference canopy shadow index (NDCSI), were adopted considering
    the ability to distinguish crops from soil and shadow (Sun et al., 2021, Wang
    et al., 2022, Xu et al., 2019). The calculations for the above VIs were shown
    in (1)-(3). The six image segmentation methods (OTSU, ISODATA, MAXENTROPY, MEAN,
    MINERROR, and MOMENTS) were used to automatically segment the NDVI, SAVI, and
    NDCSI sub-images, respectively. Each method generated a binary sub-image from
    which the winter wheat canopy could be easily identified. In order to evaluate
    the performance of the automatic image segmentation methods, this study used the
    SVM model to segment the multispectral sub-image and adopted the result as the
    segmentation ground truth (Details could be found in Appendix 1). Consequently,
    the confusion matrix could be generated, based on which the F1-score was calculated
    according to (4). The optimal combination of the automatic image segmentation
    method and VI was determined with the maximum F1-score. (1) (2) (3) (4) Where

    between the categories which were extracted respectively from the binary NDVI,
    SAVI, and NDCSI sub-images segmented by the OTSU method. Theoretically, the winter
    wheat canopy obtained from multispectral images could be used to mask the soil
    and shadows in thermal images. However, this would lead to significant errors
    in practice as the multispectral and thermal images were not acquired simultaneously.
    The location, shape, and size of the shadow differed due to changes in the solar
    zenith angle and azimuth. Since the RGB and thermal images were acquired at the
    same time, the RGB image registered with the thermal image was used to automatically
    segment the winter wheat canopy from the soil and shadows in the thermal image.
    A sub-image with 450 × 500 pixel resolution containing wheat, soil, and shadows
    was cut from the RGB image (Fig. 6a). Three color VIs, i.e., excess green index
    (ExG), ExGR, and green–red vegetation index (GRVI), were adopted and calculated
    according to (5) - (10) (Chen and Wang, 2022, Tucker, 1979). (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)

    categories which were extracted from a binary temperature sub-image segmented
    by ISODATA, MAXENTROPY, MEAN, MINERROR, MOMENTS, and OTSU, respectively. The six
    image segmentation methods were used to automatically segment the ExG, ExGR, and
    GRVI sub-images, respectively. The generated binary sub-images were compared with
    the SVM classification result (Appendix 1). Subsequently, the confusion matrix
    was used to calculate the F1-score to evaluate the performance of the six image
    segmentation methods. The optimal combination of the automatic image segmentation
    method and VI was determined with the maximum F1-score. The soil and shadows could
    be masked from the thermal sub-image by overlaying the binary sub-image generated
    by the optimal combination. (3) TAZ removal for thermal images. TAZ was first
    proposed in this study as the noise caused by thermal radiation of the bare soil.
    The higher the soil surface temperature, the stronger the thermal radiation, thus
    causing the expansion of TAZ. If the TAZ extended beyond the bare soil and covered
    the adjacent winter wheat canopy, the temperature of the canopy within the TAZ
    would increase abnormally. Therefore, TAZ should be excluded by determining its
    boundaries. Theoretically, the canopy temperature would gradually decrease with
    an increasing distance to the bare soil till a constant level was reached. Consequently,
    the position where the canopy temperature stabilized was considered the boundaries
    of the TAZ. According to the histograms of the thermal images (Appendix 2), a
    consistent unimodal pattern could be observed from all three thermal images. Therefore,
    the determination of the TAZ boundaries could be achieved by histogram-based threshold
    segmentation. The thermal image was automatically segmented into TAZ and non-TAZ
    using the image segmentation methods. If there was no significant change in the
    canopy temperature of winter wheat in the non-TAZ under the same treatment, the
    segmentation results were considered reasonable. Specifically, the TAZ could be
    recognized by the following steps (Fig. 4). 1) Extract a sub-image from the thermal
    image and segment the into a binary sub-image of TAZ and non-TAZ, respectively,
    using the six image segmentation methods. 2) Repeat the above step for the RGB
    image , which was simultaneously collected with , and obtain a binary sub-image
    of winter wheat and background. Notably, the optimal combination of the automatic
    image segmentation method and RGB-based VI for the segmentation of was determined
    in the Soil and shadows removal for thermal images. Mask the soil and shadows
    of by the overlay of , obtaining a canopy thermal sub-image . Mask the TAZ of
    by the overlay of , obtaining a canopy thermal sub-image of non-TAZ. 3) Explore
    if the influence of TAZ on had been minimized by the equal-width buffer (EWB)
    method. The EWB method created four buffer zones outside the TAZ, each with a
    width of 10 cm. The buffer zones were actually inside the non-TAZ. Extract the
    canopy temperature values in all buffer zones by the overlay of and compare the
    mean canopy temperature between them by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). If the
    temperature differences were insignificant, the image segmentation method for
    identifying TAZ would be appropriate. The optimal method could be determined once
    it produced a minimal temperature difference. In practice, the average temperature
    of the buffer zone closest to the TAZ was consistently higher than that of the
    other buffer zones, and there was no significant temperature difference between
    the other buffer zones since the histogram was unimodal. As long as the temperature
    difference between the buffer zones did not exceed the difference between the
    1st and 99th percentile of the canopy temperature in the non-TAZ excluding buffer
    zones, the image segmentation method was still considered appropriate. Statistically,
    the maximum difference in non-TAZ canopy temperature was approximately 2.2℃ on
    April 28, 2.4℃ on May 12, and 2.3℃ on May 21, respectively. The optimal segmentation
    methods for multispectral and thermal sub-images were further applied to the entire
    images of the experimental field to distinguish winter wheat canopy from soil,
    shadows, and TAZ. Considering the large variations in canopy reflectance and temperature
    among the seven treatments, automatic image segmentation was first conducted for
    each treatment separately. Next, seven binary images generated by the optimal
    segmentation method and multispectral VI were stitched and overlaid with the multispectral
    image, resulting in the extraction of the winter wheat canopy. Seven binary images
    generated by the optimal segmentation method and RGB VI, as well as by the optimal
    segmentation method and temperature, were stitched respectively and overlaid with
    the thermal image, from which winter wheat canopy was extracted. To determine
    if the removal of the TAZ caused a significant decrease in canopy temperature
    for each treatment, a pairwise Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test was performed to compare
    the canopy temperature images with and without the TAZ removed. The significance
    was set to p < 0.05. 3. Methods 3.1. Drought stress tolerance index To represent
    the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars, this study adopted the YSI (Nergui
    et al., 2022), which was calculated using the Formula (11): (11) Where is the
    yield of the cultivar under water stress. is the mean yield of the cultivar of
    the WW treatment. A big value of the YSI is considered as high drought tolerance,
    whereas a low value shows drought susceptibility. 3.2. Canopy feature extraction
    and selection Canopy features in this study included canopy spectral, texture,
    and thermal features. Prior to the canopy spectral feature extraction, canopy
    reflectance was first standardized to reduce the effects of varying illumination
    caused by scattered clouds (Zhang et al., 2012). A total of 18 VIs, which have
    demonstrated good performance in UAV-based crop yield prediction, were extracted
    (Table 1). Table 1. Vegetation indices (VIs) used in this study. Vegetation index

    MSR Modified simple ratio Chen (1996) Texture analysis was used to determine the
    pixel relationship by measuring the frequency of gray-tone changes or color-space
    correlation. As a valuable supplement to spectral and thermal features, texture
    features have improved the accuracy of crop yield prediction (Maimaitijiang et
    al., 2020, Ma et al., 2023). The most widely used texture analysis method is based
    on a gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), which has been used to extract the
    eight texture features, including mean (MEA), variance (VAR), homogeneity (HOM),
    contrast (CON), dissimilarity (DIS), entropy (ENT), second moment (SEM), and correlation
    (COR). The texture features were extracted based on UAV multispectral-based Blue,
    Green, Red, Red-edge, and NIR bands. Since these texture features are single-band
    parameters, they can be used to develop texture indices through a two-band combination
    algorithm (Wang et al., 2021). In this study, texture indices were calculated
    using a combination of simple difference (SD), simple ratio (SR), and normalized
    difference (ND), respectively, and the detailed calculations were as follows.
    A total of 24 texture indices were generated based on the eight texture features.
    (12) (13) (14) Where , and represent difference textural index, ratio textural
    index and normalized difference textural index, respectively, for the m-th texture
    metric. and are the values of the m-th texture metric in the i-th and j-th bands,
    respectively. Notably, a texture feature would be selected if the corresponding
    texture indices achieved the highest positive correlation with the measured YSI.
    Normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT) (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Li
    et al., 2022) and crop stress index (CSI) (Das et al., 2021) are two temperature
    indices used to assess drought stress levels. A higher NRCT or CSI value indicates
    crops under more water stress, resulting in a lower YSI value. Therefore, the
    formulas of NRCT and CSI were transformed to keep aligned with YSI. The transformed
    NRCT (TNRCT) and transformed CSI (TCSI) were calculated using UAV thermal imagery
    by the following formulas. (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) Where is the canopy temperature,
    and represent the maximum and minimum values of the canopy temperature in the
    whole test site, respectively. is the vapor pressure deficit, is the saturated
    vapor pressure of canopy (kPa), and is the vapor pressure in the air (kPa). and
    are the corresponding ambient air temperature (℃) and relative humidity (%), respectively.
    Once the canopy feature extraction was finished, this study used the Relief-F
    algorithm (Afshar and Usefi, 2022) to eliminate redundant and irrelevant features.
    Since the features selected for April 28, May 12, and May 21 were expected to
    be different, only the features simultaneously selected for all three dates would
    be finally selected for evaluating the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars.
    Details could be found in Appendix 3. 3.3. Methods for evaluating drought tolerance
    The PCA-WS, Entropy-TOPSIS, and RF methods were used to evaluate the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars under both rainfed and water-deficit irrigation treatments.
    According to the PCA-WS method, PCA analysis was performed at first, and the score
    and contribution of each key principal component (PC) were determined once the
    eigenvalue of the coefficient matrix of the evaluation indicators was greater
    than 1. Then, the total score (TS) for each cultivar was calculated using the
    following formula. (20) Where is the contribution of the variance explained by
    the n-th PC to the total variance. is the score of the n-th PC. For detailed calculations,
    readers were referred to Aghaie et al. (2018). In the Entropy-TOPSIS method, firstly,
    the entropy weight method was used to determine the weights of the indicators
    for each treatment. Subsequently, the TOPSIS was incorporated with the entropy
    weights to calculate the comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) of each cultivar.
    The formula is as follows. (21) Where and are the distance between the ith evaluated
    solution and the positive and negative ideal solutions. Details about the Entropy-TOPSIS
    can be found in Wang et al. (2023). RF was used as a representative of machine
    learning methods due to its ability to prevent overfitting and its applicability
    in prediction with small sample sizes and a large number of variables (Wan et
    al., 2020). The RF model is based on three user-defined parameters: the number
    of trees, the number of variables as a predictor at each tree, and the minimum
    size in each terminal node. Before applying the above three evaluation methods,
    those selected indices were first normalized using the range standardization method,
    which were then fed into the PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS models to calculate the
    TS and CEI, as well as into the RF model to predict YSI. Furthermore, the samples
    were randomly divided into the training dataset and the test dataset in a ratio
    of 8:2 before running the RF model. The performance of the model was evaluated
    by the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean
    absolute error (MAE). The calculations of RMSE and MAE are shown as follows. (22)
    (23) where and are the measured and predicted values of YSI for sample , respectively;
    is the number of samples. Higher R2 value indicates better model performance and
    data fitting. Lower values of RMSE and MAE suggest better prediction accuracy.
    3.4. Ranking of winter wheat cultivars based on TS, CEI, and predicted YSI Winter
    wheat cultivars were ranked in descending order according to the measured YSI,
    TS, CEI, and predicted YSI, respectively, thus obtaining the top five cultivars
    for each ranking result. The cultivars selected by the TS, CEI, and predicted
    YSI were compared to those selected by the measured YSI, and the consistency ratio
    of the measured YSI with the TS, CEI, and predicted YSI was calculated. The consistency
    ratio represented the overall accuracy of the cultivars selected by the TS, CEI,
    and predicted YSI. 4. Results 4.1. The optimal method for removing soil and shadows
    from UAV multispectral images The sub-images of NDVI, SAVI, and NDCSI were calculated
    from the multispectral images on April 28, May 12, and 21, 2021, respectively.
    Next, these sub-images were automatically segmented using the six image segmentation
    methods. The segmentation accuracy (F1-score in %) verified by SVM-based classification
    results was shown in Table 2. On May 12 and 21, the OTSU method based on the NDCSI
    achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, with an F1-score of 96.6 % and 96.1
    %, respectively. Some examples of the OTSU method on May 12 were shown in Fig.
    5e-5 g. All three indices performed well in distinguishing the winter wheat canopy
    from the soil. However, their performance significantly varied in identifying
    shadows. The shadows identified by NDCSI were closest to those from the SVM classification
    results (Fig. 5d and 5 g), followed by SAVI and NDVI. Almost no canopy shadows
    were detected by NDVI, indicating its inability to remove canopy shadows. On April
    28, the OTSU and the MOMENTS methods based on the SAVI had the highest segmentation
    accuracy with an F1-score of 97 %. According to the mean accuracy of the three
    dates, the NDCSI-based OTSU method was the best among all image segmentation methods,
    achieving an F1-score of 96.5 %. Consequently, OTSU and NDCSI were considered
    the optimal combination for removing soil and shadows from UAV multispectral images.

    soil and shadows from UAV thermal images The ExG, ExGR, and GRVI sub-images were
    calculated from the RGB images registered with the thermal images on April 28,
    May 12, and 21, 2021, respectively, and were then automatically segmented using
    the six image segmentation methods. The accuracy (F1-score in %) verified by the
    SVM-based classification results was shown in Table 3. On April 28, the ExG-based
    MINERROR produced the highest segmentation accuracy, with an F1-score of 95.5
    %. On May 12, MINERROR still had the highest segmentation accuracy based on the
    ExGR and GRVI, achieving an F1-score of 95.9 %. On May 21, the segmentation accuracy
    of the ExGR-based OTSU method was the highest, with an F1-score of 94.9 %. According
    to the mean accuracy of the three dates, the ExGR-based MINERROR method performed
    best among all image segmentation methods, reaching an F1-score of 95 %. Therefore,
    MINERROR and RGB-based ExGR were considered the optimal combination for removing
    soil and shadows from UAV thermal images. An example of the ExGR sub-image segmented
    by the MINERROR method on May 12 was shown in Fig. 6a. Table 3. Segmentation accuracy

    optimal method for removing TAZ from UAV thermal images Based on the six image
    segmentation methods, the thermal sub-images on April 28, May 12, and 21, 2021,
    were automatically segmented into the TAZ and non-TAZ. The mask segmented by MINERROR
    was used to extract the winter wheat canopy from the thermal sub-images. The average
    canopy temperature of the TAZ and the buffer zones was calculated, as shown in
    Fig. 7. The results indicated that the temperature of the TAZ was significantly
    (P < 0.05) higher than that of the buffer zones at different distances. The temperature
    of the 0–10 cm buffer zone was significantly higher than that of the other three
    buffer zones. For the ISODATA, MEAN, and MINERROR methods, the temperature difference
    among the other three buffer zones was not significant (P > 0.05) on April 28
    and May 12 (Fig. 7a and 7b). The maximum temperature differences among all buffer
    zones were 0.66 °C, 0.62 °C, and 0.62 °C on April 28, 0.9 °C, 0.83 °C, and 0.9
    °C on May 12, and 0.84 °C, 0.82 °C, and 1.2 °C on May 21, respectively, which
    were within the temperature range in the non-TAZ excluding buffer zones. Regarding
    the MAXENTROPY, MOMENTS, and OTSU methods, the temperature difference among the
    buffer zones showed a significant difference. The maximum temperature differences
    were 1.78 °C, 4.37 °C, and 4.47 °C on April 28, 3 °C, 5.32 °C, and 4.89 °C on
    May 12, and 1.7 °C, 2.77 °C, and 2.65 °C on May 21, respectively. The MEAN method
    produced the smallest difference among the buffer zones, with a temperature range
    of 0.62 to 0.83 °C. Therefore, the MEAN method was considered the optimal segmentation
    method for removing the TAZ from UAV thermal images. Examples of the six image
    segmentation methods on May 12 were displayed in Fig. 6b–6 g. The TAZ identified
    by the ISODATA, MEAN, and MINERROR methods were broader and contained more winter
    wheat canopy pixels than those identified by the MAXENTROPY, MOMENTS, and OTSU
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (272KB) Download : Download full-size

    this study compared the mean canopy temperature before (Fig. 8, gray boxes) and
    after (Fig. 8, pink boxes) the TAZ removal. The MWU test indicated that the TAZ
    removal caused a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in canopy temperature to both
    the well-watered and water-deficit treatments (Fig. 8). Besides, the lower standard
    deviation after removing the TAZ indicated a smaller difference between samples.

    4.4. Drought tolerance evaluation on winter wheat cultivars As expected, the number
    of selected features for April 28, May 12, and May 21 was 23, 33, and 34, respectively,
    while the number of features simultaneously selected for all three dates was seven,
    seven, and one (Appendix 3). The seven VIs were RVI, NDVI, GRVI, EVI2, WDRVI,
    IPVI, and MSR. The seven texture indices were DTI1, RTI1, NDTI1, RTI2, NDTI2,
    RTI4, and NDTI4. The thermal index was TCSI. These features were finally used
    to calculate TS and CEI, as well as to predict YSI. The linear fitting results
    between the TS and measured YSI showed a significant difference in TS-based drought
    tolerance evaluation accuracy across the treatments (Table 4). The highest accuracy
    was achieved by the DW5 treatment on May 12, with an R2 of 0.637, while the lowest
    accuracy was observed by the DW2 treatment on May 21, with an R2 of 0.109, indicating
    no significant linear relationship (P > 0.05). Except for the DW2 on May 21, TS
    maintained a significant linear correlation with the measured YSI. A significant
    (P < 0.001) relationship was established in DW5, NW, DW1 (on May 12 and 21), and
    DW3 (on April 28). Similar to the TS, the linear relationship between the CEI
    and measured YSI also showed significant differences among the treatments (Table
    4). The maximum R2 of 0.636 was achieved by DW5 on May 21, while the minimum R2
    was 0.139, which was observed by the DW2 on May 12. CEI was significantly correlated
    with the measured YSI over all the water deficit treatments. The greatest significance
    (P < 0.001) was by DW5, followed by NW, DW1 (on May 12 and 21), and DW3 (on May
    12 and 21). In general, the correlation between the CEI and the measured YSI was
    slightly stronger than that between the TS and measured YSI, except for the DW5
    (on April 28 and May 12) and DW2 (on April 28). Table 4. Coefficient of determination

    that the linear fitting model reached significance levels of 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001,
    respectively. The RF model accurately predicted the YSI on April 28, May 12, and
    21, 2021 (Table 5). The highest accuracy for the training dataset occurred on
    May 21, with an R2 of 0.937, an RMSE of 0.039, and an MAE of 0.032, and the highest
    accuracy for the test dataset occurred on May 12, with an R2 of 0.674, an RMSE
    of 0.078, and an MAE of 0.06. Next, the predicted YSI was fitted to the measured
    YSI for each water stress treatment, achieving a significant linear relationship
    (Table 4, P < 0.001). The significance of the DW1 and DW5 treatments on May 12
    was the strongest of the three dates, with an R2 of 0.938 and 0.901, respectively.
    For NW, DW2, DW3, and DW4, the strongest significance was on May 21, with an R2

    YSI and measured YSI was more significant than that between the TS and measured

    of winter wheat cultivars based on the TS, CEI and predicted YSI Winter wheat
    cultivars were ranked in descending order according to the measured YSI, TS, CEI,
    and predicted YSI, respectively. The cultivars selected by the TS, CEI, and predicted
    YSI were compared with those selected by the measured YSI. Of the top five cultivars,
    the consistency ratio of the cultivars selected by the TS, CEI, and predicted
    YSI was calculated (Fig. 9). The consistency ratio was between 60 % and 100 %
    for the predicted YSI, while it was between 60 % and 80 % for the TS and CEI,
    respectively. The predicted YSI demonstrated a higher cultivar screening accuracy
    than the TS and CEI for all water-deficit treatments on May 21, 2021, as well
    as the DW1 treatment on April 28 and May 12 and the DW3 treatment on April 28.

    for UAV multispectral and thermal images It is well known that soil and shadow
    are the primary sources of noise in the application of UAV multispectral and thermal
    images in agricultural fields, which also influence the drought tolerance evaluation
    of winter wheat cultivars in this study (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). In addition, this study
    proposed the concept of TAZ for the first time and considered it another source
    of noise from the UAV thermal images. The abnormal increase in canopy temperature
    (Fig. 7) within the TAZ suggested that the noise should not be ignored. In Das
    et al. (2021), crop canopies were first segmented from the noise using the OTSU
    method based on VIs calculated from multispectral images and then registered to
    the thermal image to mask the noise in the thermal image. In this study, the multispectral
    and thermal images were not acquired simultaneously since the multispectral and
    thermal cameras were mounted on different UAVs. Therefore, the winter wheat canopy
    extracted from the RGB image rather than the multispectral image was used to mask
    the soil and shadows from the thermal image. Despite the image type, the high
    noise removal performance depends on the selected image segmentation methods and
    VIs and could improve the accuracy of feature extraction. This study systematically
    compared the accuracy of the six image segmentation methods based on NDVI, SAVI,
    and NDCSI from multispectral images, as well as ExG, ExGR, and GRVI from RGB images.
    For multispectral images, the NDCSI-based OTSU had the highest average accuracy,
    with an F1-score value of 96.9 % on April 28, 96.6 % on May 12, and 96.1 % on
    May 21, respectively (Table 2). Since NDCSI was specifically developed for shadow
    identification (Xu et al., 2019), it performed best in segmenting shadows (Fig.
    5g), followed by SAVI (Fig. 5f) and NDVI (Fig. 5e). For RGB images, the average
    accuracy of the ExGR-based MINERROR was the highest, with an F1 score of 95.1
    % on April 28, 95.9 % on May 12, and 94 % on May 21, respectively (Table 3). ExGR
    has been proven effective in extracting crops from soil background (Chen and Wang,
    2022) and performed better than ExG and GRVI (Meyer and Neto, 2008). Although
    the OTSU was the most widely used image segmentation method for removing soil
    background, it was not always the best for removing both soil and shadows. The
    selected VI significantly impacted accuracy, which also applied to other automatic
    image segmentation methods. To assess the impact of soil thermal radiation on
    winter wheat canopy temperature, this study used the six image segmentation methods
    to segment the thermal images (Fig. 6). The TAZs identified by the ISODATA, MEAN,
    and MINERROR methods (Fig. 6b, 6d, and 6e) were found to be larger than those
    identified by the MAXENTROPY, MOMENTS, and OTSU methods (Fig. 6c, 6f, and 6 g).
    Besides, the average canopy temperature among the buffer zones showed a significant
    difference (Fig. 7). The maximum temperature difference was 5.32℃, which was produced
    by the MOMENTS method, followed by 4.89℃ by the OTSU method, 3.0℃ by the MAXENTROPY
    method, 1.2℃ by the MINERROR method, 0.9℃ by the ISODATA method, and 0.83℃ by
    the MEAN method. The TAZ boundaries identified by the MINERROR, ISODATA, and MEAN
    methods were reasonable as they produced a maximum temperature difference that
    did not exceed the temperature range within the non-TAZ excluding buffer zones.
    Of the three segmentation methods, the MEAN method had the smallest temperature
    difference and was therefore recommended as the optimal method to remove TAZ.
    To determine the necessity of removing the TAZ, this study compared the canopy
    temperature before and after the removal of the TAZ and found that the TAZ removal
    caused a significant decrease in canopy temperature for all treatments (Fig. 8).
    This result indicated that the abnormal increase in canopy temperature in the
    TAZ was caused by soil thermal radiation rather than water deficit, thus probably
    resulting in a deviation from the actual canopy temperature under water-deficit
    conditions. Therefore, the TAZ should be excluded to improve the accuracy of feature
    extraction from the thermal images. The winter wheat canopy information extracted
    from the multispectral or RGB images was unable to mask this noise. The temperature-based
    MEAN method proved to be the best solution. 5.2. Rapid evaluation on drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars Previous studies used features extracted from UAV multispectral
    and thermal images to predict biomass or yield, based on which drought stress
    tolerance indices could be calculated and ranked the crop cultivars. For example,
    Das et al. (2022) developed a drought stress tolerance index (DSTI) and proved
    that it was closely related to the actual water use efficiency of wheat genotypes,
    with an R2 of 0.68, suggesting that DSTI-based rankings can help farmers select
    drought-tolerant wheat genotypes in a sodic soil environment. Based on the biomass
    predicted by UAV-derived canopy structure, reflectance, and thermal features,
    Li et al. (2022) calculated two drought tolerance indices, i.e., geometric mean
    productivity (biomass-GMP) and biomass-YSI, and assessed the drought tolerance
    of bioenergy sorghum under water-stressed conditions. By verification, both indices
    achieved significant linear correlations with the measured values, with an R2
    of 0.59 and 0.21, respectively. It should be noted that the performance of the
    drought tolerance indices depends on the accuracy of biomass or yield prediction
    models, which is similar to the YSI prediction using the RF model in this study.
    It is challenging to guarantee similar high accuracy in different fields without
    measured samples. However, using measured samples will result in a time lag in
    evaluating drought tolerance. Therefore, multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation
    methods, such as PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS, offer a potential solution. The R2
    values of the TS and CEI with the measured YSI were significantly lower than those
    with the predicted YSI (Table 4), indicating a lower accuracy of PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS
    than RF in evaluating the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars. However,
    PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS were still capable of evaluating the drought tolerance
    of winter wheat cultivars, as the linear models reached a significant (P < 0.05)
    level (except DW2 on May 21 for PCA-WS). Similar to the RF, PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS
    could quantify the degree of drought tolerance of each cultivar and achieve the
    ranking, which was undoubtedly necessary for comparing drought tolerance among
    cultivars. For instance, Aghaie et al. (2018) used the PCA-WS to obtain the contributions
    and scores of PC1 and PC2 from the growth and physiological parameters of fourteen
    tomato cultivars and calculate the “ranking value”, namely TS, of each cultivar
    under mild and severe drought stress conditions. The results indicated that the
    drought tolerance evaluated by the PCA-WS was highly consistent with the four
    drought tolerance categories defined by hierarchical clustering analysis. The
    Entropy-TOPSIS method has not been applied for drought tolerance evaluation. However,
    it has been widely used to identify the optimal irrigation mode for balancing
    yield, quality, and water use efficiency (Wang et al., 2023), which belongs to
    the category of multi-target comprehensive evaluation rather than the multi-criteria
    comprehensive evaluation in this study. When yield-based drought tolerance indicators
    such as YSI are used as an evaluation target, no parameters for PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS
    methods need to be determined. Therefore, the drought tolerance evaluation of
    winter wheat cultivars based on UAV images can be performed at any time and in
    any field during the winter wheat growth period. In this study, the R2 of the
    linear model between the CEI and the measured YSI was slightly higher than that
    between the TS and measured YSI under most water deficit treatments (Table 4).
    However, the consistency ratio of the top five winter wheat cultivars ranked by
    the TS and CEI remained consistent (Fig. 9). The results revealed that Entropy-TOPSIS
    did not exhibit a higher accuracy than PCA-WS in selecting stable-yield cultivars.
    In the future, more studies will be conducted to verify their accuracy. The fusion
    of canopy spectral, texture, thermal, and structural features from UAV images
    is cutting-edge research for crop yield prediction under different irrigations
    in recent years (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2023). Canopy structure
    features mainly include canopy coverage and plant height (Wan et al., 2020, Li
    et al., 2022). This study calculated the canopy coverage and found that the correlation
    coefficients with the measured YSI were 0.133, 0.221, and 0.334 on April 28, May
    12, and 21, respectively, which were much lower than those of the other features
    (Fig. A2, Fig. A3, and Table A1 in the Appendix 3). The plant height is usually
    calculated by subtracting the digital terrain model from the digital surface model.
    To generate the digital terrain model of the bare soil, UAV flight campaigns need
    to be conducted before seedlings emerge (Wan et al., 2020). This study also measured
    the plant height manually. The correlation coefficients between plant height and
    measured YSI were 0.138, 0.589, and 0.573 on April 28, May 12, and 21, respectively,
    which appeared to be higher than the canopy coverage. Although canopy coverage
    could be quickly extracted, it remained of low importance. While plant height
    had a higher correlation with the measured YSI, it was not suitable for rapid
    evaluation of drought tolerance in field conditions. Therefore, canopy coverage
    and plant height were not considered in this study. 6. Conclusions Soil, shadow,
    and TAZ were considered noises influencing UAV image feature extraction in this
    study. The NDCSI-based OTSU method achieved the highest segmentation accuracy
    in removing soil and shadows from UAV multispectral images, with an average F1-score
    of 96.5 %. Based on the registered RGB and thermal images, the ExGR-based MINIRROR
    and temperature-based MEAN methods were chosen since the former was with an average
    F1-score of 95 % in removing soil and shadows, while the latter resulted in the
    smallest canopy temperature difference between buffer zones in removing TAZ. The
    PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS transformed canopy spectral, texture, and thermal features
    into a single index (TS and CEI) to evaluate the drought tolerance of winter wheat
    cultivars under both rain-fed and water-deficit treatments. Although less accurate
    than the RF method, they were more straightforward and efficient, allowing rapid
    drought tolerance evaluation as soon as UAV images were obtained from any field.
    The top five cultivars ranked by the TS and CEI showed the same consistency ratios
    of 60 %–80 %, indicating that the PCA-WS and Entropy-TOPSIS should be equally
    preferred in the drought tolerance of winter wheat cultivars. CRediT authorship

    Appendix 1. Generation of the segmentation ground truth using the SVM The segmentation
    ground truth of the sub-images by the SVM could be achieved by the following steps.
    (1) Extract the canopy spectral, texture, and color features and select samples
    from the sub-images to construct the training dataset. The label for a sample
    in the training dataset was background or wheat canopy. (2) Build the SVM classification
    model and train the model using the training dataset. (3) Use the trained SVM
    model to segment the sub-images, thus achieving the wheat canopy images. (4) Randomly
    select independent test samples and test the performance of the SVM models. Based
    on the above steps, the SVM model achieved an overall accuracy of over 99.3 %
    and a Kappa coefficient of over 0.98 on April 28, May 12, and 21 for the multispectral
    image, and an overall accuracy of over 99.4 % and a Kappa coefficient of over
    0.99 on April 28, May 12, and 21 for the RGB image. Appendix 2. Histograms of

    of the measured YSI with original reflectance-based VIs (Red line) and normalized
    reflectance-based VIs (Blue line). A significant positive correlation between
    VIs and the measured YSI was found, regardless of whether the VIs were calculated
    by the original or normalized reflectance. Appendix 3. Feature selection for drought
    tolerance evaluation The 18 VIs were calculated using the original and normalized
    canopy reflectance, respectively, and then employed for correlation analysis with
    the measured YSI (Fig. A2). The results indicated a significant positive correlation
    between VIs and the measured YSI, regardless of whether the VIs were calculated
    by the original or normalized reflectance. Moreover, by standardizing canopy reflectance,
    the correlation was enhanced on April 28 for the VIs of MCARI/OSAVI, MCARI, OSAVI,
    MSAVI, SAVI, DVI, and EVI2. Among them, MCARI/OSAVI and MCARI were also improved
    on May 12 and 21. Texture indices based on the three two-band combination algorithms
    were calculated for each texture metric and were used for correlation analysis
    with the measured YSI. The texture indices with the highest correlation coefficient
    were displayed in Table A1. All texture indices showed a significant positive
    correlation with the measured YSI, regardless of the band combinations. Further
    analysis revealed that most texture indices were based on the combination of red
    and near-infrared bands. The two temperature indices, TNRCT and TCSI, were calculated
    for correlation analysis with the measured YSI (Fig. A3). The results showed that
    they were significantly positively correlated with the measured YSI and produced
    the highest correlation coefficient on May 21, followed by May 12 and April 28.
    The correlation coefficient of the TNRCT was slightly higher than that of the
    TCSI. Based on the VIs, texture indices, and temperature indices, the Relief-F
    algorithm was used to select the most appropriate indices. The number of selected
    indices was 23, 33, and 34 on April 28, May 12 and 34 on May 21, respectively.
    The intersection of the indices on the three dates included seven VIs, seven texture
    indices, and one temperature index. The seven VIs were RVI, NDVI, GRVI, EVI2,
    WDRVI, IPVI, and MSR. The seven texture indices were DTI1, RTI1, NDTI1, RTI2,
    NDTI2, RTI4, and NDTI4. The temperature index was TCSI. These indices were finally
    used to calculate TS and CEI, as well as to predict YSI. Table A1. Correlation

  description: Precision agricultural (PrA) technology relies on the utilization of
    special equipment to access real time observations on plant health status, chlorophyll,
    nitrogen content, and soil moisture content. In this research new PrA technology
    (i.e., SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development), and UAV-based NDVI (Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were used to monitor maize
    yield based on different filed trials in eastern part of Hungary. Our study aimed
    to examine the utilization of PrA technology specifically SPAD and UAV-based NDVI
    measurements for monitoring maize GY under irrigated and rainfed experimental
    setups in Hungary with varied nitrogen treatment for the year 2022. The results
    showed that the SPAD increased in all treatments (14.7 %; p < 0.05) from V6–V8
    in the rainfed treatments, decreased significantly (p < 0.05) by 13.9 % (R1) and
    30.6 % (R3). However, implementation of irrigation significantly increased the
    SPAD values in majority of treatments. Also, results reveal that, under irrigated
    and rainfed conditions the highest UAV-based NDVI value (0.703, 0.642) was obtained
    in V12 (A120 treatment) and highest NDVI value (0.728, 0.662) was obtained in
    Vn (A120 treatment). Remarekedly, irrigation led to significant differences (p
    < 0.05) of UAV-based NDVI values compared with none irrigated. On the other hand,
    implementation of 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing led to highest GY, especially under
    irrigated conditions (8.649 Mg ha−1). The overall mean GY under rainfed treatment
    was 6.256 Mg ha−1, while under irrigated treatment it increased by 37.2 % and
    reached 8.581 Mg ha−1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, PrA technology will support farmers

    • SPAD and UAV- based NDVI proved to be efficient for monitoring maize yield.
    • R3 maize growth stage had the highest correlation of UAV-NDVI with N-fertilization
    and GY. • 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing is recommended to achieve highest UAV-NDVI
    and GY, under irrigated conditions. Abstract Precision agricultural (PrA) technology
    relies on the utilization of special equipment to access real time observations
    on plant health status, chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and soil moisture content.
    In this research new PrA technology (i.e., SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development),
    and UAV-based NDVI (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index) were used to monitor maize yield based on different filed trials in eastern
    part of Hungary. Our study aimed to examine the utilization of PrA technology
    specifically SPAD and UAV-based NDVI measurements for monitoring maize GY under
    irrigated and rainfed experimental setups in Hungary with varied nitrogen treatment
    for the year 2022. The results showed that the SPAD increased in all treatments
    (14.7 %; p < 0.05) from V6–V8 in the rainfed treatments, decreased significantly
    (p < 0.05) by 13.9 % (R1) and 30.6 % (R3). However, implementation of irrigation
    significantly increased the SPAD values in majority of treatments. Also, results
    reveal that, under irrigated and rainfed conditions the highest UAV-based NDVI
    value (0.703, 0.642) was obtained in V12 (A120 treatment) and highest NDVI value
    (0.728, 0.662) was obtained in Vn (A120 treatment). Remarekedly, irrigation led
    to significant differences (p < 0.05) of UAV-based NDVI values compared with none
    irrigated. On the other hand, implementation of 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing led
    to highest GY, especially under irrigated conditions (8.649 Mg ha−1). The overall
    mean GY under rainfed treatment was 6.256 Mg ha−1, while under irrigated treatment
    it increased by 37.2 % and reached 8.581 Mg ha−1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, PrA
    technology will support farmers in making informed decisions regarding fertilization
    strategies and timing, which will in turn maximize yield and minimize risk. Graphical

    performanceHungary 1. Introduction Maize is the second most widely grown crop
    globally after wheat and is a key component of animal feed playing a significant
    role in global agri-food systems and securing nutrition [[1], [2], [3]]. The global
    maize production accounts for 197 million ha majorly in Latin America, Asia, and
    Sub-Saharan Africa [2]. Europe is also reported to be a good contributor for maize
    in terms of increasing yield from past two decades [4] sharing 11 % of the world''s
    maize production [2]. The three major crops i.e., wheat, maize, and rice provide
    30% of the dietary calories for more than 4.5 billion people in 94 developing
    countries [5]. With projected world population growth, increasing demand for food
    products and changing diets, increasing the yield, yield stability and quality
    of maize is of key importance [6,7]. The situation is complicated by the loss
    of arable land [8] and increasingly extreme environmental conditions due to climate
    change [[9], [10], [11]]. Numerous climatic extremes including heat stress and
    drought conditions leads to a reduction in cereal grain filling by reducing the
    spikelet fertility and increasing the rate of transpiration ultimately causing
    a significant decline in cereal yield [12]. Frequent occurrence of droughts and
    high temperatures lowers the moisture content, offset the maize plant growth unless
    provided with sufficient irrigation supported with fertilization [13]. It is expected
    that by 2050, there would be a 20 % decline in maize yield under projected climatic
    scenarios of global warming and drought stress [14]. A critical cultivation technology
    component of maize GY improvement is a balanced nutrient supply, with especial
    regard to N-supply [15,16], as it is an essential element of plant biochemical
    and physiological processes [[17], [18], [19]]. Applying the appropriate quantity
    of N fertilizer can help GY growth [20], but applying excessive amounts is wasteful,
    increases costs [21], does not improve GY, impairs water balance, and might cause
    nitrate pollution [22]. Monitoring maize GY largely depends on the reliable information
    about maize leaf chlorophyll content during the growing season that is much needed
    for appropriate application of N-fertilization in plant without environmental
    damage [23,24]. Chlorophyll is the photosynthetic pigment of the plant, playing
    a central role in light absorption, energy conversion and organic synthesis in
    plants [25]. Since chlorophyll content is closely related and correlated with
    leaf nitrogen concentration, and an important indicator for monitoring plant nitrogen
    status, development, growth, and GY [26]. It also provide an opportunity to schedule
    nitrogen fertilizer application and determine the optimal amount [27]. The use
    of PrA technology (refers to an information technology (IT) based farm management
    system) in this regard is indispensable in all types of environmental conditions
    [28]. PrA technology relies on the utilization of special equipment, sensor devices,
    real time kinematic (RTK) and un-named aerial vehicles (UAVs) to access real time
    observations on plant health status, chlorophyll, nitrogen, and soil moisture
    content [29]. Optical sensor devices like Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD)
    meter are cost effective and non-destructive handled PrA technology used to monitor
    in situ plant fertilization or N status to assist improving GY prediction [30].
    The SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter is based on the radiation absorption in leaves
    in the red (R) (650 nm) and near-infrared (NIR) (940 nm) range. The 650 or red
    wavelength is correlated with the chlorophyll content in the leaf while 940 or
    NIR provides the detail of leaf moisture content and plant thickness [31]. Previously,
    it has been used in various studies as a PrA tool for effective farm management
    and GY improvement [32]. The relative chlorophyll content values at leaf level
    measured by the instrument are closely related to the leaf N-value and total chlorophyll
    concentration at different developmental stages, as confirmed by numerous researchers
    [16,33]. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multispectral remote sensing technology
    is more advanced PrA technology widely used to extract phenophase information,
    leaf area index (LAI), carotenoid estimation, and SPAD prediction [34,35]. A brief
    review of similar recent applications of PrA technology in different crop management
    practices are presented in Table 1. Table 1. A review of recent studies with PrA
    applications in agricultural management practices. Crops/plants PrA tool Objective

    UAV-NDVI, and RENDVI under different nitrogen treatments at plot level RENDVI
    camera performed better than NDVI in SPAD predictions [44] The optical and thermal
    infrared sensors of UAVs are capable to derive several vegetation indices like
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge
    index (NDRE) used to estimate the biomass, chlorophyll, and nitrogen content,
    and predict crop yields in high spatial resolution [44] with flexibility, rapid
    and non-destructive diagnosis [45,46]. It is profitable and cost-effective [47],
    but this can only be achieved by the optimal timing of surveys [48]. However,
    monitoring and measuring the plant chlorophyll and fertilization status from PrA
    technology largely depends on soil moisture content sourced by rainfall in natural
    and irrigation in human developed scenarios [40,49]. Irrigation is a key factor
    that influences the photosynthetic performance of maize due to severe water stress,
    which otherwise can greatly reduce the relative chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis,
    resulting in significant GY loss [50]. Formerly, studies have proven the application
    of SPAD and UAV PrA technology for monitoring GY under stressed and non-stressed
    environment [41,51,52]. For instance, a few studies reported the use of SPAD and
    UAV based measurements for sun-induced chlorophyll and grain yield measurements
    in particular experimental setup in Europe as well [53,54]. Hungary, from central
    Europe experienced moderate to severe drought spells in recent past years with
    unprecedented impacts on maize and wheat yield [[55], [56], [57]]. Specifically,
    the recent drought year of 2022 is well recognized in research [58,59] to cause
    agriculture drought and impact grain yield. In this context, our study aimed to
    examine the utilization of PrA technology specifically SPAD and UAV-based NDVI
    measurements for monitoring maize GY under irrigated and rainfed experimental
    setups in Hungary with varied nitrogen treatment for the year 2022. Specifically,
    we analyzed the correlation between different levels of basal nitrogen and top-dressing
    treatments, irrigation, and chlorophyll content using spectral values (SPAD, UAV-based
    NDVI). It facilitated determining the required amount of N, the timing of its
    application and the influence of irrigation for achieving higher GY. Overall,
    the output of this research provides an effective utilization of PrA technology
    for grain yield monitoring proposing an optimistic future for farm management
    under drought and non-drought conditions to maximize the GY. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Experimental site This research was carried out in central Europe
    within the research station of the University of Debrecen (47° 33′ N, 21° 26′
    E, altitude 111 m) (Fig. 1). The experiment was conducted using factorial design,
    with two-replicate. The main plots were set up with three hybrids (Merida, Armagnac,
    Fornad), split-plots with irrigation (rainfed, irrigated) and split-split-plots
    with nitrogen treatment doses. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    Debrecen; B: layout of the basal and top-dressing nitrogen treatment experiment,
    established by A. Széles, 2011). 2.2. Soil data The soil of the experiment can
    be characterized with high clay loam content (42 %) with humic layer (80–100 cm),
    and medium-compaction, and can be classified as lowland calcareous chernozem (Mollisol-Calciustoll
    or Vermustoll, USDA). The average pHKCl is 6.6 and nitrogen N-supply of the soil
    is medium (humus content: 2.6 %, total N = 0.14–0.18 %). The soil is calcareous
    in the upper 80 cm, but moderately calcareous (12 %) from 100 cm. The original
    AL-soluble P2O5 content of the soil is 130 mg/kg and the AL-soluble K2O content
    is 240 mg/kg. 2.3. Experimental design Before sowing, 27 % Genesis CAN (calcium
    ammonium nitrate) was applied. To meet the factorial design, the nitrogen rates
    were split between basal and top-dressing treatments. All nitrogen doses and period
    are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Nitrogen treatments and period for the factorial

    drought in Hungary, irrigation was considered as the second factor. Thus, plots
    were split to irrigated and none irrigated (rainfed). The total irrigation water
    applied was 115 mm, broken down as follows: 25 mm (21st May); 30 mm (13-16th June);
    30 mm (3rd July) and 30 mm (16th July). The maize was sown on 14.04.2022 and harvested
    on 05.10.2022; the plant density was 73 thousand plants/ha. The evaluation was
    carried out using two maize hybrids of the medium maturity group (FAO 400–499).
    Harvested yield GY (t ha−1) was indicated by correcting it for 14 % moisture.
    2.4. An outlook of climate conditions during the experiment In the first month
    of the growing season (April), rainfall was in line with the average for the reference
    period (1981–2010) (54 mm), while temperatures were 2.2 °C lower. Rainfall in
    May and June was 10 mm and 19 mm respectively, only 15 and 29 % of the multiannual
    average (Fig. 2). This was coupled with mean temperatures in May and June that
    were 1 °C and 2.9 °C above the multi-year average. The drought continued in July
    (21 mm) and August (28 mm), and the situation was exacerbated by the fact that
    the monthly mean temperatures for these two months were 2.1 °C and 2.7 °C above
    the multi-year average. September received the highest rainfall (162 mm), more
    than three times of average. (Fig. 2). Overall, the climatic conditions for the
    growing season 2022 (April–September) deviated from the climatic data for the
    reference period (1981–2010). The rainfall of the growing season was below the
    multi-year average (294 mm), accounting for 85 % of the average, and was characterised
    by an inappropriate temporal distribution. The mean temperature was 1 °C above
    the multi-year average (18.5 °C). Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download

    The temporal pattern of rainfall during the growing season (from sowing to harvesting)
    and the daily mean temperature trends are shown in Fig. 3. Of the 35 days with
    rainfall, 23 days were below 10 mm and 9 days were above 10 mm. Rainfall exceeding
    20 mm was recorded on 3 days. Reflecting the extreme weather conditions, maize
    water requirements at flowering stage (R1) were 4.5–5.5 mm/ha per day, while there
    was only 3 mm of rainfall during the 31 days between phenophases V8 and R1, and
    average temperature also increased significantly (23.7 °C). Between phenophases
    R1-R3, there was 21 mm rainfall with an average temperature of 22.8 °C. Significant
    rainfall occurred after the R6 phenophase (146 mm). Download : Download high-res

    and daily mean temperature trends from sowing to harvest. Hence, Due to less rainfall
    and prevailing drought conditions during the growing season and the unique challenges
    posed by this specific climatic context, a one-year experimental duration was
    deemed fitting to comprehensively capture the impact of varied nitrogen treatments
    in rainfed and irrigated experimental setups. 2.5. PrA instruments and test methods
    2.5.1. The SPAD-502 A Minolta SPAD-502 portable device (Minolta Camera Ltd., Osaka,
    Japan) was used for the non-destructive assessment of leaf chlorophyll content
    [60]. The illumination system of the device contains two photodiodes, one red
    (max 650 nm) and one infrared (max. 940 nm). The two photodiodes emit light alternately
    with equal brightness. The illuminated area is 6 mm2. The two types of light pass
    through the leaf plate and some of it is reflected (reflection), some is absorbed
    (absorption) while the rest penetrates the leaf (transmission). The light that
    penetrates the leaf is picked up by a sensor consisting of a silicone photodiode
    and converted into an analogue electrical signal. The instrument amplifies the
    electrical signal and converts it into a number. The calculation is based on the
    ratio of the intensity of the infrared and red light passing through the leaf.
    The higher the ratio, the more red light is absorbed by the leaves of the plant,
    which is closely related to the chlorophyll content. The SPAD value can range
    from 0 to over 100 [61,62]. SPAD measurements were performed in the phonological
    phases V6, V8, V12, Vn, R1 and R3. Measurements were taken per hybrid per Nitrogen
    treatment, on the 6th, 7th, and 8th plants of the second left row of each plot.
    Between V6 and R1 phenophase on the latest released fully developed leaf, between
    R1-R6 phenophase on the leaf at the ear [63]. 2.5.2. UAV/drone image acquisition
    The UAV-NDVI measurements were performed using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2 drone equipped
    with Sentera Double 4K TrueNDVI and TrueNDRE sensors [64] in six phenophases (V6,
    V8, V12, Vn, R1, R3) simultaneously with the SPAD measurements. The flying height
    was set to 80 m. The precise plot boundaries were determined by another PrA instrument
    i.e., Trimble RTK [65]. All georeferenced UAV images were stitched to make orthomosaic
    with a spatial resolution of 2 cm in open source WebODM program for further analysis
    [66]. The other products developed included digital surface model (DSM) and digital
    terrain model (DTM) which were not used in analysis. The orthorectified photos
    were further processes in open source QGIS environment for NDVI measurements.
    For accurate channels (wavelengths) separation, a set of equations were used to
    subtract out the effect of the out of band channels [64]. These includes eq (1)),
    2), and 3): (1) (2) (3) The resulting NDVI images were analyzed in the QGIS environment
    to calculate mean NDVI of each plot using “zonal statistics” function. 2.6. Statistical
    analysis First, the effects of nitrogen treatments on SPAD and UAV-NDVI for irrigated
    and rainfed conditions are examined in Box-plot distribution plots with significant
    *p < 0.5; **p < 0.1; ***p < 0.001 mean difference plotting from Duncan''s test
    in OriginLab [67]. Multivariate factorial analysis of variance ANOVA from generalized
    linear model (GLM) was used to examine the effects of nitrogen treatments, irrigation,
    and hybrid on GY. The comparison of mean values of different treatment practices
    were analyzed using Duncan multiple range test (DMRT) [68] to avoid the accumulation
    of first-order error. The DMRT is a post-hoc statistical analysis to examine the
    significant differences between various treatments of an experimental setup [69].
    It significantly compares the means of all possible pairs of different treatment
    groups. Currently, DMRT is employed in different nitrogen treatments to evaluate
    the pairwise difference in rainfed and irrigated conditions. Within the homogeneous
    group, the grain yields did not differ at 5 % significance level. Furthermore,
    the significant relationship of nitrogen treatment with SPAD and NDVI values were
    examined by parabolic (quadratic) regression analysis. The independent variable
    was nitrogen treatment, and the dependent variables were SPAD and UAV-NDVI. The
    significant relationship was evaluated based on coefficient of determination (R2).
    The correlation between SPAD and grain yield, and UAV-NDVI and grain yield were
    analyzed using bivariate linear regression analysis. The independent variables
    were SPAD and UAV-NDVI, and the dependent variable was grain yield. Here also,
    the significant relationship was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination
    (r2). The statistical evaluation was performed using the latest version of the
    R environment and results are plotted in OriginLab. 3. Results 3.1. Effect of
    nitrogen treatment and irrigation on studied maize indicators During the growing
    season, the SPAD values varied from 23.0 to 48.4 in the rainfed treatment and
    from 24.4 to 51.8 in the irrigated treatment. Under natural rainfall conditions,
    the average SPAD value was 38.5, while under irrigated conditions it was 40.2.
    The highest SPAD values during the whole growing season were obtained under natural
    rainfall conditions with treatment A60 (40.3; p < 0.05) and under irrigated conditions
    with treatment V6150 (45.5; p < 0.05), which resulted in an increase of 18.5 %
    and 39.6 %, respectively, compared to treatment A0 (Fig. 4, Table 3). Download

    value increased in the V6–V8 phenophase period in the rainfed treatment but varied
    upon nitrogen treatment. The most significant increase (20.7 %; p < 0.05) was
    recorded in the V690 treatment which increased the 60 kg N ha−1 basal treatment
    (A60) with an additional 30 kg N ha−1 dose. After the V8 phenological phase, there
    was a decrease in leaf SPAD values (p < 0.05), 13.9 % (R1) and 30.6 % (R3) (Fig.
    5d). In irrigated treatments, SPAD values increased until the V8 phenophase in
    treatments A0, A60 and A120 (p < 0.05), whereas the top-dressing treatments (V690,
    V6150, V12120 and V12180) increased SPAD values up to phenophase R1 (p < 0.05).
    The highest increase up to phenophase V8 was obtained with A120 (22.8 %) and up
    to phenophase R1 with V6150 (50.6 %) (Fig. 5c and e). By the R3 phenophase, SPAD
    values were identical to those measured at the V6 phenophase, averaged over the
    nitrogen treatments (Fig. 5a–g, Table 4). Furthermore, Duncan test revealed highly
    significant (p < 0.001) SPAD value difference in rainfed and irrigated treatment
    in V8 and V12 phenophase is observed in A0 nitrogen treatment (Fig. 4a), R1 and

    = not significant, *p < 0.5; **p < 0.1; ***p < 0.001. The lowest SPAD value was
    detected in treatment A0 in all phenophases, both in the rainfed and irrigated
    treatments. Evaluating the efficiency of the basal nitrogen and top-dressing treatments
    by phenophase showed that the highest value was 41.8 in phenophase V6 (V12120),
    but the Duncan test did not distinguish between SPAD values in different nitrogen
    treatments. In V8 growth stages, the highest SPAD value was measured in the A120
    treatment (47.3), an increase of 10.0 % (p < 0.05) compared to the A0 treatment.
    After V12 phenophase until R3 phenophase, the lowest spring basal nitrogen treatment
    of 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) proved to be effective (p < 0.05). The nitrogen application
    in R3 phenophase had the greatest effect on SPAD value compared to treatment A0
    (44.8 %). The average nitrogen effect was also highest in the R3 phenophase (39.1
    %). In the irrigated treatment, the statistically proven increase in the vegetative
    phase (V6-Vn) was obtained by the A60 treatment (p < 0.05), while in the generative
    phase (R1-R3) by the A120 treatment increased with an additional 30 kg N ha−1
    (V6150). In the vegetative stage, the V12 phenophase (36.5 %) and in the generative
    stage, the R3 phenophase (102.9 %) had the highest nitrogen treatment effect compared
    to the non-nitrogen (A0) treatment (Table 3). On the other hand, implementation
    of irrigation significantly increased the SPAD values in the majority of treatments
    (Table 4). For the control treatment, the irrigation has a significant impact
    only on the early stages V6 (p < 0.5), V8 (p < 0.001), and V12 (p < 0.001). While
    no significant impact was detected on the other stages (Table 4). For the first
    nitrogen level (60 kg N ha−1 before sowing), the irrigation has no effects on
    SPAD values. However, based on the observed values, the irrigation has no effect
    on SPAD values in Vn stage for all nitrogen levels, where it has an impact on
    R1, and R3. All on all, the irrigation has a significant impact on SPAD for all
    phenological phases except for Vn (Table 4). 3.2. Effect of Nitrogen treatments
    and irrigation on the UAV-based NDVI Nitrogen treatments and irrigation affected
    the UAV-based NDVI values. The values varied from 0.364 to 0.662 in the rainfed
    treatment and from 0.348 to 0.728 in the irrigated treatment. The overall experiment
    mean was 0.541. Under natural rainfall, the UAV-based NDVI for maize was 0.518,
    while under irrigated conditions it was 0.564. The measured data showed that the
    highest average value of the NDVI was obtained in A60 (0.538; p < 0.05) in the
    rainfed treatments and A120 (0.623; p < 0.05) in the irrigated treatments, which
    were 12.3 % and 21.9 % increases, respectively, compared to the treatment A0 (Table
    3). In the rainfed treatment, maize reached the highest UAV-based NDVI value in
    V12 and Vn, with increases of 61.9 % and 64.8 %, respectively (Fig. 6a–g, Table
    5). Then, it decreased in R1 and R3 phenophases (11.3 % and 22.3 %). The measured
    data showed that in V12 phenophases, the highest NDVI values (p < 0.05) were obtained
    in treatments A0, A60, V690 and V6150, while in Vn phenophases, the highest values
    were obtained in treatments A120, V12120 and V12180. Download : Download high-res

    Note: UAV-based NDVI values for nitrogen treatments with different lowercase letters
    within columns are significantly different from each other based on the Duncan''s
    test at the p < 0.05 probability level. Phenophases of UAV-based NDVI values marked
    with different capital letters within the row are significantly different from
    each other based on the Duncan''s test at p < 0.05 probability level. Irrigation
    effect: ns = not significant, *p < 0.5; **p < 0.1; ***p < 0.001. Also under irrigated
    conditions, the highest UAV-based NDVI was achieved for V12 and Vn phenophases,
    increasing by 72.1 % for the V12 phenophase and 77.7 % for the Vn phenophase.
    The values have decreased in the R1 and R3 growth phase; by 4.3 % between Vn-R1
    and 17.8 % between Vn-R3. Fertilizer treatments also had an influence in this
    case. At the V12 phenophase, treatments A0, V690, V6150 and V12180 had a significant
    effect (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6a–d, e, & g), while the other treatments had the highest
    effect at the Vn phenophase (Fig. 6b,c, & f, Table 5). Overall, Duncan''s test
    revealed a highly significant (p < 0.001) difference in rainfed and irrigated
    high NDVI values in V12 and Vn phenophase in A60, A120, and V690 nitrogen treatments
    (Fig. 6b, c, & d). Under natural rainfall conditions, the A120 treatment was proven
    to provide the highest UAV-based NDVI value (p < 0.05) throughout the vegetation
    period. Between treatments, the largest increase was recoreded in A120 (38.4 %)
    in the R3 phenophase compared with control one. Under irrigated conditions, the
    result of treatment A60 showed the highest UAV-based NDVI value. Over all the
    highest UAV-based NDVI value were recoreded in A120 (Table 5). Similar to SPAD,
    the UAV-based NDVI value positively affected by irrigation. Irrigation had a positively
    significant effect on the average of treatments based on different phenological
    phases. For A60 and A120 irrigation had a distinct and substantial impact on UAV-based
    NDVI in all phenological phases (Table 5). Under other nitrogen treatments, the
    impact of irrigation on the UAV-based NDVI was inconsistent; it affected certain
    phenological stages while leaving others unaffected. However the average value
    showed that irrigation has significant impact on UAV-based NDVI under all phenological
    phases except for V6. 3.3. Effect of Nitrogen treatments and irrigation on grain
    yield Under rainfed treatments, the A0 provided the lowest GY (4.2 Mg ha−1), which
    was well separated from the other treatments by Duncan''s test (Table 3, Fig.
    3). The 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) resulted in an increase of GY by 64.7 % (p < 0.05).
    This treatment did not increase GY at the 6-leaf stage when increased with an
    additional 30 kg N ha−1 nitrogen rate (V690), and no significant increase was
    measured when an additional 30 kg N ha−1 nitrogen rate was applied at the 12-leaf
    stage (V12120). Treatment A120 provided the largest GY increase (8.649 Mg ha−1),
    which was more than double of the GY of treatment A0 (p < 0.05). However, top-dressing
    treatments above the basal 120 kg N ha−1 resulted in a significant GY reduction
    (p < 0.05). Under irrigated conditions, the lowest GY in terms of nitrogen (5.149
    Mg ha−1) was measured in the A0 treatment. The 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) applied as a
    basal treatment resulted in a GY increase of 4.755 Mg ha−1 (92.3 %; p < 0.05),
    and the 120 kg N ha−1 basal treatment (A120) resulted in a GY increase of 6.715
    Mg ha−1 (130.4 %; p < 0.05) compared to the A0 treatment. Increasing the A60 treatment
    at V6 phenophase with a +30 kg N ha−1 (V690) resulted in a GY increase of only
    3.2 %. Then, at 12-leaf stage, application of an additional 30 kg N ha−1 (V12120)
    reduced GY (−1.363, Mg ha−1; p < 0.05). Compared to the A120 treatment, the effect
    of applying top-dressing (V6150) was minimal on GY reduction. An additional 30
    kg N ha−1 application (V12180) caused further GY reduction (−0.629 Mg ha−1; p
    < 0.05). The 120 kg N ha−1 basal treatment (11.863 Mg ha−1) was found to have
    a reliable GY enhancing effect (Table 3, Fig. 3). The main average yield was 7.419
    Mg ha−1 (rainfed, irrigated). The irrigated variant had a higher average yield
    (8.581 Mg ha−1) (p < 0.05), which was 37.2 % higher than the rainfed version (6.256
    Mg ha−1). In all nitrogen treatments, the irrigated variants provided higher grain
    yields. 3.4. Interaction between yield and different experimental variables Based
    on the factorial ANOVA from GLM analysis (Table 6) different factors with a significant
    impact on GY are identified. Table 6 showed that nitrogen treatments, irrigation,
    and hybrid had a significant impact (p < 0.05), however, the phenological phases
    did not exhibited any impact on GY. Analysis of variance results of chlorophyll
    content expressed as SPAD values in maize hybrids in rainfed and irrigated treatments
    showed that the main factors (nitrogen treatments and irrigation) were strongly
    (p < 0.001) correlated to the development of SPAD values (Table 6). The interaction
    between all variables presented in Fig. 6 revealed the highest rainfed GY (8.6
    Mg ha−1) with the highest NDVI (0.56) and irrigated GY (11.86 Mg ha−1) with the
    highest NDVI (0.62) was obtained under A120 nitrogen treatment (Fig. 7c & f).
    The highest rainfed SPAD value (40.6) is also obtained in A120 nitrogen treatment
    while highest irrigated SPAD value (45.5) is obtained in V6150 nitrogen treatment
    (Fig. 7i). The highest average SPAD value was recorded under irrigated treatment
    (42.9) compared with rainfed (39.7) (Fig. 7h). For GY, the irrigated average treatments
    exceeded the rainfed, while the best GY value were reached with A120 treatments.

    impact. Overall, the fertilizer *irrigation interaction was confirmed at 0.1 %

    treatments. Download : Download high-res image (962KB) Download : Download full-size

    of spectral indexes with nitrogen treatment SPAD and UAV-based NDVI values recorded
    in phenophases were compared with basal nitrogen treatment and top-dressing treatments
    using parabolic regression-analysis (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). The relationship between
    SPAD and applied amount of nitrogen showed that nitrogen application positively
    influenced SPAD in rainfed and irrigated treatments during the growing season.
    Under natural rainfall conditions, the relationship was weakly positive in the
    V6 phenophase (R2 = 0.17**) and nitrogen treatment influenced the SPAD value in
    17.0 %. The relationship between the two variables became stronger for the V8
    phenophase (R2 = 0.4***) and further strengthened for the R1 phenophase (R2 =
    0.47***). A stronger relationship (R2 = 0.67***) was observed for the R3 phenophase,
    with a 67 % influence of nitrogen treatment. Under irrigated conditions, similar
    to the rainfed treatment, the relationship was weak (R2 = 0.23**) for the V6 phenophase
    and became stronger (R2 = 0.83***) in R1 and R3 phenophase. Hence, in R1 and R3
    developmental stages, the influence of nitrogen treatment was the most significant
    (83 % and 83 %) (Fig. 9). Download : Download high-res image (590KB) Download

    Fig. 10. Correlation between N nitrogen treatment and UAV-based NDVI under rainfed
    and irrigated conditions, 2022. The relationship between the UAV-based NDVI values
    and nitrogen application at natural rainfall was moderately close and closely
    correlated in the V12, R1, and R3 phenophases. The strongest correlation was observed
    at the R3 developmental stage (R2 = 0.8***). Under irrigated treatment, the parabolic
    relationship between the two variables was weak at the V6 phenophase and became
    increasingly stronger. It reached to its maximum at R3 phenophase (R2 = 0.82***).
    In this case, the differences between irrigated and rainfed treatments were lower
    than for SPAD (Fig. 10). 3.6. Relationship of spectral indexes with grain yield
    The significant relationship between grain yield and SPAD value under natural
    rainfall conditions was found to be weak to medium until silking (R1) phenophase.
    Furthermore, it improved to a medium level (r2 = 0.51***) by the R3 phenophase.
    For irrigated conditions, it was found to be strongest in R1 phenophase (r2 =

    yield was medium in the V8 and V12 phenophase (r2 = 0. 4–0.52***), became stronger

    improved maize (Zea mays L.) yield. Determining the amount and effective application
    timing of basal and top-dressing fertilizer to achieve optimal grain yields is
    a key research issue under drought stressed environmental conditions. To explore
    the issue, our research effectively utilized PrA technology including Soil Plant
    Analysis Development (SPAD) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV-NDVI) measurements
    in a specified experimental scenario. Under current ongoing climate change, drought
    is considered as one of the natural hazards that has a direct impact on crop production.
    In this context, maize is one of the crops that is directly affected by drought
    and heat waves due to its origin [70]. Many studies reported the sensitivity of
    maize to drought [14,71]. In Hungary, Mohammed, Alsafadi [55] also reported that
    maize is more prone to drought events compare to wheat. The experimental year
    2022 proved to be a record-breaking for extreme weather events with significant
    impacts on agriculture potential of the region [72,73]. Hence meaningful PrA results
    are provided by our research for maize production monitoring under the rainfed
    and irrigated setups in the region. The major findings of the study revealed that
    the SPAD values are highly dependent upon the effects of N-fertilization treatments
    in irrigated and rainfed environments with significant high SPAD values (40.3;
    p < 0.05) reported under rainfed conditions with treatment A60 and (45.5; p <
    0.05) under irrigated condition with treatment V6150 (Table 3, Fig. 4). Formerly,
    János [74] also reported a high SPAD value under irrigated treatment compared
    to low SPAD in non-irrigated treatments. Our research output also reported that
    115 mm irrigated treatment did not reach on average the maximum SPAD range of
    52–56 recommended by Piekielek, Fox [75]. Under rainfed conditions, the early
    top-dressing (V6) suggested by Jaynes [76] had its effect and there was a significant
    (p < 0.05) increase for all nutrient levels for the V8 phenophase. Furthermore,
    in agreement with other research findings [77,78], Following V8 phenophase, water
    deficit significantly (p < 0.05) reduced SPAD, which did not contribute to greater
    accumulation of pre-R1 dry matter. Furthermore, V12 and R3 phenophases had the
    highest effects of fertilizers compared to (A0) treatment. Phenophase analysis
    further revealed that under irrigated conditions in V12 phenophase, maize leaves
    had higher SPAD values than in the rainfed treatment (Table 4, Fig. 5). Due to
    irrigation and top-dressing treatments applied at V6 and V12 phenophases, the
    highest SPAD value developed at silking (R1) stage, the highest increase was observed
    with the V6150 treatment. Like SPAD, the UAV-based NDVI values averaged low i.e.,
    0.518 in the rainfed treatment and high i.e., 0.564 in the irrigated treatment,
    with a significant difference between the two treatments (p < 0.001) as also reported
    by Zhang, Han [79]. Significantly (p < 0.05) highest UAV-based NDVI values over
    the entire growing season in rainfed and irrigated treatments were detected in
    V12 and Vn phenophase with treatment A120 and proved to be most effective for
    achieving high GY (Table 5, Fig. 6). The correlation analysis of GY and UAV-NDVI
    spectral values in agreement with [80] revealed that the early growth stages (V6
    and V8) show a weaker correlation with GY while (V12 and Vn) showed a strong correlation
    with GY. Further research findings exposed that due to extreme weather anomalies
    in 2022, top-dressing had no GY enhancement reflecting the findings of Venterea
    and Coulter [81], as the water stress reduced the transpiration of plants causing
    a decline in N uptake to leaf [33,82]. For instance Ref. [57], also reported that
    several precipitation characteristics including onset and cessation dates, and
    rainy days frequency tend to impact the maize yield in different climatic scenarios
    in Hungary. Another recent study by Rawat, Sharda [83] suggested the significant
    role of climate (in terms of severe heat and less rain) for maize yield predictions.
    Moreover, the negative impact of high temperature is also reported by Liu, Yu
    [84] reducing the chlorophyll index and net photosynthetic rate shortening the
    kernel filling duration. Recent historical climatic conditions of the EU substantially
    impacted the maize yield in rainfed and irrigated conditions with varying fertilization
    treatments [85]. Currently, our findings revealed that the highest grain yields
    were obtained with the application of the spring basal treatment (A120), that
    is in agreement with the results of Drury, Reynolds [86] in both the rainfed and
    irrigated treatments. Moreover, significant (p < 0.001) irrigation effects were
    detected at all nutrient levels with the most significant effect in the V6120
    treatment compared to the A0 treatment. Overall, the coefficient of determination
    R2 of N-nitrogen treatment with both SPAD and NDVI are significantly (p < 0.001)
    strong in irrigated condition compared to rainfed condition except for phenophase
    6 where they have weak correlation (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Hence, SPAD and NDVI are
    more recommendable to predict maize GY under irrigated condition. From these results,
    the sequence of SPAD correlation with maize GY based on R2 in irrigated conditions
    is as: R1 (0.62) > V12 (0.59) > R3 (0.51) > V8 (0.5) > Vn (0.27) > V6 (0.23) and
    the sequence of NDVI with maize GY is as: R3 > (0.75) > R1 (0.62) > Vn, V12 (0.52)
    > V8 (0.4) > V6 (0.1) (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). Overall, the results of the correlation
    between SPAD and NDVI spectral values and GY agree with other research findings
    [87,88]. Hence, we can conclude that spectral response at regenerative phenophase
    (R1 and R3) are recommendable for GY estimation [80,89]. Our research provides
    a meaningful analysis of PrA technology for effective farm management under irrigated
    and rainfed conditions in drought or stressed environmental condition, however,
    the results of study could be more comparable by using other UAV indices as used
    in other studies [[90], [91], [92]]. 5. Conclusions In the last few decades, the
    agricultural sector has experienced significant advancements by integration of
    advanced agricultural research and technology. Among them, PrA is one of the new
    technologies that are involved in agricultural production. PrA is one of the supporting
    tools that help to improve agricultural production and monitor plant health to
    achieve the maximum yield. In this research, SPAD and UAV-based NDVI were used
    to monitor maize growth in Hungary. The output of thus research can be summarized
    as follow: 1 Different fertilization levels in different maize growing stage led
    to significant differences (p < 0.05) in SPAD, UAV-based NDVI, and GY between
    rainfed and irrigated treatments. 2 Irrigation had increased the yield of maize
    significantly (p < 0.05) in all treatments. 3 SPAD increased in all treatments
    in the V6–V8 phenophase period under rainfed conditions. However, implementation
    of irrigation significantly increased the SPAD values in the majority of treatments.
    4 Under irrigated and rainfed conditions the highest UAV-based NDVI value (0.703,
    0.642) was obtained in V12 (A120 treatment) and highest NDVI value (0.728, 0.662)
    was obtained in Vn (A120 treatment), thus it is'' recommended to use UAV-based
    NDVI in these stages. 5 Irrigation led to significant differences (p < 0.05) of
    UAV-based NDVI values compared with none irrigated. 6 Based on the output of this
    research, implementation of 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing led to highest GY, especially
    under irrigated conditions (8.649 Mg ha−1). On the other hand, both Fertilization*irrigation
    had a positive significant impact on GY. 7 The highest correlation was obtained
    between fertilization and UAV-based NDVI (r = 0.8) under irrigated conditions
    in R3 maize growing stage. A similar pattern emerged where the highest correlation
    between UAV-based NDVI and GY was obtained in R3, also under irrigated conditions.
    Overall, this research recommends using irrigation with 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing
    to increase the maize yield, however more research is needed to confirm this recommendation.
    Also, monitoring the crop using PrA, could indicate potential yield. In this sense,
    high correlation between UAV-based NDVI in R3 stages could reflect high SPAD value
    and potential high yield. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare

    development of modern closed-loop irrigation systems cannot be overstated. Due
    to the diversity of soil, it is difficult to obtain an accurate model for the
    agro-hydrological system. In this study, soil moisture estimation in one-dimensional
    (1D) agro-hydrological systems with model mismatch is the focus. To address the
    problem of model mismatch, a nonlinear state-space model derived from the Richards
    equation is utilized, along with additive unknown inputs. The determination of
    the number of sensors required is achieved through sensitivity analysis and the

    real-time, a recursive expectation maximization (EM) algorithm derived from the
    conventional EM algorithm is employed. During the E-step, the extended Kalman
    filter (EKF) is used to compute states and covariance in the recursive Q-function,
    while in the M-step, unknown inputs are updated by locally maximizing the recursive
    Q-function. The estimation performance is evaluated using comprehensive simulations.
    Through this method, accurate soil moisture estimation can be obtained, even in
    the presence of model mismatch. 1 INTRODUCTION The challenges posed by water and
    food shortages are becoming increasingly significant worldwide, fuelled by a combination
    of population growth and climate change. According to the United Nations, agriculture
    accounts for approximately 70 % of available freshwater usage, with irrigation
    being the primary contributor to this figure. Fischer et al. report that the current
    global average efficiency of water consumption in irrigation is approximately
    50 % .[1] Increasing water-use efficiency in irrigation is essential to alleviate
    water shortages. However, open-loop irrigation, which wastes a significant amount
    of water, is still commonly used. Closed-loop irrigation systems offer great potential
    to reduce the impact on water supplies and improve crop health, but they are not
    yet widely adopted.[2] The implementation of a closed-loop irrigation system necessitates
    accurate agro-hydrological models and real-time soil moisture data for the entire
    field. However, obtaining such information is often challenging.[3] One approach
    is to estimate soil moisture from limited sensor data. State estimation is the
    process of determining the internal state of a system.[4-6] However, the reliability
    of these estimates largely depends on the quality of the agro-hydrological model
    used. Unfortunately, due to the complex nature of soil parameters and the discretization
    of partial differential equations (PDEs), model mismatch is an unavoidable issue
    in irrigation models. Therefore, the objective is to devise a state estimation
    method to efficiently overcome model mismatch and provide reliable soil moisture
    estimates in this research. The dynamics of soil water are explained through the
    use of the Richards equation, where soil properties are related to several parameters
    in the equation. The Richards equation belongs to the family of porous medium
    equations which have been extensively studied in the realm of chemical engineering,
    particularly concerning estimation and control problems.[7, 8] In the field of
    agro-hydrology, soil moisture is a crucial indicator in agro-hydrological systems.
    Therefore, implementing a soil moisture estimation approach is of utmost importance.
    Some potential solutions to the problem of estimating soil moisture content have
    been studied.[9-12] As an example, the Kalman filter was utilized to predict soil
    water content in the work of Walker et al.[13] based on the linearization of a
    simple soil profile model. In another study,[14] the extended Kalman filter (EKF)
    was employed to estimate soil moisture in a three-dimensional (3D) agro-hydrological
    polar system. In the abovementioned references, the model mismatch is not considered.
    On the other hand, precise estimation of soil parameters is also crucial.[15]
    Parameter estimation holds significant importance in the domain of chemical engineering,
    as it plays a pivotal role in refining and optimizing process models.[16] In recent
    times, significant attention has been given to the challenge of parameter estimation
    for nonlinear functions and auxiliary models.[17-19] In addition, the field of
    agro-hydrology has seen previous efforts dedicated to parameter estimation. In
    the work of Bo et al.,[20] a moving horizon estimation method is introduced to
    simultaneously estimate the parameters and states of agro-hydrological systems.
    This method enables the estimation of the capillary pressure head and model parameters.
    However, it should be noted that not all parameters can be accurately estimated
    through this approach. In cases where certain parameters cannot be estimated,
    they are assumed to be constant and given an initial guess. It is possible that
    the initial guess for certain parameters may not be precise, leading to model
    mismatch. This, in turn, can result in poor estimates of soil moisture that may
    fail to accurately track the true value or even diverge altogether. Additionally,
    external factors such as crop coefficient and evaporation rate can be difficult
    to estimate accurately, as pointed out by Agyeman et al.[14] Due to fluctuations
    in the surrounding environment, these parameters could exhibit temporal variation.
    On occasion, direct estimation of such parameters is either impossible or impractical.
    The estimation of soil moisture is further complicated by the fact that the Richards
    equation is a PDE.[21] As a result, soil water content is a function of both spatial
    and temporal variables, particularly under non-steady flow conditions. The finite
    difference method is a common approach used to solve PDEs by discretizing them
    into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, this approach can
    result in model errors during the discretization procedure.[20] As discussed earlier,
    model mismatch is an inevitable issue in the estimation of the irrigation process,
    making it crucial to address this problem. Another problem related to the state
    estimation for agro-hydrological systems is the sensor selection. Optimal sensor
    placement is a significant aspect of soil moisture estimation. In the work of
    Sahoo et al.,[22] a systematic strategy was developed to address this problem.
    Furthermore, the issue of sensor placement for an actual field was tackled in
    the work of Orouskhani et al.[23] by considering the degree of observability.
    In this study, the model mismatch is addressed by treating it as additive unknown
    inputs to the state equation, and the sensor selection problem for agro-hydrological
    systems is addressed. The estimate of unknown inputs has historically been studied
    widely in the perspective of linear systems. An observer is presented for dynamic
    linear systems with unknown inputs, along with adequate requirements for the observer''s
    existence.[24] In the multiple-model approach, unknown inputs are represented
    by a random variable of which transition probabilities follow a known Markov chain.[25]
    A recursive method known as the augmented state Kalman filter (ASKF) has been
    proposed in linear systems, and the conventional strategy aims to integrate unknown
    inputs into the state vector.[26, 27] However, if the unknown inputs are time-varying,
    it is difficult to construct the state transition matrix for the unknown inputs.
    The expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is a method for jointly estimating
    the states and identifying the unknown parameters in linear systems, it is an
    iterative optimization algorithm used for point estimation. Recent studies on
    the estimation of unknown inputs in nonlinear systems have made significant progress.
    For instance, in the work of Kim et al.,[28] a filter was designed to simultaneously
    estimate the unknown inputs and states of a class of nonlinear stochastic systems
    where unknown inputs are arbitrary. Additionally, Khan et al.[29] introduced an
    EM algorithm using a particle smoother in nonlinear system identification to address
    the estimation of unknown inputs. The EM algorithm was originally proposed by
    Dempster et al.[30] to address the maximum likelihood estimation under the situation
    of missing data, then it was developed to handle parameter estimation problems
    in hidden models widely. The EM algorithm is an iterative optimization methodology,
    which requires all the historical data incorporated in the computation.[31-33]
    The technique must be completely recalculated when additional sensor data are
    received, which is a drawback in terms of computation complexity.[34] Motivated
    by the above discussion and the characteristics of the agro-hydrological system,
    this paper is dedicated to reduce calculation complexity by recursion and update
    the model error in a real-time manner. The recursive implementation of the EM
    algorithm has recently garnered tremendous scholarly interest. A recursive EM
    (REM) method was first presented by Titterington.[35] Stochastic gradient strategy
    is the foundation of the algorithm, online modifications are made via the Fisher
    information matrix (FIM), the drawback being that the inverse of the FIM is required
    and is not easy to calculate, especially for high dimensional systems. The conditional
    expectation of likelihood was obtained using a stochastic approximation step by
    Cappé, which avoided the need for inverting the FIM.[36, 37] In the initial, REM
    is developed for parameter estimation of a hidden Markov model.[38] In recent
    years, several studies have employed the REM method to solve the problem of parameter
    identification. For nonlinear state-space systems with a jump Markov model, a
    REM identification strategy was presented in the work of Özkan et al.[39] Identification
    of the hidden Markov models using REM algorithm is concerned, and convergence
    result of the algorithm was derived in the work of Krishnamurthy and Yin.[40]
    Based on the above motivations, we address the problem of state estimation for
    one-dimensional (1D) agro-hydrological system with model mismatch in this work.
    The model mismatch is treated as the additive unknown inputs to the state equations.
    Due to the discretization for the whole field, dozens of states are common for
    the 1D agro-hydrological process. It is not possible to place a sensor for each.
    To determine the minimum number of sensors and their optimal placement, this study
    employs the sensitivity analysis and orthogonalization method. After that, we
    propose a systematic structure for state and unknown inputs estimation by derivating
    a REM algorithm. In E-step of the REM algorithm, a recursive approximation of
    the Q-function is represented, and the EKF is employed to update the states and
    the covariance. The M-step of the proposed algorithm involves the correction of
    the unknown inputs at each time instance by maximizing the modified recursive
    Q-function. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:
    The model mismatch is inevitable for an agro-hydrological system because the soil
    property parameters are always difficult to determine, and the external environment
    will affect the system significantly. The problem of state estimation for 1D agro-hydrological
    system with model mismatch is addressed in this work. It is quite costly to place
    sensors at all the nodes of an irrigation field. Consequently, the sensor placement
    problem has tremendous significance for state estimation of agro-hydrological
    system. The optimal sensor placement and minimum number of sensors are determined
    in this paper by adopting the sensitivity analysis and orthogonalization approach.
    A REM algorithm is derived from the conventional EM algorithm to implement estimation
    for states and model mismatch. The proposed REM algorithm has the advantage of
    handling incomplete data compared with the least squares method, which is capable
    to implement state estimation with model mismatch. On the other hand, compared
    with the conventional EM algorithm, the REM method is more computationally efficient.
    For the agro-hydrological system or some other high dimensional systems, the REM
    algorithm is more practical. 2 AGRO-HYDROLOGICAL SYSTEM AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
    2.1 System model description This study considers the hydrological cycle of an
    agro-hydrological system, which involves the interactions between the soil, plants,
    and atmosphere. The water flows that enter and leave the soil, such as rainfall,
    irrigation, root absorption, evaporation, drainage, and runoff, are all considered
    as inputs to this system. Figure 1 provides a schematic of the system under consideration.
    This study only focuses on the vadose zone of the field. Additionally, two hypotheses
    are formed: (a) the horizontal homogeneity of the soil''s features; and (b) the
    uniformity of the field''s surface irrigation. To comprehensively analyze the
    hydrological processes in the soil, this study considers the vertical dynamics
    of the system. Specifically, the dynamics of the water flows are described by
    the Richards equation[41]: ∂ θ ∂ t = C ⁡ ( h ) ⁢ ∂ h ∂ t = ∂ ∂ z ⁢ [ K ⁡ ( h )
    ⁢ ( ∂ h ∂ z + 1 ) ] − S ⁡ ( h , z ) (1) FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    A schematic of the considered agro-hydrological system.[20] The soil hydraulic
    properties, including the hydraulic conductivity K ⁡ ( h ) and the capillary capacity
    C ⁡ ( h ) , can be modelled using the van Genuchten–Mualem approach,[21] which
    relates these properties to the soil water pressure head h . The expressions for
    K ⁡ ( h ) and C ⁡ ( h ) are given as follows: K ⁡ ( h ) = K s ⁡ [ ( 1 + ( − αh
    ) n ) − ( 1 − 1 n ) ] 1 2 ⁢ [ 1 − [ 1 − [ ( 1 + ( − αh ) n ) − ( 1 − 1 n ) ] n
    n − 1 ] 1 − 1 n ] 2 , (2) C ⁡ ( h ) = ( θ s − θ r ) ⁢ αn ⁢ ( 1 − 1 n ) ⁢ ( − αh
    ) n − 1 ⁢ [ 1 + ( − αh ) n ] − ( 2 − 1 n ) , (3) The explanations of the variables
    in Equations (1-3) are listed in Table 1. The α ( 1 / m ) and n are curve-fitting
    soil hydraulic properties. The Mualem–van Genuchten model[21] represents the relationship
    between the pressure head h and soil moisture θ as follows: θ ⁡ ( h ) = ( θ s
    − θ r ) ⁢ [ 1 1 + ( − αh ) n ] 1 − 1 n + θ r , (4) TABLE 1. Parameters of Richards

    moisture content m 3 / m 3 θ r Residual moisture content m 3 / m 3 Since the Richards
    equation is a PDE, it does not have a closed-form solution. Therefore, in this
    study, the finite difference method is used to approximate the equation. The derivatives
    of Equation (1) with respect to the vertical property z are discretized using
    the finite difference method.[14] This approximation transforms the PDE into a
    system of ordinary differential equations that depends solely on the temporal
    variable. Subsequently, the Euler method is used to approximate the temporal differential.
    The boundary conditions to solve Equation (1) are illustrated below: ∂ h ∂ z |
    T = − 1 − q T K ⁡ ( h ) , (5) ∂ ( h + z ) ∂ z | B = 1 . (6) The equations denote
    boundary conditions at the top and bottom layers, respectively. The q T ( m /
    s ) is the irrigation rate which is considered as the manipulated input of the
    system and free drainage boundary condition is imposed at the bottom. The nonlinear
    state-space model is represented as follows: x k + 1 = f ⁡ ( x k , u k ) + ω k
    (7) where x k denotes the state vector with dimension of n at the defined time
    instant k . u k and ω k denote the input and the process noise with zero mean
    and covariance of Q , respectively. 2.2 Problem formulation In this work, we consider
    the presence of model mismatch, which can be described as unknown inputs added
    to the state equation. Therefore, the actual system can be modelled as follows:
    x k + 1 = f ⁡ ( x k , u k ) + Ma k + ω k (8) where a k is the vector of unknown
    inputs which represents the model mismatch, and M is an identity matrix, which
    means the unknown inputs will affect all the states. The general output function
    that considers measurement noise can be expressed as follows: y k + 1 = Ch ⁡ (
    x k + 1 ) + v k + 1 (9) where y k + 1 and v k + 1 denote the m dimensional measurement
    vector and measurement noise with zero mean and covariance R . The C matrix represents
    the location of the sensor. In this work, the soil moisture sensor is used to
    measure the volumetric soil moisture θ , the measurement Equation (9) is converted
    from Equation (4). The main aim of this work is to develop a computationally efficient
    approach to estimate the states when there is model mismatch in the form of additive
    unknown inputs. Remark 1.The unknown inputs and disturbances serve distinct physical
    roles. In this study, the unknown inputs are harnessed to encapsulate unmodelled
    dynamics, while the disturbances correspond to zero-mean Gaussian noise. As for
    the M matrix, due to our limited understanding of the unmodelled dynamics, we
    have chosen to employ an identity matrix to describe the unknown inputs. 3 EKF-BASED
    REM ALGORITHM Given the model formulated in the previous section, the objective
    is now to simultaneously estimate the states and unknown inputs to address the
    state estimation problem in agro-hydrological systems with model mismatch. To
    achieve this goal, the EM algorithm is commonly utilized to estimate the expectation
    of latent variables and unknown parameters. To overcome the complexities inherent
    in high-dimensional agro-hydrological systems, we modified the traditional EM
    algorithm to a recursive version. The following section outlines the detailed
    derivation of this approach and the following notation will be used throughout
    this section: { x 0 , ⋯ , x N } refers to the set of states, { y 1 , ⋯ , y N }
    represents the set of measurements, and a 0 : N is the set of unknown inputs.
    E denotes the mathematical expectation, and Tr is the trace of the matrix. The
    notation N ⁡ ( μ , P ) represents a Gaussian probability distribution with mean
    μ and covariance P . The superscripts ∧ and ∨ denote the estimation and prediction,
    respectively. First, we will discuss the traditional EM algorithm, also known
    as the batch EM (BEM) algorithm. An EM algorithm is an iterative method to find
    maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters. The
    EM iteration alternates between performing an expectation (E) step, which creates
    a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the current
    estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters
    by maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E-step. In the E-step,
    the Q-function is typically computed, which represents the expected log-likelihood
    of complete data. The Q-function is expressed as follows: Q ⁡ ( a , a ′ ) = E
    z mis ∣ ( z obs , a ′ ) ⁡ { log ⁡ p ⁡ ( z mis , z obs | a ) } (10) where the z
    mis are the latent variables which means the states in this paper, and z obs are
    the measurements. The log-likelihood can be formulated in terms of the state-space
    model''s Markov-chain structure. Specifically, the log-likelihood function is
    expressed as follows: L 0 : N = log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x 0 , … , x N , y 1 , … , y N | a
    0 : N − 1 ) = log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x 0 | a 0 ) + ∑ k = 1 N log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x k | x k − 1 ,
    a k − 1 ) + ∑ k = 1 N log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y k | x k ) (11) During the M-step, the goal
    is to find the optimal solution for the unknown inputs by maximizing the Q-function;
    this yields the following expression: a = arg max a ⁡ Q ⁡ ( a , a ′ ) (12) By
    iteratively performing the preceding two procedures, the Q-function can be locally
    maximized. 3.1 Recursive Q-function in E-step The BEM algorithm is an optimization
    algorithm that requires all historical data to be considered during each iteration.
    However, this approach can be computationally complex and is not well-suited for
    real-time applications. An alternative to the BEM algorithm is the EM algorithm,
    which utilizes a recursive computation of the Q-function. By using this approach,
    the EKF-based REM strategy can be implemented for online state and unknown inputs
    estimation. The following derivation illustrates this concept in more detail.
    To transform Equation (11) into a recursive formulation, we can separate the component
    of the last time instance from the accumulation: Q ⁡ ( a , a ′ ) = E ⁢ { log ⁡
    p ⁡ ( x 0 | a 0 ) + ∑ k = 1 N − 1 log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x k | x k − 1 , a k − 1 ) + ∑ k
    = 1 N − 1 log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y k | x k ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x N | x N − 1 , a N − 1 ) + log
    ⁡ p ⁡ ( y N | x N ) } (13) The REM algorithm updates Equation (13) as new data
    is received in a time sequence. Unlike the BEM approach, which involves all historical
    data, the REM algorithm performs a single E-step using only the latest data and
    parameters identified in the previous time index. This allows for a quasi-recursive
    formulation of Equation (13) that can be expressed as follows: Q N ⁡ ( a , a N
    old ) = E ⁢ { log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x 0 | a 0 ) + ∑ k = 1 N − 1 log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x k | x k −
    1 , a k − 1 old ) + ∑ k = 1 N − 1 log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y k | x k ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x N |
    x N − 1 , a N − 1 old ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y N | x N ) } (14) where the subscript N
    represents the current time instant, and a denotes the set of unknown inputs to
    be estimated in the current moment. The variable a N old refers to the solution
    obtained at time index N − 1 , which is used to compute the posterior expectation
    at the N time instant. The superscript ‘old’ indicates that the unknown inputs
    were estimated at the preceding time step N . The estimation of hidden states
    is achieved by utilizing the parameters that are recursively obtained in the quasi-recursive
    Q-function (14). Consequently, the quasi-recursive Q-function can be mathematically
    expressed as follows: Q N ⁡ ( a , a N old ) = Q N − 1 ⁡ ( a , a N − 1 old ) +
    E ⁢ { log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x N | x N − 1 , a N − 1 ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y N | x N ) } (15) Equation
    (15) can be categorized as a quasi-recursion because the E-step is independent
    of the time, and is solely updated with the recursive parameter set. A true recursive
    Q-function can be introduced by the definition of Q ˜ N , which is the average
    of the Q N at time index N : Q ˜ N ⁡ ( a , a N old ) = 1 N ⁢ Q N ⁡ ( a , a N old
    ) (16) After substituting Equation (16) into the above Equation (15), we can obtain
    the recursive form for the likelihood of complete data, as shown below: Q ˜ N
    ⁡ ( a , a N old ) = 1 N ⁢ Q N − 1 ⁡ ( a , a N − 1 old ) + 1 N ⁢ E ⁢ { log ⁡ p
    ⁡ ( x N | x N − 1 , a N − 1 ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y N | x N ) } = ( 1 − 1 N ) ⁢ Q ˜
    N − 1 ⁡ ( a , a N − 1 old ) + 1 N ⁢ E ⁢ { log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x N | x N − 1 , a N − 1
    ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y N | x N ) } (17) The natural step-size 1 / N is decreasing when
    the time index N increases, it may not always be the most effective approach.
    To handle this problem, we introduce a fixed step-size or the learning rate as
    a hyper-parameter which can be tuned to replace 1 / N . From the theory of stochastic
    approximation,[43-45] we employ an artificial step-size denoted by γ N to replace
    the step-size 1 / N in Equation (17). Consequently, the expectation can be recursively
    calculated as follows: Q ˜ N ⁡ ( a , a N old ) = ( 1 − γ N ) ⁢ Q ˜ N − 1 ⁡ ( a
    , a N − 1 old ) + γ N ⁢ E ⁢ { log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x N | x N − 1 , a N − 1 ) + log ⁡ p
    ⁡ ( y N | x N ) } (18) By computing the recursion of Q ˜ N ⁡ ( a , a N old ) from
    the initial time instance, the recursive Q-function (18) is further elaborated
    as follows: Q ˜ N ⁡ ( a , a N old ) = ∏ t = 2 N ( 1 − γ t ) ⁢ E ⁡ ( G 1 ) + ∑
    k = 2 N − 1 [ ∏ t = k + 1 N ( 1 − γ t ) ] ⁢ γ k ⁢ E ⁡ ( G k ) + γ N ⁢ E ⁡ ( G
    N ) (19) where E ⁡ ( G 1 ) = E ⁡ { log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x 0 | a 0 ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x 1 |
    x 0 , a 0 ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y 1 | x 1 ) } (20) E ⁡ ( G k ) = E ⁡ { log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x
    k | x k − 1 , a k − 1 ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y k | x k ) } (21) E ⁡ ( G N ) = E ⁡ { log
    ⁡ p ⁡ ( x N | x N − 1 , a N − 1 ) + log ⁡ p ⁡ ( y N | x N ) } (22) To calculate
    Equations (20-22), the conditional probability density functions of initial guess
    p ⁡ ( x 0 | a 0 ) , state update p ⁡ ( x k | x k − 1 , a k − 1 ) , and measurements
    p ⁡ ( y k | x k ) are required. Under the assumption that the system noise and
    measurement noise are both Gaussian, the abovementioned equations are represented
    as below: p ⁡ ( x 0 | a 0 ) = N ⁡ ( x ̂ 0 , P 0 ) (23) p ⁡ ( x k | x k − 1 , a
    k − 1 ) = N ⁡ ( f ⁡ ( x k − 1 , u k − 1 ) + Ma k − 1 , Q k ) (24) p ⁡ ( y k |
    x k ) = N ⁡ ( Ch ⁡ ( x k ) , R k ) (25) Next, by substituting the mean and covariance
    into the probability density function of Gaussian distribution, we can derive
    the log-likelihood of the aforementioned Equations (23-25) as follows: log ⁡ p
    ⁡ ( x 0 | a 0 ) = − n 2 ⁢ log ⁡ ( 2 ⁢ π ) − 1 2 ⁢ log ⁡ | P 0 | − 1 2 ⁢ D ⁡ (
    x 0 − x ̂ 0 , P 0 ) (26) log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x k | x k − 1 , a k − 1 ) = − n 2 ⁢ log ⁡

    2 ⁢ log ⁡ | R k | − 1 2 ⁢ D ⁡ ( y k − Ch ⁡ ( x k ) , R k ) (28) where the symbol
    D denotes the abbreviation of matrix operation D ⁡ ( x , P ) = x T ⁢ P − 1 ⁢ x
    . Then we can obtain the expectation of the likelihood functions (26)–(28): E
    ⁡ ( log ⁡ p ⁡ ( x 0 | a 0 ) ) = − n 2 ⁢ log ⁡ ( 2 ⁢ π ) − 1 2 ⁢ log ⁡ | P 0 |

    the Jacobian matrices of f ⁡ ( ⋅ ) and h ⁡ ( ⋅ ) at time step k , respectively.
    The symbol C denotes the abbreviation of matrix operation C ⁡ ( x ) = xx T . Then,
    by substituting Equations (29-31) into Equations (20-22), we obtain the following:

    covariance To compute the conditional expectation of the log-likelihood function
    (19), it is necessary to evaluate the posterior probability and prediction of
    x N and corresponding covariance P N . Previous studies have employed a fixed-interval
    smoother to calculate the posterior of the hidden states in the Q-function. While
    smoothers are effective batch processing methods for state estimation, they are
    not suitable for real-time computation. Therefore, in this study, we utilize the
    EKF for state estimation, which can be computed recursively. The EKF is capable
    of providing sub-optimal state estimation for nonlinear stochastic systems. Its
    recursive calculation capability makes it compatible with integration into the
    REM algorithm. The filter can be represented as follows: Predicted state estimation:
    x ˇ N = f ⁡ ( x ̂ N − 1 , u N − 1 ) + Ma N − 1 (35) Predicted covariance estimation:
    P ˇ N = F N − 1 ⁢ P ̂ N − 1 ⁢ F N − 1 T + Q N − 1 (36) Near-optimal Kalman gain:
    K N = P ˇ N ⁢ H N T ⁢ C T ⁢ ( CH N ⁢ P ˇ N ⁢ H N T ⁢ C T + R N ) − 1 (37) Updated
    state estimation: x ̂ N = x ˇ N + K N ⁢ ( y N − Ch ⁡ ( x ˇ N ) ) (38) Updated
    covariance estimation: P ̂ N = ( I − K N ⁢ H N ) ⁢ P ˇ N (39) where F N and H
    N are the Jacobian matrices of f ⁡ ( ⋅ ) and h ⁡ ( ⋅ ) at time step N , respectively.
    3.3 M-step To achieve the maximum solution of the recursive Q-function in the
    EKF-based REM algorithm, we perform partial differentiation with respect to the
    unknown inputs. By setting the partial derivative to zero, we can calculate the
    local maximum of the model''s unknown input vector a k . ∂ Q ˜ N ⁡ ( a , a N old
    ) ∂ a N = 0 (40) Then, by substituting Equation (19) to Equation (40), we can
    obtain the following: ∂ Q ˜ N ⁡ ( a , a N old ) ∂ a N = ∂ ∂ a N ⁢ { ∏ t = 2 N
    ( 1 − γ t ) ⁢ E ⁡ ( G 1 ) + ∑ k = 2 N − 1 [ ∏ t = k + 1 N ( 1 − γ t ) ] ⁢ γ k
    ⁢ E ⁡ ( G k ) + γ N ⁢ E ⁡ ( G N ) } = 0 (41) Finally, we can get the following:
    a N = ( 1 − γ N ) ⁢ a N − 1 + γ N ⁡ ( M − 1 ⁢ ( x ̂ N − f ⁡ ( x ̂ N − 1 , u N
    − 1 ) ) ) (42) Therefore, the derivation of the M-step of EKF based REM algorithm
    is completed. The pseudocode of the proposed EKF based REM approach is illustrated
    in Algorithm 1. 4 SENSOR PLACEMENT To reduce the cost and maintenance associated
    with estimating all of the system''s states using sensors in the 1D agro-hydrological
    system, it is possible to choose a minimum number of sensors that can still guarantee
    the observability of the system. Some studies have employed appropriate observability
    criteria for sensor selection, such as the empirical observability Gramian matrix.[46,
    47] Nevertheless, these methods encounter a fundamental limitation when applied
    to nonlinear systems: they are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated
    simulations with perturbed initial states in order to calculate the ensemble average.
    In this paper, the sensor selection can be achieved by constructing a local sensitivity
    matrix that measures the sensitivity of the system''s outputs to its initial conditions;
    it can help determine the extent to which a system can be observable locally.
    In the work of Liu et al.,[48] a criterion based on the local sensitivity matrix
    is proposed to assess the degree of observability for different sensor combinations,
    using the successive orthogonalization project. The sensitivity-based sensor placement
    methods are proposed to determine the sensor locations for complex processes.
    A sensitivity-based approach for determining the minimum number of sensors and
    their optimal locations for state estimation is proposed in the work of Liu et
    al.[49] The observability is measured using the local sensitivity matrix of the
    output measurements to initial states. Based on this matrix, the minimum number
    of sensors required is determined to achieve full column rank. In this work, to
    select an optimal subset of sensors that can provide reliable estimates for the
    states of the agro-hydrological system, a ranking of sensor relevance is established
    based on the local sensitivity matrix. After constructing the matrix, the optimal
    subset of sensors can be obtained by selecting the state nodes that are least
    relevant while ensuring that the matrix maintains full column rank. This guarantees
    observability of the system. By using this method, it is possible to estimate
    the system states in a cost-effective way while still maintaining observability.
    4.1 Sensitivity analysis For the agro-hydrological dynamic system, it is necessary
    to estimate all states and unknown inputs simultaneously. To achieve this, the
    sensitivity matrix must include both the states and unknown inputs. One common
    approach to check the observability of the states and unknown inputs is augmenting
    the unknown inputs as states. For clarity and simplicity, in this section, we
    will use the subscript a to represent the augmented system and k to denote the
    time step. Therefore, the following augmented system can be obtained: ≔ ≔ x a
    ⁡ ( k + 1 ) = [ f ⁡ ( x ⁡ ( k ) , u ⁡ ( k ) ) a ⁡ ( k ) ] ≔ f a ⁡ ( x a ⁡ ( k
    ) , u ⁡ ( k ) ) y ⁡ ( k ) = Ch ⁡ ( x ⁡ ( k ) ) ≔ C a ⁢ h a ⁡ ( x a ⁡ ( k ) ) (43)
    where x a ⁡ ( k ) = [ x T ⁡ ( k ) a T ⁡ ( k ) ] T ∈ R n + p denotes the augmented
    state vector. The rank of the successive sensitivity matrix along a typical trajectory
    within a data window of the augmented system is evaluated to assess the observability
    of the augmented system. S a ⁡ ( k ) = [ S y , x a ⁢ ( k − N ) ⁡ ( k − N ) S y
    , x a ⁢ ( k − N ) ⁡ ( k − N + 1 ) ⋮ S y , x a ⁢ ( k − N ) ⁡ ( k ) ] (44) where
    N is the size of data window and is either larger than or equal to n + p . Given
    state and measurement equations of a process, we can derive the following formula
    to determine sensitivity of the measurements y ⁡ ( i ) , i = k − N , ⋯ , k to
    the states x a ⁢ ( k − N ) as follows: S y , x a ⁢ ( k − N ) ⁡ ( i ) = C a ⁢ ∂
    H a ∂ x a ⁢ ( i ) ⁢ ∂ F a ∂ x a ⁢ ( i − 1 ) ⁢ ∂ F a ∂ x ⁢ ( i − 2 ) ⋯ ∂ F a ∂
    x a ⁢ ( k − N ) (45) where ∂ F a ∂ x a ⁡ ( i ) = [ ∂ F ∂ x ⁢ ( i ) ∂ F ∂ a 0 I
    p × p ] , ∂ H a ∂ x a ⁢ ( i ) = [ ∂ H ∂ x ⁢ ( i ) ∂ H ∂ a ] . Examining the rank
    of the matrix S a ⁡ ( k ) at each sampling period can help determine whether the
    complete augmented state vector x a can be estimated locally using input and measurement
    data. By evaluating the rank of the sensitivity matrix, we can determine whether
    the system is observable and if it is possible to estimate all variables accurately.
    Remark 2.The importance of sensitivity analysis extends to verifying the observability
    of both states and unknown inputs. In the case where parameters exhibit spatial
    and temporal variations, a higher number of sensors would be necessary to achieve
    parameter observability. Assurance of observability paves the way for straightforward
    implementation of the proposed approach. However, a potential challenge lies in
    the computational complexity as the count of unknown inputs grows. To address
    this, model reduction or approximation emerges as a viable strategy. 4.2 Sensor
    selection for agro-hydrological system To determine the optimal sensor subset
    for agro-hydrological systems, the sensitivity matrix S a ⁡ ( k ) needs to be
    analyzed for both the norm of columns and the degree of dependence between them.
    When the columns of a matrix are highly correlated, it suggests that changing
    the corresponding states would result in similar effects on the system''s measurements.
    Successive orthogonalization is used to rank the columns of S a ⁡ ( k ) .[50]
    To perform the orthogonalization, the projection method is applied, which is demonstrated
    in the following example using Algorithm 2. A schematic diagram of the orthographic
    projection described in the algorithm is shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint A graphical illustration of the projection procedure. To reduce
    computational complexity, we adopt Algorithm 2 for orthographic projection. The
    following is the procedure for sensor selection. First, we select the column in
    the sensitivity matrix with the largest norm of sensitivity and place a sensor
    on the corresponding state. Then we calculate the rank of the sensitivity matrix.
    If it is full rank, it means that we only need one sensor to estimate all the
    states and unknown inputs. If it is not full rank, then we add a sensor to the
    state that has the largest component orthogonal to the selected one. We then recalculate
    the rank of the sensitivity matrix constructed by these two measurements. We repeat
    these two steps to ensure that the sensitivity matrix is full rank, which gives
    us the optimal and minimum set of sensors. ALGORITHM 2. Orthogonal projection
    algorithm 1: Construct the sensivity matrix ≔ S a ⁡ ( k ) ≔ [ ξ 1 , ξ 2 , ⋯ ,
    ξ m ] . 2: Calculate the norm of each column in matrix S a ⁡ ( k ) ; if the ξ
    1 has the largest norm G ξ 1 , then calculate the direction p ξ 1 = ξ 1 / ∥ ξ
    1 ∥ . 3: Calculate ξ ˜ 2 = ξ 2 − ( p ξ 1 T ⁢ ξ 2 ) ⁢ p ξ 1 , ξ ˜ 3 = ξ 3 − ( p
    ξ 1 T ⁢ ξ 3 ) ⁢ p ξ 1 to ξ ˜ m = ξ m − ( p ξ 1 T ⁢ ξ m ) ⁢ p ξ 1 ; if ξ ˜ 3 has
    a larger norm than other columns, then calculate the direction p ξ ˜ 3 = ξ ˜ 3
    / ∥ ξ ˜ 3 ∥ . 4: Repeat step 3 until end, based on the multiple orthogonalization,
    the norm of each column which represents the irrelevance is arranged as F ξ 1
    > F ξ 3 > ⋯ > F ξ m . Remark 3.In this work, while we focus on 1D agro-hydrological
    systems, the proposed approach may be applied to handle 3D agro-hydrological systems.
    One potential issue could be the significantly increased computational complexity.
    To handle the computational complexity, one feasible approach is to perform model
    approximation or reduction before sensor selection and state estimation. Pertaining
    to model approximation, the hybrid modelling as discussed in the works of Bangi
    and Kwon and Shah et al.[51, 52] may provide a promising solution. 5 SIMULATIONS
    5.1 System description In this case study, we investigate a soil column with a
    depth of 0.30 m , as exhibited in Figure 3. The soil column is divided into 16
    compartments. By using the sensor placement method mentioned in Section 4, we
    determine that only two sensors are needed for this soil column, and the optimal
    locations for these sensors are indicated by the orange dots in Figure 3. FIGURE
    3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A diagram depicting the loam soil column under
    investigation and sensor locations. We assume that the soil column has the same
    capillary pressure head for all the 16 states, and the soil parameters used in
    the model are provided in Table 2.[53] TABLE 2. The parameters of the investigated
    loam soil column. K s ⁢ ( m / s ) θ s ⁢ ( m 3 / m 3 ) θ r ⁢ ( m 3 / m 3 ) α (

    the performance of the proposed EKF-based REM algorithm with simulated measurements
    in three different scenarios: Scenario 1: The values of the unknown inputs are
    the same for each state, and the initial guesses of the unknown inputs are also
    the same. Scenario 2: The values of the unknown inputs are different for each
    state, and the initial guesses of the unknown inputs are random. Scenario 3: The
    unknown inputs are caused by errors in the crop efficiency Kc and evaporation
    rate Et , which are involved in the sink term S ⁡ ( h , z ) , and the two parameters
    are time-varying. For each of these scenarios, we consider a sampling time of
    2 min. 5.2 Scenario 1 In this scenario, all unknown inputs corresponding to each
    state have the same true value of 3 × 10 − 5 . The true value of the initial state
    is x 0 = − 1 , and the initial guess of the state is x ̂ 0 = 1.1 × x 0 . We consider
    process noise and measurement noise in this simulation, which have zero mean and
    variance of 4 × 10 − 9 and 8 × 10 − 7 , respectively. To illustrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed EKF-based REM algorithm, we present the estimation for four states
    and compare the performance with a standard EKF without estimating the unknown
    inputs. Figures 4 and 5 show that the proposed EKF-based REM algorithm converges
    to the true value after 4 days, indicating that it can provide accurate estimates
    of the true states. In contrast, the standard EKF approach always exhibits a steady
    error to the true states. Figure 6 illustrates that the estimates of the unknown
    inputs by EKF-based REM algorithm also converge to the true value of 3 × 10 −
    5 after about 4 days, indicating that the EKF-based REM algorithm can estimate
    the unknown inputs correctly. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Trajectories
    of the actual state and the estimates by the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF)
    and the EKF-based recursive expectation maximization (REM) methods at the surface

    maximization. In order to perform a comprehensive performance comparison between
    the standard EKF and the proposed algorithm, we utilize the root mean square error
    (RMSE) as a metric. The RMSE provides a mathematical representation of the average
    deviation between the predicted values and the corresponding true values. Its
    formulation is as follows: RMSE k = 1 n ⁢ ∑ i = 1 n ( x k i − x ̂ k i ) 2 (46)
    where n is the number of data points in the dataset, x k i is the true value of
    kth state for the ith data point, and x ̂ k i is the estimated value of kth state
    for the ith data point. The trajectories of the performance indices RMSE of the
    EKF and the EKF-based REM are presented in Figure 7, which confirms that the EKF-based
    REM outperforms the EKF in estimating the states and unknown inputs. These simulations
    showcase the ability of the EKF-based REM algorithm to handle model mismatch,
    which appears as a constant bias to the states. Additionally, it should be noted
    that in this simulation, all the initial guesses of the unknown inputs are consistent.
    In the subsequent section, we will explore scenarios with different unknown inputs
    and initial guesses. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Trajectories of
    root mean square error (RMSEs) for state estimation with standard extended Kalman
    filter (EKF) and EKF-based recursive expectation maximization (REM) algorithm
    for states h 1 , h 6 , h 11 , and h 16 . 5.3 Scenario 2 In this scenario, all
    the true values and initial guesses of the unknown inputs corresponding to each
    state are different. The true values of unknown inputs for [ h 1 ] , [ h 6 ] ,
    [ h 11 ] , and [ h 16 ] are 2.5 × 10 − 5 , 3 × 10 − 5 , 3.5 × 10 − 5 , and 4 ×
    10 − 5 , respectively. The initial guesses for these four unknown inputs are 1
    × 10 − 6 , 6 × 10 − 6 , 1.1 × 10 − 5 , and 1.6 × 10 − 5 , respectively. The true
    value of the initial state is x 0 = − 1 , and the initial guess of the state is
    x ̂ 0 = 1.1 × x 0 . The zero mean and variance of 4 × 10 − 9 and 8 × 10 − 7 for
    process and measurement noise are considered, respectively. The proposed EKF-based
    REM algorithm demonstrates its ability to accurately estimate the states in scenarios
    where the unknown inputs for each state differ, as shown in Figures 8 and 9. These
    figures demonstrate that the EKF-based REM algorithm can track the true states
    after approximately 4 days. On the other hand, the EKF approach performs poorly
    in such situations, exhibiting a steady error to the true states. Additionally,
    Figure 10 shows that the EKF-based REM algorithm can estimate the unknown inputs
    correctly, even when the true values and initial guesses differ. FIGURE 8 Open

    11 shows the trajectories of the RMSE performance indices associated with the
    EKF and EKF based REM algorithm, which indicate that the EKF based REM algorithm
    outperforms the EKF when estimating states and unknown inputs. This simulation
    demonstrates that the EKF-based REM algorithm is capable of handling situations
    with model mismatches which result in different constant biases to the states
    with different initial guesses. In the next section, we will discuss simulations
    of unknown inputs due to parameter variations. FIGURE 11 Open in figure viewer

    with standard extended Kalman filter (EKF) and EKF-based recursive expectation
    maximization (REM) algorithm for states h 1 , h 6 , h 11 , and h 16 . 5.4 Scenario
    3 In this scenario, the unknown inputs are caused by the parameter variations,
    which means the reference crop efficiency Kc and evapotranspiration values Et
    are time-varying and we do not have any prior knowledge of them. The true value
    of the crop efficiency is 0.88 from day 1 to day 3.5 , and after day 3.5 , this
    value varies to 1.08 . The initial guess of the crop efficient is 1.8 . The reference
    evapotranspiration value is 1.4 mm / day from day 1 to day 3.5 , and 1.5 mm /
    day after day 3.5 . The initial guess of the evapotranspiration rate is 1.3 mm
    / day . The true value of the initial state is x 0 = − 0.8 , and the initial guess
    of the state is x ̂ 0 = 1.1 × x 0 . The process noise and measurement noise are
    considered in the simulations and they have zero mean and variance of 4 × 10 −
    9 and 8 × 10 − 7 , respectively. Figures 12 and 13 clearly show that the proposed
    EKF-based REM algorithm is capable of accurately estimating the true states even
    when there is parameter variation, within about 3 days. On the other hand, the
    EKF approach displays poor performance in state estimation and exhibits a steady
    error when used to estimate states with model mismatch. The convergence speed
    of the estimates is not slow compared with the dynamics of the system itself.

    the EKF and EKF-based REM are presented in Figure 14, which confirms that the
    EKF-based REM algorithm outperforms the EKF model in estimating the states with
    model mismatch. These results demonstrate that the EKF-based REM algorithm can
    handle situations where there are errors in the model parameters leading to model
    mismatch including modelling error resulting from finite difference approximation
    of the original model. FIGURE 14 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Trajectories

    Kalman filter (EKF) and EKF-based recursive expectation maximization (REM) algorithm

    problem of state estimation in the 1D agro-hydrological process with model mismatch.
    To represent the model mismatch, additive unknown inputs are introduced into the
    state equation. The minimum number of sensors is determined using sensitivity
    analysis and orthogonalization methods, which also maximizes the degree of observability.
    The REM algorithm, derived from the traditional EM algorithm, is used for online
    state and unknown inputs estimation. In the E-step of the REM algorithm, the EKF
    is used to update the states and covariance. Simulation results show that the
    EKF-based REM approach can accurately compensate for model mismatch compared to
    the EKF algorithm. It is also demonstrated that when model error exists, common
    filter methods may not have the necessary robustness for accurate state estimation.

    the globe demands more food production. However, the changing climate causes declining
    water availability and thus leading to the water and energy shortages across all
    the sectors including mainly the agriculture [1]. To maintain the current per
    capita supply, the food production needs to be increased by around 50 % in the
    next 50 years to feed the rising population, which further intensifies the demand
    for water and energy [2]. In this scenario, any poor agricultural practices will
    further intensify the negative effects, leading to more vulnerable situations.
    While the accessibility to surface water resources is limited, groundwater contribution
    is a major source of irrigation. Nearly two-third (64 %) of irrigated agriculture
    in India depends on groundwater sources, which is depleting at an alarming rate
    due to inefficient irrigation management and unreliable power supply [3]. Consequently,
    about 30 % of the aquifers are in a critical state, threatening the sustainability
    of groundwater utilization [4]. The urgency of this water-energy nexus investigation
    stems from the shortage of water and energy, a phenomenon that is intensifying
    recently both in India and across the world. Irrigation efficiency has direct
    implications on the nexus between water usage and power consumption. According
    to the organization for economic co-operation and development''s environmental
    outlook 2050, Indian agriculture would face severe water constraints/shortages
    in the next thirty years [5]. Supplying precise amount of irrigation water (i.e.,
    right quantity at the right time) not only saves water used for irrigation but
    also protects the groundwater resources and further reduces power consumption
    used for pumping. For this endeavor, solar water pumps could be a viable alternative
    for both optimal irrigation and energy from the utility grid [6]. Irrigation scheduling
    can be categorized into plant-based-, soil moisture based-, and weather-based
    approach [7]. In the existing literature most of the automatic irrigation and
    monitoring systems are typically based on soil moisture approach, often integrated
    with weather parameters (e.g. rainfall) [8]. There are a variety of water-saving
    techniques for diverse crops, ranging from the most basic to the most technologically
    advanced. Notably, a remote canopy temperature-based approach employed infrared
    thermometers to automate the cotton crop irrigation, the automatic irrigation
    system activated by canopy temperature threshold [9]. Similarly, implementing
    an evapotranspiration (ET) based automatic irrigation scheduling system to compute
    the crop irrigation requirement and time of water application achieved up to 42
    % water saving [10]. Innovative strategies, such as soil sensors and evaporimeters
    are used to further reduce/adjust the irrigation based on the daily weather or
    substrate moisture content fluctuations [11]. Advancements in wireless sensor
    networks (WSN) have facilitated irrigation machinery control. Multiple studies
    have explored WSNs to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and illumination to maintain optimal conditions for crop growth [12,13].
    A novel irrigation scheduling system was developed in Ref. [14] to plan for more
    accurate water allocation using earth observation data, weather forecasts, and
    numerical simulations. To overcoming the challenges in WSN systems, recent advancements
    in microelectronics and wireless technologies generated low-cost, low-power components,
    power-aware protocols, task management, and communication solutions [15,13] are
    useful. Since the groundwater based irrigated agriculture contributes major share
    of total agricultural products, approximately 31.8 million pumps have been installed,
    which are being operated by grid power and diesel engines [16]. Recently, the
    solar powered water pumping systems have gained significant attention [17,18],
    which can be off-grid or grid connected. The solar based pumping mainly helps
    in effective utilization of grid power, effective use of sensors, to achieve high
    efficiency in the power electronic conversion modules, and thus to reduce the
    loading on utility grid. Several research papers have discussed the performance
    improvement of solar pumps in terms of battery storage [19], environmental impact
    assessment [20], comparison of DC and AC motors [21], comparing the pumps such
    as centrifugal, submersible and displacement pumps [22]. Further, solar water
    pumping system with water storage tank was introduced to address the reliability
    and life cycle cost issues [23]. Based on the literature review presented, it
    was noted that the integration of both water and energy management still needs
    further improvements especially at field scale. Therefore, the paper proposes
    an energy management scheme to maximize the utilization of photovoltaic (PV) capacity
    and ensure the power supply security during overcast conditions. The goal of the
    study is to demonstrate that automated irrigation system reduces water and power
    consumption for enhancing the Water-Energy-Food nexus at field scale. This was
    achieved adopting the following tasks a) to develop wireless sensor network (WSN)
    nodes to measure soil moisture and local weather and cloud-based irrigation decision
    support system using the Internet of Things (IoT), b) to develop an onsite optimal
    energy management strategy to operate the solar-powered automated irrigation system,
    c) to implement a well-structured integration of all the sources and loads (pump),
    d) to demonstrate the interconnected system for irrigation experimentally, and
    e) to apply the energy management and control systems for improving irrigation
    in more economical and energy-efficient way. Fig. 1 illustrates the overall integration

    Water and energy-efficient reliable irrigation system (WatEr-ERIS). The WatEr-ERIS
    encompasses an array of modules which are explained in detail in the subsequent
    sections. The main focus of this paper includes: • A rule-based energy management
    and control schemes for a grid connected solar water pumping system for water
    and energy-efficient reliable irrigation system. • The seamless operation of the
    Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPMSM) drive is reported with Battery,
    PV on grid-connected mode or island mode based on energy management scheme. •
    A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) operation for PV is achieved along with
    the DC-link voltage regulation. • The abnormal condition of grid performance is
    also analyzed with voltage sag and swell scenarios. The paper is arranged in the
    following manner. The realization of the proposed work is given in Section 2.
    Section 3 elaborates various modules to achieve automated irrigation system. The
    proposed energy management scheme is explained in Section 4. The discussion over
    experimental results is made in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the paper.
    2. Realization of proposed system The proposed study focuses on the rural areas
    (Kataula, Salgi etc.) of Mandi District, Himachal Pradesh, India, where significant
    water shortage is affecting mainly groundwater irrigation. The open-source satellite
    products are updated on a daily basis, and field observed meteorological parameters
    are used to forecast the local weather for 5–7 days lead period and store it in
    the cloud [24]. The soil moisture and temperature sensors along with Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices, are used to transmit the data to the cloud. The cloud
    provides crop-specific irrigation information to the users along with other weather
    parameters such as rainfall, solar irradiation, temperature, and soil moisture
    level. The pump can be operated through mobile apps to irrigate, irrespective
    of power supply from the grid is available or not. During the power shutdown,
    pumps are operated from the onsite power backups, which are recharged by the solar
    PV system. The integration of all the entities such as PMSM drive, PV, and energy
    storage system are achieved with help of power electronics converters. Based on
    the power conversion stage, converters can be classified as single-stage and two-stage
    topologies. In power electronics, there exist a major challenge to establish a
    regulation of desired voltage or current and hence the configuration must be chosen
    carefully. For this purpose, a two-stage power electronics topology typically
    consisting of two converters in the overall power conversion process is chosen.
    The key advantage of the two-stage topology is that it requires the small capacitance
    size for strict voltage regulation and achieving in better maximum power point
    tracking capability. In a two-stage topology, the voltage regulation is excellent
    as compared to the single-stage converter topology. Several converters are used
    to accomplish the objective. A front-end DC-DC boost converter is interfaced between
    the PV panel and DC link. For PV application, two-stage configuration also provides
    the MPPT efficiency and system dependability. Another DC-DC bi-directional converter
    is connected to battery. In combined, both circuitry makes it a two-stage DC-DC
    converter. Here, first DC-DC converter is used for extracting maximum power and
    the second converter is used for maintaining the constant DC link voltage [[25],
    [26], [27]]. To extract the maximum power from the PV, the perturb and observation
    (P&O) algorithm is used. Another, two-stage configuration is used for interconnection
    of PMSM drive and the AC grid. In this, front-end single phase voltage source
    inverter (VSC) connects AC grid to the common DC link. Whereas another three phase
    VSC is used to connect PMSM drive with DC link. In order to control the speed
    of the PMSM, a hysteresis current controller is used. The performance is analyzed
    with different operating conditions such as motoring and regenerative braking
    condition. The more details about the power stage of the converters are elaborated
    in section 5 which is an experimental part of this study. 3. Automated irrigation

    of soil moisture measurement. 3.2. Module 2: short-range soil moisture forecasting
    Module 1 provides the information of the soil moisture and weather information
    measured at the field. In Module 2, a machine learning based long short-term memory
    (LSTM) model was developed to forecast the soil moisture (SM). LSTM is a robust
    model in forecasting the sequential timeseries information by accounting vanishing
    gradient problem. For scheduling the irrigation, 5 days ahead prediction of the
    soil moisture content is required. Accordingly, the SM was forecasted for up to
    5 days ahead including the 1 and 3 days ahead forecasting. The input variables
    for the LSTM model consists of meteorological parameters such as rainfall [P]
    (mm), temperature [T] (oC), relative humidity [H] (%), wind speed [W] (kmph),
    dew point [D] (oC) along with soil moisture measured using field sensors. The
    summary statistics of selected input variables for modelling is presented in Table
    1. Based on the cross, and auto correlation the most significant inputs were identified
    correspondingly to current time (t) and different lagged time (up to t-2). The
    final input model structure was fixed and the outputs are the soil moisture corresponding
    to the required forecast lead (t+1, t+3 and t+5). Table 1. Summary statistics

    between different input variables also with output (soil moisture at time ‘t’).
    It is clear that despite different levels of correlation estimated among the input
    variables, the overall correlation with output variable varied between −0.125
    and 0.2907. Unlike other hydrological variables such as surface runoff, evapotranspiration,
    the correlation was not very strong in the case of soil moisture corresponds to
    weather parameters. However, the influence of weather parameters on the soil moisture
    cannot be ignored so as to allow the LSTM model to train with diverse sets of
    inputs capturing the underlying physics of the system. Download : Download high-res

    of input and output variables. The model is constructed using single layer LSTM
    cells with 32 units connected to 4 layers of fully connected neural networks.
    The LSTM model is optimized using Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) with mean
    squared error as the loss function. The model is trained and tested to forecast
    SM 5-days ahead (SMt+5). To achieve better accuracy, the 5-days ahead rainfall
    forecast collected from block level India Meteorological Department forecast was
    used. The observed hourly data of the weather information and soil moisture from
    December 2021 to April 2022 was used to develop the SM forecast module. The model
    was trained optimizing the 5697 parameters (weights and biases) with the hyperparameters
    learning rate, 0.001 and batch size of 32. The model performance was assessed
    using Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency index (NSE) for 1-day, 3-day and 5-day ahead forecast.
    Overall a good fit between observed and forecasted was found and the NSE estimated
    are presented in Table 2. As the dynamics of SM was very consistent, the model
    performance was almost similar across all the lead time. Furthermore, the ability
    of LSTM learning sequentially the underline trend of the data allows the model
    performance not to deteriorating even the lead time increases. The testing period
    results of 5 days ahead SM forecast is illustrated in Fig. 5. The results of 1-
    and 3- days ahead forecast are not presented herein for brevity. Further, it is
    confirmed from Table 3 that the statistical estimates (mean, standard deviation
    and skewness) of observed and forecasted soil moisture closely matches with each
    other across all the lead time (1- day, 3-day and 5-day). Table 2. Performance

    Module 3: smart irrigation scheduling All the data received from Module 2 helps
    calculate the actual crop water requirement (CWR). In this study, the CROPWAT
    8.0 simulation platform has been used to calculate the net CWR. The CROPWAT 8.0
    utilizes weather data including rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and
    wind speed, crop data, and soil data in order to evaluate CWR [29]. Here, weather
    data is taken from the automatic weather station installed near the experimental
    field. According to crop water requirements, the decision support scheme turns
    ON/OFF the motor. The process to check the status of water requirement is given
    in Fig. 6. The amount of net irrigation required by the crop is a very important
    aspect. To achieve this Module 3 processes and computes the net irrigation. The
    computed irrigation required, and the water supplied by the pump and reservoir
    together are represented as D (liters/hectare) and S (liters/hectare), respectively
    in Fig. 6. The net irrigation depends on various parameters such as field capacity,
    the water level of the reservoir, rainfall status, etc. Download : Download high-res

    of water requirement [D indicates water supplied by pump and reservoir together
    in liters/hectare]. The soil present in the experimental field is silty loam with
    field capacity (FC) of 32 % and wilting point of 12 % (available water 20 %).
    Field capacity is defined as water retained in the field due to molecular attraction
    and by loose chemical bonds after irrigation or rain. The FC can be expresses
    as eq. (1). Allowable depletion is 80 % of available water (i.e. irrigation water
    is applied when the soil moisture goes below 16 % to bring back to 32 %). The
    effective root zone depth is measured as 47 cm. The depth of water (d) stored
    in the root zone is calculated using eq. (2) [30] and is comes out to be 11.3
    cm. (1) (2) where, and are the density of dry soil and water, respectively. The
    values of and taken from the field are 14.78 KN/m3 and 9.81 KN/m3, respectively.
    Considering the irrigation efficiency of 80 %, volume of water stored in the root
    zone is 33.9 m3 (field size is 20 m × 15 m) and volume of water pumped/supplied
    from the source is 42.375 m3. The data for decadal crop water requirement for
    potato, effective rainfall, soil water availability are presented in Table 4.
    It can be noticed that for crop periods, November to March, two-time irrigation
    is required. Therefore, total volume of water supplied for the experimental field
    is 84.75 m3 (equivalent to 2825 m3/ha). However, conventional irrigation requirement
    is calculated as 3086.25 m3/ha based on the flood irrigation method and potential
    evapotranspiration requirement of the crop for the field location [31]. Here,
    water saving achieved is around 261.25 m3/ha (9.24 %) under no water stress condition.
    With pump discharge rate of 0.03 m3/Sec, the total time to run the pump is calculated
    as 84.75/0.03 = 2825 Sec or 0.78 h. At last, the total energy consumed is computed
    in eq. (3) (3) Total energy Consumed = 3.7 kW × 0.78/0.9 = 3.2 kWh Table 4. Irrigation

    irrigation requires around 26.15 h of pumping which consume about 96.80 kWh of
    energy, whereas conventional irrigation requires around 28.57 h of pumping which
    consume 105.7 kWh of energy. Compared conventional irrigation, soil moisture-based
    irrigation saved around 8.9 kWh. 3.4. Module 4: energy management scheme The energy
    management scheme (EMS) is initiated with reference to the inputs received from
    the forecasting and crop simulation models, which deal with soil moisture forecasting,
    growth prediction, genetic features of specific cultivar, environmental variables
    and management practices etc. If solar powered automated irrigation system is
    not adequately managed and operated, it may lead to wasteful energy and water
    use. Hence, an EMS is proposed and a detailed discussion is presented in the next
    section. 4. Proposed energy management scheme Irrigation can be improved in a
    more cost-effective and energy-efficient manner with well-implemented energy management
    and control systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a rule-based energy management
    and control schemes for a grid connected solar water pumping system. The EMS is
    initiated with reference to the inputs received from the forecasting and crop
    simulation models, which deal with soil moisture forecasting, growth prediction,
    genetic features of specific cultivar, environmental variables and management
    practices etc. The EMS requires the prior knowledge regarding operational status
    of various entities such as availability of PV power, water level in storage tank,
    state of charge of storage battery and availability of grid by means of placing
    suitable sensors. Estimation of State of Charge (SoC) of battery is an important
    parameter and the estimated SoC decides the operational states of the energy management
    scheme. Finally based on objective function defined, EMS generates the reference
    variables for controllers, that control the power electronic interfacing devices.
    Whole data is transferred to cloud through IoT, which is retrieved by other modules
    and monitored. To achieve this objective, the proposed EMS is implemented on the
    system shown in Fig. 7. The flowchart of proposed EMS is shown in Fig. 8. This
    figure also illustrates various control strategy for different converters. The
    operation is carried out in such a way where, PV side DC-DC boost converter operates
    in the MPPT mode derived using P&O algorithm. The proposed system operates in
    two modes i.e., grid-connected mode and island mode. The working modes of the
    converters are chosen in accordance with the EMS, as indicated in Fig. 8. This
    EMS leads to the definition of distinct cases, which are then carried out and
    confirmed through experimental tests. In the following section, these studies
    are well-explained. Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download : Download

    image Fig. 8. Proposed Energy Management Scheme along with control strategies
    for different converters. When the AC grid is OFF, battery side BI-DI DC-DC converter
    regulates the DC-link voltage. If the irrigation is not required i.e., IPMSM pump
    drive is OFF, the PV power injects into the battery completely. Therefore, the
    battery begins to charge up to its maximum capacity. As the battery is fully charged,
    the PV feeds the power into the grid. Once the sun is not available, then the
    battery provides the energy to the IPMSM drive pump. If the SOC of battery (SOCB)
    is less than 10 %, then grid feeds power to the pump. The grid assumes control
    of the DC link voltage as soon as it is connected and regulates it to the required
    value. In this instance, the system contains both a PV and an AC grid, and the
    PV supplies electricity to the AC grid. The whole process ensures the maintenance
    of power flow. So that maximum power of PV is utilized completely. The pump operates
    in its optimal condition. According to water requirements, the motor operates
    at different speeds. Here, a dual loop control (inner current loop and outer voltage
    loop) is used. When PV current (iPV) is more than the required current, the DC-link
    voltage (VDC) is greater than the reference voltage (Vref), and both the voltages
    are compared, and error is fed to the PI controller. At this time, the outer voltage
    controller generates the negative reference current. The actual battery current
    (Ib) is compared to the generated reference current (Ibref), and again, error
    is fed to the PI controller that generates the pulses for the respective switches.
    Another PI controller is used for control the speed of IPMSM. Fig. 8 illustrates
    the control strategies on the individual converters. 5. Experimental study The
    experimental prototype of the grid integrated solar PV array and battery fed IPMSM
    drive is developed in the laboratory as in Fig. 9. Here, the IPMSM motor emulates
    a water pumping system for irrigation. In the power stage, a PV, battery, and
    AC grid utility are used as active sources and IPMSM motor is used as pump load.
    The 3.7 kW IPMSM (JD engineering works) is coupled with the DC machine and connected
    to DC link through IGBT based VSC (Semikron converters). To emulate solar PV,
    a TerraSAS photovoltaic simulator (EGAR) is utilized. In the control unit, a digital
    controller dSPACE-1104 is used to operate the system in real-time. To acquire
    the voltage and current data, the hall effect voltage and the current sensors
    are used, respectively. The parameters selected for experimental study are given
    in Table 5. The different cases have been studied which are as follows. Download

    performance is tested at different solar irradiance. At 1200 W/m2 and 200 W/m2
    (at 25 °C constant temperature), the PV current and voltage are the 3.9 A and
    110 V, and 0.4 A and 102 V, respectively. In this case, the pump load is not connected
    hence, the PV feeds the power to the battery. The tracking efficiency of MPPT
    achieved is 98 %–99 %. The experimental results for this case are shown in Fig.
    10. It can be observed that at t1, t2, t3, and t4, when solar irradiance decreases,
    the power is delivered to battery is also decreases. But the DC-link voltage (VDC)
    remains regulated. Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download : Download

    solar irradiance. (i.e., PVON, battery = ON, pump = OFF, AC grid = OFF). 5.2.
    Case 2: PV with AC grid utility This case occurs when the battery is charged completely
    then the PV power is transferred to the AC grid utility. At this time, the grid
    maintains the VDC. Since the reference is zero before the grid is ON, PV current
    iPV begin to increase, hence, the grid reference current Igref also increases
    to maintain the constant DC-link voltage. Fig. 11 illustrates the results for
    this case. In Fig. 11(a), it can be seen that at t5, as the solar irradiance change
    from 800 W/m2 to 1200 W/m2, the iPV also increases from 3.2 A to 4.8 A. Hence,
    the ig also increases up to some level. Similarly, the effect of iPV and ig under
    decrement in solar irradiance form 1200 W/m2 to 800 W/m2 at t6 is shown in Fig.
    11(b). The transients during turning ON of PV while grid is ON can be seen in
    Fig. 12. Here, the PV (solar irradiance: 1000 W/m2) is turned ON at t7 and delivers
    the power to the AC grid. In this mode, the ig is out of phase from Vg. Download

    2: Transient during turning ON of PV. 5.3. Case 3: pump load with AC grid This
    case represents a scenario when solar power is not available (i.e., PV is OFF),
    the battery is fully discharged and the pump (IPMSM) requires the power to run.
    At this time the AC grid feed the power to the IPMSM. The transient and steady-state
    behavior of IPMSM is shown in Fig. 13. At t8, IMPSM gets turned ON and start to
    run and then settle at 400 RPM. The peak value of grid current (ig) and motor
    stator phase current (istator) are 2 A and 2.5 A, respectively. Download : Download

    during AC grid feeds power to IPMSM. (i.e., PVOFF, battery = OFF, pump = ON, AC
    grid = ON). The AC grid performance is observed at Vg = 120 V (RMS). At t9, the
    speed has been changed to 1000 RPM. During this time, ig and istator are 9 A and
    9 A, respectively. 5.4. Case 4: pump load with PV and AC grid In this case, the
    PV and AC grid both feed the power to the IPMSM. Fig. 14 illustrates the PV, AC
    grid and IPMSM performances for this case. Solar irradiance is kept constant throughout
    i.e., 400 W/m2. Initially PV and AC grid both present in the system till t10.
    During this time, PV feeds power to the AC grid and it can be seen through section
    Z5. Here, ig and Vg both are out of phase from each other. Later, at t10 the IPMSM
    is connected and begin to run then reaches to 500 RPM in steady-state. In steady-state,
    the VPV, iPV and ig are 107 V, 2 A and −0.5 A, respectively. After some time,
    at t11, the speed of IPMSM is increased up to 1000 RPM. This increment in the
    speed requires extra power than PV. Therefore, AC grid start to deliver power
    and feed to IPMSM. A change in ig can be seen in zoomed version Z6. Here, ig is
    changed from −0.5 A to 6.5 A when speed changes from 500 to 1000 RPM. Download

    can be arisen when both PV and AC grid is not available and irrigation is needed.
    At this time, battery feeds the power to IPMSM. The steady state performances
    of battery and IPMSM at 500 RPM and 800 RPM, respectively are illustrated in Fig.
    15(a) and (b). At t12, it can be observed that as the motor speed increases from

    management scheme is proposed for PV-battery based grid-connected system to drive
    the water pump. This helps to make water and energy-saving reliable irrigation
    system. The proposed scheme is based on data such as rainfall, solar irradiation,
    temperature, and soil moisture level. These aforesaid data are used to operate
    solar pump based on availability of the power sources such as PV, battery and
    AC grid utility. In this paper, various real-time scenario such as PV with battery,
    PV with grid, water pump with AC grid, both PV and AC grid with water pump, and
    battery with water pump have been implemented experimentally. Hence, the optimal
    operation of pump and harvesting maximum power from PV along with the power injection
    into AC grid if needed, have assured the water and energy-saving during irrigation.
    The results show that around 9.24 % of water and energy saving is achieved with
    the proposed irrigation system for potato crop with full irrigation. However,
    extensive studies are required to explore more water and energy saving possibilities
    for different crops under different levels of deficit irrigation. Ethical standards
    The research meets all ethical guidelines, including adherence to the legal requirements
    of the study country. Data availability The data used will be shared upon the

  description: In China, the area of greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) has exceeded
    4 million ha, accounting for >80% of global GVP systems. Excessive nitrogen (N)
    fertilization and frequent irrigation have created GVP hotspots of nitrous oxide
    (N2O) emissions. There are several studies on soil N2O emissions from GVP systems,
    but all with low-frequency manual sampling, which may have resulted in large uncertainties
    regarding quantifying N2O emissions. Herein, we utilized an automatic chamber
    system equipped with 16 channels to measure N2O emissions under common farm practice
    from a GVP system in Shouguang, Northern China. We measured emissions from both
    furrows and ridges for 1 year from July 2020 to July 2021. Our continuous monitoring
    showed that the annual soil N2O emission was 102 kg N ha−1, accounting for 7.6%
    of the applied N (1338 kg N ha−1). The annual N2O emission from furrows (176 kg
    N ha−1) was significantly higher than that from ridges (28 kg N ha−1). Large spatial
    variations in the N2O emissions were observed, ranging from 102 to 273 kg N ha−1
    yr−1 for furrows (n = 8) and from 19 to 45 kg N ha−1 yr−1 for ridges (n = 7).
    In addition, we found that irrigation caused N2O flux pulses from furrows, increasing
    by 12–396% compared with the level before irrigation. High-frequency measurements
    using our automatic chamber system provided detailed information on the diurnal
    and seasonal dynamics of N2O emissions, which could be useful for building more
    accurate models and developing more effective policies to reduce N2O emissions
    from global GVP systems.

    1. Introduction Greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) systems are designed to
    overcome the limitations of the natural environment; they provide optimal growing
    conditions for vegetable production, which result in the enhancement of people''s
    diets worldwide (Chang et al., 2011, 2013). In China, the area of GVP systems
    has increased >700-fold, from 5000 ha in 1978 to >4 million ha in 2021 (Guo et
    al., 2012; Qasim et al., 2021). To maximize yield and profitability, GVP systems
    have often been over fertilized and irrigated. The single irrigation water volume
    and annual fertilizer nitrogen (N) application amount are usually 50–120 mm and
    >2000 kg N ha−1, respectively, in Chinese GVP systems (Chen et al., 2004; Ju et
    al., 2006; Lv et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2005). This level of
    fertilizer N is two to five times higher than that in open vegetable fields (Wu
    et al., 2020) and four to five times higher than that in cereal crop farms (Diao
    et al., 2013). However, fertilizer N use efficiency is usually <20% (Ren et al.,
    2010; Wang, 2011), which indicates that large amounts of fertilizer N are either
    accumulating in the soil or being lost into the environment. Nitrous oxide (N2O),
    primarily produced through nitrification and denitrification processes, is an
    important pathway associated with N loss from the soil (Bremner, 1997; Tian et
    al., 2020). On a 100-year time scale, N2O has a 273-fold greater global warming
    potential than carbon dioxide (CO2) (IPCC, 2021). Given that the emission rate
    of soil N2O has a nonlinear response to the fertilizer N rate (Shcherbak et al.,
    2014; Thompson et al., 2019), the high-rate application of fertilizer N in GVP
    systems may lead to higher soil N2O emissions than those in other cropping systems.
    Previous studies have reported a variation in annual N2O emissions from GVP systems,
    ranging from 3.9 to 63 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (e.g., Chen et al., 2019; Lou et al., 2012;
    Wang et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2018; Zhang, 2015). Such a large
    variation reflects the spatial differences in GVP systems with regard to N2O emissions.
    Traditional N2O measurements are mainly based on manual techniques involving a
    sampling frequency of once every few days or weeks (Dorich et al., 2020; Shang
    et al., 2020). Low-frequency measurement may not adequately characterize emissions;
    it may overlook some low and peak values of N2O fluxes, thus leading to the over-
    or underestimation of N2O emissions (Barton et al., 2015). Some automatic chamber
    systems have been used in Australia''s open vegetable cultivation systems (De
    Rosa et al., 2016; Scheer et al., 2014), but no high-frequency N2O monitoring
    system has been described for vegetable greenhouses. In addition, most in situ
    monitors only track soil N2O emissions during the growing season, ignoring the
    fallow period, especially the anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) period. Farmers
    usually employ the ASD technique during the fallow period to decrease soil-borne
    diseases. This involves the addition of organic matter to the topsoil, followed
    by irrigation and plastic foiling of the soil; next, the greenhouse is closed
    for nearly 1 month before transplanting (Qasim et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021).
    Neglecting N2O emissions from the non-growing season has been shown to result
    in a 10% underestimation of cropland N2O emissions (Shang et al., 2020). The effect
    of neglecting ASD time on the estimation of N2O emissions for GPV systems is unknown.
    Chinese GVP systems are usually cultivated in a ridge–furrow cultivation pattern
    (Fig. 1a). The furrows are used for crop cultivation, fertilization, and irrigation,
    while the ridges are utilized for passage, crop harvesting, and pesticide spraying
    (Song et al., 2014). Although N2O emissions from GVP systems have received considerable
    attention, most studies have concentrated on N2O emissions from furrows without
    considering ridges (e.g., Geng et al., 2021; He et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013;
    Xiong et al., 2006; Ye et al., 2018). Due to the variations in management practices
    and environmental conditions between furrows and ridges, it is necessary to investigate
    the distinction between N2O emissions from both areas. Download : Download high-res

    every 50 cm within furrows. Eight chambers were set in the furrows, and another
    eight were set in the ridges. d) Temporal laboratory built within the greenhouse,
    in which gas analyzers were installed. Therefore, in the present study, we conducted
    the high-frequency automatic monitoring of N2O emissions from a GVP system in
    Shouguang, Shandong province, known as the “greenhouse vegetable village” of China
    (Fig. 1b). Our objectives were to a) characterize diurnal and seasonal patterns
    of soil N2O emissions; b) identify the major drivers of temporal changes in N2O
    fluxes; and c) determine the difference between N2O fluxes from furrows and ridges
    and elucidate the underlying mechanisms for the observed differences. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Site description and experimental design The field experiment
    was conducted in Zhaili village, Shouguang county, Northern China (E118°42′4.5″,
    N 36°55′26.4″), which is characterized by a warm-temperature continental monsoon
    climate with an average temperature, precipitation, and sunshine time of 13.8
    °C, 856 mm, and 2475 h, respectively, in 2020 (Shandong Statistical Yearbook,
    2021). The experimental soil is classified as a Cambisol; in the 0–10 cm tillage
    layer (before ridge building), the organic carbon (C), nitrate (NO3−), and ammonium
    (NH4+) contents were 16.6 g C kg−1, 44.4 mg N kg−1, and 6.7 mg N kg−1, respectively,
    and the pH was 7.7. The solar greenhouse was established in 2013 and oriented
    in the east–west direction; it had switchable gaps at the top and front, which
    were opened at regular times during the day to regulate the air temperature and
    humidity inside the greenhouse (Fig. 1c). The study was performed over 1 year,
    from July 8, 2020 to July 10, 2021. From July 10 to August 10, 2020, the greenhouse
    was completely closed for 1 month for ASD. Tomatoes were planted from August 11,
    2020, to March 1, 2021, and cucumbers were planted from March 5, 2021 to July
    10, 2021. According to the conventional planting practices of the local farmers,
    only organic fertilizers were applied as the base fertilizer before transplanting,
    with no subsequent application of synthetic fertilizer and topdressing. During
    the ASD period, incorporating decomposable C - rich organic amendments under anaerobic
    conditions can eradicate soil diseases and pests (Gioia et al., 2017). Therefore,
    the organic fertilizer for tomato (deer dung) was applied at rates of 743 kg N
    ha−1 and 5201 kg C ha−1 before the ASD on July 8, 2020. The organic fertilizer
    for cucumber (fermented corn residue) was applied at rates of 595 kg N ha−1 and
    7973 kg C ha−1 on March 3, 2021. Tillage was performed after fertilization to
    ensure proper mixing of the organic fertilizer with the soil. Drip irrigation
    was carried out every 10–15 days during the growing seasons. Crops were planted,
    fertilized, and irrigated in the furrows (between ridges), whereas the ridges
    were mainly used for passage and harvesting, with no planting, fertilization,
    or irrigation occurring there (Fig. 1a). 2.2. Measurement of soil N2O flux Soil
    N2O fluxes (only from soil, not including plants) were measured using an automated
    monitoring system (Su et al., 2021). The system consisted of 16 automatic sampling
    opaque chambers (20 cm diameter × 10 cm height), a multi-channel chamber control
    system (SF-3000, Lica United Inc., Beijing), and gas analysis equipment (Fig.
    1d). Eight chambers were placed in the furrows, and another eight chambers were
    placed in the ridges (one of the chambers in the ridges malfunctioned for a period).
    Each chamber measurement lasted 33 min, measuring nitric oxide (NO) and N2O fluxes.
    For each chamber, in the first 5 min, NO was analyzed through the continuous transport
    of gas samples at a flow rate of 0.8 L/min to a chemiluminescence NO–NO2-NOx analyzer
    (42i, Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, United States). Next, the same
    chamber was programmed to close for 20 min to determine the N2O flux. The gas
    was automatically sampled at three time points (0, 10, and 20 min after chamber
    closure). The N2O concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph (GC204,
    Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD). The chamber
    was opened and emptied for 4 min after NO and N2O measurements were completed.
    Therefore, the 16-chamber device required 8.8 h to complete a cycle of analysis.
    The NO–NO2-NOx analyzer and gas chromatograph were installed in a temporary instrument
    room in the greenhouse (Fig. 1d). Our automated system measured both NO and N2O
    fluxes. In this study, we mainly focused on N2O fluxes. N2O flux ( , μg N m−2
    h−1) was calculated using Equation (1). (1) where dc/dt is the rate of N2O concentration
    change over time determined via linear regression; V is the volume of the chamber
    (3360 cm3); and A is the surface area of the chamber (314 cm2). P0 (1013 hPa)
    and T0 (273 K) are the atmospheric pressure and absolute temperature under standard
    conditions, respectively. P and T are the actual air pressure and chamber air
    temperature, respectively. The N2O emissions ( ; kg N ha−1) per unit area (area-weighted
    average) of the GVP system were calculated using the area ratio of 1:1 for the
    furrow and ridge. The emission factor ( ; %) was obtained from the N2O emissions
    per unit area ( ) divided by the amount of fertilizer N applied: (2) where (%)
    represents the fertilizer N emission factor of N2O, and Nfertilization (kg N ha−1)
    refers to the total annual N fertilizer application amount. 2.3. Auxiliary field
    measurements Soil (5 cm) temperature (°C) and soil (0–10 cm) moisture (VWC, volumetric
    water content; %) were monitored using 16 sensors (TMS4, TOMST, Czech Republic),
    along with gas sampling. Soil moisture was converted into water-filled pore space
    (WFPS; %) by using Equation (3). (3) where 2.65 g cm−3 is the assumed soil particle
    density, and the soil bulk density is 1.4 g cm−3. Topsoil (0–10 cm) from furrows
    and ridges was separately sampled every 3 days after fertilization and then on
    a weekly to biweekly basis at a later stage. Fresh soil samples were sieved with
    a 2 mm mesh, and 10 g of sieved soil was extracted with 100 mL of 2 M KCl solution
    for 1 h with continuous shaking. The extracts were stored in a freezer, and ammonium
    nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3−-N) concentrations were later determined
    by using an auto discrete analyzer (SmartChem 200, Westco Scientific Instruments,
    Inc., Italy). 2.4. Data analysis Statistical analysis and graphic production were
    performed using R (4.1.1) and RStudio. The information on the observation method
    and the coordinates for each site were input into the map using ArcGIS (version
    10.5, ESRI, Redlands, CA). The differences in N2O emission rates during different
    seasons were tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Linear regression
    analysis was used to explore the relationship between soil N2O fluxes and environmental
    factors, such as soil temperature. The main factors influencing soil N2O emissions
    from GVP systems were identified using categorical random forest (RF) analysis,
    with higher MSE (mean square error) values implying more important variables.
    A significance level of P < 0.05 was used for all data analyses. 3. Results 3.1.
    Variability of environmental and soil conditions Soil temperature showed a consistent
    trend for furrow and ridge treatments throughout the study period. During the
    non-ASD period (11 months), soil temperature ranged from 11.3 to 40.1 °C, with
    an average of 21.2 °C. During the ASD period, the highest temperature recorded
    was 42.0 °C, and the average temperature was 36.0 °C (Fig. 2a). The WFPS values
    of furrows were greatly affected by irrigation, ranging from 5.0% to 94.8%, with
    an average of 66.0%. Drip irrigation was applied a total of 22 times throughout
    the study year, and the WFPS values of furrows increased by 7.4%–52.0% after each
    irrigation. Meanwhile, the WFPS values of ridges varied from 5.1% to 58.3% (mean:
    41.4%) (Fig. 2b). Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download

    disinfestation period. All figures have error bars, but most of the error bars
    are smaller than the points. The downward arrows represent the dates of fertilization.
    In both furrow and ridge treatments, the soil NO3− contents were significantly
    higher than the soil NH4+ contents. The NH4+ and NO3− contents in ridged soil
    were higher than those in furrowed soil, particularly that of NO3−. In the furrow
    treatment, the mean NH4+ content was 11.3 mg N kg−1, which significantly increased
    after two fertilization events, reaching 25.8 and 145.3 mg N kg−1, respectively,
    while the NO3− contents ranged from 1.5 to 392.2 mg N kg−1, with an average of
    243.3 mg N kg−1. In the ridge treatment, the mean values of NH4+ and NO3− were
    17.4 mg N kg−1 and 1759.6 mg N kg−1, respectively. The highest value of NO3− reached
    5343.6 mg N kg−1 (Fig. 2d and e). 3.2. N2O fluxes There were considerable seasonal
    variations in N2O emissions during the annual monitoring. The N2O fluxes from
    furrows were mainly affected by fertilization and irrigation. During the ASD period,
    the N2O fluxes from furrows peaked at 6006 μg N m−2 h−1 on the third day after
    fertilization, which lasted for only 2 days. Subsequently, the N2O fluxes from
    furrows peaked at 36,236 μg N m−2 h−1 2 weeks after fertilization, with a peak
    phase lasting nearly 1 month in the cucumber season (Fig. 2c). In addition, the
    N2O fluxes from furrows exhibited brief pulses, increasing by 12–396% on the same
    day of or the day after each irrigation event; however, subsequently, the fluxes
    rapidly decreased (Fig. 3). The average N2O fluxes from furrows during the ASD
    period, tomato season, and cucumber season were 1289, 506, and 5325 μg N m−2 h−1,
    respectively. In contrast, the N2O fluxes from ridges showed relatively narrow
    variations, ranging from 10 to 897 μg N m−2 h−1. During the ASD period, tomato
    season, and cucumber season, the mean N2O fluxes from ridges were 423, 283, and
    353 μg N m−2 h−1, respectively (Fig. 2c). Download : Download high-res image (705KB)

    fluxes from furrows before and after each irrigation. The downward arrows represent
    the day of irrigation. The blue percentages next to data points represent daily
    mean soil moisture as WFPS at a 0-10 cm depth. Error bars indicate standard errors.
    Over the experimental period, the accumulative N2O emissions during the ASD period,
    tomato season, and cucumber season were 10.6, 25.2, and 140.0 kg N ha−1 from furrows,
    and 3.5, 13.6, and 10.8 kg N ha−1 from ridges. On average, the annual soil N2O
    emission from the GVP system was 101.9 kg N ha−1, of which the ASD period, tomato
    season, and cucumber season accounted for 7%, 19%, and 74%, respectively (Table
    1). The annual in our GVP system was estimated to be 7.6%, with 3.6% in the tomato
    season and 12.7% in the cucumber season. Table 1. Soil N2O emissions from a typical

    mean value of N2O emissions calculated according to a ratio of furrow and ridge
    area of 1:1. The application of fertilizer to tomato plants was carried out in
    the anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) period; hence, a combined was calculated
    over the ASD period and tomato season. Within each treatment (furrow, ridge, and
    average), means between monitoring seasons with different letters are significantly
    different at P < 0.05. In this study, we observed a large spatial heterogeneity
    in our GVP system. With a maximum value of 272.8 and a minimum value of 102.0
    kg N ha−1, the variation coefficient of N2O emissions from furrows as measured
    by various chambers reached 37% (n = 8). Despite not using fertilizer, the annual
    N2O emissions from ridges ranged from 18.5 to 44.5 kg N ha−1, with a 31% variable
    coefficient (n = 7; Fig. S1). Besides the apparent seasonal dynamics, we found
    a clear diurnal pattern in N2O fluxes from both furrows and ridges during the
    growing seasons. The highest N2O fluxes were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00
    local time, when soil temperature reached its peak and WFPS hit the lowest point
    during the day (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (1014KB) Download

    using the entire data from the ASD period (a,d,g), tomato season (b,e,h), and

    standard errors. 3.3. Factors influencing N2O emissions To further explore the
    potential drivers of the N2O emissions from GVP systems, we identified the main
    influencing factors of soil N2O emissions by using random forest analysis. The
    model explained 73% and 52% of the variances in N2O fluxes from furrows and ridges,
    respectively (Fig. 5). From furrows, the soil respiration (P < 0.01) was found
    to be the most critical factor influencing N2O emissions, followed by soil NH4+
    concentrations (P < 0.01) and NO3− concentrations (P < 0.05, Fig. 5a). Contrary
    to furrows, the N2O fluxes from ridges were also significantly affected by soil
    temperature (P < 0.01), except for soil respiration (P < 0.01), NH4+ concentrations
    (P < 0.01), and NO3− concentrations (P < 0.01, Fig. 5b). Download : Download high-res

    increases in the mean squared error (MSE) of variables were used to estimate the
    importance of these predictors, and higher MSE% values imply more important predictors.
    Significance levels are as follows: *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. 4. Discussion 4.1.
    Magnitude and temporal variability of N2O fluxes Unexpectedly, we observed extremely
    high annual N2O emission (101.9 kg N ha−1) in our study, which exceeded the previous
    reports of 3.9–63 kg N ha−1 yr−1 for GVP systems (e.g., He et al., 2009; Liu et
    al., 2013; Luo, 2019; Min et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2015, 2019; Zhang, 2015).
    However, our result was within the range (56.4–238.0 kg N ha−1 yr−1) reported
    by Jia et al. (2012) for annual N2O emissions from an intensive vegetable production
    region with four typical consecutive rotations and a fallow period in Nanjing,
    China. The large N2O emissions observed in this study may be attributed to the
    application of organic fertilizer as well as the high-frequency irrigation. The
    fertilizers applied in both growing seasons were organic fertilizers. The meta-analysis
    of Liu et al. (2021) and Yang et al. (2019) found that replacing chemical fertilizers
    with organic fertilizer can significantly increase N2O emissions in GVP systems.
    The application of organic fertilizer improved the C and N resources for soil-active
    microorganisms and increased the soil N2O emissions through heterotrophic nitrification
    in GVP systems (Wang et al., 2017). In contrast to the N2O peak, we also found
    a CO2 peak after the second fertilization in the cucumber season (Fig. S2). According
    to Sarfaraz et al. (2020), the biochars produced using crop straws have more C
    than the animal manures. The organic fertilizer applied for cucumber provided
    more C substrate for denitrification''s production of N2O. In addition, the plant
    residues in organic fertilizer for cucumber enhanced water absorption and created
    distinctive anaerobic microenvironmental conditions which accelerated the generation
    of N2O through microbial denitrification (Kravchenko et al., 2017). The organic
    fertilizer applied for cucumber also contained a large amount of NH4+ (Fig. 2d).
    High amounts of NH4+ and easily decomposable organic C can directly stimulate
    soil denitrifiers and decrease oxygen concentration, thereby further stimulating
    N2O production through denitrification (Chantigny et al., 2010; Velthof et al.,
    2003). Additionally, excessive nitrogen application caused an accumulation of
    NO3− in the soil (Fig. 2e), which inhibited N2O reduction and increased the proportion
    of gaseous N loss in the form of N2O. (Senbayram et al., 2012; van Cleemput, 1998).
    Irrigation events caused multiple peak N2O emissions even weeks after the fertilizations
    (Fig. 3), which differed from the observation of Yao et al. (2019). This may be
    attributable to the abundance of available inorganic N in the soil in this study.
    Additionally, irrigation promotes the denitrification processes by influencing
    the soil moisture level (Dobbie et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2010). High-frequency
    sampling was able to capture these peaks in our study. In a study on the effect
    of the sampling frequency on N2O emissions estimates from GVP systems, He et al.
    (2009) found that biases can occur if the intermittent emissions are not captured
    by low-frequency measurements. A simulation showed that weekly sampling resulted
    in a 17% underestimation of annual N2O emission, compared with the results obtained
    by sampling three times a day in this study (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res

    N2O emissions over the study period (2020–2021) with different sample frequencies.
    The solid red line represents the scenario with three measurements per day, as
    mentioned in the present study. Different sampling frequencies (daily, weekly,
    and biweekly intervals) at local solar time 09:00 to 11:00 are displayed in different
    colors. Differing from most previous observations of N2O emissions during the
    growing season, we monitored the entire year continuously, including the ASD period.
    Unlike what was observed in the growing season, we found that the peak of the
    N2O emissions from furrows appeared earlier and lasted for a shorter period during
    the ASD period. A high soil temperature and WFPS during the ASD period were more
    conducive to the mineralization of organic fertilizer, resulting in an earlier
    peak period of the N2O emissions (He et al., 2009). The study by Shang et al.
    (2020) showed that neglecting the non-growing season may underestimate the N2O
    emissions of rice by 30%, those of non-vegetable upland crops by 10%, and those
    of vegetables by even higher amounts. According to our findings, the lack of ASD
    monitoring resulted in a 7% underestimation of the annual N2O emission from the
    GVP systems. Combining our new data with previously published data on soil N2O
    emissions under common farm practices from different Chinese GVP systems (Fig.
    S3), we roughly calculated that the mean annual soil N2O emission from Chinese
    GVP systems was approximately 25.6 kg N ha−1. Currently, the area of Chinese GVP
    systems has exceeded 4 million hectares (Qasim et al., 2021), resulting in annual
    N2O emission exceeding 102 Gg N. According to a model estimate provided by Cui
    et al. (2022), N2O emissions from Chinese cropland reached 315.0 Gg N in 2017.
    Therefore, we estimated that only 3% of Chinese cropland is covered by GVP systems
    (China Statistical Yearbook, 2018), but they contribute to 32% of the national
    cropland''s N2O emissions. Our study suggests that strategies and policies that
    can reduce N2O emissions from Chinese GVP systems should be urgently adopted.
    Moreover, it highlights the need for more intensive and comprehensive studies
    to assess total N2O emissions on a national scale in China. 4.2. N2O emission
    factors The annual of 7.6% in this study was higher than the direct N2O emission
    factors (EFd) for Chinese GVP systems reported in previous studies, which ranged
    from 0.2 to 5.0% (e.g., Min et al., 2012; Shan et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2019;
    Zhang et al., 2016a, 2016b). It is also slightly higher than the previously reported
    values, 0.94% and 0.93%, for global vegetable cropping systems (Gerber et al.,
    2016; Rashti et al., 2015), as well as the EFd (1%) for agricultural fields (IPCC,
    2006). Given that control treatment was not set up in this study, we did not eliminate
    background N2O emission while calculating . According to previous reports, the
    annual background N2O emissions from Chinese GVP systems usually ranged from 0.08
    to 5 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (e.g., He et al., 2009; Lv et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2015;
    Zhang et al., 2018). Therefore, our estimated might be slightly higher than the
    EFd value, by less than 0.3%. The greater in our study may be attributed to the
    higher N2O emissions arising from the organic fertilizer application and frequent
    irrigation, completely monitored by the high-frenquency monitoring, as discussed
    in Section 4.1. We also found a significant difference in between the two growing
    seasons with similar fertilizer N application rates. This was consistent with
    the findings of Zhang et al. (2019), which demonstrated that EFds among the tomato–cabbage–soybean
    growing seasons were in the range of 0.98–4.54% in Southeast China. We propose
    that variations in between growing seasons are mainly caused by the organic fertilizer
    applied for cucumber providing more substrates for denitrification''s production
    of N2O, as discussed in Section 4.1. In addition, different crops have varying
    effects on the physical, chemical, and biological qualities of the soil, as well
    as varying capacity for nutrient and water absorption (Zhao et al., 2022). Organic
    fertilizers have a slower rate of mineralization and may not be fully mineralized
    within a growing season (Zhang et al., 2018). Therefore, tracking a specific growth
    season may produce inaccurate results when estimating the N2O emission factor
    of GVP systems, and hence, the monitoring time should be as long as possible.
    4.3. Differences in soil N2O emissions between furrows and ridges During most
    of the vegetable growth period, the NH4+ and NO3− concentrations in ridged soils
    were substantially higher than those in furrowed soils, especially for NO3− (on
    average, 1760 vs. 243 mg N kg−1 soil) (Fig. 2d and e). This is similar to the
    soil inorganic N contents of GVP systems observed in Yangling and Xi''an (Zhou
    et al., 2010). Three reasons might be responsible for this difference: 1) When
    preparing the furrowed planting, farmers usually move the furrowed topsoil to
    cover the ridges, and most of the soil''s nutrients exist in the topsoil; 2) In
    the fertilized, irrigated, and planted furrow area, soil inorganic N remain a
    low level due to root N uptake and NO3− leaching/lateral seepage (Song et al.,
    2014); and 3) Furrow soil N is prone to gaseous N loss due to optimal soil moisture
    and substrates, which promote nitrification and denitrification processes. Additionally,
    plant roots boost denitrification rates by supplying exudates with organic C and
    creating oxygen-depleted microenvironments through root and microbial respiration
    (Bakken, 1988; Hayashi et al., 2015; Kramer et al., 2006; Qin et al., 2017). Most
    studies on soil NO3− in GVP systems focused on the furrows and ignore the ridges,
    and this might significantly underestimate the leaching of NO3−. According to
    the results of our study, ridges in GVP systems serve as a significant inorganic
    N sink; hence, the N balance and NO3− leaching from ridges should be properly
    estimated. Our study found that N2O emissions from furrows were significantly
    higher than those from ridges, mainly due to the influence of activated organic
    carbon (AOC) in soils and irrigation events. According to the Pearson correlation
    matrix, the combined N2O fluxes from furrows and ridges had the greatest correlation
    with the CO2 fluxes (r = 0.513, P < 0.001) and WFPS (r = 0.196, P < 0.001) (Fig.
    S4). The emissions of CO2 (indicating soil respiration) have been used as an indicator
    of the availability of organic C in soils (Beauchamp et al., 1989; Mathieu et
    al., 2006). In our study, the CO2 fluxes from furrows were significantly higher
    than those from ridges. Similar to N2O, in the cucumber season, CO2 fluxes generated
    an extremely high peak after fertilization (Fig. S2). Therefore, we speculated
    that the higher N2O emissions from furrows during this period were mainly due
    to the higher AOC content in the soil. Moreover, in addition to the differences
    in AOC, the rewetted soil environment influenced by frequent irrigation was another
    important factor that contributed to variations in N2O emissions from furrows
    and ridges. During the dry stage, activated N and organic C can be released from
    manure or microbial biomass. In the wet stage, the availability of NH4+ and NO3−
    as the substrates connected to nitrification and denitrification processes may
    increase, resulting in increased N2O emissions (Agehara and Warncke, 2005; Rudaz
    et al., 1999; Wu and Brookes, 2005). Moreover, the alternation of wet and dry
    soil environments creates aerobic and anaerobic conditions for nitrification and
    denitrification processes, ultimately increasing N2O emissions (Fischer and Whalen,
    2005; Ruser et al., 1998). 4.4. Diurnal pattern of N2O emissions and the influence
    of sampling frequency on cumulative N2O estimates Our study indicated a clear
    diurnal pattern in N2O emissions during the growth seasons, and the diurnal N2O
    fluxes significantly and positively correlated with soil temperature (R2 = 0.51–0.76,
    Fig. S5). This was consistent with the findings of the study on diurnal N2O by
    Su et al. (2021) in a rainfed maize field in Northeast China and by He et al.
    (2009) in a Chinese GVP system. In addition to the N2O peak generated in the afternoon,
    we found that another N2O emission peak occurred at night during the growing seasons.
    We hypothesize that the accumulation of inorganic N in the soil, resulting from
    the mineralization of fertilizers, leads to increased N2O emissions at night;
    conversely, during the day, the available N is absorbed by plants, resulting in
    N consumption and reduced N2O emissions (Shurpali et al., 2016). Su et al. (2021)
    proposed that sampling at 9:00–10:00 can yield results that provide the most accurate
    representation of the daily average N2O emission, and He et al. (2009) reported
    that the most suitable sampling time is 8:00–10:30. In this study, the best sampling
    time for the furrow treatment was 9:00–11:00 during the ASD period (July–August)
    and cucumber season (March–July). An appropriate sampling frequency is crucial
    for estimating N2O emissions and determining the causal relationship between agricultural
    management practices, soil characteristics, and N2O emissions. Most in situ N2O
    measurements are obtained using manual sampling, often with a frequency of once
    per day to once per week (e.g., Diao et al., 2013; Du et al., 2019; Mei et al.,
    2011; Min et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2018). According to Liu et al. (2010), such
    low-frequency measurement is prone to the overestimation or underestimation of
    annual N2O emission. To enhance manual sampling techniques, Barton et al. (2015)
    proposed employing a continuous automated sampling system. We performed simulations
    to assess the effect of sampling frequency on the estimation of annual N2O emission,
    assuming that manual sampling occurred daily, weekly, and biweekly (Su et al.,
    2021). From the measured values, we extracted the N2O fluxes between 9:00 and
    11:00. As shown in Fig. 6, daily, weekly, and biweekly sampling resulted in an
    underestimation of annual N2O emission by 8.48%, 16.65%, and 8.94%, respectively,
    compared with sampling three times per day. Our findings contradicted those of
    previous studies, which demonstrated that low-frequency sampling can result in
    the overestimation of N2O emissions by 2–18 % (Scheer et al., 2014; Su et al.,
    2021; Yao et al., 2009). Therefore, we suggest that there are still uncertainties
    associated with low-frequency sampling regarding the estimation of N2O emissions,
    especially under complicated environmental conditions, such as GVP systems. Discrepancies
    in the calculation of N2O emissions may occur as a result of the intermittent
    occurrence of N2O emissions, especially when low-frequency sampling measures do
    not capture these intermittent emissions. Therefore, it is crucial to increase
    the frequency of sampling after fertilization and irrigation. 5. Conclusion In
    this study, we used an automatic monitoring system to conduct high-frequency continuous
    monitoring of N2O emissions from a GVP system under conventional farm practice
    for 1 year, including the fallow period with ASD. Our results indicate that the
    GVP system was a hotspot for N2O emissions, with annual N2O emission of 101.9
    kg N ha−1, higher than the reported values in previous studies. The annual emissions
    of N2O from furrows and ridges were 176 and 28 kg N ha−1, respectively. Ignoring
    the ridged areas would result in an overestimation of N2O emissions by 72.6%.
    Our study demonstrates the necessity of high-frequency and long-term monitoring
    when estimating N2O emissions from GVP systems. For high-frequency monitoring,
    we discovered that 9:00–11:00 is usually the best period for sampling, and low-frequency
    sampling can result in the underestimation of N2O emissions by 8–17%. Furthermore,
    high-frequency flux measurements allowed us to capture the N2O pulses generated
    after irrigation (increasing by 12–396% each time), which helped to reduce the
    uncertainty regarding N2O emission estimation. For long-term monitoring, the absence
    of monitoring during the ASD period would lead to an underestimation of annual
    N2O emission by 7%. In conclusion, our high-frequency monitoring of the GVP system
    in Shouguang, a typical GVP region, revealed higher N2O emissions than in previous
    reports. With the increase in population and the change in the food consumption
    structure of residents, the demand for vegetables will further increase. To achieve
    the global goal of controlling the increase in air temperature by 2050, we suggest
    that it is necessary to pay more attention to N2O emissions from GVP systems and
    carry out more studies to clarify the emission mechanisms and explore mitigation
    strategies. CRediT authorship contribution statement Xue Li: Conceptualization,

  description: Irrigation system is widely used in agriculture sector and has significant
    impacts to the growth of the plantation or crops. Traditional method of irrigation
    system always counter problems such as time consuming, human labour cost, inefficient
    of water usage and monitoring challenging throughout the process. Thus to address
    the issues, this paper proposed the development of smart irrigation system that
    embedded various types of sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) platform used for
    monitoring plant growth. In this work, there are three module have been developed
    which are hardware, software and integration module of the proposed system. In
    hardware module, Raspberry Pi is used to calculate and process the data based
    on the sensors parameters. Different types of sensors have been employed such
    as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, ultrasonic and vision sensors. In this
    framework, the reading of soil moisture sensor was obtained from the base station.
    The Raspberry Pi will receive the information and starts to pump the water from
    the tank until the condition of soil moisture content is normal (i.e. reach the
    threshold value). In addition, the DHT22 sensor will act as the monitoring system
    in terms of temperature and humidity data. While, the ultrasonic sensor will send
    the information to the microprocessor and calculate the water level. Furthermore,
    the webcam vision is used for monitoring the plant growth during the day and night.
    While, the dripping process runs in real-time application to the plant. The microcontroller
    ESP8266 used to control the state of ON or OFF light bulb depending on the value
    of LDR sensor. Based on the results and monitoring process, the proposed smart

  description: 'The original article [1] has been amended to increase the clarity
    of citation sources within the text. The authors included additional references:
    paper by Ahn, et al. (2011) “Comparison of Nutrient Replenishing Effect under
    Different Mixing Methods in a Closed-loop Soilless Culture using Solar Radiation-based
    Irrigation”, published in the Journal of Bio-Environment Control; book by Kim
    & Park (1995) “Hydroponics”; and “Development of Closed Hydroponic Technologies
    with an Environment-Friendly Substrate in Cultivation of Export Fruit Vegetable”
    published by RDA (2017). The citations have now been inserted in the Section 1,
    Paragraph 1 and should read: The facility gardening industry in Korea has been
    referred to as the ‘white revolution’ and is becoming a major agricultural technology
    by producing high profits and adding value to various agricultural products through
    year-round cultivation. This industry has become crucial for farmers who face
    difficulties such as falling agricultural prices [1–5]. Since the 1990s, the facility
    horticulture industry has accounted for more than 40% of the total horticulture
    industry, driven by the increasing demand for productivity, high quality, and
    labor savings through automation [1–4,6–9]. Hydroponics is a cultivation method
    that utilizes a solid medium to provide crops with the necessary nutrients and
    moisture [1,2,4,10]. In Korea, hydroponics was introduced in 1954 and has gained
    prominence due to its ability to produce high-quality crops for both domestic
    consumption and exportation [1,2,4,11,12]. The costs associated with hydroponic
    cultivation are lower than those associated with traditional soil cultivation,
    and the former is also advantageous as it allows growing crops in different ways
    [1,2,4,13,14]. In addition, hydroponic cultivation is an easy method for managing
    temperature and humidity, pest control, disease prevention, and nutrient supply
    [1,2,4,15–18]. As a result, the proportion of the cultivation area has been increasing
    [1,2,4,13,14]. In developed European countries, such as the Netherlands, the percentage
    of hydroponics farms that reuse nutrient solutions is 95%, while in Japan, it
    is 15%. In contrast, South Korea has a much lower percentage, less than 5% [1,2,4,19–26].
    The Netherlands implemented a mandate in 2004 requiring all greenhouses to be
    converted to circular systems. Additionally, by 2024, hydroponic farms in the
    Netherlands are required to adopt recycling methods to prevent the pollution of
    soil, nearby rivers, and groundwater caused by the discharge of wastewater from
    greenhouses [1,2,4,20]. The area dedicated to hydroponics in South Korea has experienced
    significant growth, expanding nearly fivefold from 811 hectares in 2003 to 4224
    hectares in 2018 [1,2,4,15]. Greenhouses in Korea have been built up for environmental
    friendly facilities with a recycling and reprocessing system for the reuse of
    nutrients and drainage [1,2,4,24,25]. However, the majority of farmers—approximately
    95%—in South Korea use non-circulating hydroponic systems with low facility costs
    [1,2,20,26]. This indicates an urgent requirement to establish agricultural recycling
    technologies to reduce the environmental pollution caused by the discharge of
    waste nutrients from non-circulating hydroponic systems [1,2,4,27]. The authors
    unintentionally omitted the paper by Son, et al. (2022): “Identification of major
    pathogenic fungi species for the reuse of drainage water in horticulture hydroponic
    system in Korea” published in the Korean Society of Biological Engineering Spring
    Conference and International Symposium. The citation has now been inserted in
    the Section 3.1, Paragraph 1: Twenty-four fungal species from four phyla, six
    classes, eight orders, ten families, and ten genera were observed in the thirty
    six hydroponic greenhouses; the observed density was 399 (Table 2, Appendices
    A and B), which was similarly reported in the previous study [20,68]. Approximately
    3.33 species were observed at a study site with a density of approximately 11.08.
    Fifteen species from three phyla, four classes, six orders, seven families, and
    seven genera were detected in paprika among the crop types with 105 densities;
    in tomatoes, a density of 91 was observed for thirteen species from four phyla,
    five classes, five orders, seven families, and seven genera. In strawberries,
    we observed a density of 203 for sixteen species from three phyla, five classes,
    seven orders, eight families, and eight genera [68]. This reference has also been
    added at the end of the Section 3.1, Paragraph 3, without any changes in the text.
    Text corrections to clarify citation sources and revised text have been made in
    the following sections: 1. Section 1, Paragraphs 2–4: Due to the growing demand
    for high-quality agricultural products, there has been an adoption of large-scale
    hydroponic systems, leading to an increasing proportion of institutional horticulture
    [1,2,4,28–32]. However, this trend has resulted in various environmental issues
    being reported, including agricultural water depletion, non-point source pollution,
    and loss of fertilizer components [1,2,4,28–32]. Nonetheless, hydroponics offers
    the advantage of a highly controllable nutrient supply, facilitating plant growth,
    increased quantity, and improved quality [1,2,4,33,34]. However, pathogenic microorganisms
    may spread rapidly within the flowing medium because of a higher chance of contact
    with the crop’s root, which is a disadvantage of hydroponics [1,2,4,33,34]. In
    non-circulating hydroponics, if the nutrient solution is drained after being supplied
    once, and the waste nutrient solution is discharged directly into rivers, it can
    result in significant adverse effects, such as groundwater and soil pollution,
    as well as an environmental burden due to the presence of excessive nitrogen,
    phosphorus, pathogens, and other contaminants [1,2,20,35]. To effectively implement
    a circular hydroponic system, it is essential to carefully monitor and prevent
    the spread of pathogens, including fungi and bacteria, present in the medium and
    drainage, as they can cause diseases when reused. Additionally, proper treatment
    of the drainage volume should be conducted during reuse [1,2,4]. By employing
    systematic circulating hydroponic facilities, environmentally friendly cultivation
    techniques such as fertilizer conservation and the prevention of water pollution
    can be achieved [1,2,4,36]. Major bacterial pathogens found in horticulture facilities
    include Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, and Pseudomonas
    spp. [2,4]. Such fungal pathogens include Botryosphaeria spp., Colletotrichum
    spp., Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Phytophthora spp., Pythium spp., Leveillula
    taurica, Cladosporium spp., and Alternaria solani [2,4]. In previous studies,
    most of the samples analyzed were collected from the crop roots and hydroponic
    media. The primary pathogens detected in previous studies were Agrobacterium tumefaciens
    [37,38], Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora [39,40], Pseudomonas spp. [2], Pseudomonas
    syringae [41,42], Pseudomonas marginalis [43–45], Pseudomonas ciridiflava [43–45],
    Botrytis cinerea [46], Colletotrichum spp. [47], Fusarium spp. [48–51], Phytophthora
    spp. [52–54], and Leveillula taurica [55,56]. Lee et al. [2] reported that fungi
    and bacteria detected in the media and roots moved to the drainage through the
    supplied nutrient solution; therefore, the present study evaluated the degree
    of the detection of fungi and bacteria in the drainage for each crop. In this
    study, we conducted the identification, quantification, and evaluation of harmful
    fungal and bacterial species present in drainage water and the growing medium
    used for paprika, tomato, and strawberry crops, which are commonly cultivated
    in hydroponic greenhouses in Korea [1,2,4]. Based on the results of our analysis,
    we emphasize the need for effective management measures in circulating hydroponic
    systems to ensure the safe reuse of discharged drainage. The questions established
    for the study are: is sterilization necessary to reuse, and what are the main
    species of drainage wastewater [1,2,4]? Is there a difference in concentration
    from the detected species according to the type of facility and discharge type
    [1,2,4]? In conclusion, the main objective of this study is to provide fundamental
    data on the importance and viability of sterilization facilities for achieving
    sustainable agriculture and establishing eco-friendly horticultural facility complexes.
    Additionally, the study aims to contribute to the stable cultivation of circular
    hydroponics. By offering this valuable information, we aim to support the implementation
    of environmentally conscious and sustainable practices in the field of hydroponics.
    2. Section 2.1, Paragraph 1: The experimental plots were selected for greenhouses
    cultivating paprika, tomatoes, and strawberries, the most frequently grown crops
    in hydroponic greenhouses in South Korea [1,2,4,20,57]. Study sites were chosen
    for thirty-six different areas, with three each per crop (the only selection criterion
    was crop type), and the drainage from each site was sampled. Korea’s hydroponic
    greenhouses usually grow from September to May [4,58–60]. In general, the crops
    are planted in September, ending a one-time cycle. In Korea, the maximum temperature
    rises to about 35 degrees from June to August, with a high humidity, making it
    difficult for crops to grow inside the greenhouse [5,61–63]. In some areas, crops
    are produced in the summer, but temperature control is difficult [64]. Therefore,
    the sample for the study was a place where the crops were sufficiently grown for
    more than 6 months (sample collection was a similar age to the crops). The samples
    were collected between March and May 2020, and the physicochemical properties
    and concentrations of nutrient solution were similar for each crop. The samples
    were taken once for uniformity (outside, crop age, time) in the discharge area
    shown in Figure 1 and Video S1. 3. Section 2.2, Paragraphs 1–8: Paprika, tomato,
    and strawberry, which are the most commonly grown crops in hydroponics in Korea,
    were selected as study crops based on the findings of the Ministry of Agriculture,
    Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) [1,2,4,6,7,9]. By analyzing the harmful fungi and
    bacteria most commonly found in Korean hydroponics, 57 fungi and 11 bacteria were
    detected [1,2,4,39,67]. The most common fungal and bacterial pathogens in Korea
    are Cladosporium spp., Botrytis cinerea, Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., Colletotrichum
    loeosporioides, Pseudomonas spp., and Erwinia carotovora subsp. [1,2,4,67]. These
    harmful fungi and bacteria are known to be typical species that require management
    in horticultural practices [1,2,64]. To detect the major fungal and bacterial
    species, DNA multi-scan analysis was performed (Eurofins Agro; Eurofins Scientific,
    Agro, LLC, Wageningen, The Netherlands) using the following steps [1,2,4]. First,
    the analysis samples were prepared (drainage samples were collected in 1 L sterile
    collection bottles). Second, the sample were put into contact with a sterile liquid
    medium (for the releaseof fungal and bacterial isolates). Third, DNA amplification
    was performed using the PCR process (low-level DNAdetection). Fourth, DNA was
    put into contact with a specific membrane. Fifth, the visualization of attached
    fungi and bacteria was performed (detected pathogens were classified into six
    categories according to European standards: <25 colony-forming unit (CFU)/m3 =
    very low (1), <100 CFU/m3 = low (2), <500 CFU/m3 = moderate (3), <1000 CFU/m3
    = moderate-to-high (4), <2000 CFU/m3 = high (5), and >2000 CFU/m3 = very high
    (6)). By following these steps, researchers can identify and classify the harmful
    fungi and bacteria commonly found in hydroponics in Korea. This information can
    be used to develop appropriate management strategies to control and mitigate the
    effects of these pathogens in captive horticultural practices [1,2,4]. Additional

    Notes 1. Missing Citation The original article [1] has been amended to increase
    the clarity of citation sources within the text. The authors included additional
    references: paper by Ahn, et al. (2011) “Comparison of Nutrient Replenishing Effect
    under Different Mixing Methods in a Closed-loop Soilless Culture using Solar Radiation-based
    Irrigation”, published in the Journal of Bio-Environment Control; book by Kim
    & Park (1995) “Hydroponics”; and “Development of Closed Hydroponic Technologies
    with an Environment-Friendly Substrate in Cultivation of Export Fruit Vegetable”
    published by RDA (2017). The citations have now been inserted in the Section 1,
    Paragraph 1 and should read: The facility gardening industry in Korea has been
    referred to as the ‘white revolution’ and is becoming a major agricultural technology
    by producing high profits and adding value to various agricultural products through
    year-round cultivation. This industry has become crucial for farmers who face
    difficulties such as falling agricultural prices [1–5]. Since the 1990s, the facility
    horticulture industry has accounted for more than 40% of the total horticulture
    industry, driven by the increasing demand for productivity, high quality, and
    labor savings through automation [1–4,6–9]. Hydroponics is a cultivation method
    that utilizes a solid medium to provide crops with the necessary nutrients and
    moisture [1,2,4,10]. In Korea, hydroponics was introduced in 1954 and has gained
    prominence due to its ability to produce high-quality crops for both domestic
    consumption and exportation [1,2,4,11,12]. The costs associated with hydroponic
    cultivation are lower than those associated with traditional soil cultivation,
    and the former is also advantageous as it allows growing crops in different ways
    [1,2,4,13,14]. In addition, hydroponic cultivation is an easy method for managing
    temperature and humidity, pest control, disease prevention, and nutrient supply
    [1,2,4,15–18]. As a result, the proportion of the cultivation area has been increasing
    [1,2,4,13,14]. In developed European countries, such as the Netherlands, the percentage
    of hydroponics farms that reuse nutrient solutions is 95%, while in Japan, it
    is 15%. In contrast, South Korea has a much lower percentage, less than 5% [1,2,4,19–26].
    The Netherlands implemented a mandate in 2004 requiring all greenhouses to be
    converted to circular systems. Additionally, by 2024, hydroponic farms in the
    Netherlands are required to adopt recycling methods to prevent the pollution of
    soil, nearby rivers, and groundwater caused by the discharge of wastewater from
    greenhouses [1,2,4,20]. The area dedicated to hydroponics in South Korea has experienced
    significant growth, expanding nearly fivefold from 811 hectares in 2003 to 4224
    hectares in 2018 [1,2,4,15]. Greenhouses in Korea have been built up for environmental
    friendly facilities with a recycling and reprocessing system for the reuse of
    nutrients and drainage [1,2,4,24,25]. However, the majority of farmers—approximately
    95%—in South Korea use non-circulating hydroponic systems with low facility costs
    [1,2,20,26]. This indicates an urgent requirement to establish agricultural recycling
    technologies to reduce the environmental pollution caused by the discharge of
    waste nutrients from non-circulating hydroponic systems [1,2,4,27]. The authors
    unintentionally omitted the paper by Son, et al. (2022): “Identification of major
    pathogenic fungi species for the reuse of drainage water in horticulture hydroponic
    system in Korea” published in the Korean Society of Biological Engineering Spring
    Conference and International Symposium. The citation has now been inserted in
    the Section 3.1, Paragraph 1: Twenty-four fungal species from four phyla, six
    classes, eight orders, ten families, and ten genera were observed in the thirty
    six hydroponic greenhouses; the observed density was 399 (Table 2, Appendices
    A and B), which was similarly reported in the previous study [20,68]. Approximately
    3.33 species were observed at a study site with a density of approximately 11.08.
    Fifteen species from three phyla, four classes, six orders, seven families, and
    seven genera were detected in paprika among the crop types with 105 densities;
    in tomatoes, a density of 91 was observed for thirteen species from four phyla,
    five classes, five orders, seven families, and seven genera. In strawberries,
    we observed a density of 203 for sixteen species from three phyla, five classes,
    seven orders, eight families, and eight genera [68]. This reference has also been
    added at the end of the Section 3.1, Paragraph 3, without any changes in the text.
    2. Text Correction Text corrections to clarify citation sources and revised text
    have been made in the following sections: 1. Section 1, Paragraphs 2–4: Due to
    the growing demand for high-quality agricultural products, there has been an adoption
    of large-scale hydroponic systems, leading to an increasing proportion of institutional
    horticulture [1,2,4,28–32]. However, this trend has resulted in various environmental
    issues being reported, including agricultural water depletion, non-point source
    pollution, and loss of fertilizer components [1,2,4,28–32]. Nonetheless, hydroponics
    offers the advantage of a highly controllable nutrient supply, facilitating plant
    growth, increased quantity, and improved quality [1,2,4,33,34]. However, pathogenic
    microorganisms may spread rapidly within the flowing medium because of a higher
    chance of contact with the crop’s root, which is a disadvantage of hydroponics
    [1,2,4,33,34]. In non-circulating hydroponics, if the nutrient solution is drained
    after being supplied once, and the waste nutrient solution is discharged directly
    into rivers, it can result in significant adverse effects, such as groundwater
    and soil pollution, as well as an environmental burden due to the presence of
    excessive nitrogen, phosphorus, pathogens, and other contaminants [1,2,20,35].
    To effectively implement a circular hydroponic system, it is essential to carefully
    monitor and prevent the spread of pathogens, including fungi and bacteria, present
    in the medium and drainage, as they can cause diseases when reused. Additionally,
    proper treatment of the drainage volume should be conducted during reuse [1,2,4].
    By employing systematic circulating hydroponic facilities, environmentally friendly
    cultivation techniques such as fertilizer conservation and the prevention of water
    pollution can be achieved [1,2,4,36]. Major bacterial pathogens found in horticulture
    facilities include Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora,
    and Pseudomonas spp. [2,4]. Such fungal pathogens include Botryosphaeria spp.,
    Colletotrichum spp., Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Phytophthora spp., Pythium
    spp., Leveillula taurica, Cladosporium spp., and Alternaria solani [2,4]. In previous
    studies, most of the samples analyzed were collected from the crop roots and hydroponic
    media. The primary pathogens detected in previous studies were Agrobacterium tumefaciens
    [37,38], Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora [39,40], Pseudomonas spp. [2], Pseudomonas
    syringae [41,42], Pseudomonas marginalis [43–45], Pseudomonas ciridiflava [43–45],
    Botrytis cinerea [46], Colletotrichum spp. [47], Fusarium spp. [48–51], Phytophthora
    spp. [52–54], and Leveillula taurica [55,56]. Lee et al. [2] reported that fungi
    and bacteria detected in the media and roots moved to the drainage through the
    supplied nutrient solution; therefore, the present study evaluated the degree
    of the detection of fungi and bacteria in the drainage for each crop. In this
    study, we conducted the identification, quantification, and evaluation of harmful
    fungal and bacterial species present in drainage water and the growing medium
    used for paprika, tomato, and strawberry crops, which are commonly cultivated
    in hydroponic greenhouses in Korea [1,2,4]. Based on the results of our analysis,
    we emphasize the need for effective management measures in circulating hydroponic
    systems to ensure the safe reuse of discharged drainage. The questions established
    for the study are: is sterilization necessary to reuse, and what are the main
    species of drainage wastewater [1,2,4]? Is there a difference in concentration
    from the detected species according to the type of facility and discharge type
    [1,2,4]? In conclusion, the main objective of this study is to provide fundamental
    data on the importance and viability of sterilization facilities for achieving
    sustainable agriculture and establishing eco-friendly horticultural facility complexes.
    Additionally, the study aims to contribute to the stable cultivation of circular
    hydroponics. By offering this valuable information, we aim to support the implementation
    of environmentally conscious and sustainable practices in the field of hydroponics.
    2. Section 2.1, Paragraph 1: The experimental plots were selected for greenhouses
    cultivating paprika, tomatoes, and strawberries, the most frequently grown crops
    in hydroponic greenhouses in South Korea [1,2,4,20,57]. Study sites were chosen

    difficult for crops to grow inside the greenhouse [5,61–63]. In some areas, crops
    are produced in the summer, but temperature control is difficult [64]. Therefore,
    the sample for the study was a place where the crops were sufficiently grown for
    more than 6 months (sample collection was a similar age to the crops). The samples
    were collected between March and May 2020, and the physicochemical properties
    and concentrations of nutrient solution were similar for each crop. The samples
    were taken once for uniformity (outside, crop age, time) in the discharge area
    shown in Figure 1 and Video S1. 3. Section 2.2, Paragraphs 1–8: Paprika, tomato,
    and strawberry, which are the most commonly grown crops in hydroponics in Korea,
    were selected as study crops based on the findings of the Ministry of Agriculture,
    Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) [1,2,4,6,7,9]. By analyzing the harmful fungi and

    the analysis samples were prepared (drainage samples were collected in 1 L sterile
    collection bottles). Second, the sample were put into contact with a sterile liquid

    = moderate-to-high (4), <2000 CFU/m3 = high (5), and >2000 CFU/m3 = very high
    (6)). By following these steps, researchers can identify and classify the harmful
    fungi and bacteria commonly found in hydroponics in Korea. This information can
    be used to develop appropriate management strategies to control and mitigate the
    effects of these pathogens in captive horticultural practices [1,2,4]. 3. References

  description: The installation of the smart electricity meters (SEMs) to the high-density
    pumping wells in the North China Plain (NCP) provided a method to control the
    groundwater withdraw. The record in real-time electricity consumption from SEMs
    also provided an alternative method to forecast soil moisture to make irrigation
    decisions to improve irrigation efficiency. The irrigation timing and the irrigation
    amount could be obtained on-line from the SEMs based on the coefficients obtained
    for electricity-to-water conversion (E-Wc). The real-time recordings in the irrigation
    timing and amounts were further used to forecast the next irrigation timing and
    amount based on the water rights per area of land, the lower limit of soil water
    contents for different crops at their different growing stages and online meteorological
    data. A smartphone app was developed based on this framework. The running of the
    app to simulate soil water contents based on the soil water balance equation was
    supported by databases on soil texture, crop coefficients, water rights, E-Wc
    and threshold soil water content values as well as the real-time collection of
    electricity consumption and meteorological data. The simulated real-time soil
    water contents were shown on the mobile phone screen and could be compared with
    the threshold values for making irrigation decisions for users. The accuracy in
    forecasting the soil water contents using the methods developed in this framework
    was tested under different irrigation schedules for winter wheat and summer maize
    during 2018–2019 and 2021–2022, and the app was tested for three locations starting
    from sowing winter wheat in October 2022 to April in 2023. The results showed
    that the app could be easily run, and precise real-time soil water contents were
    simulated. With the application of the pumping well renovation project in the
    NCP, most of the pumping wells were installed with the SEMs, and using SEMs for
    groundwater pumping control and irrigation decisions should be possible.

    • Real-time readings from Smart Electricity Meters (SEMs) were converted into
    irrigation recordings. • The historical recordings in irrigation were used to
    forecast soil water changes. • Threshold soil water values was developed and used
    for irrigation decision. • Mobile phone app was developed to make irrigation decision
    based on SEMs Abstract The installation of the smart electricity meters (SEMs)
    to the high-density pumping wells in the North China Plain (NCP) provided a method
    to control the groundwater withdraw. The record in real-time electricity consumption
    from SEMs also provided an alternative method to forecast soil moisture to make
    irrigation decisions to improve irrigation efficiency. The irrigation timing and
    the irrigation amount could be obtained on-line from the SEMs based on the coefficients
    obtained for electricity-to-water conversion (E-Wc). The real-time recordings
    in the irrigation timing and amounts were further used to forecast the next irrigation
    timing and amount based on the water rights per area of land, the lower limit
    of soil water contents for different crops at their different growing stages and
    online meteorological data. A smartphone app was developed based on this framework.
    The running of the app to simulate soil water contents based on the soil water
    balance equation was supported by databases on soil texture, crop coefficients,
    water rights, E-Wc and threshold soil water content values as well as the real-time
    collection of electricity consumption and meteorological data. The simulated real-time
    soil water contents were shown on the mobile phone screen and could be compared
    with the threshold values for making irrigation decisions for users. The accuracy
    in forecasting the soil water contents using the methods developed in this framework
    was tested under different irrigation schedules for winter wheat and summer maize
    during 2018–2019 and 2021–2022, and the app was tested for three locations starting
    from sowing winter wheat in October 2022 to April in 2023. The results showed
    that the app could be easily run, and precise real-time soil water contents were
    simulated. With the application of the pumping well renovation project in the
    NCP, most of the pumping wells were installed with the SEMs, and using SEMs for
    groundwater pumping control and irrigation decisions should be possible. Previous

    app 1. Introduction The North China Plain (NCP) is one of the most important grain
    production areas in China. Winter wheat and summer maize form an annual double-cropping
    system that requires annual irrigation water of approximately 200–350 mm, and
    70% of the irrigation water comes from underground, resulting in a rapid decline
    in groundwater tables (Zhang et al., 2011, Yan et al., 2020, Zheng et al., 2022).
    The overuse of groundwater in the NCP could be attributed to the unregulated groundwater
    withdrawals by millions of private users (Li et al., 2018a). In the shallow groundwater
    irrigation areas in the piedmont plains in the NCP, the density of the pumping
    wells is quite high, with one well supplying water to approximately 5 to 6 ha
    of land. For example, Hebei Province in the NCP had pumping wells of 914000 to
    irrigate 3.87 million ha of land. Most of the wells are owned and operated by
    individual farmers, and there are no requirements for water withdrawal permits
    currently (Wang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a). Previously, the government had
    little success in controlling groundwater extraction within the existing formal
    laws and regulations (Shen, 2015) because no water monitoring measure was installed.
    Therefore, monitoring groundwater use is critical to control the over withdrawal
    in underground water pumping (Bluemling et al., 2010; Ursitti et al., 2018). However,
    for millions of pumping wells, each well to be installed with a water meter would
    be quite expensive, especially for meters that could automatically send water
    use information such as electromagnetic and ultrasonic water meters. These meters
    would also require technical resources to maintain the system (Wang et al., 2020).
    Zekri (2009) suggested that implementing an annual individual electricity quota
    without interfering with the electricity pricing policy can act as a surrogate
    method to control groundwater pumping. The majority of pumps in China are powered
    by electricity. After the initial unsteady flow, water pumping can be considered
    a constant flow from a single well (Chen et al., 2019). Ignoring the slight changes
    in groundwater levels during pumping, a constant electricity consumption per unit
    of water withdrawals could be obtained for each well, and based on the electricity-to-water
    conversion coefficient (E-Wc), the electricity use could be turned into irrigation
    water use, and controlling the electricity purchase could be an alternative method
    to control groundwater withdrawals (Shah et al., 2008, Davies et al., 2014, Jahromi
    et al., 20142014, Wang et al., 2017). With the implementation of the state grid
    transformation project in China, some of the wells in the NCP have been installed
    with smart electricity meters (SEMs), which can provide real-time information
    on electricity consumption and have the intelligent functions of two-way multirate
    metering, user-side control, and two-way data communication. The smart meter provides
    an alternative method for recording irrigation water use based on electricity
    consumption as well as irrigation processes, such as the beginning and ending
    of an irrigation event for a pumping well. Many studies have demonstrated that
    real-time information on water use would not only enable the control of water
    withdrawals but also enable users to understand and monitor their water use to
    increase water-saving awareness (Davies et al., 2014). To control the overall
    groundwater withdrawal, a pre-electricity consumption amount could be allocated
    to each SEM based on the irrigated land of a pumping well covered, the E-Wc for
    that well, and the water rights allocated to the land. The recording of irrigation
    timing by the SEMs also provides a useful tool in forecasting the changes in soil
    water to make future irrigation decisions (Nakabuye et al., 2022, Kumar et al.,
    2023). Previous studies have shown that E-Wc is influenced by declining groundwater
    levels. Li et al. (2022) found that the correlation between electricity consumption
    and groundwater extraction amount was relatively stable when the changes in groundwater
    level were small. It was found that during an irrigation event, the E-Wc fluctuated
    less than 5.7%, and the seasonal variation in the E-Wc for a well was less than
    10% (Wang, 2017, Li et al., 2022). There were large variations in the E-Wc among
    different irrigation methods, with the water pumped per unit electricity consumption
    being the highest for surface irrigation, followed by drip irrigation, and the
    lowest being sprinkler irrigation (Li et al., 2022). To accurately determine the
    E-Wc for a well, the irrigation method, groundwater levels and pump efficiency
    are factors to be considered (Wang et al., 2020, Liang et al., 2020). Deciding
    the right timing and amount to irrigate is an effective measure to improve water
    productivity (Lombardi et al., 2022, Nakabuye et al., 2022). Soil water contents
    are often used for guiding irrigation (Zhang et al., 2015). However, for smallholder
    farmers in the NCP, the installation of soil water sensors is expensive and impractical
    (Li et al., 2022). Against the background of groundwater withdrawal control, how
    to use limited water is becoming more important by optimizing irrigation scheduling.
    Forecasting the changes in soil moisture based on the information obtained from
    historical electricity use and real-time weather data could provide an effective
    method for smallholder farmers in the NCP (Guo et al., 2022). Threshold values
    in soil water contents could be used for guiding irrigation (Singh et al., 2023,
    Magyar et al., 2023). Based on the information collected from the SEMs and real-time
    meteorological data, soil water change forecasting could be achieved to make irrigation
    decisions (Li et al., 2022). Since individual farmers do not have the resources
    and knowledge to collect information, it is necessary to develop a user-friendly
    decision support system to help farmers make irrigation decisions (Car, 2018).
    With the popularization of smartphones, an app could be developed to fulfill this
    purpose. Decision support tools not only improve crop performance but also enhance
    irrigation management and water productivity (Kayad et al., 2021). Therefore,
    it is important to know if the irrigation timing and amount obtained on-line from
    the SEMs could provide reliable information for soil water forecasting, and if
    so, how this forecasting could help farmers to make irrigation decisions. The
    purposes of this study are to develop a framework to integrate real-time information
    from smart electricity meters and soil water forecasting into a smartphone app
    to help farmers make irrigation decisions. The framework and the app were further
    tested to provide references to use the method proposed in this study. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Verifying the electricity-to-water conversion coefficient (E-Wc)
    In the pumping well irrigated region in the NCP, a general electricity-to-water
    conversion coefficient (E-Wc) was developed for each county by the local hydraulic
    Bureaus. To examine whether a general E-Wc could be applied to different wells
    in a region, three pumping wells were installed with smart electricity meters
    (PFSXD-115, Shijiazhuang, China), groundwater level sensors (pressure sensor type,
    PFSWC-311, Taizhou, China) and electromagnetic flowmeters (PFSLM-0201, Nanjing,
    China) to record the real-time electricity consumption, groundwater level and
    water flow rate every five minutes, and the data were uploaded to a cloud platform
    through the built-in 4 G gateway. The data collected were used to analyze the
    beginning of an irrigation event, ending of an irrigation event, electricity used,
    groundwater water level changes and water drawn from the wells to obtain the water
    conversion coefficient (E-Wc) and the changes in E-Wc during irrigation. The E-Wc
    obtained was compared with the general E-Wcs formulated by the local hydraulic
    bureau. Three pumping wells which had groundwater levels below the soil surface
    approximately 35–55 m were used for testing the E-Wcs. The three wells were separately
    used for surface irrigation, sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation. For surface
    irrigation, water was transported to the field by low-pressure water transportation
    pipes, and inside the field along the pipes, there were outlets (10 m apart) installed
    to irrigate each small boarded plot (with an area of approximately 50 m2). For
    drip irrigation, the distance between the two drip lines was 60 cm apart. For
    sprinkler irrigation, the spacing of the two sprinklers was set at 12 m, with
    a working pressure of 0.3 MPa. All the necessary pressure regulation, filters
    and fertigation equipment were installed at the well to ensure the normal operation
    of the system. 2.2. Forecasting the changes in soil water contents and testing
    the forecasting results The water balance equation was used to forecast the soil
    water storage at a daily step for the whole root zone of the crop during the growing
    season: (1) TWDi=TWDi-1+P+I+G+Wr-ET-D-R where TWDi (mm) and TWDi-1 (mm) are the
    total soil water storage on day i and the previous day, i-1, respectively, for
    the root zone profile at time i; P is precipitation (mm), I is irrigation (mm),
    G is capillary rise (mm), D is drainage from the root zone (mm), R is runoff (mm),
    and ET is evapotranspiration from day i-1 to day i (mm). Wr is the soil water
    storage change related to the changes in rooting depth from day i-1 to day i (mm).
    Due to the deep groundwater levels and the small rainfall, G and R were taken
    as zero. The depth of the rooting zone profile at different growing periods was
    decided by the rooting depth (Zr, cm) using the experimental results from the
    field based on the relationship of rooting depth with days after sowing (DAS)
    (Zhang, 1999, Zhang et al., 2004): For winter wheat: Zr=DAS (Before winter dormancy),
    Zr = 50 + 0.348(DAS-50) (during winter dormancy), and Zr = 90 + 1.5 (DAS-170)
    (After winter dormancy). For summer maize, Zr=DAS. At seedling stages (DAS less
    than 40 days), soil depths of 0–40 cm for both crops were considered, without
    considering the Zr value. Drainage was calculated as when the average soil water
    content was over field capacity (FC) by irrigation or rainfall, and the water
    was drained out of the rooting zone. That was, during the simulation of the soil
    water contents, when the average soil water content for the rooting zone was over
    the FC after rainfall or irrigation, it was assigned the value of the FC. The
    daily evapotranspiration was calculated based on the following equation: ET=Kc×Ks×ETo,
    where ETo is the crop reference evapotranspiration, Kc is the crop coefficient
    without water stress and Ks is the soil water stress coefficient, the calculation
    processes for the three parameters in the equationwere as follows: (1) Deciding
    the initial soil water contents: The start was the sowing of winter wheat (approximately
    15 Oct), and the end was the harvesting of maize (30 Sep the following year) to
    finish the whole circle of the two crops as an annual double cropping system.
    Due to the relatively high rainfall amounts during the summer season, which could
    replenish the soil water consumed during the winter wheat season, the soil water
    contents for the 2 m soil profile generally had average values of over 80% of
    the FC. When summer rainfall was low, irrigation was applied to maize or before
    sowing winter wheat to compensate for less rainfall. Therefore, the initial soil
    water contents were set at 80% of FC for the top 2 m soil profile. (2) Total available
    water for the major rooting zone: TAW=Zr× (FC-WP) × 10; total available water
    (TAW, mm) in the rooting zone profile is defined as the total water between field
    capacity (FC, v/v) and wilting point (WP, v/v). Zr (cm) is the rooting depth and
    changed with crop growing stages. (3) Readily available water: RAW= ρ × TWA, RAW
    (mm) is readily available water, which is a fraction (ρ) of TWA in the root zone
    profile that a crop can be extracted without suffering water stress. The lower
    limit of the soil water contents that did not affect crop ET can be determined
    by the equation θL= (1-ρ)(FC-WP)+WP. When the soil water content in the rooting
    zone was over θL, soil water was not a limiting factor to ET, and Ks was taken
    as 1. (4) Deciding Ks: When the soil water content in the rooting zone is below
    θL, ET declines linearly with the decline in soil water content until the wilting
    point, when the ET becomes zero. Ks can be calculated with the following equation:
    Ks= (θ-WP)/(θL-WP), where θ is the actual soil water content in the rooting zone.
    In this study, ρ had a value of 0.50 for winter wheat and 0.45 for summer maize.
    Kc in this study was obtained based on Liu et al. (2002), Zhang et al. (2011)
    and Li et al. (2023), which provides the monthly average Kc or Kc at different
    growing stages without water stress for winter wheat and summer maize in the same
    region. The calculation of the ETo was based on the method of using daily average,
    minimum and maximum temperature (Allen et al., 1998), which are the meteorological
    factors that can be obtained from the online weather data for any county in China.
    (2) ET0=0·0023(Tmean+17·8)(Tmax-Tmin)0·5 Ra where Tmean is the daily mean temperature,
    Tmin and Tmax are the daily minimum and maximum temperatures (°C), respectively,
    and Ra is extraterrestrial radiation. The daily Ra value can be calculated using
    the latitude and day of the year for a location based on the equations provided
    in the FAO 56 (Allen et al., 1998). Units for both ETo and Ra in Eq. 2 are mm/d.
    The change of the unit for Ra from MJ/m2 d to mm/d is to multiply the former by
    0.408 to get the latter (Allen et al., 1998). A long-term irrigation study at
    Luancheng Experimental Station in the NCP was used to test the soil water forecasting
    method used in this study. The irrigation study included six irrigation treatments
    from one irrigation (irrigation at sowing maize, without other irrigations during
    both growing seasons of winter wheat and maize, I1) up to six irrigations (I6,
    defined as full irrigation) for the annual double cropping of winter wheat and
    summer maize, and the soil water contents for each treatment were monitored by
    neutron probes (503DR, CPN International Inc. USA) and automatic soil water sensors
    (Insentek soil water sensors, Eastern Ecology Company, China, in the 2018–2019
    season). The detailed experimental conditions can be found in Zhang et al., 2017,
    Zhang et al., 2021. The soil water monitoring results from 2018–2019 and 2021–2022
    for the two irrigation treatments (I1 and I6) were used to compare the simulated
    and the measured soil water contents. 2.3. Deciding the irrigation timing and
    amount The optimized irrigation timing for winter wheat and summer maize was decided
    following the soil water threshold values developed in this region (Zhang et al.,
    2018; Wang et al., 2022) as follows: Irrigation was applied when soil water contents
    were lower than 60% FC for the top 50 cm soil profile from the seedling to recovery
    stage, 65% from jointing to anthesis for the top 65 cm soil profile, and 60% for
    the top 80 cm soil profile during grain filling for winter wheat. For summer maize,
    irrigation was applied when soil water contents were lower than 65% FC for the
    top 40 cm soil profile before the V9 (9 leaf) stage, 70% FC from the V9 to R2
    (Blister) stage for the top 50 cm soil profile, and 65% FC from the R2 to R5 (Dent)
    stage for the top 60 cm soil profile. The irrigation amount was applied to bring
    the soil water contents to FC for the major rooting zone. 2.4. Database established
    to support the running of the framework To use smart electricity meters to control
    groundwater withdrawals and optimize irrigation scheduling, the databases listed
    in Table 1 were needed. The functions and data sources of each database are provided
    in Table 1. Table 1. Databases created to run the framework to guide irrigation

    to harvesting for winter wheat and maize under sufficient water supply to calculate
    daily ET without water stress The monthly crop coefficients for winter wheat and
    maize without water stress were interpolated into five-day average values Daily
    weather data (Weather database): Daily average, minimum and maximum temperature,
    rainfall; and a 7-days’ forecasted values to calculate ETo and for soil moisture

    data from the websites of the meteorological bureau of each county Soil water
    threshold value database Threshold values in soil water contents for deciding
    irrigation timing and amount Based on the major soil types and the water rights,
    the threshold values for soil water contents at different growing stages of winter
    wheat and maize were created for each county. 2.5. The work flow of the framework
    The framework to conduct the soil water simulation and determine the irrigation
    timing and amount was as follows (Fig. 1): The user firstly inputtheSEM series
    number of his pumping well, location of the farmland, land area and irrigation
    method (surface, sprinkler or drip); then, the electricity use history, the E-Wc
    and water rights from the databases were used to obtain the irrigation history
    of the land, irrigation water used, and irrigation water available. Furthermore,
    based on the soil, daily weather and crop coefficient databases, the historic
    soil water change and the current soil water status would be simulated, and irrigation
    decisions would be made by comparing the current soil water conditions with the
    threshold values for different irrigation water availability to make the decision
    of whether irrigation should be applied or not. If yes, the suitable irrigation
    amount would be converted to electricity consumption to guide the user to conduct
    irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size

    2.6. Testing the framework An app (application) named “irrigation decision support
    system” was developed and could be installed on a computer or a smartphone to
    carry out soil water forecasting and make irrigation decisions following the abovementioned
    framework. All the real-time databases were stored on a server, and the app was
    directly connected with the server to carry out the necessary simulations. A user-friendly
    interface was created to guide the users to use this app. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Electricity-to-water conversion coefficients (E-Wc) Average E-Wc values every
    20 min during two irrigation events for a surface irrigation pumping well were
    provided in Fig. 2, which indicated a relatively stable E-Wc value.The average
    E-Wc was 2.72 m3/kWh with a groundwater depth at 52.42 m for irrigation conducted
    on 21 March 2022, which was an irrigation for winter wheat. For irrigation on
    June 20, 2022, which was for the germination of summer maize, the average E-Wc
    value was 2.57 m3/kWh with groundwater depth at 55.30 m. There was a slight decline
    in the water pumped per unit electricity consumption with the declining in groundwater
    levels. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download : Download full-size

    method. Similar changes were observed for pumping wells with drip and sprinkler
    irrigation (Fig. 3). The average E-Wc was 2.64 m3/kWh at groundwater depth of
    36.9 m for drip irrigation, and 2.07 m3/kWh at groundwater depth of 41.39 m for
    sprinkler irrigation. The results showed that E-Wc was also relatively stable
    for drip and sprinkler irrigation methods, but the energy consumption was greater
    than that for surface irrigation methods, especially for sprinkler irrigation
    due to its high-pressure requirements in delivering the water to crops (Campos
    et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (169KB) Download : Download

    For plains located in the piedmont of the Taihang Mountains, the irrigation water
    mostly comes from shallow underground water, with the groundwater depth below
    the soil surface changing from 15 m in the north to 60 m in the south. The E-Wc
    provided by the hydraulic bureau varied from 4.51 to 2.23 m3/kWh for the surface
    irrigation method; generally, with a 10 m increase in groundwater depth, the E-Wc
    was reduced by 0.15 m3/kWh (Li et al., 2022). The county where the tested well
    is located has an average value of 2.67 m3/kWh for surface irrigation, which is
    quite similar to the results of this study. The E-Wc database created in this
    study used the officially formulated data for each county and was calibrated using
    the equations in Li et al. (2022). Wang et al. (2020) suggested that the main
    challenge in obtaining the E-Wc lies in the variations among different pumping
    wells. They found that the conversion error for an individual well was less than
    20%. Conversion could be developed based on the theoretical relation between lift,
    energy use and pumping rate. However, due to the heterogeneity in hydrogeological
    conditions as well as the difference in pump types, ages and working conditions,
    large deviations were observed between the actual relation and the theoretical
    relation for estimating the E-Wc (Foster et al., 2015, Ursitti et al., 2018, Li
    et al., 2022). Trade-offs in precisely obtaining groundwater with reasonable efforts
    regarding data collection could be considered in the selection of water metering
    methods. Wang et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2020 suggested that energy-based groundwater
    abstraction monitoring outperforms direct water metering with respect to cost
    and robustness, and it provides satisfactory data accuracy and equitability in
    regions where irrigation wells are powered by electricity. 3.2. Soil moisture
    forecasting 3.2.1. Comparing the methods in calculation of ETo In this study,
    Eq. 2 was used to calculate the daily ETo using the real-time daily average Tmean,
    Tmin and Tmax for each county obtained online. The ETo calculated using the Penmen-Monteith
    equation, which requires the input of daily Tmin, Tmax, wind speed, sunshine hours
    and humidity, were compared with the ETo simplified using the temperature information,
    as shown in Fig. 4. Similar daily values for the two methods were obtained, and
    the ETo calculated from the temperature information could be used to replace the
    ETo calculated from the Penmen-Monteith equation. Download : Download high-res

    site. 3.2.2. Testing the soil water content forecasting using the water balance
    equations Using the water balance equation (Eq. 1) to simulate the soil water
    contents for winter wheat and summer maize in two years, the simulated soil water
    contents were compared with the measured ones under two irrigation treatments
    (Fig. 5). The results in the 2018–2019 season showed that the simulated soil water
    contents for the rooting soil profile during both winter wheat and summer maize
    growing season were all in good agreement with the measured values either using
    the automatic sensors to obtain the daily values or the neutron probe to obtain
    regular values (R2 was over 0.9, P < 0.01). The RMSE was 0.0139 and NRMSE was
    5.21% for I6 and 0.0204% and 8.71%, respectively, for I1. Further testing using
    results from 2021–2022 was shown in Fig. 6. The rainfall in the summer maize season
    was greater than that in the 2018–2019 season, and the simulated values were also
    in good agreement with the measured values. The RMSE was 0.0139 and NRMSE was
    5.21% for I6 and 0.0204% and 8.71%, respectively, for I1. Download : Download

    using the measured neutron probe soil water content values as compared with the
    simulated ones during the growing seasons of winter wheat and summer maize in
    2021–2022 under one irrigation (I1) and six irrigations (I6). The top figure was
    the daily rainfall (R) and irrigation (Irri) (except for marking the irrigation
    for I1, all the irrigation was for I6). Crops depend on soil water to meet their
    water requirements, and soil water content is often used as a direct indicator
    for deciding when and how much to irrigate (Arunadevi et al., 2022). The availability
    of soil water to crops also depends on the rooting system, and the soil moisture
    at the root zone profile matters to the crop (Wu et al., 2022). In this study,
    either the simulated or the measured soil water content values were the average
    values for the rooting zone profile, which changed with the root growth of the
    crops. Therefore, the method used in this study in the simulation of the soil
    water contents considered the change in rooting depth of the two crops during
    their growing seasons. The adjusted crop coefficient by soil water contents, as
    shown in Fig. 5, indicated that its change was in accordance with the soil water
    conditions under the two irrigated treatments, and the actual evapotranspiration
    could be precisely simulated. The soil water availability to crops at a certain
    soil layer is affected not only by soil water contents but also by the root availability
    (Li et al., 2018b, Shi et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2004). Roots were not uniformly
    distributed along the soil profile, and there was a general extinction coefficient
    describing the decline in root amount with the increase in soil depth (Jackson
    et al., 1996). Zhang et al. (2015) proposed a method of incorporating the root
    distribution factor into the relative available soil water to establish the threshold
    values of soil water contents in guiding irrigation decisions. Further studies
    might be required to consider both the rooting depth and the root distribution
    factor for deciding the Ks. 3.3. Using a smartphone app to guide irrigation management
    Users could scan a QR code (quick response code) to directly connect with the
    website to obtain information on the irrigation history, irrigation water used,
    dynamic changes in soil water contents in his or her own fields, and irrigation
    suggestions. The user could also install the irrigation decision app on a smart
    mobile phone. For the first run of the decision system either using the app or
    directly on the website, the user needs to input information on the series number
    of his or her SEMs, the location of the field, and irrigation methods (Fig. 7).
    From this background information, the electricity use history, soil type, weather
    data, E-Wc, Kc, and water rights were obtained from the database for running the
    app. On the screen, the water rights, water used and the water remaining shall
    be displayed for the reference of the users (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res

    users click the soil water forecasting option, the changes in soil water contents
    should be displayed on the screen, together with the threshold value of the soil
    water contents for deciding if irrigation should be applied (Fig. 8). The simulation
    in the soil water content change was carried out starting from the sowing of winter
    wheat to the day of the running of the app. Next 15 days forecast in soil water
    contents was also carried out based on the weather forecasting data automatically
    collected from the online information for each county. Based on the comparison
    of the current soil water contents and the threshold soil water values, irrigation
    decisions could be made, and irrigation amounts could be calculated to bring the
    soil water contents in the major rooting zone to field capacity. Download : Download

    decision and forecasting the changes in soil water contents by using the irrigation
    decision APP. Precisely setting up irrigation scheduling depends on the estimation
    of the soil water contents or plant water status (Asiimwe et al., 2022; Panigrahi,
    2023; Selvaraj et al., 2023). There are many methods available for directly monitoring
    the soil and plant water status, such as automatic soil water sensors or canopy
    temperature monitoring to assess the crop water stress index. All these methods
    required equipment to obtain the data. Small-scale households may not be able
    to afford to purchase equipment for monitoring, and there might be some pre-requirements
    in technologies in using some equipment that might restrict the use of those methods.
    The method provided in this study can be applied without cost, and farmers can
    easily obtain information and guidance for irrigation scheduling. 3.4. Advantages
    and limitations in using the smart electricity meter in irrigation management
    Deciding when and how much to irrigate depends on the continuous monitoring of
    soil water or crop water status. There are several methods available to obtain
    soil moisture contents, such as the in-situ direct measurements, remote and proximal
    sensing techniques (Kashyap and Kumar, 2021). Due to the small farmland area for
    each household in the NCP, and different households generally use different irrigation
    scheduling, resulting in the large difference in soil water conditions between
    two adjacent fields from two households. The difference might be difficult to
    be captured by the normal remote sensing methods. The in-situ soil moisture measuring
    needs equipment to be installed to each field to manually or remotely obtain soil
    moisture conditions. However, cheap and practical soil moisture sensors are not
    easily available to the local farmers, which restricts the use of this technology.
    The soil moisture simulation developed in this study was based on the information
    remotely collected from the SEMs, which can provide real-time information on electricity
    consumption to be converted into the beginning and ending of an irrigation event
    for a field, and the real-time information can be further used for simulation
    of the soil moisture changes and forecasting the next irrigation event (Nakabuye
    et al., 2022, Kumar et al., 2023). The real-time information on water use could
    be further used to control underground water withdrawals by assigning a pre-electricity
    consumption quota. The method developed in this study doesn’t need extra cost,
    and could be easily used with a mobile phone, which is already becoming popular
    in rural regions in China. The framework developed in this paper depended on the
    automatic collection of the electricity consumption for individual farmers for
    a pumping well. Currently, the SEMs were installed in each pumping well, and a
    pumping well covered farmland generally owned by several farmers in the NCP, except
    for collectively managed farmland. Therefore, distinguishing the electricity consumption
    among the several farmers for a pumping well would be important for the framework
    to be used in practice. There are several ways this could be done. First, a module
    could be installed with a SEM, each user was assigned a number, and the electricity
    use could be recorded with each number. Second, when using the app, the user could
    manually input the electricity use information for soil water simulation. Groundwater
    has been widely used for irrigation around the world, which has resulted in groundwater
    overuse in many regions. Controlling groundwater withdrawals requires water metering.
    Due to the difficulties and high costs of installing water meters in each pumping
    well, pumping volumes are often estimated from information based on electricity
    consumption. A precisely obtained conversion coefficient from electricity consumption
    to water volume pumped would be quite important in using electricity monitoring
    or controlling groundwater withdrawals. Previous studies have shown that this
    coefficient is influenced by many factors, such as groundwater level, pump type
    and efficiency as well as irrigation methods. In this study, the average E-Wc
    values for three irrigation methods were assigned to a county based on the general
    pumping conditions. The specific pump working conditions were not considered,
    which might cause some errors in the estimation of the irrigation water amount.
    Further studies might be required to develop a more accurate E-Wc for different
    pump types and adjusted for the changes in groundwater levels. A preset electricity
    consumption quote could be assigned to each SEM to control the groundwater withdrawals.
    The quote could be decided based on the local groundwater availability and the
    irrigated land each SEM covered. SEMs provide an alternative method to control
    groundwater use. The irrigation decision in this study was based on the previously
    developed soil water threshold values. Under different availability of irrigation
    water and different weather conditions, the optimized irrigation scheduling and
    the low limit in soil water control would change. Therefore, further studies are
    required to set up soil water threshold values for irrigation decisions under
    different irrigation water availabilities and forecasted future rainfall. 4. Conclusions
    For regions using groundwater as irrigation water sources and that need to control
    the decline in groundwater levels, real-time recording of groundwater use would
    be important to control the over-withdrawal of groundwater resources. For irrigation
    scheduling, deciding when and how much to irrigate is important to increase irrigation
    use efficiency. The results from this study showed that SEMs could be used for
    controlling groundwater withdrawals as well as providing information on irrigation
    timing and irrigation amount to forecast soil water contents for future irrigation
    decisions. With the popularity of smart mobile phones, individual farmers can
    easily access this information and make irrigation decisions. The framework and
    the testing results shown in this study proved the reliability of this method
    and its ease of use. Limitations of this method include precisely setting up the
    E-Wc values for individual pumping wells and soil water contents for guiding irrigation
    decisions based on irrigation water availability and rainfall forecasting. The
    app developed in this study is location specific. Further studies are required
    for generalization of the app. CRediT authorship contribution statement Liwei

  description: Reported technological tools for irrigation scheduling lack the integration
    of real-time crop measurements, weather forecasting, and the limitations and variabilities
    introduced by human operation. Moreover, most of these tools do not provide practical
    irrigation recommendations, limiting their adoption and benefits in enhancing
    agricultural efficiency and reducing environmental impact. To address these challenges,
    we propose an adaptive and predictive irrigation management decision support system
    by formulating a feedback plus feedforward algorithm that uses modeling, estimation,
    prediction, and control strategies. The major feature of this DSS is the consideration
    of human intervention in the control loop. The DSS integrates field data, including
    soil moisture, rain, temperature, and irrigation, in addition to weather forecasting.
    It gives irrigation managers precise and practical instructions on how much to
    irrigate based on preferences for irrigation events. The DSS adapts in real-time
    to provide irrigation volume recommendations that ensure optimal soil moisture

    Get rights and content Highlights • Novel DSS for irrigation control integrating
    human intervention into the loop. • The DSS has the potential of 30% water savings
    in seepage irrigated crops. • The algorithm uses real-time data and forecasts
    for precise irrigation scheduling. • The DSS uses a control-oriented model to
    estimate soil moisture with high confidence. • DSS maintains optimal soil moisture,
    reducing leaching and runoff risks. Abstract Reported technological tools for
    irrigation scheduling lack the integration of real-time crop measurements, weather
    forecasting, and the limitations and variabilities introduced by human operation.
    Moreover, most of these tools do not provide practical irrigation recommendations,
    limiting their adoption and benefits in enhancing agricultural efficiency and
    reducing environmental impact. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive
    and predictive irrigation management decision support system by formulating a
    feedback plus feedforward algorithm that uses modeling, estimation, prediction,
    and control strategies. The major feature of this DSS is the consideration of
    human intervention in the control loop. The DSS integrates field data, including
    soil moisture, rain, temperature, and irrigation, in addition to weather forecasting.
    It gives irrigation managers precise and practical instructions on how much to
    irrigate based on preferences for irrigation events. The DSS adapts in real-time
    to provide irrigation volume recommendations that ensure optimal soil moisture
    levels are maintained. Our approach includes the incorporation of a simplified
    control-oriented model (COM) to characterize the soil moisture dynamics, a data
    processing stage that makes the measured data compatible with the COM, a parameter
    estimation stage that guarantees an optimal adjustment of the COM parameters,
    a control stage that uses the parametrized COM, measured information from the

    controlPrecision irrigation 1. Introduction Agriculture is the base of our socio-economical
    model, and its development plays an essential role in the welfare of nations (Gollin
    et al., 2002). However, agriculture has a high environmental impact and can be
    considered one of the most important contributors to global environmental degradation
    (Mueller et al., 2012). Furthermore, as the global population continues to grow,
    there is an urgent need to increase food production. This already complex challenge
    is further intensified by accelerated environmental changes, characterized by
    significant shifts in precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme weather
    events such as heavy rains, heatwaves, and droughts (Bisbis et al., 2018). Consequently,
    it is critical to develop strategies to enhance agricultural production while
    mitigating its environmental impact. In this context, improvements in irrigation
    scheduling play an important role, not only because agriculture is the consumer
    of almost 70% of freshwater resources (Jalilvand et al., 2019), but also because
    appropriate irrigation scheduling can help to increase the yield production and
    minimize the leaching of nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metal to freshwater
    sources (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). Incorporating technological tools could be a
    viable solution to improve irrigation scheduling, where the aim is to make irrigation
    decisions based on the needs of the crops, establishing when the crops need water
    and how much water needs to be applied. Numerous studies have centered on developing
    tools that accurately detect plant water stress conditions to determine optimal
    irrigation. For instance, Torres et al. (2019) employed near-infrared spectroscopy
    to measure in-situ leaf relative water content. In parallel, other approaches
    assess plant water requirements using soil moisture sensors (SMS) positioned in
    the target zone. The use of SMS is the most adopted technology for irrigation
    scheduling in the USA (USDA, 2018, Taghvaeian et al., 2020), and in many scenarios,
    a common response to identified irrigation needs is implementing feedback threshold
    control by using SMS (Dukes et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2010, Zhang et al.,
    2017, Li et al., 2018, Cayuela et al., 2022, Simionesei et al., 2020), or using
    fuzzy-based decision systems (Culman et al., 2019, Stone et al., 2020). Both strategies
    define levels based on measured stress conditions or soil moisture. However, the
    methodology for setting these threshold levels is not versatile enough to accommodate
    the diversity of crops, soils, and environmental conditions. Furthermore, these
    thresholds often remain static, not accounting for the evolving needs of crops
    influenced by environmental factors, intrinsic crop properties, and growth stages.
    Accurately determining the volume of water needed for irrigation entails a comprehensive
    understanding of plant water consumption concerning environmental variables, specific
    crop attributes, and growth stages (Lopez-Jimenez et al., 2022). Many decision
    support systems employ crop measurements coupled with AI to estimate and compensate
    for water losses from the evapotranspiration process (Katimbo et al., 2023). The
    works developed by Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et al. (2019) aim
    to bolster decision-support systems for agricultural irrigation by incorporating
    analytical models such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM). This comprehensive
    model features modules covering soil water balance, nutrient dynamics, equilibrium
    soil chemistry, potential evapotranspiration, surface energy balance, heat transfer,
    pesticide processes, and plant growth, relying on the Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). RZWQM has been widely utilized to simulate
    the impacts of agricultural management strategies on crop yields and soil and
    water quality (Ma et al., 2012). Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et
    al. (2019) use RZWQM for computing irrigation scheduling based on measurable crop
    conditions, predefined threshold values, and numerical solutions generated by
    the model. Nonetheless, employing RZWQM to compute irrigation scheduling in a
    feedback scheme presents significant challenges due to its inherent complexity
    and rigidity. The model’s detailed structure complicates the straightforward analyses
    and inclusion of user-specified requirements and the adaptation to overcome discrepancies
    between the crop and the model. Furthermore, RZWQM is restricted to a predefined
    set of cultivars, limiting its versatility to diverse agricultural settings. The
    complexity also imposes computational constraints, making real-time feedback control
    based on the current soil moisture state and crop stages challenging. These limitations
    underscore the necessity for more versatile, adaptive, and computationally efficient
    irrigation scheduling strategies. To this end, some studies have explored advanced
    control theory as a systematic approach to the irrigation problem (Saleem et al.,
    2013, Delgoda et al., 2016, Shang et al., 2020). As mentioned by Romero et al.
    (2012) and Ding et al. (2018), using advanced control strategies in agriculture
    has a high potential to increase efficiency. However, tangible applications are
    sparse. Much of the documented research revolves around simulations (Romero et
    al., 2012). While comprehensive on paper, some models oversimplify real-world
    scenarios by presupposing fully instrumented crops. Contrarily, in practical settings,
    agricultural systems often struggle with control limitations. In many irrigation
    systems, manual intervention dominates, where operators activate or deactivate
    pumps, manage ditches, and manipulate valves or gates to regulate irrigation.
    In summary, we evidence a lack of irrigation strategies that balance efficiency,
    practicality, and real crop management considerations. Many current methods rely
    heavily on static thresholds or intricate models, which often do not adapt dynamically
    to changing environmental conditions, diverse crop needs, irrigation management
    practices, and different growth stages. Moreover, while advanced control theory
    holds promise, there is an absence of advanced control strategies that account
    for real-world complexities and manual human intervention in the operation of
    irrigation systems, where the timely human response to crop needs, actuation precision,
    and operational reliability are important elements that influence the controlled
    system. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this research is to use
    control theory to enhance the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly in
    real agricultural scenarios that are often human-operated. We propose developing
    a novel control-based algorithm for a DSS for irrigation scheduling capable of
    computing practical irrigation instructions based on field measurements and weather
    forecasting, which is designed to be adaptable to the grower’s or irrigation manager’s
    operational limitations, preferences, and experience and must compensate for uncertainties
    introduced by human intervention. We have formulated our DSS around a simplified
    proposed control-oriented model (COM), which describes the soil moisture dynamics;
    a data processing stage, which makes the measured data compatible with the COM;
    a parameter estimation stage, which guarantees an optimal adjustment of the COM
    parameters based on measured information from the crop; and a control stage, which
    uses the parametrized COM, measured information from the crop, and information
    from weather forecasting to compute the appropriate irrigation instructions that
    maintain the soil moisture close to a desired level. We evaluated our algorithm
    using collected data from a seepage-irrigated commercial sweetcorn field in South
    Florida. Our evaluations covered each component of our system, from model validation
    to overall system performance. As a principal outcome, the proposed algorithm
    presents the potential to save 30% of water in this type of irrigation system.
    This water-saving is facilitated through effective and achievable computed irrigation
    scheduling that maintains soil moisture within a targeted range. Such control
    preserves optimal growing conditions and minimizes environmental risks by preventing
    runoff, percolation, and the leaching of hazardous agricultural chemicals into
    the surrounding ecosystem. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 starts with an overview of soil moisture and irrigation scheduling,
    establishes the problem of formulating a control-oriented DSS for irrigation scheduling,
    and offers a detailed description of the proposed DSS algorithm. Section 3 describes
    the process following to validate the proposed algorithm. In Section 4, the results
    of the validation are presented and discussed. Finally, in Section 5, some conclusions
    are drawn. 2. Methods 2.1. Process description and problem formulation The relationship
    between irrigation, soil, plants, and the environment constitutes a complex system
    that requires practical concepts and analogies to formulate optimal irrigation
    strategies. As delineated in Eisenhauer et al. (2021), soil can be conceptualized
    as a reservoir, with different levels representing the amount of water available
    for plant uptake. We adopt this conceptual framework to simplify a complex problem
    that involves agriculture, control theory, and human interaction and to formulate
    the control problem on a DSS for irrigation management. Within this context, we
    identify key input and output variables, delineate desired conditions or set points,
    and specify agricultural constraints and human limitations. Download : Download

    of soil moisture states significant for plant-water relations and irrigation control
    based on Eisenhauer et al. (2021). The Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) delineates
    the lower threshold of soil water content at which plants cannot recover from
    water stress, marking the limiting boundary for plant survivability. The Maximum
    Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical reference, as soil moisture levels
    below this point result in sub-optimal physiological responses in plants. The
    soil moisture range between MADP and Field Capacity (FC) is optimal for plant
    growth, balancing water availability and stress prevention. Surpassing FC leads
    to inefficient water use, soil structural degradation, anaerobic root conditions,
    nutrient leaching, and the potential for surface water pollution. Beyond the Saturation
    Point (SP), the soil reaches its hydraulic limit, becoming incapable of retaining
    additional moisture. Fig. 1 illustrates this analogy: the base level, or the Permanent
    Wilting Point (PWP), indicates that below this threshold level, plants cannot
    extract water from the soil, leading to irreversible wilting. The next critical
    point is the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP); if the soil moisture drops
    below this level, the plants undergo water stress, potentially reducing yield.
    Consequently, MADP often serves as a guideline for irrigation decisions as the
    lower limit. However, its precise value, i.e., the percentage of MADP as the lower
    limit, can vary based on the crop, its growth stage, and prevailing climatic conditions.
    For instance, Bayabil et al. (2023) demonstrated that using only 75% of the expected
    MADP saved 25% of water consumption, with no reduction in sweet corn yield. Similarly,
    strategic deficit irrigation during certain growth stages of wine grapes enhances
    fruit quality for winemaking (Kang et al., 2023). From a control systems perspective,
    the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical set-point or lower-bound
    constraint that must be maintained. Failure to uphold soil moisture levels at
    or above this threshold can lead to suboptimal plant physiological responses and
    yield reduction. The Field Capacity (FC) is defined as the soil water content
    threshold beyond which the gravitational drainage is negligible and is considered
    the upper limit. Below FC, the capillary actions keep the water stored in the
    soil pores. Irrigating until reaching FC and avoiding exceeding field capacity
    prevents the leaching of nutrients and pesticides applied to the crops. The saturation
    point (SP) is attained when the soil can no longer retain water, leading to runoff
    on the surface, which poses significant environmental concerns. Soil texture significantly
    influences key hydraulic characteristics such as the PWP, FC, and SP. Saxton and
    Rawls (2006) provide detailed hydraulic characteristics across various soil textures,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2. From this figure, it becomes evident that managing irrigation
    in sandy soil is notably challenging. A simple 5% fluctuation in water content
    in such soil can either lead to plant wilting or result in water wastage. In contrast,
    silt soils offer better flexibility: water content can vary by as much as 24%
    without triggering any adverse agricultural or ecological consequences. Therefore,
    the soil’s proportion of sand, silt, and clay plays an important role in the control
    problem definition and for specific irrigation decisions. Conceptually, for control
    purposes, soil can be viewed as a storage unit, where the area depends on the
    soil texture, the control input is irrigation, and the control objective is maintaining
    the volumetric water content to a desired level. However, additional considerations
    must also be included in the case of a DSS for irrigation control. Download :

    Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) of 50% of the available water for each
    soil class. Points over each bar denote the specific values. This figure is based
    on the hydraulic characteristics reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006). 2.1.1. Control
    challenges on a decision support system for irrigation scheduling A DSS for irrigation
    scheduling is particularly useful in farm systems with no automatic control elements,
    where the grower or irrigation manager carries out irrigation actions. In our
    proposed DSS, the control problem is to use available information from crops and
    weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions that help the user minimize
    the error between desired and measured soil moisture. Below, we discuss some considerations
    that must be addressed. Timely Human Response: The grower or irrigation manager
    cannot execute irrigation instructions quickly and suddenly. For that, even if
    sensors and computational capabilities can offer periodic information with sampling
    periods of minutes or seconds, this information will be unhelpful and might overwhelm
    or confuse the operator. Moreover, if an irrigation instruction suddenly appears
    when the operator is unavailable to make an irrigation action, it might not generate
    the expected result. Actuation Precision: Many conventional irrigation systems
    rely on actuators that operate more as binary switches than precision instruments.
    In agriculture, it is common to find devices such as on–off pumps, gates, weirs,
    and valves, which are unsuited for precise operation. Hence, recommendations should
    be straightforward and actionable, such as suggesting irrigation during a time
    rather than maintaining a specific flow rate. Human Reliability: Even with precise
    recommendations from the DSS, human behavior introduces variability. External
    influences can alter the final action taken, introducing a layer of uncertainty.
    Considered Measurable Variables: In most agricultural practices, rain ( ), irrigation
    ( ), and temperature ( ) are the main measurable variables affecting root zone
    soil moisture ( ). While capillary effects from the deep soil also influence root
    zone soil moisture, quantifying these effects necessitates more elaborated measurement
    techniques compared to the direct measurement of the aforementioned variables.
    Integration of Weather Forecasts: Meteorological advancements have made weather
    predictions increasingly accurate. Governments worldwide are making concerted
    efforts to provide weather forecasts as part of impact-based decision-support
    services. These forecasts, especially regarding expected rainfall and temperature,
    are crucial for making informed irrigation decisions, ensuring optimal water use,
    and supporting crop health. 2.2. Proposed approach We address the control challenges
    by proposing a DSS presented in Fig. 3, which integrates measured information
    from the crop and weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions. The
    DSS integrates control theory and accommodates timely human response by working
    periodically and allowing the grower to determine the irrigation period1 for these
    executions. Furthermore, the DSS provides practical and realizable irrigation
    instructions, given in units of volume per irrigation period or irrigation time
    per irrigation period. For instance, if the grower selects a two-day irrigation
    period, the DSS will calculate the necessary volume of water or irrigation time
    that must be applied for each two-day interval. Download : Download high-res image

    proposed Decision Support System (DSS) for irrigation scheduling. The description
    illustrates the measured variables, where represents the instant time when the
    data is obtained, indicates the temperature, rain, soil moisture, and irrigation.
    The DSS is formulated with four main components: (i) the control-oriented model
    (COM), used as a base of the control algorithm; (ii) the data processing stage
    for aligning multi-temporal sensor data with algorithmic components; (iii) a parameter
    estimation stage for updating model parameters ( ); and (iv) a control algorithm
    that utilizes the COM, estimated parameters, processed measurements, and weather
    forecasts to calculate irrigation instructions ( ). The DSS uses measured variables
    from the crop, where rain and temperature can be obtained from a weather station,
    and volumetric water content can be obtained from soil moisture sensors. To address
    the system’s robustness against human variability in irrigation execution, our
    DSS additionally considers measuring this execution, i.e., obtaining measurements
    of irrigation time per irrigation period or volume of water per irrigation period.
    This measurement can be obtained from flowmeters or sensors for flow detection.
    The proposed approach (Fig. 3) is supported by (i) a COM of the SM, (ii) a data
    processing stage, (iii) a parameter estimation stage, and (iv) a control algorithm.
    In this approach, the COM serves as a parametrizable model that characterizes
    soil moisture as a function of processed measured variables and parameters to
    be estimated. At each irrigation period, the estimation stage calculates and updates
    the parameters. Then, the control stage uses the COM, the estimated parameters,
    soil moisture measurements, and weather forecasting data to determine the appropriate
    irrigation action that maintains the soil moisture at the desired value. A detailed
    breakdown of each component of the DSS is provided below. 2.2.1. Proposed control-oriented
    model for soil moisture The most important element of the proposed strategy is
    the COM. In agriculture, traditional models often focus on capturing the complexity
    of various biophysical processes. Although accurate, these models are often computationally
    expensive and not straightforwardly applicable for control design. We have derived
    the COM from a simplified water balance, as Fig. 4 describes. This model considers
    the soil a storage unit, where a linear combination of adaptable parameters and
    measured variables performs a water balance with inputs, including rain, irrigation,
    and upward capillarity. On the other hand, outputs include evapotranspiration,
    deep percolation, and runoff. The choice of a simplified model inevitably raises
    concerns about the sacrifice of modeling accuracy. However, in our DSS algorithm,
    this drawback is mitigated by continual parameter estimation based on real-time
    data and by incorporating feedback in the control equation. Our COM is formulated
    based on three assumptions: Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download

    dynamics, where , and are outputs associated with evapotranspiration, and deep
    percolation; , , and are inputs associated to rain, irrigation, and capillary
    rise. Assumption 1 Model Sampling Period The COM is formulated with a fixed time
    step, denoted by , corresponding to the irrigation period. This fixed period allows
    for the discretization of soil moisture dynamics, indexed by the variable . Our
    DSS algorithm is based on the COM, which is discrete and will describe the soil
    moisture dynamics according to the irrigation period ( ). The grower or irrigation
    manager can configure to suit their operational preferences. Consequently, the
    COM and, by extension, the DSS algorithm are adaptable to those preferences. For
    instance, if a two-day irrigation period is selected, the COM will effectively
    model soil moisture dynamics under this discrete time interval. It is highlighted
    that, in practice, sensors often provide data at multiple sampling frequencies.
    We have designed specific data management techniques to reconcile this multiplicity
    of data with the user-defined irrigation period . These techniques are detailed
    in Section 2.2.2. Assumption 2 Soil Moisture Average During an appropriate irrigation
    period, it is reasonable to presume that the available water for the plants within
    the root zone is closely around an average soil moisture value, denoted as . This
    assumption enables us to formulate the control objective as maintaining this average
    soil moisture close to a desired level . This assumption simplifies both the model
    and the DSS algorithm. However, we clarify that choosing a lengthy irrigation
    period might be comfortable for the irrigation manager but can be risky for the
    plant’s health. Conversely, opting for shorter irrigation periods can mitigate
    potential water deficit issues during this period, but at the expense of demand
    for more managerial time. The optimal irrigation period depends on the crop type,
    environmental conditions, and highly on soil type. For instance, sandy soils,
    characterized by low water retention capacities, necessitate shorter irrigation
    periods than silt soils, which can retain almost six times more water (see Fig.
    2). It is pertinent to note that the temporal resolution of the COM is directly
    correlated with the chosen irrigation period . A shorter irrigation period effectively
    enhances the temporal resolution, allowing the model to capture more rapid fluctuations
    in soil moisture and other variables. However, this comes at the expense of increased
    computational and managerial demands. The adaptability in selecting allows for
    a trade-off between temporal resolution and operational convenience. Assumption
    3 Linear Relation Soil moisture operates as a causal system. The future average
    soil moisture is influenced by its prior water content and the inputs and outputs
    during this irrigation period. We are considering average soil moisture variation
    between successive irrigation periods, which is represented as , as a linear relation
    of the water balance during such irrigation period. We are formulating that in
    the upcoming irrigation period, the soil moisture average will depend on the actual
    soil moisture average and a linear combination between parameters (rates of change)
    and accumulated amounts of water inputs and outputs during the current irrigation
    period. In this form, we denote water input as the accumulated amount of rain
    during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change between and
    . Note that the rain units are commonly expressed in units of the water depth
    accumulated in the area under study. Since is a summation of measurements, it
    retains the same depth units, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture
    per unit of depth. Similarly, we denote the input as the accumulated amount of
    irrigation during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change
    between and . Irrigation can be measured in units of depth, volume, or, in our
    case, for simplifying sensor instrumentation and data acquisition, irrigation
    time. reflects the total time that the crop is irrigated during the irrigation
    period, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture per unit of time. To streamline
    the electronic instrumentation, we are not considering measured variables corresponding
    to the capillary rise input, as this capillary rise comes from the water table.
    Instead, the input associated with capillary rise will be treated as an unknown
    parameter, denoted by . As discussed in the process description (Section 2.1),
    the infiltration and runoff are directly related to the soil moisture. For that,
    we are associating this output to the combination between the soil moisture average
    and the parameter , which is adimensional and represents the rate of change between
    and . The most adopted method to evaluate evapotranspiration is the FAO-56. This
    method requires the measurement of multiple environmental variables beyond the
    scope of our DSS, such as net radiation, soil heat flux, wind speed, saturation
    vapor pressure, and actual vapor pressure. Inspired by simpler models such as
    the Hargreaves Method (Gao et al., 2017), we overcome this issue by relating evapotranspiration
    directly to the temperature average ( ) via the estimated parameter , which has
    soil moisture per temperature units and describes the rate of change between and
    . Therefore, according to the assumptions and the proposed linear combinations
    that describe the system inputs and outputs, our parametrizable COM is formulated
    as (1) where , , , , and are positive parameters to be estimated, and the variables
    , , , and are obtained in the data processing stage from measured raw data. 2.2.2.
    Data processing stage The primary objective of this stage is to utilize measured
    data to compute the average soil moisture, total rainfall, total irrigation, and
    average temperature over the duration of the irrigation period. In that form,
    knowing a fixed irrigation period spanning from the time instant to and considering
    the sampling period of the respective sensor as , the number of samples within
    an irrigation period can be defined as: (2) With this, the average soil moisture
    is determined by: (3) Similarly, the average temperature is given by: (4) The
    accumulated rainfall over the period is computed as follows: (5) The accumulated
    irrigation is: (6) In Fig. 3, the data processing stage also processes rain and
    temperature forecast data. This data process uses the same methods followed in
    Eqs. (5), (4), considering the sampling time used for the forecasting provider.
    The expected accumulated rainfall for the next irrigation period is noted as ,
    and the expected temperature average is noted as . 2.2.3. Parameter estimation
    stage We aim to estimate the parameters inherent to the COM, namely , , , , .
    Our strategy hinges on maintaining a record of processed data, from which we derive
    an optimization-based approach for parameter estimation. This method is a variation
    of the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) technique (Rao et al., 2001). Our variation
    comprises an expanding estimation window, and this is slightly different from
    the conventional MHE, where a fixed-size window is used. Moreover, we propose
    to ensure the estimated parameters’ optimality by formulating a two-step estimator.
    The decision to use an expanding window arises from the unique characteristics
    of seasonal crops and the observed irrigation practices by growers. Notably, some
    crops can be ready for harvest just 30 days post-planting. Additionally, the irrigation
    schedules set by growers can fluctuate significantly, ranging anywhere from one
    to more than five days. Given these dynamics, valuing and utilizing every data
    collected from the crop throughout its growth cycle is imperative. Moreover, with
    a fixed-size estimation window, we risk encountering data windows without rain
    events or irrigation events, which can impact the estimation of parameters related
    to rain and irrigation. We use an expanding estimation window to mitigate this,
    ensuring the algorithm always has access to a sufficient data set. For permanent
    crops, the analysis might benefit from a moving window with a fixed size long
    enough to guarantee optimal parameter estimation. For data aggregation within
    this expanding window, we consider vectors of processed data from the instant
    to the instant . Hence, the processed data for soil moisture, rainfall, irrigation,
    and temperature within each estimation window is defined as: with . In that form,
    according to the corresponding estimation window, the parameters , , , , and are
    estimated at each irrigation period, given adaptive characteristics to the COM.
    We employ a two-step estimation strategy to guarantee the optimality of our estimated
    parameters: the first step estimates parameters in association with measured variables.
    In contrast, the subsequent step estimates the parameter linked to the water table.
    Prior estimation step At this step, we assume a water table’s slow dynamic variation
    in seepage irrigation and general water table elevation. For that, has a low incidence
    in the variation of the soil moisture. Consequently, we exclude in the first estimation
    step. This step estimates the parameters that minimize the quadratic error between
    the soil moisture variation and the linear combination between the measured variables
    and the parameters associated with the measured variables. In this estimation
    step, we are including a constraint to ensure that all the parameters must be
    positive to conserve the proposed physical relation of the mass balance. The proposed
    optimization problem is formulated as follows: Download : Download high-res image
    (40KB) Download : Download full-size image where is the vector of parameters that
    are associated with measured variables , and is the quadratic error described
    as (8) with , and . For the optimization problem (Eq. (7)), the linear constraints
    imply that an optimal solution is achievable if is convex. The convexity of this
    cost function can be established if its Hessian matrix respect to is positive
    definite (Bhatia, 2015), which in turn depends on the linear independence of the
    columns in . Variability in soil moisture and temperature can generally be assumed,
    ensuring the linear independence of corresponding columns in . However, given
    that rainfall and irrigation can exhibit extended periods of invariability, the
    algorithm is designed to commence only when observed variability in and is confirmed.
    Subsequent estimation step After estimating the parameters associated with the
    measured variables, is estimated. As we consider this parameter directly related
    to the soil moisture, we propose to find the parameter that minimizes the quadratic
    error between the measured soil moisture and the estimated soil moisture with
    initial conditions given by . Where the estimated soil moisture is obtained from
    the water balance in Eq. (1), and the numerical solution of the model (Eq. (1)),
    which is described as (9) In that form, we propose a subsequent optimization problem
    described as Download : Download high-res image (40KB) Download : Download full-size
    image where is the quadratic cost function given by (11) with . In this optimization
    problem, the constraints are also linear. In Appendix, it is shown that by appropriate
    substitutions, appear as a linear combination into the numerical solution given
    by , confirming the convexity of the cost function and that optimal solutions
    of also can be guarantee. 2.2.4. Control stage In the control stage, the COM,
    the estimated parameters, the processed measured variables, and the forecasted
    variables are integrated to calculate the amount of water that must be applied
    during the irrigation period. This stage is an adaptive, predictive, and feedback-plus
    feedforward control strategy. The main objective is to use measured and forecast
    information to estimate the appropriate irrigation ( ) that maintains the soil
    moisture close to a desired value. We explain the control strategy in four steps,
    where first, the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the estimated parameters obtained
    in Eqs. (7), and (10), and the processed measured data (Eqs. (3), (4), (5), and
    (6)) are used to predict (or forecast) the soil moisture one step ahead ( ) as
    follows: (12) Second, we use the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the predicted
    soil moisture , forecast rain and temperature data ( , and , and we assume that
    in the next irrigation period, the estimated parameter variation can be neglected
    or in other words that . With this information, we predict the soil moisture two
    steps ahead ( ) as follows: (13) Third, we establish the objective to deduce the
    irrigation amount to be applied, such as two steps ahead, the predicted soil moisture
    will be equal to the desired soil moisture. Therefore, by replacing in Eq. (13)
    and obtaining , we deduce the irrigation amount equation as follows: (14) Fourth,
    to analyze and understand the elements of the irrigation amount equation, we define
    the expected error between the desired soil moisture and the expected soil moisture
    as . Therefore, Eq. (14) can be rewritten as follows: (15) where the elements
    of the irrigation control equation can be described as components of the water
    balance that equilibrates the soil moisture around the desired value as follows:
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate for the difference
    between the desired moisture and the expected average of the soil moisture; is
    the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that, during
    the irrigation period, was lost due infiltration; is the volume of irrigation
    water that can be hold based on the expected rain during the irrigation period;
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that
    is expected to be lost due evapotranspiration; is the amount of water the crop
    will receive from capillary rise. Note that this control action is a case of adaptive
    control, knows a self-tuning regulator, where the stability of the controlled
    system is conditioned to the accuracy of the estimated parameters and the grade
    of uncertainty between the controlled system and the estimated system (Åström
    and Wittenmark, 2008). 3. Experimental verification The algorithm was validated
    using on-field measurements from a commercial sweetcorn field in South Florida.
    This data was initially collected as part of an integrated research and extension
    project focused on improving farmers’ adoption of soil moisture sensors for irrigation
    scheduling in vegetable farms. We evaluated our DSS algorithm using readings from
    soil moisture probes, a weather station, and a pressure transducer deployed in
    the commercial field. In this section, we describe the data collection process
    and the algorithm evaluation towards establishing the potential benefits of the
    algorithm in comparison with the information obtained from the grower irrigation
    practices. As shown in Fig. 5, we installed sensors to measure soil moisture,
    precipitation, environmental temperature, and irrigation management from December
    21, 2022, to January 11, 2023. Due to confidentiality agreements, the precise
    location of the commercial field remains undisclosed in this study. The soil in
    this field is classified as waveland and lawnwood fine sands. Following the hydraulic
    properties reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006) (Fig. 2), this soil is characterized
    by a permanent wilting point of 5%, a field capacity of 10%, and a saturation
    point of 46%. The field water movement and location of the sensors are described
    in Fig. 5, where the field is surrounded by a channel supplied by a pump drawing
    from a natural water source. Water is distributed from this surrounding channel
    to the crops via pipes. This water is then dispersed into ditches across the field.
    These ditches feature interconnected silts that facilitate water transport to
    the plant beds. Irrigation is accomplished by increasing the water level in the
    channel. It is important to note that this system operates under the assumption
    of homogeneous water distribution, with the water supply pump serving as the unique
    control element. Download : Download high-res image (568KB) Download : Download

    deployment of a weather station, a soil moisture sensor, and a pressure transducer.
    The blue lines delineate the water distribution inflow utilized for irrigating
    the agricultural field under study. Under the homogeneous water distribution consideration,
    moisture measurements were taken in the root zone at a depth of 0.3 m, using a
    Sentek Drill & Drop 60 cm soil moisture probe, which is capable of measuring soil
    moisture, temperature, and salinity at uniformly spaced depths every 0.1 m, providing
    a profile up to 0.6 m depth (Sentek, 2018). The sampling time was 1800 s. Rain
    and temperature data were obtained using a Davis Vantage Pro2 GroWeather 6820c
    weather station (Davis, 2023). The sampling time was 900 s. Irrigation measurements
    were taken by installing a KPSI 700 pressure sensor at the bottom of the channel.
    This sensor has a range of 0.7–210 m, an accuracy of 1% with analog output from
    0 to 10 V. The objective was to identify sudden increases related to pump activation
    to establish the irrigation time during the irrigation period. The pressure sensor
    was connected to a CR1000X datalogger of Cambell Scientific (Campbell, 2023) with
    a sampling time of 300 s, and the irrigation management was established by analyzing
    this information. The proposed DSS algorithm was tested using Matlab software
    version R2022a (Matlab, 2022). The irrigation period was selected by analyzing
    the irrigation management given by the grower. We observed that the management
    given by the grower was in function of soil and crop appearance, irrigating when
    required, and turning the pump on and off with an elapsed time between 1 and 6
    days. Given this information, our algorithm testing incorporated an irrigation
    period of two days ( ). We consider that with this period, we can provide reasonable
    timing actions from the grower. We added normally distributed random noise to
    the measured data to simulate the inherent stochasticity in weather forecasts.
    Specifically, the magnitude of this noise was set at 10% of the standard deviation
    of the actual measured data. In the context of rainfall predictions, any resultant
    negative values post-noise addition were truncated to zero. The maximum allowable
    depletion for sweet corn was considered 50% (Bayabil et al., 2023). We determined
    the desired soil moisture between 7.5% and 10%. We selected a desired soil moisture
    of 9% to stay far from the maximum allowable depletion point and accommodate uncertainties
    in soil characteristics. Before initializing the algorithm, we converted missing
    data entries to zeros. Soil moisture and irrigation data underwent homogenization
    through interpolation to match the 900 s rain and temperature data sampling interval.
    In the prior estimation step, the optimization problem was formulated as a quadratic
    programming problem and iteratively solved using the “quadprog” tool in Matlab.
    In the subsequent estimation stage, the optimization problem was iteratively addressed
    using a sequential quadratic programming method with the “fmincon” tool in Matlab.
    Then, in the test, the data is processed at each irrigation period to obtain the
    corresponding averages of the temperature and soil moisture and the corresponding
    amounts of accumulated rain and accumulated irrigation applied by the grower.
    Moreover, the model’s parameters are estimated at each irrigation period, and
    the recommended irrigation is computed. We evaluated the overall DSS algorithm
    by applying the computed control action to the parametrized COM. We are addressing
    the uncertainties related to assuming negligible estimated parameter changes between
    consecutive irrigation periods by adding stochastic variability, which was obtained
    by analyzing the variation of the estimated parameters and adding a randomized
    normal distributed disturbance with a standard deviation equal to the observed
    standard deviation of . In that form, the stochastic soil moisture prediction
    is given by (16) where , , , , and are the corresponding disturbances. In consequence,
    the evaluated control action is also disturbed by including the stochastic soil
    moisture prediction as (17) Below, we present the outcomes of our analysis. 4.
    Results and discussion Fig. 6 shows the results of the data processing stage.
    Note how the temperature ( ) shows a periodic component related to day and night
    patterns, also presented in the soil moisture ( ). However, this periodic component
    is removed in both the processed temperature ( ) and soil moisture ( ). In the
    case of accumulated rain ( ), the processed data is presented as the cumulative
    sum for each irrigation period. The grower irrigation decision represents the
    accumulated hours the grower irrigated during each irrigation period. The data
    processing stage is pivotal in aligning the measured data with the model and significantly
    mitigating uncertainties from the measured parameters of soil moisture, temperature,
    rain, and irrigation. As described, this stage computes the average soil moisture,
    total rainfall, total irrigation, and average temperature over the duration of
    each irrigation period. This computation aids in filtering out uncertainties and
    undesired data anomalies provided by sensors and forecasting methods. By averaging
    soil moisture over an irrigation period, the impact of incorrect measurements
    and transient spikes not contemplated in the model and random fluctuations are
    reduced, leading to more representative information on the available water for
    the plants. For example, in Fig. 6, an anomalous temperature measurement close
    to −20 °C is observed on Jan-08-23. This incorrect measurement was filtered out
    in the processed temperature data, thus attenuating its influence. Furthermore,
    considering accumulated rain and irrigation data in the data processing stage
    notably enhances the DSS robustness by minimizing the influence of uncertainty
    in both the measurement and prediction processes. It is essential to emphasize
    that uncertainties in measured rainfall and irrigation data, sampled every 900
    s, have a diminished impact on the estimation and control stages as the duration
    of the irrigation period increases. This reduction in the influence of data uncertainty
    is pivotal for the robustness, accuracy, and reliability of the entire DSS algorithm.

    and the average and distribution of the estimation errors for each estimation

    The lowest recorded correlation and values are 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. In
    addition, the -value starts at and decreases as the estimation window expands,
    reaching a minimum of . The consistently high correlation and values across all
    estimation windows suggest that the estimation algorithm performs well in describing
    the dynamics of the soil moisture average. The lowest value of 0.84 indicates
    that, in the worst-case scenario, the COM can explain an 84% of the variability
    in the soil moisture average. On the other hand, the lowest correlation value
    of 0.92 indicates that we are reaching a strong linear relationship between the
    proposed COM and the observed soil moisture averages. The low and decreasing -value
    describes a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the estimations, which
    increases as the estimation window increases. Download : Download high-res image

    The figure also visualizes prediction error behavior for each prediction instance.
    The results indicate that the average estimation error across all estimation windows
    is around zero, with maximum standard deviations of . The prediction error is
    similarly centered around zero, exhibiting maximum and minimum errors of . As
    the estimation window increases, the prediction error decreases. However, an increase
    in the prediction error is evidenced on Feb-05. This problem is also observed
    in the estimation analyses, with a decrease in the and correlation. On this particular
    estimation, the commercial sweetcorn field experienced an intense rainfall of
    26.67 mm within 24 h. This led to a substantial change in soil moisture levels,
    which the algorithm failed to estimate accurately, resulting in a peak error of
    3.29%. This behavior shows that close to the desired operation region (between
    the MADP and FC), the soil–water relation can be described as a linear model,
    where our COM can accurately describe the dynamics. However, the COM accuracy
    reduces in extreme events that move the SM content away from the desired operation
    region. Our proposed approach overcomes the uncertainties associated with using
    a simplified modeling approach by considering a recursive parameters estimation
    strategy that lets the model adapt to changing crop and environmental conditions.
    The modeling and estimation approach is capable of accurately describing the soil
    moisture dynamics close to the operation region, overcoming associated uncertainties,
    and can be used as a baseline for making irrigation decisions. To delve deeper
    into the validation and performance of our modeling and estimation approach, a
    comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the estimated parameters is subsequently
    provided. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the parameters and the incidence of
    the estimated parameters in the COM. It can be observed that the parameters associated
    with moisture ( ), irrigation ( ), rain ( ), and temperature ( ) exhibits a low
    dispersion in contrast with the parameter associated to the capillary rise ( ).
    A sensitivity analysis of the estimated parameters can be performed by multiplying
    the obtained parameters by the maximum reported value per respective variable,
    obtaining how much the soil moisture can increase or decrease according to the
    parameter dispersion and the maximum values reported for each variable. The results
    show that during an irrigation period, the soil moisture could (i) decrease a
    1.5% concerning maximum soil moisture of 13.6%; (ii) increase around 3.6% with
    48 h of continuous irrigation; (iii) increase around a 3.7% in relation with 26
    (mm) of rain on a period of 48 h; (iv) decrease around 0.3% with a maximum temperature
    average of 23.3 (°C); and (v) increase around 0.06% in relation with the capillary
    rise. Note that the parameter that shows the high dispersion in the estimation
    process is . However, gives the most significant influence. Moreover, it is observed
    that soil water losses from leaching and runoff could be five times higher than
    the amount lost due to high temperature, which is related to the evapotranspiration
    process. Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Distribution of the parameters and incidence of their distribution
    in the model. Fig. 10 shows that the variations of the estimated parameters are
    distributed close to zero. This dispersion accounts for the expected variation
    that the parameters could present between irrigation periods. For example, in
    the case of rain, from Fig. 9, we have that the parameter associated ( ) is close
    to 0.11. From the standard deviation of , we can expect that this parameter could
    be different around in the next irrigation period. This uncertainty is reflected
    in the prediction of the soil moisture Eq. (16) and in the control action, which
    is taken based on that prediction. For that, the standard deviations of the variation
    of the parameters shown in Fig. 10 are used to add uncertainty and perform a realistic
    simulation in the presence of such uncertainty. The results of the controlled
    system are shown in Fig. 11, where we compare the system’s measured data with
    the expected data if the proposed algorithm is used to manage irrigation. Download

    between and is imperceptible. This is because the added normally distributed random
    data is filtered in the process stage. This is important because a similar result
    can be expected by using data from the corresponding weather forecasting services,
    highlighting the importance of the data processing stage in enhancing the algorithm’s
    robustness. On the other hand, it is observed that due to the processing stage,
    rain presents more sensitivity to the added random data. That is because, in the
    case of rain, the limitation to zero of the applied noise affects his distribution.

    irrigation actions (red) and recommended irrigation actions by our DSS. In Fig.
    11, we are also presenting the comparison between the measured soil moisture and
    the expected soil moisture if the grower uses the computed recommended irrigation
    . In the comparison, we included the desired soil moisture ( ), and we can observe
    how the controlled moisture tries to be around this value. It is important to
    mention that the computation of starts on January 02, when the first prediction
    data is available (see Fig. 7); before that, and are the same. The most notable
    difference between the irrigation scheduling given by the grower and the irrigation
    scheduling computed by the algorithm is that the algorithm does not generate saturated
    irrigation actions of 48 h. The algorithm aims to uphold an average irrigation
    duration of 10 h every two days. This duration fluctuates proportionally with
    forecasted temperature changes (as seen on January 18) and inversely in response
    to anticipated rain events (as evidenced on January 24). On the other hand, the
    decisions taken by the grower show that he is reacting to extreme events. For
    example, on January 18, the irrigation was turned off when the average soil moisture
    reached a maximum of 13.85% (percolation). Also, it is observed that the irrigation
    is turned on on February 01, when the soil moisture is close to reaching the allowable
    depletion point of 7.5%. In contrast, the controlled moisture is close to 9, avoiding
    the environmental impact of percolation and also avoiding the crop risk of reaching
    an allowable depletion point. However, it is important to mention that the decisions
    taken by the grower show expertise in dealing with this complex process on the
    most difficult type of soil (see Fig. 2), avoiding the allowable depletion point
    and maintaining the soil moisture close to the available water region. Fig. 12
    compares the cumulative irrigation hours applied by the grower with those used
    for the proposed algorithm. On February 09, the grower reported a total of 367
    h of irrigation, while the algorithm used a total of 258 h. This result demonstrates
    the potential of our algorithm to save 30% of the water typically used in seepage-irrigated
    crops in Florida. Notably, seepage irrigation systems are known for their low
    efficiency, often falling below 40% (Dukes et al., 2010). Despite this inefficiency,
    they remain prevalent in Florida. According to the current grower records (personal
    communication), a single hectare of seepage-irrigated sweet corn can consume around
    1500 m3 of water per season. Using this volume consumption as a baseline, our
    proposed algorithm has the capacity to increase water use efficiency up to 450
    m3 per hectare per season. This finding underscores the substantial water-saving
    potential of our DSS, highlighting its significance for sustainable agriculture
    if it is adopted in the state of Florida. Download : Download high-res image (176KB)

    of irrigation hours between the grower technique and the recommendations provided
    by the proposed decision support system. Our study demonstrates significant advancements
    in irrigation management, particularly in incorporating information from weather
    forecasting services to optimize irrigation scheduling. Our approach has shown
    reduced irrigation time in response to anticipated rainfall events. This predictive
    capability offers a distinct improvement over fully automated systems as those
    reported by Domínguez-Niño et al. (2020) and approaches that at the beginning
    of the season precalculate irrigation management based on crop models as reported
    by Hodges et al. (2022), where a consistent reduction in irrigation corresponding
    to rainfall is not evident. We also highlight that the proposed strategy integrates
    multiple information sources for optimal irrigation management based on soil moisture
    and water balance. This is an advancement over the traditional approach presented
    by El-Naggar et al. (2020), where the use of soil moisture sensors and soil water
    balances are seen as independent control techniques, which are compared to elucidate
    the most suitable irrigation practices. While the modernization of irrigation
    systems, as discussed by Çetin et al. (2023), is crucial for sustainable agriculture
    and water conservation, it often involves significant initial investments. This
    can be a major barrier in regions still reliant on traditional irrigation methods
    such as seepage. Our research addresses this challenge by demonstrating that substantial
    water savings can be achieved without full-scale modernization and automation
    of irrigation systems. Our study’s results highlight our approach’s environmental
    benefits, presenting it as a cost-effective alternative for enhancing the sustainability
    of irrigation practices in diverse agricultural settings. Future studies involve
    evaluating the algorithm across varied agricultural settings, encompassing different
    soil types, irrigation methods, different regions, and crops. This is crucial
    for assessing its adaptability and efficacy in water conservation. Concurrently,
    efforts will be directed towards integrating this adaptive decision support system
    (DSS) into accessible digital platforms such as smartphone applications and websites,
    simplifying irrigation decision-making for farmers. Enhancing the DSS algorithm
    will involve developing advanced modeling and estimation techniques to accurately
    estimate and forecast soil moisture dynamics under extreme environmental conditions,
    considering their random and complex nature. The enhancement also includes refining
    predictive models and automated control strategies for more precise irrigation
    scheduling. A key aspect is the creation of control algorithms with mixed objectives,
    such as minimizing irrigation while ensuring optimal crop yield. The implementation
    of Kalman filters and stochastic model predictive control techniques to manage
    forecast uncertainty must be explored. 5. Conclusions In this study, we introduced
    a technological solution to enhance the sustainability of water management in
    agriculture. We developed a decision support system algorithm for irrigation scheduling
    using principles from control theory. This algorithm encompasses modeling, processing,
    estimation, and control stages, ensuring the optimality of the model that describes
    the system. During the evaluation, the estimation stage achieved minimum correlation
    coefficients and values of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. The algorithm integrates
    the parametrized model, processed data, weather forecasting, and human limitations
    to conform an adaptive feedback plus feedforward irrigation predictive control
    strategy that considers human action in the control loop. The algorithm can consistently
    regulate soil moisture, ensuring it remains at desired levels. This approach reduced
    the risks associated with leaching and runoff and offered the potential for water
    savings of up to 30% in seepage irrigated crops on sandy soils. Looking forward,
    we plan to move towards end-user implementation to promote wider adoption and
    benefits of this technological solution. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    resulting in daily correlation coefficient R2 and daily maximum absolute percentage
    errors ranging from 0.34 to 0.90 and 10% to 27% respectively. However, these errors
    decreased to a large extent when considering multiday accumulated values. A comparison
    was conducted between the GLDAS model ET0 and the station-estimated values, revealing
    an overestimation of ET0 by the GLDAS model. Additionally, significant variations

    Variation of Evapotranspiration Derived from Multi-temporal Landsat Datasets using
    FAO-56 Penman-Monteith Method Chapter © 2021 Introduction Agriculture holds significant
    importance in driving the socio-economic growth of developing countries such as
    India, serving as the primary source of livelihood for a substantial portion of
    the population. As per the 2011 Census, the agricultural and allied sector activities
    engage 54.6% of the total workforce (Annual Report 2020–21, 2021). Adequate water
    availability at the right time is crucial for agriculture as it directly influences
    crop yields. However, the impact of climate change has resulted in irregular precipitation
    patterns (Soni et al. 2023), leading to adverse effects on agricultural productivity
    in the country (Abeysekara et al. 2023; Jha et al. 2023; Ondrasek 2014; Zhang
    et al. 2023; Zizinga et al. 2022). Various meteorological and agriculture departments
    actively engage in providing agricultural advisories to farmers. Among these advisories,
    information on when to irrigate and how much to irrigate holds great significance
    for farmers (Cahn and Johnson 2017; Lorite et al. 2012). It not only helps farmers
    to save money and enhance crop productivity but also reduces excessive water usage
    in irrigation. Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a significant role in soil water
    balance models and various crop water requirement-based models, following precipitation.
    These models are instrumental in obtaining accurate estimates for irrigation scheduling
    (Zhang et al. 2011), optimizing irrigation practices, understanding crop water
    requirements, and predicting yields (Attia et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2023; Lee
    et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2022). The availability of daily or weekly ET data, along
    with current soil moisture conditions and weather forecasts, is invaluable in
    accurately determining crop water requirements and helpful in providing timely
    irrigation advisories. This integrated approach enhances the effectiveness of
    water resource management and aids in optimizing agricultural practices (Vuolo
    et al. 2015). Evapotranspiration (ET) encompasses the combined water loss from
    the Earth''s surface through soil evaporation and plant transpiration (Allen et
    al. 1998a; Kite 2000). Evapotranspiration (ET) includes various terms, namely
    potential evapotranspiration (PET), reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and actual
    evapotranspiration (AET). PET represents the maximum amount of water that could
    evaporate and be transpired under optimal conditions, assuming an adequate water
    supply without considering soil moisture constraints. ET0 serves as a benchmark,
    representing the evaporative demand for a reference crop, such as well-watered
    grass, considering sufficient water availability. It helps estimate crop water
    requirements in diverse regions and crops. On the other hand, AET refers to the
    measured or estimated water loss (evaporation and transpiration) specific to a
    particular crop. AET can be derived from ET0 by multiplying it with the crop coefficient
    (kc) (Allen et al. 1998b; Pereira et al. 1999). The estimation of evapotranspiration
    relies on various techniques that utilizes meteorological and satellite data inputs.
    Several empirical equations have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration;
    however, these methods have limitations in terms of data availability and adaptability
    at the local scale (Hargreaves and Samani 1985; Priestley and Taylor 1972; Thornthwaite
    1948; Zhang et al. 2008). Empirical method Penman may require wind calibration
    (Malek 1994), the radiation method performs well in humid conditions where aerodynamic
    influence contribution is comparatively small (Tabari et al. 2013; Vishwakarma
    et al. 2022) and temperature based empirical methods require local calibration
    (Lee 2010). These empirical methods are suitable to estimate the water demand
    at low spatial resolution and monthly time scale. Among the available methods
    FAO-56 Penman Monteith (PM) empirical method estimates evapotranspiration relatively
    accurately and performs consistently for arid, semi-arid, and humid conditions
    at a global scale (Abdollahnejad et al. 2018; Allen et al. 1998a; Subedi and Chávez
    2015) as it includes both thermodynamics and aerodynamic aspects. FAO 56 Penman
    Monteith, a globally accepted empirical equation for estimating evapotranspiration,
    requires multiple inputs such as air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed,
    and relative humidity. However, these inputs are often scarce and rarely available
    across space, making it challenging to accurately estimate water demand. In developing
    countries like India, most of the studies have predominantly focused on the point
    scale due to limited weather station coverage and inconsistent data, which are
    insufficient for capturing precise spatial variability and translate this information
    in agriculture advisories. Choudhury 1997 estimated the monthly global PET from
    the satellite data in which satellite-derived solar radiation, fractional cloud
    cover, air temperature, and vapour pressure were used. Polar and geostationary
    satellite derived near surface air temperature and insolation were used to estimate
    PET estimation in most of the studies (Bois et al. 2008; Cruz-Blanco et al. 2014).
    Baik and Choi 2015 estimated geostationary satellite-based Priestley-Taylor PET
    which was compared with high quality, global land surface model GLDAS (25 km)
    based PET and found significantly overestimated. Rao et al. 2012, estimated station-based
    PET for 51 stations using 8 different empirical methods and found that the modified
    Penman Monteith overestimated mostly during summer and Hargreaves method performed
    better during the northeast monsoon season compared to the other three season.
    Over the past three decades, numerous researchers have dedicated their efforts
    to estimating evapotranspiration using various approaches such as satellite data,
    meteorological data, or a combination of both (Bhattarai et al. 2016; Huerta et
    al. 2022; Ha et al. 2020; Singer et al. 2021; Vyas et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016).
    However, despite these advancements, the full utilization of these methods and
    datasets is hindered by several challenges. One of the main hurdles is the scarcity
    of calibration and validation of datasets, which affects the accuracy and reliability
    of the estimations. Evapotranspiration estimation is significantly influenced
    by solar radiation, as it is directly proportional to it. Even small uncertainties
    in solar radiation measurements can introduce considerable errors in evapotranspiration
    estimation (Heck et al. 2020). However, due to limitations in the availability
    and consistency of solar radiation data, an alternative solution for estimating
    evapotranspiration can be found in satellite-derived high spatial and temporal
    remote-sensed meteorological data. To address the uncertainties in solar radiation,
    this study developed and discussed a data integration approach that combines remotely
    sensed insolation products with observed daily meteorological data. This integration
    enables the estimation of near real-time evapotranspiration at a spatial resolution
    of 12.5 km and a daily temporal scale for the entire country of India. Although
    models such as the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) also provide daily
    evapotranspiration estimates, these models tend to overestimate evapotranspiration
    and cannot be directly used without proper calibration and validation at the regional
    scale. This paper focuses on the discussion and validation of the estimated regional
    evapotranspiration (ET0) specifically in the context of its application in agriculture
    advisory services. The paper is organized as follows: Section \"Material and methods\",
    the paper comprehensively addressed the various components of the study. This
    encompassed discussions about the station observational data covering the 34 meteorological
    sub-divisions, the INSAT 3D insolation product, the gridded observed temperature
    product, and the GLDAS-based evapotranspiration. Moreover, the paper also provided
    insights into the process of deriving the estimated evapotranspiration, outlined
    the statistical methods utilized for error computation, and described the calibration
    procedure employed for result comparison. Section \"Results and discussions\"  focused
    on the patterns of monthly evapotranspiration throughout the region, scrutinizing
    its 3 days to monthly and sub-divisional variations. The calibration coefficients
    for both proposed derived ET0 and GLDAS model-based ET0 were presented, alongside
    statistical comparisons, accuracy assessments, and an exploration of the daily
    temporal variation at the sub-division level. Finally, in the Summary and Conclusion
    section, paper discussed the potential use of satellite data in enhancing the
    quality of agriculture advisories in India and improving various models through
    the utilization of calibrated proposed evapotranspiration. Material and methods
    Study Area This study primarily centers on the Indian subcontinent, encompassing
    a geographical range of latitude 7.5° to 37.5° N and longitude 67.5° to 97.5°
    E. The vast size and diverse topography of India contribute to its remarkably
    varied climate. The agricultural sector and water resources in India greatly rely
    on the southwest monsoon season. This period holds significant importance as certain
    regions receive as much as 75% of their annual rainfall during this time, making
    it a crucial determinant of the country''s overall annual precipitation where
    annual rainfall ranges from 1100 to 2000 mm per year and distribution of rainfall
    over land mass varies widely. From 1901–2020 the monthly mean of average temperature
    varies between 18° C to 29° C with annual mean average of 24° C. The climate of
    India can be categorized into different regions, including tropical, subtropical,
    and arid/semi-arid regions. The tropical regions are predominantly located in
    the southern and eastern parts of the country and are characterized by consistently
    high temperatures throughout the year. Subtropical regions, located in the northern
    and central parts of India, experience seasonal variations in temperature with
    hot summers and cold winters. These regions receive rainfall primarily during
    the monsoon season, although in lesser amounts compared to the tropical regions.
    Arid or semi-arid regions are primarily situated in the northwest and western
    parts of India. These regions face low and erratic rainfall throughout the year,
    resulting in drought conditions and water scarcity (Rajeevan and Nayak 2017; Soni
    et al. 2023). India is divided into 36 meteorological subdivisions based on the
    unique rainfall patterns observed across the country (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 SRTM DEM
    and spatial distribution of IMD Agromet stations in meteorological subdivisions

    study, we selected 34 Agrometeorological observatories (Table 1) to ensure representation
    from each meteorological subdivision (Fig. 1). This strategic selection facilitated
    effective validation and calibration of the estimated evapotranspiration (ET0).
    The Agromet observatories are equipped with sensors to measure various weather
    variables including maximum and minimum temperature, maximum and minimum relative
    humidity, rainfall, bright sunshine hours, and evaporation. These stations cover
    a wide range of conditions, including rainfed and irrigated areas, diverse weather
    patterns, topography, and soil types. Consequently, the impact of weather and
    other physical variables was thoroughly investigated. Ground observations from
    agricultural fields were collected for the years 2017 and 2018. Table 1 Details
    of IMD Agromet observatories and data used Full size table IMD gridded temperature
    data Temperature is a critical parameter in the estimation of evapotranspiration,
    and the use of accurate data is of utmost importance. In this study, we utilized
    gridded maximum and minimum temperature data obtained from the National Climate
    Centre (NCC) of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) (https://www.imdpune.gov.in/lrfindex.php,
    accessed on August 24th, 2021). This dataset is available at a daily frequency
    with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° (approximately 2500 km2). It has been
    found to be highly reliable compared to other datasets available for the Indian
    region, exhibiting an error of less than 0.5 °C during cross-validation. Moreover,
    this dataset successfully captures the mean frequency of cold and heat waves,
    as well as temperature anomalies associated with monsoon breaks (Srivastava et
    al. 2009). SRTM DEM data SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital
    Elevation Model) data provides elevation information for nearly the entire Earth’s
    surface, covering approximately 80% of the globe. It is a joint collaboration
    between National Aeronautic Space Administration (NASA), National Geospatial Intelligence
    Agency (NGA), and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It has been widely used in
    various applications such as geology, hydrology, cartography, and terrain analysis.
    In this study, we utilized SRTM 90 m (3 Arc second) spatial resolution DEM data
    (Version 4). This dataset can be accessed through platforms like the United States
    Geological Survey (USGS), NASA''s Earthdata Search, and the CGIAR-CSI SRTM 90
    m Database (https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ accessed on 28th August 2021). SRTM radar
    used C and X bands for the preparation of DEM data which has been further processed
    to fill data voids. (Jarvis et al. 2008). Satellite derived insolation data INSAT
    3D (Indian Geostationary satellite) insolation product, 3DIMG_L2C_INS, provides
    data with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 30 min over
    the Asia Mercator region. This region spans from 44.5°E to 105.5°E longitude and
    10.0°S to 45.5°N latitude. Insolation refers to the total amount of solar radiation
    flux or irradiance in the shortwave range of 0.3 to 3 µm, which reaches the ground
    and consists of a combination of direct and diffuse components of solar radiation
    fluxes. In the retrieval of insolation data from INSAT 3D, two approaches are
    primarily utilized: statistical or empirical methods (Tarpley 1979) and physical
    or radiative transfer methods (Tanahashi et al. 2001). These approaches estimate
    surface insolation by making use of visible and thermal bands. The estimation
    of instantaneous and daily insolation is achieved through the implementation of
    a spectrally integrated irradiance model and a three-layer cloudy model, using
    the INSAT 3D visible (VIS), water vapor (WV), and thermal infrared (IR) bands
    (Bhattacharya et al. 2013). A trapezoidal integration was applied to construct
    the daily value from the instantaneous global irradiances in MJm−2. The INSAT
    3D insolation product exhibits significantly higher accuracy compared to other
    available products, such as Heliosat SARAH-E and the NASA MERRA-2 reanalysis product,
    with improvements of approximately 42.5% and 43.8% respectively (Kamath and Srinivasan
    2020). Weather forecast model GFS T1534 reanalysis products IMD runs weather forecast
    model GFS T1534 twice daily (00 and 12 UTC) on a horizontal spatial scale of 12.5
    km and on a vertical scale of 64 hybrid sigma-pressure layers with a top layer
    centered around 0.27 hPa (~ 55 km) to generate 10 days’ deterministic forecast
    in advance on MIHIR HPCS (Sridevi et al. 2020). The model gives the post-processed
    output parameters at 25 km and 12.5 km spatial resolution. The atmospheric forecast
    model used in GFS is a global spectral model (GSM) with spherical harmonic functions.
    The IMD GFS T1534 operational model’s dynamical core is based on two-time level
    semi-implicit Lagrangian discretization with three dimensional Hermite interpolation
    (Sela 2010). The initial conditions are prepared at BHASKARA HPCS, NCMRWF to run
    the IMD-GFS model using NCEP Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) based hybrid Global
    Data Assimilation System (GDAS) (Buehner et al. 2013). The model is based on the
    usual expressions of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy at T1534 spectral
    truncation 12.5 km physics Gaussian grid and 64 levels in a hybrid sigma-pressure
    vertical grid (Kumar et al. 2019). The detailed structure and physics of the Global
    Forecast System (GFS) are available at http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/GFS/doc.php.
    Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) The GLDAS model integrates satellite
    and ground-based information using advanced land surface modelling and data assimilation
    techniques to produce the optimal field of land surface states and fluxes (Rodell
    et al. 2004). The reanalysed datasets through the common land model (CLM), variable
    infiltration capacity model (VIC), and Noah LSM are available at GLDAS websites
    (http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/) at various spatial scales (0.25° and 1°) and
    temporal scale (3 h and monthly). In this study, the GLDAS 0.25° (GLDAS_NOAH025_3H
    2.1) has been used. Methodology The FAO-56 Penman–Monteith empirical method is
    widely employed for accurately estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0).
    However, this method necessitates a significant number of weather inputs, including
    radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed, and vapor pressure.
    Unfortunately, these inputs are often not readily available at a suitable spatial
    and temporal scale in standard weather observatories. To address this issue of
    data scarcity from ground stations, we utilized a derived insolation product from
    the geostationary satellite INSAT-3D to estimate net radiation. Additionally,
    we incorporated observed India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded temperature
    data, IMD GFS model-based reanalysed data for relative humidity and wind speed,
    and SRTM DEM elevation data. The inclusion of observed and analysed inputs in
    the model yielded comparatively more accurate results in comparison to utilizing
    a general model for estimating ET0. FAO-56 Penman–Monteith empirical reference
    ET 0 framework In 1948, Penman developed an empirical equation to estimate evaporation
    from an open water surface (Penman 1948). This equation takes into account meteorological
    parameters such as sunshine, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, utilizing
    an approach based on energy balance and mass transfer (see Fig. 2 and Table 2).
    Subsequently, this method was expanded to include cropped surfaces by incorporating
    factors such as aerodynamic resistance and surface resistance. The FAO proposed
    a standard parameterization of the Penman–Monteith empirical method (Monteith
    1981) for the estimation of daily grass reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from
    a well-irrigated, homogenous, 0.12 m grass crop height, a fixed surface resistance
    of 70 s m-1, and an albedo of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a). This empirical method,
    hereafter referred to as PM, is a standard worldwide acceptable method to compute
    the daily reference ET0 in mm and calculated as follows: $${ET}_{0}=\\frac{0.408\\Delta
    \\left({R}_{n}-G\\right)+\\gamma \\frac{900}{T+273}{u}_{2}({e}_{s}-{e}_{a})}{\\Delta
    +\\gamma (1+0.34{u}_{2})}$$ (1) where ET0 is the grass-reference evapotranspiration
    in mm day−1, Rn is net solar radiance at crop surface in MJ m−2 day−1, G is solar
    heat flux density in MJ m−2 day−1, T is the air temperature at 2 m height in °C,
    u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height in m s−1, es is saturation vapour pressure
    in kPa, ea is actual vapour pressure in kPa, (es—ea) is saturation vapour pressure
    deficit in kPa, ∆ is slope vapour pressure curve in kPa °C−1, γ is psychrometric
    constant equivalent to 0.665 × 10–3 P in kPa °C−1. Fig. 2 Flow chart to estimate
    daily ET0 using FAO-56 Penman Monteith empirical framework Full size image Table
    2 Data used Full size table Saturation vapour pressure eo(T) kPa at temperature
    T °C is computed using below empirical equation $${e}^{o}\\left(T\\right)=0.6108{\\text{exp}}\\left[\\frac{17.27{\\text{T}}}{{\\text{T}}+237.3}\\right]$$
    (2) Due to the nonlinearity of Eq. 2, the mean saturation vapour pressure for
    a day should be computed as the mean between the saturation vapour pressure at
    the mean daily maximum and minimum air temperature for that period. $${e}_{s}=\\frac{{e}^{o}({T}_{max})+{e}^{o}({T}_{min})}{2}$$
    (3) Actual vapour pressure (ea) computed from the relative humidity and saturation
    vapour pressure using below empirical equation $${e}_{a}=\\frac{{e}^{o}\\left({T}_{min}\\right)*\\frac{{RH}_{max}}{100}+{e}^{o}\\left({T}_{max}\\right)*\\frac{{RH}_{min}}{100}}{2}$$
    (4) The slope vapour pressure curve (∆) [kPa °C-1] at a given ait temperature
    T°C is computed by $$\\Delta =\\frac{4098 [0.6108exp\\left(\\frac{17.27T}{T+237.3}\\right)]}{{(T+237.2)}^{2}}$$
    (5) The psychrometric constant (γ) is computed using P daily mean atmospheric
    pressure (kPa), λ the latent heat of vaporization (2.45 MJ kg−1), Cp the specific
    heat at constant pressure (1.013 × 10–3 MJ kg−1 °C−1), ε ratio molecular weight
    of water vapor/ dry air (0.622) given by $$\\gamma =\\frac{{C}_{p}P}{\\varepsilon
    \\lambda }=0.000665 P$$ (6) where mean atmospheric pressure P (kPa) can be computed
    from the elevation in meters z by using the below equation $$P=101.3 (\\frac{293-0.0065
    z}{293}{)}^{5.26}$$ (7) Wind speed at 2 m height is required to compute ET0. Generally,
    in meteorology operations anemometers are placed at 10 m height and in agrometeorology
    it is placed at the 2 m or 3 m height. To adjust the wind speed data a logarithmic
    wind speed profile is used for measurement above a short-grassed surface $${u}_{2}={u}_{z}
    \\frac{4.87}{{\\text{ln}}(67.8 z-5.42)}$$ (8) The soil heat flux (G) is the energy
    that is used in heating the soil. The positive value of G shows that the soil
    is warming and negative value of G shows the soil is cooling. In the estimation
    of ET0, soil heat flux is negligible compared to Rn when the surface is fully
    covered with vegetation $$G\\approx 0$$ (9) Net solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1)
    is the difference between net shortwave solar radiation and net longwave solar
    radiation. $${R}_{n}={R}_{net\\;shortwave}-{R}_{net\\;longwave}$$ (10) $${R}_{net\\;shortwave}=\\left(1-\\alpha
    \\right) {R}_{Surface\\;insolation}$$ (11) where α is the albedo of a hypothetical
    grass reference crop with a value of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a). The earth absorbs
    the solar radiation and converts it to heat energy. Some of the longwave radiation
    is absorbed by the atmosphere and some of loses into space. Net longwave solar
    radiation (Rnl) is computed using the empirical equation $${R}_{nl}=\\sigma \\left[\\frac{{T}_{max,
    k}^{4}+{T}_{min, k}^{4}}{2}\\right]\\left(0.34-0.14\\sqrt{{e}_{a}}\\right)\\left(1.35\\frac{{R}_{s}}{{R}_{so}}-0.35\\right)$$
    (12) where Rnl is net outgoing longwave radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), σ is Stefan-Boltzmann
    constant (4.903 X 10–9 MJ K−2 m−2 day−1), Tmax, k is the maximum absolute temperature
    during 24 h period in Kelvin, Tmin, k is minimum absolute temperature during 24
    h period in Kelvin, ea is actual vapour pressure (kPa), Rs is solar radiation
    (MJ m−2 day−1), Rso is clear sky radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), and Rs/Rso is relative
    shortwave radiation (limited to ≤ 1.0). Clear sky radiation can be computed $${R}_{so}=\\left(0.75+2
    X {10}^{-5} Z\\right) {R}_{a}$$ (13) where Z is the station elevation above sea
    level (m) and Ra is the extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). The extraterrestrial
    radiation can be computed $${R}_{a}=\\frac{24 \\left(60\\right)}{\\Pi }{G}_{sc}{d}_{r}\\left[{\\omega
    }_{s}{\\text{sin}}\\left(\\phi \\right){\\text{sin}}\\left(\\delta \\right)+{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\phi
    \\right){\\text{cos}}\\left(\\delta \\right){\\text{sin}}\\left({\\omega }_{s}\\right)\\right]$$
    (14) where Ra is extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), Gsc is solar constant
    equal to 0.0820 MJ m−2 min−1, dr is inverse relative distance between Earth and
    Sun, ωs is sunset hour angle in radian, ϕ is latitude in radian, δ is solar decimation
    in radian. $${d}_{r}=1+0.033\\;cos\\;\\left(\\frac{2\\Pi J}{365}\\right)$$ (15)
    $$\\delta =0.409\\;{\\text{sin}}\\;\\left(\\frac{2\\Pi J}{365}-1.39\\right)$$
    (16) where dr is inverse distance between the earth and the sun, δ is the solar
    decimation angle, and J is the number of days between 1 to 365 or 366 in Julian
    date. $${\\omega }_{s}=arccos\\left(-{\\text{tan}}(\\phi ){\\text{tan}}(\\delta
    )\\right)$$ (17) where ωs is sunset hour angle and ranges between -1 to 1. Daylight
    hours are calculated from the sunset angle in radians $$N = \\frac{24 {\\omega
    }_{s}}{\\pi }$$ (18) Solar radiation is derived from the station measured bright
    sunshine hours (BSSH) and day light hours (N) using an empirical equation. $$Solar\\;Radiation=a+\\left(\\frac{b*BSSH}{N}\\right)*
    {R}_{a}$$ (19) where a = 0.25 and b = 0.5 are constants, Ra is extraterrestrial
    radiation and N is daylight hours. Statistical analysis used for error estimation
    A statistical analysis was conducted to compare the estimates from weather stations
    with the estimated gridded reference evapotranspiration (ET0) data. Evaluation
    metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error
    (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)
    were calculated at both daily and monthly temporal scales. Mean Absolute Percentage
    Error (MAPE) MAPE is a measure of prediction accuracy in the percentage of predicted
    (P) with respect to observed data (O). It is calculated using the below empirical
    equation $$MAPE=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|\\frac{{O}_{i}-{P}_{i}}{{O}_{i}}\\right|}{n}
    X 100$$ (20) Coefficient of determination (R2) The coefficient of determination
    (R-squared) is basically “goodness of fit” and is the proportion of the fluctuations
    in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. R2
    values varyvary between 0 to 1, where 1 represents a perfect fit and 0 represents
    that the model fails. $${R}^{2}= {\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}({O}_{i} - \\overline{O
    })({P}_{i} - \\overline{P })}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({O}_{i} - \\overline{O })}^{2}}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({P}_{i}
    - \\overline{P })}^{2}}}\\right]}^{2}$$ (21) where Oi is daily observed ET0 and
    Pi is daily estimated gridded ET0. Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE)
    The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) is a normalized statistic that determines
    the relative magnitude of the residual variance (“noise”) compared to the measured
    data variance (“information”) (Nash and Sutcliffe 1970). The NSE varies between
    1 (perfect fit) to -∞. The NSE less than 0 indicates that the mean value of observed
    time series data would have been a better predicator than the simulated model
    time series data. $$NSE=1- \\left[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({O}_{i} - {P}_{i}
    \\right)}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({O}_{i} - \\overline{O }\\right)}^{2}}\\right]$$
    (22) where Oi is daily observed ET0 and Pi is daily estimated gridded ET0. Bias
    correction In this study, we utilized the simple and data-efficient linear bias
    correction statistical method. To accurately capture weather conditions and ET0,
    we computed a yearly scale factor (α) based on a time series of station-estimated
    ET0 and gridded-estimated ET0 data (Eq. 23). To overcome the limitations arising
    from limited data availability, we considered meteorological subdivisions, which
    group regions exhibiting similar weather patterns. For each subdivision, we determined
    a bias scale factor by leveraging ground station data. This approach effectively
    encompasses the wide spectrum of weather conditions and evapotranspiration patterns
    found across various subdivisions, despite the constraints posed by limited station
    data availability. $$Scaling\\;factor\\;\\left(\\alpha \\right)= \\frac{mean\\;observed}{mean\\;simulated}$$
    (23) Probability of Detection (POD) The performance diagram (Roebber 2009) is
    a valuable tool for comparing the probability of detection (POD) and success ratio
    (SR) between two datasets: estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS model ET0. It utilizes
    a contingency table (Table 3) to assess hits, false alarms, misses, and missing
    rejections when comparing observed values to derived products. This diagram enables
    a comprehensive evaluation of these metrics, providing insights into the performance
    and agreement of the datasets. The comparison was conducted between the gridded
    estimated ET0, GLDAS ET0, and station-estimated ET0 for the period 2017–2018.
    ET0 values were categorized as low (0–5 mm), medium (5–10 mm), and high (10–15
    mm), allowing for a thorough analysis of dataset performance within different
    ET0 ranges. Table 3 Contingency table Full size table $$Probability\\;of\\;Detection\\;(POD)=
    \\frac{A}{A+C}$$ (24) $$False\\;Alarm\\;Rate\\;(FAR)= \\frac{B}{A+B}$$ (25) $$Success\\;Ratio\\;(SR)=1-FAR$$
    (26) Results and discussions Spatiotemporal distribution of ET 0 over the Indian
    region Evapotranspiration varies throughout the year in response to seasonal changes,
    as it is influenced by factors such as radiation and temperature. Figure 3 illustrates
    the spatiotemporal variations of monthly ET0. From January to May, ET0 gradually
    increases due to rising in surface temperatures. However, from June to September,
    ET0 decreases as the southwest monsoon arrives and progresses. During October
    to December, ET0 further decreases due to declining surface temperatures. Notably,
    in January and February, certain regions such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Central Maharashtra,
    Karnataka, Telangana, West Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu exhibit comparatively
    high ET0 values to other regions. These elevated ET0 values during the Rabi season
    may necessitate field-level interventions for risk management, especially if they
    coincide with critical stages of Rabi crops like wheat. Fig. 3 Spatiotemporal
    distribution of monthly ET0 over the Indian region Full size image From March
    onwards until the onset of the monsoon, ET0 rapidly increases over India, except
    in extreme north and northeast regions, due to the rise in temperature and solar
    radiation. As the monsoon arrives and progresses, ET0 values decrease. However,
    in rainfed regions, where Kharif crops depend on rainfall, it is essential to
    regularly monitor water stress in plants to address the high evapotranspiration
    demand and provide timely irrigation. The regular monitoring of evapotranspiration
    under the present climate variability and erratic monsoon behaviour is crucial
    for effective climate risk management. The North-eastern and Western Ghats region
    of India exhibited minimal annual variability in ET0 values, primarily due to
    consistently low temperatures throughout the year. On the other hand, the northwestern,
    central, and certain areas of the northern plains (Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya
    Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh) experienced the highest annual variability
    in ET0. The monthly sub-division wise heatmap (Fig. 4) clearly illustrates that
    these regions, including East and West Rajasthan, N. I. Karnataka, Coastal A.
    P., Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Rayalaseema, Marathwada, and Madhya Pradesh, consistently
    show high ET0 values throughout most months of the year. As these regions are
    predominantly rainfed and prone to drought (Soni et al. 2023), accurate ET0 values
    are crucial for planning appropriate crop types and cropping patterns to maximize
    agricultural productivity. Fig. 4 Sub-division wise monthly temporal variation
    of ET0 Full size image Daily temporal variation of ET 0 at meteorological subdivision
    level Regions such as hilly and coastal areas exhibit relatively low temporal
    variation in ET0 (Fig. 4), ranging from 0.8 mm to 6.5 mm. On the other hand, the
    northern plains, central and southern parts of India (excluding the coastal region)
    display high temporal variation, with values ranging from 0.8 mm to 12.14 mm throughout
    the year. These rainfed regions, characterized by significant variations in the
    southwest monsoon, are susceptible to drought, highlighting the need for timely
    information to assess and manage irrigation scheduling and other agricultural
    operations. In the time series (Fig. 5), it is clear that the ET0 is following
    the same pattern and temporal variation for years 2017 and 2018. Central and few
    areas of the Northern plains of India (Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar,
    and Uttar Pradesh) shows high standard deviation with variation of 1.44 to 2.23
    mm, North-eastern region shows a low standard deviation with a variation 0.9 to
    1.0 mm, northern hilly region varies 1.26 to 1.85 mm, coastal region varies 0.8
    to 1.68 mm, and south region except coastal varies 1.1 to 1.68 mm. Spatial analysis
    of ET0 carried out (Rao et al. 2012) also reflects the low ET0 value over hilly
    and coastal regions whereas comparatively high values over arid regions and central
    India due to high advective energy and high atmospheric demand over the area.

    ET0 with station estimated ET0 for the year 2017 and 2018 Full size image Calibration
    of satellite based ET 0 estimates The calibration and validation of estimated
    gridded ET0 at the sub-divisional level provide greater confidence in the agricultural
    scientific community when issuing advisories to farmers and planners. A linear
    bias correction method was employed to estimate the bias correction factor (α)
    for the years 2017 and 2018. Figure 6 depicts that the bias factor remains relatively
    stable for both years, except in Himachal Pradesh where there was limited data
    available for the year 2018. In this study, the bias correction factor (α) was
    derived from the 2017 data and applied as a correction factor to the daily estimated
    gridded ET0 for 2018. Different seasons are influenced by various parameters impacting
    ET0, as evidenced by the sensitivity analysis of the PM empirical equation (Bois
    et al. 2008). For example, wind speed exhibits the highest sensitivity during
    winters, while net solar radiation holds greater influence during the summer season.
    The study also suggests conducting seasonal calibration to minimize errors introduced
    by input parameters. The estimated gridded ET0 generally tends to be overestimated
    across all meteorological subdivisions, but it exhibits a strong correlation with
    the station estimates. Figure 7 demonstrates a significant reduction (ranging
    from 60 to 80%) in MAPE error in subdivisions like Himachal Pradesh and Punjab,
    both at daily and monthly scales. The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) statistics
    (Fig. 8) generally indicate values below 0.5, except for Chhattisgarh, Coastal
    AP, East MP, Kerala, Rayalaseema, and Saurashtra. However, after applying bias
    correction calibration, the ET0 of 79% of the meteorological subdivisions showed

    and calibrated gridded ET0 Full size image Statistical comparison of estimated
    gridded ET 0 with station ET 0 Stations were carefully chosen to cover every meteorological
    subdivision, ensuring comprehensive coverage. The evaluation of the estimated
    gridded ET0 performance was conducted at different temporal scales, ranging from
    daily to monthly, using statistical parameters such as R2, NSE, and MAPE. Substantial
    variations in the statistical parameters were observed among the meteorological
    subdivisions at the daily scale, but the accuracy significantly improved when
    comparing the datasets at higher temporal scales. The daily coefficient of correlation
    (R2) values between the datasets of station estimates and nearest grid estimates
    of gridded ET0 varied from 0.34 to 0.9. A notable improvement was observed at
    the 3-day accumulated temporal scale, where R2 values ranged from 0.68 to 0.94.
    Subsequently, further improvement in accuracy was observed at higher temporal
    scales (Fig. 9). The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) score, comparing station
    estimates and nearest grid estimates of gridded ET0, exhibited a similar trend
    (ranging from 0.16 to 0.88) to the coefficient of correlation (R2), with a low
    NSE value in subdivisions such as Coastal Karnataka, S. I. Karnataka, and N.I.
    Karnataka (Fig. 10). Since NSE measures the relative accuracy of the model estimates
    compared to the average observed value, it is evident that accuracy improves with
    a higher temporal scale, highlighting the quantitative improvement in accuracy.
    The Maximum Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) ranged from 10 to 27% on the daily
    scale, and a notable reduction in error was observed as the temporal scale increased
    (Fig. 11). High MAPE (> 20%) values over the Arunachal Pradesh. Bihar, Concan

    Kerala, Odisha, Rayalaseema, Sourashtra, Telangana, and West MP. Fig. 9 R2 comparison

    regions (Coastal Karnataka, Gangetic WB, Odisha, Kerala, Konkan & Goa, N. I. Karnataka,
    S. I. Karnataka, and Tamilnadu) and certain hilly regions (Arunachal Pradesh,
    Assam & Meghalaya, and NMMT) display higher MAPE errors and lower values of R2
    and NSE. These differences can be primarily due to the uncertainty in wind data
    in coastal areas and temperature variations in hilly regions. Considering the
    inherent variations in daily ET0, its practicality in agriculture advisory may
    be somewhat limited when compared to the more reliable multiday accumulated ET0
    values. The multiday accumulated ET0 values demonstrate a significant enhancement
    in accuracy and can be harnessed effectively for diverse agricultural planning
    purposes such as water budgeting, irrigation scheduling, and more. Statistical
    comparison of GLDAS model ET 0 with station ET 0 The Global Land Data Assimilation
    System (GLDAS) provides a 3-hourly ET0 product that can be accumulated over different
    time intervals, ranging from daily to monthly, for comparison with station-estimated
    ET0. When assessing ET0 at a daily scale, the GLDAS model-based ET0 exhibited
    satisfactory agreement in most of the meteorological subdivisions, with correlation
    coefficients ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 and NSE coefficients ranging from -1.3 to
    0.8 (Fig. 12). Without calibration, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    varied from 74 to 233%, but after calibration, it decreased to a range of 12%
    to 52% (Fig. 13). In summary, it can be concluded that the GLDAS ET0 tends to
    significantly overestimate values and, therefore, requires calibration before
    practical use. Fig. 12 NSE comparison of non–calibrated and calibrated GLDAS ET0

    ET0 Full size image The meteorological subdivisions of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam
    & Meghalaya, Coastal Karnataka, Gangetic WB, N. I. Karnataka, NMMT, Odisha, S.
    I. Karnataka, and SHWB displayed a weak correlation (R2 less than 0.5) at the
    daily scale. Furthermore, there was no observed improvement in the North Eastern
    subdivisions of Arunachal Pradesh, NMMT, and SHWB even at the monthly time scale.
    The NSE score also indicated a poor relationship between the datasets in most
    of the subdivisions, with negative values observed for Arunachal Pradesh, Assam
    and Meghalaya, Coastal Karnataka, NMMT, Odisha, SHWB, and Tamil Nadu. Although
    some subdivisions like Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Jharkhand, Gangetic WB, and Assam and
    Meghalaya showed good agreement (R2), the NSE score clearly indicates poor relative
    accuracy of the model estimates compared to the average observed value (Figs.
    14 and 15). Fig. 14 R2 comparison between the estimated station and GLDAS ET0
    at various temporal scale Full size image Fig. 15 NSE comparison between the estimated
    station and GLDAS ET0 at various temporal scales Full size image Statistical comparison
    of GLDAS ET 0 with estimated gridded ET 0 GLDAS ET0 estimates are valuable but
    they have certain limitations. The model relies on input data and has certain
    assumptions that may introduce uncertainties. Local calibration and validation
    are necessary to improve the accuracy in a specific region. As mentioned in the
    earlier section, it was observed that the GLDAS model overestimated ET0, indicating
    that the overall ET0 values are reduced by approximately 54% after bias correction
    (Fig. 16). Season-wise analysis was conducted for both calibrated estimated gridded
    ET0 and calibrated GLDAS ET0. As shown in Fig. 17, the RMSE error was found to
    be higher during the Monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons across most subdivisions.
    In contrast, it was lower during the post-monsoon and winter seasons, which can
    be attributed to the lower temperatures and solar radiation during those periods.
    A similar pattern was observed in GLDAS ET0, although with a higher standard deviation
    and RMSE, as depicted in Fig. 18. In the winter and post-monsoon seasons, the
    estimated gridded ET0 exhibits a low RMSE, with most stations recording values
    below 0.5 mm. Furthermore, there is a strong correlation agreement ranging from
    0.6 to 0.9 among all stations, except for Jharkhand. However, in the case of GLDAS
    ET0, the RMSE values for most stations range from 0.4 to 1 mm, with a correlation
    agreement ranging from 0.2 to 0.9, except for Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu, and SHWB.
    During the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, the estimated gridded ET0 shows an
    RMSE ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm, with approximately 80% of stations displaying a
    correlation greater than 0.6. On the other hand, GLDAS ET0 exhibits an RMSE ranging
    from 0.5 to 1.5 mm, with around 60% of stations correlating greater than 0.6.
    The accuracy of both datasets is relatively lower during the monsoon season, and
    they demonstrate similar behaviour to the pre-monsoon period. The findings of
    the study indicate that GLDAS ET0 can be reliably utilized during the post-monsoon
    and winter seasons. However, for the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, further
    investigation and calibration of the GLDAS model ET0 are recommended to enhance
    its accuracy in those periods. Fig. 16 Bias correction factor comparison between

    (POD) The estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS ET0 were compared to ground observations
    for the period 2017–2018. The datasets were divided into three categories based
    on ET0 values: low (0–5 mm), medium (5–10 mm), and high (10–15 mm). In Fig. 19,
    the performance of the two datasets is represented by POD and SR scores for the
    low (red) and medium range ET0 (black) categories, which show good agreement.
    However, the performance of GLDAS ET0 in the medium range (5–10 mm) is not as
    good. In the case of the high ET0 (10–15 mm) category, both datasets exhibit degraded
    performance, but the estimated gridded ET0 shows a relatively higher probability
    of detection with a POD of 0.4 and SR of 0.9 than the GLDAS ET0. Fig. 19 Performance

    This paper examines the spatiotemporal distribution of reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) patterns across various meteorological regions of India. The study proposed
    a gridded ET0 dataset which is generated through the integration of observed gridded
    data, model reanalysis products, and satellite data. Furthermore, the study includes
    a comprehensive statistical comparison with station estimates and other available
    sources as well, such as the GLDAS model ET0. The analysis highlights the importance
    of monitoring evapotranspiration, especially in rainfed regions and during climate
    variability, for effective climate risk management and agricultural planning.
    Different regions of India show varying levels of annual and temporal variability
    in ET0 values, with coastal and hilly areas showing lower variability compared
    to regions like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh.
    Calibration of various model based ET0 is crucial for precise advisories to farmers
    and planners. The study employs a linear bias correction method and suggests conducting
    seasonal calibration to minimize errors introduced by input parameters. The analysis
    demonstrates improvements in accuracy and correlation between estimated gridded
    ET0 and station ET0 values after calibration. However, discrepancies still exist,
    particularly in coastal and hilly regions, indicating the need for further improvement
    in those areas. The study also compares the GLDAS model-based ET0 with station-estimated
    ET0. GLDAS ET0 tends to overestimate values and requires calibration for practical
    use. The analysis shows varying levels of agreement and accuracy between GLDAS
    ET0 and station ET0 across different meteorological subdivisions and seasons.
    Probability of detection (POD) analysis is also performed to assess the performance
    of estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS ET0 in different ET0 value categories. The
    estimated gridded ET0 demonstrates better performance, particularly in the high
    ET0 range, compared to GLDAS ET0. The findings of this study can also contribute
    to the global model datasets to calibrate the models at the regional level. In
    developing countries like India, establishing and maintaining a dense network
    of observatories for reliable and accurate weather data is challenging. However,
    leveraging satellite data and high-resolution models in the current era allows
    for capturing spatial variability and identifying vulnerable areas, enabling prompt
    advisories and solutions. In summary, this study highlights the significance of
    precise ET0 estimation for agricultural planning, risk management, and irrigation
    scheduling, while emphasizing the regional and seasonal variations in ET0 patterns
    across India. Data availability The data that support the findings of this study

  description: Today, the use of sensors and imaging techniques, which are used to
    obtain information about plants and soil in smart irrigation systems, is rapidly
    becoming widespread. This study aimed to investigate the usability of leaf turgor
    pressure and thermal images from plant-based monitoring techniques to detect water
    stress and the irrigation time of pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. “California Wonder”)
    and to determine their relationship with physiological traits in Canakkale/Türkiye
    in 2017 and 2018. The four irrigation treatments (100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%) were
    applied in the experiment. Leaf turgor pressure (Pp), thermal images and physiological
    measurements were carried out during the growing season. Soil moisture and Pp
    were monitored in real time by remote. Thermal and physiological measurements
    were made before each irrigation. As a result of the study, the average evapotranspiration
    (ETc) was 697 mm, and the yield value was 83.7 t ha−1 under non-stress conditions.
    Depending on the decrease in ETc, yield values also decreased significantly. Leaf
    water potential and stomatal conductivity values were statistically different
    in all irrigation treatments. The change in the activity of catalase (CAT) due
    to water stress was greater than that of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In this case,
    it can be said that other physiological traits are more successful than SOD in
    distinguishing water stress. According to the regression models, significant relationships
    were determined between both the indices calculated from the thermal images and
    Pp, yield, and physiological traits. The predictive ability of Pp values has been
    strengthened with the addition of meteorological properties to the model in general.
    The highest correlation (R2 =0.63) was between Pp + meteorological properties
    and CAT. All the regression models between physiological traits and indices calculated
    from thermal images were statistically significant. The highest R2 values were
    obtained in August. In this month, the highest correlations were between Crop
    Water Stress Index (CWSIp) and leaf water potential / stomatal conductivity (R2
    =0.91), IGp and stomatal conductivity (R2 =0.80). The predictive power of CWSIp
    was higher than Stomatal Conductivity Index (IGp). The experiment illustrated
    that Pp and temperature data, which are plant-based monitoring methods, have the
    potential to detect water stress in peppers.

    • The pepper plant is very sensitive to water stress. • Instant monitoring of
    both the soil and the plant is quite important. • Stomatal conductance and leaf
    water potential are effective indicators of water stress. • Physiological traits
    can be monitored in real time using Pp probe. • Yield and physiological properties
    can be accurately predicted from thermal indices. Abstract Today, the use of sensors

    1. Introduction Today, as in all sectors, the use of technology in the modernization
    process in agriculture is rapidly becoming widespread. Among these, remote sensing
    and sensor technologies in agricultural fields has gained importance. By using
    these techniques and technologies, it is now easier to understand the physiological
    state of the plant. Studies aimed at reducing the possible effects of environmental
    stress on plants were emphasized. Accordingly, the employment of new technologies
    has been the subject of studies to prevent the possible effects of water/drought
    stress on plants. Numerous studies have been conducted from the past to the present
    on the effects of water stress on plants. There are many valid indicators measured
    in the monitoring of plant water status, especially leaf water potential. However,
    the techniques used in the determination of the said indicators have disadvantages,
    such as damaging the plant, taking a long time to determine, and not allowing
    instant monitoring. Jones (2004) also pointed out some of the drawbacks of the
    various instruments employed in plant-based observations. In response to these
    disadvantages, sensors based on turgor pressure that allow continuous monitoring
    of the water status of the plant have been developed (Zimmermann et al., 2008).
    The use of these sensors has been researched in various plants (Rüger et al.,
    2010, Zimmermann et al., 2010, Ehrenberger et al., 2012, Fernandes et al., 2017).
    In addition, studies on the determination of symptoms caused by water stress with
    remote sensing techniques are increasing. Remote sensing is used because it is
    difficult to measure water stress indicators with ground-based techniques. For
    example, stomatal conductivity, which is an important indicator of the plant''s
    stress level, can be estimated with indices calculated from thermal images (Jones,
    1999). Plants under stress use enzymatic mechanisms to protect themselves. In
    such a case, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase,
    and glutathione reductase enzymes are active (Arora et al., 2002). These components
    involved in the enzymatic mechanism are used to inactivate free radicals called
    reactive oxygen species (ROS), which will occur when plants are exposed to stress.
    While the synthesis of ROS species is low under normal growing conditions, the
    amount of these compounds increases when plant growth is stressed (Smirnoff, 1993,
    Mullineaux and Karpinski, 2002, Miller et al., 2010). Under stress conditions,
    the plant defends itself with enzymatic or non-enzymatic mechanisms and tries
    to inactivate ROS species by synthesizing the above-mentioned components. Water
    stress or drought, are both the most important sources of environmental stress
    for plants. As with other environmental stresses, water stress causes the synthesis
    of ROS species and creates oxidative stress (Scandalios, 1997). Some studies have
    been conducted on the synthesis of enzymes that inactivate ROS species under conditions
    of water stress (Yaşar et al., 2013, Murshed et al., 2013). However, in these
    studies the relations between these enzymes used to determine the onset and level
    of stress cannot be detected visually and the thermal measurements and turgor
    level of the leaf were not discussed. Turkey, particularly the province of Canakkale,
    plays an important role in pepper production. Pepper production ranks second among
    vegetables in the province (Anonymous, 2015). The fact that pepper has great potential
    for the region and no research been carried out globally on the determination
    of water stress in pepper using turgor pressure and thermal images, prompted the
    necessity of the study. In order to determine water stress and irrigation time;
    this study, which is unique because it uses turgor and thermography techniques
    allowing rapid and instant monitoring without damaging the plant, aims to demonstrate
    the usability of plant-based monitoring techniques instead of soil-based monitoring
    techniques, and to create statistical models among them with yield and known physiological
    stress indicators (leaf water potential, stomatal conductivity, superoxide dismutase,
    and catalase activity). 2. Material and methods 2.1. Experimental site and design
    In 2017 and 2018, the experiment was conducted on Aristocrat F1 pepper (Capsicum
    annuum L. cv. ''California Wonder'') in the Crop Production and Research Station
    of the Faculty of Agriculture at Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University. Some soil
    features of the experiment area are given in (Table 1). Available water capacity
    (AWC) in the root zone (60 cm) of pepper is 81.4 mm. According to meteorological
    data, the average air temperature and total rainfall from May to October were
    22.3 °C and 143 mm in 2017, and 22.7 °C and 187 mm in 2018. The long-term average
    (1950–2017) is 21.1 °C air temperature and 152.2 mm precipitation. Table 1. Some
    physical analysis results of the experiment area soils. Soil Depth (cm) Texture
    Bulk Density (gr cm−3) Field Capacity (Pv, %) Wilting Point (Pv, %) 0–30 SL 1.49
    34.9 22.4 30–60 SL 1.53 33.9 19.3 Each plot had an area of 3.5 × 6.6 m, with three
    replicates in a randomized block design of each treatment. The peppers were planted
    at a density of 33 × 70 cm on 26.05.2017 and 25.05.2018. To prevent water from
    flowing between treatments and the measurements being affected, a 2.1-meter gap
    was left between each parcel. In the study, four irrigation regimes were applied
    to the pepper plants: S100 (full irrigation), S75 (75% of the water consumed in
    S100), S50 (50% of the water consumed in S100) and S25 (25% of the water consumed
    in S100). In full irrigation, lack of moisture in the soil was completed to field
    capacity when 40 ± 5% of the available water capacity in the effective root zone
    was consumed. In both years, each plot received 20 kg ha−1 of 20–20–20 NPK + trace
    elements before planting and 4 L ha−1 of humic acid and 4 kg ha−1 12–8–13 NPK
    + 3 MgO + trace elements at the flowering stage of the pepper. Further fertilization
    procedures were performed during fruit formation (2 kg ha−1 MAP 12–61–0 and 4
    L ha−1 humic acid twice, 0.6 L ha−1 16% Ca). Herbicides and pesticides were used
    when necessary. 2.2. Irrigation water amount and evapotranspiration Sensors (GS1
    model, Decagon Devices, Inc., WA, USA) were placed to 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm, and 60–90
    cm depths of the soil on all parcels for monitoring soil moisture required to
    determine the irrigation water requirement and evapotranspiration. The data from
    the sensors were instantly monitored via a remote monitoring system (Devint Informatics,
    Izmir, Turkey). The sensors were calibrated with actual soil moisture values before
    the experiment started. The moisture level in the soil was kept at the level of
    field capacity continuously until July 10 in the first year and July 11 in the
    second year. After these dates, irrigation was started according to the treatments.
    The volume of water applied to each treatment was calculated by multiplying the
    area by the percentage of cover and was applied to the experimental plots in a
    controlled manner using a water meter. The percentage of cover was obtained by
    dividing the cover width of five randomly selected plants between rows before
    each irrigation. This value was taken as at least 30%. Calibrated data obtained
    from the soil moisture sensors placed on 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–90 cm soil layers
    for all repetitions of each subject was used to determine evapotranspiration.
    The effective plant root depth was taken as 60 cm, and the moisture content at
    60–90 cm soil depth was monitored for percolation and water table movement. The
    evapotranspiration amounts for each experimental treatment were calculated using
    Eq. 1, according to the water budget method (James, 1988): (1) ET = I + P - D
    ± R ± ΔS where ET: evapotranspiration (mm), I: irrigation water (mm), P: precipitation
    (mm), D: deep percolation (mm), R: the runoff (mm), ΔS: the change in soil water
    storage (mm). During the experiment, deep percolation was ignored since there
    was no change in the moisture sensors placed in the 60–90 cm soil layer. In addition,
    since the amount of precipitation occurring in this period was at a level that
    does not cause runoff, this value was accepted as zero in the equation. 2.3. Yield
    All plants in each plot, except for edge eﬀects, were regularly harvested and
    the yield was calculated as tonnes per hectare by weighing the harvested pepper.
    Harvest started on the 66th and 70th days after planting and ended on the 155th
    and 154th days, according to 2017 and 2018, respectively. 2.4. Plant based measurements
    In the study, stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, superoxide dismutase
    and catalase activity, leaf turgor pressure and plant temperature from plant-based
    measurements were determined. The measurements in question were made from 3 different
    leaves of 3 randomly selected plants at each replication. A total of 27 measurements
    were taken for each treatment. 2.4.1. Stomatal conductance Stomatal conductance
    was measured on the abaxial surfaces of the leaves using a steady state leaf porometer
    (SC-1, Decagon Devices, USA). The measurements were made on a sun-exposed and
    mature leaves of selected plants at each replication, before irrigation (the 45th
    day after planting), between 11:00 and 14:00. 2.4.2. Leaf water potential Leaf
    water potential was measured in leaves from 3 different plants at each replication
    using a pressure chamber instrument (Model 1000, PMS Instrument, USA) following
    the standard methodology (Scholander et al., 1965). The fully developed and sun-exposed
    leaves of the plant at that time were used in the measurements. These measurements
    were made before irrigation and in the midday. 2.4.3. Superoxide dismutase and
    catalase activity Leaf samples required for the determination of enzyme activity
    were taken five times on the days when other measurements were made, considering
    the developmental status of the plants. Three plants alike with plants in other
    measurements were selected from each plot for sampling. Three leaves from these
    plants were taken, and biochemical analyses were made. Superoxide dismutase (SOD)
    (Kakkar et al., 1984) and catalase (CAT) activity (Luck, 1963) values were determined
    in these samples. 2.4.4. Leaf turgor pressure and thermal measurements In the
    study, leaf patch clamp pressure (LPCP) probes (YARA ZIM Plant Technology GmbH,
    Hennigsdorf, Germany) were used to determine leaf turgor pressure and a thermal
    camera (Fluke Ti27 model, Fluke, USA) was used to obtain thermal images. The outputs
    of LPCP are called patch pressure (Pp). The concepts of this probe were described
    in further depth by Zimmermann et al. (2008). Details of the procedures in this
    study are also described in Camoglu et al. (2021). The modified crop water stress
    index (CWSI) and stomatal conductance index (IG) were calculated using the thermal
    imaging by means of Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively (Jones, 1999). The measurement
    and calculation details regarding these are also given in detail in Camoglu et
    al. (2021): (2) (3) where Tcanopy: The canopy temperature, Twet: the temperatures
    of the wet reference surface and Tdry: the temperatures of the dry reference surfaces.
    Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitation were recorded hourly
    with the help of the climate station placed in the experimental area to be used
    in thermal measurements and leaf pressures. 2.5. Statistical analysis Data obtained
    from the two-year field experiments were subjected to variance analysis. Duncan’s
    multiple comparison test was applied to compare differences between mean values.
    Regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between leaf turgor
    pressure, thermal indices, and the traits examined. In this context, the simple
    linear regression method was used for the estimation of yield and physiological
    traits by means of thermal indices. Regression graphs were prepared in the MS
    Excel program, and the significance levels of the regression models obtained were
    determined in the SAS package program (SAS Institute, 1999). The multiple linear
    regression method was used to estimate the yield and physiological traits by employing
    the leaf turgor pressure and meteorological properties. These models were created
    using the stargazer package of the R program (Development Core Team, 2012). 3.
    Results and discussion 3.1. Changes in soil moisture In the first year of the
    experiment, all treatments were brought to field capacity on the 38th day after
    planting (DAP38), and irrigation treatments began to be applied on the 45th day
    (Fig. 1). Irrigation was finished on DAP125 and soil moisture was monitored until
    the day (DAP155) of the last harvest. When the soil moisture values of the irrigation
    treatments are examined, it is seen that the moisture values in the S100 treatment
    generally vary between the field capacity and the 40% value, which is the allowed
    portion (Ry) of the available water capacity. Soil moisture decreased below the
    40% limit since DAP110 for S75, DAP72 for S50, and DAP57 for S25. However, the
    moisture content of S25 remained at the wilting point level since DAP86. Download

    Changes in soil moisture at effective root depth of treatments in (a) 2017, (b)
    2018. In the second year of the experiment, all parcels were brought to field
    capacity on DAP43, and irrigation treatments began to be applied on DAP47 (Fig.
    1). Irrigation was finished on DAP119, and soil moisture was monitored until DAP154,
    when the last harvest was made. In the second year, it is seen that the moisture
    changes in S100 are closer to the field capacity, compared to the first year.
    Although the soil moisture in S75 treatments fell below the Ry value from time
    to time, it changed above the limit value with irrigation and precipitation. For
    S50, the moisture value changed between Ry and the wilting point since DAP80.
    As for S25, although soil moisture values had approached the wilting point for
    a day or two (DAP98, DAP101-DAP103), they were generally above the wilting point.
    When a general evaluation is made, it is seen that the moisture values in all
    treatments were higher in the second year of the experiment compared to the first
    year. It can be said that the reason for this is that the plant growth in the
    second year is weaker than the first year. 3.2. Total amount of irrigation water
    and evapotranspiration The total irrigation water and seasonal evapotranspiration
    values were calculated to be 242–684 mm and 313–734 mm in the first year of the
    experiment, and 209–524 mm and 347–660 mm in the second year, respectively (Fig.
    2). The values in the first year were higher than the second year. This may be
    due to the meteorological differences between the two years as well as the fact
    that the first-year plant growth was slightly better than the second year. Download

    Total amount of irrigation water and seasonal evapotranspiration values of treatments
    in (a) 2017, (b) 2018. There have been many studies in Turkey and worldwide in
    which different applications (irrigation, fertilization, salt applications, chemical
    applications, etc.) were made on different pepper varieties. Despite this, studies
    on irrigation regarding the \"California Wonder\" variety in our study are insufficient.
    In one study of this variety in Canakkale, Erken (2004) used five different pan
    evaporation coefficients (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25) and applied irrigation
    water between 121.8 and 609.0 mm and 183–915 mm, respectively. Demirel et al.
    (2014) applied four different irrigation levels (100%, 66%, 33%, and 0% according
    to soil moisture) on pepper plants. As a result of their study, different amounts
    of irrigation water (between 72 mm and 801 mm) were applied to the treatments.
    Yildirim et al. (2017) used five different pan evaporation coefficients (0.00,
    0.33, 0.66, 1.00 and 1.25) in their study from which they reported that the total
    irrigation water amount and seasonal evapotranspiration values varied between
    72 and 951 mm and 72–1047 mm, respectively, in the first year of the experiment
    and between 106 and 1115 mm and 106–1085 mm, respectively, in the second year
    of the experiment. Some differences were observed between studies conducted in
    the same region and this study. It can be said that these differences may be due
    to meteorological characteristics that occurred between years and differences
    in the varieties used, even if it is the same pepper type, and since they consider
    different methods (such as Pan-Evaporation) in calculating the amount of irrigation
    water. In studies conducted in India on the same pepper variety, Paul et al. (2013)
    applied the amount of irrigation water according to the pan evaporation on mulched
    and non-mulched treatments. They used three different pan evaporation coefficients
    (1, 0.8 and 0.6) and stated that the amount of applied irrigation water varied
    between 199 mm and 319 mm. Antony and Singandhupe (2004) has applied different
    irrigation methods (surface and drip irrigation) and different irrigation levels
    according to pan evaporation (1.2, 1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 for surface irrigation and
    100%, 80%, 60% and 40% for drip irrigation). As a result of the study, they applied
    irrigation water between 200 mm and 440 mm with the surface irrigation method
    and between 141 mm and 282 mm with the drip irrigation method. It is clear that
    there are differences between the results obtained from studies conducted in different
    countries and this study; due to the irrigation methods used, method of application,
    meteorological characteristics between regions, and use of different varieties.
    3.3. Yield Yield values changed between 22.9 and 90.7 t ha−1 and 22.5 and 76.6 t
    ha−1 according to the irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018, respectively (Fig.
    3). It was seen that the yield differences among the treatments were statistically
    significant in both years of the experiment. However, although the yield values
    of the first year for S100 and S50 were different compared to the second year,
    there was no difference between S75 and S25 treatments. Download : Download high-res

    to irrigation treatments. In studies conducted in the same region (Canakkale)
    with the same pepper variety, Erken (2004) applied irrigation water using five
    different pan evaporation coefficients for two years. As a result of the study,
    it was reported that yield varied between 23.49 and 68.88 t ha−1 in the first
    year and between 21.39 and 65.64 t ha−1 in the second year. Demirel et al. (2014)
    obtained yield values between 20.25 and 84.16 t ha−1 as a result of a study in
    which they applied four different irrigation levels. Yildirim et al. (2017) used
    five different pan evaporation coefficients. They reported that the yield values
    varied between 20.25 and 84.16 t ha−1 in the first year of the experiment and
    between 12.22 and 66.93 t ha−1 in the second year. Similarities were observed
    between studies conducted in the same region and the findings obtained from the
    research. It is seen that the yield values, especially among the least irrigated
    treatments (except for the second year of the experiment by Yıldırım et al. (2017),
    are very close to each other, and the yield values obtained by Demirel et al.
    (2014) are similar to those of this study. We consider that this similarity exists
    because the amount of irrigation water applied in the experiments is calculated
    according to the moisture loss in the soil in both studies. Erken (2004) and Yıldırım
    et al. (2017) used pan evaporation while calculating the amount of irrigation
    water to be applied in their studies. For this reason, although too much irrigation
    water was applied, there was not much difference among yields in these studies.
    In studies conducted in India on the same pepper variety, Paul et al. (2013) stated
    that the yield values in mulch and non-mulched treatments varied between 18.2
    and 28.7 t ha−1. Antony and Singandhupe (2004) compared surface and drip irrigation
    methods using pan evaporation, and they obtained yield values between approximately
    28 and 45 t ha−1 and 33 and 50 t ha−1 (read from the chart), respectively, according
    to the methods. 3.4. Physiological results 3.4.1. Leaf water potential Considering
    the change in leaf water potential according to irrigation treatments in the current
    study, it was determined that there are statistically significant differences
    between irrigation treatments for 2017 (Table 2). It was determined that the water
    constraint increased respectively among the irrigation treatments applied to the
    peppers and the leaf water potential decreased in the S75, S50 and S25 treatments.
    While the mean lowest leaf water potential value was − 1.84 MPa for S25, it was
    followed by S50 (−1.56 MPa) and S75 (−1.38 MPa) treatments, respectively. The
    average highest leaf water potential value with − 1.16 MPa was obtained from the
    S100 irrigation treatments (control) where the reduced moisture was completed
    to the field capacity when 40 ± 5% of the usable moisture in the 0–60 cm soil
    layer was consumed (Table 2). Table 2. Mean and standard error values of leaf

    capital letters in each month indicate the difference between irrigation treatments.
    Different lowercase letters in each topic indicate the difference between months.
    According to the leaf water potential values of the experiment in 2018, it was
    determined that the irrigation treatments had a statistically significant effect
    on the leaf water potential in the other months except September and in the average
    values (Table 2). In this context, the lowest average leaf water potential value
    was measured at S25 (−1.52 MPa), while the highest leaf water potential value
    was determined at S100 (−1.15 MPa). When the changes in leaf water potential values
    of the treatments are examined according to the months, the leaf water potential
    values of the S100, S75 and S50 treatments did not show a significant difference
    according to the months during the experiment, which included the vegetative and
    generative periods in 2017. In the second year, this situation was only realized
    with respect to S100. The leaf water potential value of S25, where water stress
    was applied the most in both years, decreased in the following July but increased
    again with the effect of precipitation in September of the second year. It is
    thought that the change in leaf water potential, especially in this regard, may
    be due to the increase in the heat load on the plant and the number of windy days
    in Canakkale in August and September, compared to July. According to Kaufmann
    (1981), the critical level in the leaf water potential varies depending on the
    plant type and growth period, as well as the environmental conditions, and the
    value decreases rapidly with the decrease in the soil water potential. In a studies
    conducted on dwarf green beans (Köksal et al., 2010) and bell pepper (Bozkurt
    Colak, 2021), they stated that the leaf water potential values differed between
    irrigation treatments, and the value increased as the irrigation water level increased.
    Similarly, Pıtır (2015) stated that the leaf water potential and the relative
    water content of the leaves decreased because of the reduction in irrigation during
    the period from flowering to harvest in Jalepeno peppers. 3.4.2. Stomatal conductance
    It was determined that different irrigation levels applied to the pepper plant
    used in the study significantly affected the stomatal conductance of the leaves
    (Table 3). In both years, the highest stomatal conductance values were determined
    in the S100. This treatment was followed by S75, S50, and S25, respectively. All
    irrigation treatments were statistically separated from each other in all months
    (except for September 2018) of both years. In September 2018, it was seen that
    S100 and S75 were in a different group from other irrigation treatments. It was
    observed that stomatal conductance values increased in the same month, similar
    to the leaf water potential values. This can also be explained by the precipitation
    in September. As a matter of fact, this increase can also be seen when the changes
    in the treatments are analyzed according to the months. While stomatal conductance
    decreased as expected towards September in 2017, the opposite was seen in 2018.

    * : p < 0.05, Note: Different capital letters in each month indicate the difference
    between irrigation treatments, and different lowercase letters in each topic indicate
    the difference between months. This phenomenon, which occurred among the treatments
    in both years, is because plants control O2 and CO2 diffusion by closing their
    stomata in the face of abiotic stress. In other words, stomatal permeability decreases
    in pepper leaves because of decreased transpiration. Costa et al. (2000) also
    stated that the closure of stomata is one of the drought-avoidance mechanisms
    that allows plants to keep water in their tissues and that it can reduce the photosynthetic
    rate and slow down the growth rate of the plant, as it prevents CO2 from entering
    the mesophyll cells. Jones (1992) stated that leaf stomatal permeability may decrease
    under the influence of environmental factors. Eriş et al. (1998) stated that the
    stomatal conductance and transpiration rate decreased as water deficiency increased
    in grapevine varieties under the same stress level conditions. Camoglu et al.
    (2019) stated that the stomatal conductance of tomato plants decreased significantly
    due to the increase in water stress. Many researchers have also pointed out that
    drought can lead to decreases in stomatal conductance and reported that the change
    in stomatal conductance is one of the important factors affecting the drought
    resistance performance of the varieties (Mehri et al., 2009, Kuşvuran et al.,
    2009, Nawaz et al., 2015). 3.4.3. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity Superoxide
    dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, which shows the stress status in
    the plant, changed significantly depending on the irrigation treatments. When
    the changes in SOD activity by months were examined, a difference was observed
    among the treatments only in August, when the stress was highest in 2017, while
    this difference was not statistically significant in any month in 2018 (Table
    4). However, in the second year of the experiment, S25 was in a different group
    than the others, according to the mean SOD values. In the first year, this did
    not occur. When the changes in the treatments according to the months were examined,
    an increase was observed in the SOD values of all treatments after July, and this
    increase was statistically significant. Table 4. Mean and standard error values

    Note: Different capital letters in each month indicate the difference between
    irrigation treatments, and different lowercase letters in each topic indicate
    the difference between months. According to the change of CAT activity by months,
    the highest enzyme activity values were recorded in August in both years (Table
    4). Contrary to SOD values in CAT activity, differences among the treatments in
    all months and mean values were found to be statistically significant. When the
    changes in the treatments according to the months are examined, it is seen that
    the CAT value is the highest in August. Studies have shown that both SOD and CAT
    activity can be used as indicators of abiotic stress (Manchandia, 1999). CAT has
    the ability to inhibit H2O2, that occurs as a result of stress (Polidoros and
    Scandalios, 1999). SOD, on the other hand, has the ability to inhibit the first
    free radicals formed during stress, by removing O2 accumulated in the cell and
    reducing the OH– ions (Mittler, 2002). With these aspects, the synthesis of both
    enzymes increases in order to reduce the effect of free radicals formed in plant
    cells during stress. Findings from the study also confirm this. However, it has
    been observed that there may be differences in the time-dependent change of the
    enzyme activities in question due to the year or environmental conditions. 3.4.4.
    Relationships between leaf pressure, meteorological parameters, and the examined
    traits The results of the regression analyses performed to estimate the yield,
    leaf water potential, stomatal conductivity, SOD, and CAD values from the instantaneously
    recorded leaf pressure values and meteorological data are given in (Table 5).

    Evaluation for yield According to the results of the model (1) created by assigning
    leaf pressure as the sole independent variable, it is seen that the change in
    leaf pressure can explain a 54.7% variation in yield (Table 5). This model was
    found to be statistically significant. It has been determined that it is not possible
    to explain the change in efficiency if the measurements of temperature, relative
    humidity, and wind speed, which are meteorological characteristics, are used separately
    as estimators. There is no change in the predictive power of the model (R2 =54.8)
    in terms of explaining the existing change in yield if meteorological properties
    are included in the model, as well as leaf pressure. 3.4.6. Evaluation for leaf
    water potential Model (1) created by assigning the leaf pressure as the independent
    variable in the prediction models created for the leaf water potential can explain
    24.4% of the change in the leaf water potential (Table 5). It is understood from
    the meteorological features that it is insufficient to explain the change in leaf
    water potential as a predictor by itself. We determined that approximately 4%
    of the change in leaf water potential can be explained if all meteorological characteristics
    in addition to leaf pressure are assigned to the model as predictors for the prediction
    of leaf water potential. 3.4.7. Evaluation for stomatal conductance According
    to the regression coefficient of the model in which only leaf pressure is used
    as an estimator among the regression models created for the estimation of stomatal
    variability, it is seen that 45.6% of the variation in stomatal conductivity can
    be explained by leaf pressure (Table 5). If the temperature, humidity, and wind
    values are added to this model (7), 50.2% of the variation in stomatal conductivity
    can be explained by the model. In other words, the success of the model can be
    increased by 5% if meteorological features are used together with leaf pressure.
    The linear regression equation of the model in question was found as stomatal
    conductivity = 807.653–6.081 x leaf pressure - 3.970 x temperature + 3.718 x relative
    humidity - 21.419 x wind speed. In the literature, the relationships between leaf
    water potential and stomatal conductivity were investigated using the data obtained
    with leaf pressure sensors. Bramley et al. (2013) found statistically significant
    relationships between these physiological traits and leaf pressure in wheat. Martinez‑Gimeno
    et al. (2017) stated that there was a good correlation between leaf pressure and
    shoot water potential in persimmon. 3.4.8. Evaluation for superoxide dismutase
    The regression coefficient (R2 = 0.29) of the model (1), in which leaf pressure
    was used alone as an estimator among the regression models created for SOD activity,
    was found to be low (Table 5). Therefore, the models including temperature and
    wind speed data can be effective in explaining the change in SOD activity, albeit
    at a low level. In addition to the leaf pressure values, the regression coefficient
    of the model in which all meteorological features were used was found to be significantly
    higher than the single models; so much so that when the model in which only leaf
    pressure is used (1) is compared with this model (7), it is seen that there is
    an 11% difference in the regression coefficient. 3.4.9. Evaluation for catalase
    activity In models where leaf pressure and meteorological features are used separately
    as predictors of CAT activity, regression models appear to be statistically significant
    when relative humidity and temperature are used alone. It was determined that
    the change in relative humidity alone could explain 37.7% of the change in CAT
    activity. Thereby, 62.9% of the change in CAT enzyme activity can be predicted
    with the model (7), in which all variables are used. The linear regression equation
    of the model in question was obtained as: CAT = −45.109 + 0.592 x leaf pressure
    + 3.913 x temperature - 1.550 x humidity + 5.959 x wind speed. 3.5. Relationships
    between thermal indices and the examined traits 3.5.1. Regression models between
    thermal indices and yield According to the results of the regression analyses
    between the yield obtained at the end of the growing period and CWSIp - IGp, a
    negative linear relationship was found between yield and CWSIp, and a positive
    linear relationship with IGp (Fig. 4). The R2 values between yield and CWSIp varied
    between 0.43 and 0.91, and 0.33 and 0.85 with IGp, depending on the months. In
    both indices, the lowest value was in September, while the highest value was in
    August. This means that yield estimation can be made with higher accuracy by using
    thermal measurements made in August. Camoglu et al. (2018) found the R2 values
    between yield and CWSIp varied between 0.52 and 0.75, depending on the measurement
    days, in their study on a different pepper cultivar (Demre). It was stated that
    the relationship between them increased in further measurements after planting.
    In studies on different plants, O’Shaughnessy et al. (2011) obtained the R2 value
    between soybean yield and empirical CWSI (CWSIe) as 0.88 in 2004 and 0.83 in 2005,
    and the value between cotton yield and CWSIe as 0.78. Camoglu and Genc (2013)
    also found the R2 value between green bean yield and CWSIp to be 0.34. Download

    physiological traits and thermal indices. Camoglu and Genc (2013) and Garcia-Tejero
    et al. (2017) reported that thermal and spectral data are useful tools to predict
    physiological characteristics such as plant water status, stomatal conductivity,
    and chlorophyll. Camoglu et al. (2018) found the R2 value between leaf proportional
    water content and CWSIp to be 0.23, which they determined as an indicator of plant
    water status in the Demre pepper variety. Relationships between leaf water potential
    and CWSI were also investigated in studies on other plants. Cohen et al. (2005)
    found that the R2 values between leaf water potential and CWSI in cotton were
    between 0.79 and 0.90, according to the measurement time. Möller et al. (2007)
    obtained the R2 values between CWSI and leaf water potential calculated from thermal
    images to be between 0.52 and 0.91. Ben-Gal et al. (2009) stated in their study
    on olives that CWSI values calculated with the help of thermal images can be used
    to determine both leaf water potential and stomatal conductivity. Zia et al. (2013)
    obtained the R2 value between stomatal conductivity and CWSI as 0.62 in maize.
    Camoglu et al. (2019) found the R2 value to be between 0.53 and 0.91, and stomatal
    conductivity between 0.55 and 0.96 between CWSI and leaf water potential, which
    they calculated empirically from thermal images in tomato. They also stated that
    the strength of the relationship increased after the first measurement. According
    to the analysis results, the R2 values between leaf water potential and CWSIp
    varied between 0.59 and 0.91 depending on the months (Fig. 5). The values were
    between 0.33 and 0.76 for IGp. The R2 values between stomatal conductivity and
    CWSIp and IGp were also between 0.68 and 0.91 and 0.43 and 0.80, respectively
    (Fig. 5). The highest values between both leaf water potential and stomatal conductivity
    and the indices were realized in August, as in the yield. In addition, the predictive
    power of the CWSIp index for both physiological traits were found to be higher
    than IGp. Accordingly, these can be predicted more accurately by using CWSIp in
    August. This could be explained by the fact that the irrigation was started in
    July, when the plants were not yet fully stressed, and the leaves of the plants
    entered the aging process due to the harvest in September. Among the enzyme activities,
    the R2 values between SOD and CAT values and CWSIp were 0.02–0.31 and 0.68–0.80,
    respectively, and the values between IGp were 0.005–0.23 and 0.34–0.66, respectively
    (Fig. 5). The highest R2 values were also found in August. The correlation between
    the indices and SOD was found to be lower than that of the CAT enzyme. In particular,
    the R2 value between CAT and CWSIp was higher than the others. In this case, it
    can be said that the CAT enzyme can be predicted more successfully with the CWSIp
    index. 4. Conclusions According to the results of the study, it was determined
    that the pepper plant is very sensitive to water stress. It was concluded that
    the evapotranspiration and amount of irrigation water should be calculated correctly
    so that the pepper plant is not exposed to water stress; for this, the soil moisture
    needs to be constantly monitored. To accomplish this, soil moisture sensors and
    remote monitoring systems that allow instant and continuous monitoring of moisture
    are very advantageous tools. The total irrigation water amount, seasonal evapotranspiration,
    and yield values under non-water stress conditions were obtained as 604 mm, 697 mm,
    and 83.7 t ha−1, respectively, according to the average of two years. The highest
    monthly evapotranspiration in these non-stress plants was in August. Water stress
    had a negative impact on all the physiological properties of pepper plants. Leaf
    water potential and stomatal conductance values differed significantly according
    to irrigation treatments. In order to prevent the pepper from being exposed to
    water stress and to determine the irrigation time, these physiological traits
    can be taken as a threshold value for the results on the S100, separately for
    each month. While superoxide dismutase values from enzyme activities were not
    successful in distinguishing the treatments from each other, catalase activity
    was successful in determining the stress level. In this case, it can be said that
    catalase activity is more useful than superoxide dismutase in determining stress.
    Statistically significant relationships were obtained in the estimation of investigated
    traits using leaf pressure + meteorological properties. According to the multivariate
    regression models, the coefficients of determination between leaf pressure + meteorological
    properties and yield, leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, superoxide dismutase,
    and catalase activity were determined as 0.55, 0.29, 0.50, 0.42, and 0.63, respectively.
    In this case, the catalase enzyme can be predicted more accurately than the other
    traits. All the models obtained according to the simple linear regression analysis
    between the thermal indices and the traits examined in the study were found to
    be statistically significant. In the analyses made by months, the best relations
    were found in August. In addition, the predictive power of CWSIp was higher than
    IGp. Accordingly, the mentioned index can be suggested for predicting yield and
    physiological characteristics. This study has revealed the extensive potential
    to identify water stress in peppers using leaf patch clamp pressure probes and
    thermal cameras, which are plant-based monitoring tools. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Aboveground biomass is an important indicator used to characterize
    the growth status of crops, as well as an important physical and chemical parameter
    in agroecosystems. Aboveground biomass is an important basis for formulating management
    measures such as fertilization and irrigation. We selected four irrigated wheat
    fields in a region near Kaifeng, Henan Province, for this study. The terrain in
    that region was undulating and had spatial differences. We used a low-altitude
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing platform equipped with a multispectral
    camera, thermal infrared camera, and RGB camera to simultaneously obtain different
    remote sensing parameters during the key growth stages of wheat. Based on the
    extracted spectral reflectivity, thermal infrared temperature, and digital elevation
    information, we calculated the spatial variability of remote sensing parameters
    and growth indices under different terrain characteristics. We also analyzed the
    correlations between vegetation indices, temperature parameters, structural topographic
    parameters and aboveground biomass. Three machine learning methods were used,
    including the multiple linear regression method (MLR), partial least squares regression
    method (PLSR) and random forest regression method (RFR). We compared the aboveground
    biomass (AGB) estimation capability of single-modal data versus multimodal data
    fusion frameworks. The results showed that slope was an important factor affecting
    crop growth and aboveground biomass. We therefore analyzed several remote sensing
    parameters for three different slope scales. We found significant differences
    among them for soil water content, water content of plants, and aboveground biomass
    at four growth stages. Based on the strength of their correlation with aboveground
    biomass, seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE, MSR, OSAVI, SAVI, and MCARI),
    four canopy structure parameters (CH, VF, CVM, SLOPE) and two temperature parameters
    (NRCT, CTD) were selected as the final input variables for the model. There was
    some variability in the accuracy of the models at different growth stages. The
    average accuracy of the models was anthesis stage > booting stage > filling stage
    > jointing stage. For the single-modal data framework, the model constructed with
    the vegetation indices was better than the aboveground biomass model constructed
    using the temperature or structure parameters, and the highest accuracy was obtained
    with an RFR model based on vegetation indices at the anthesis stage (R2 = 0.713).
    For the double modal data fusion approach, the highest accuracy resulted at the
    anthesis stage, using the structural parameters combined with the vegetation indices
    of the RFR model (R2 = 0.842). Even higher accuracies were obtained using the
    multimodal data fusion approach with an RFR model based on vegetation indices,
    temperature parameters and structure parameters at the anthesis stage (R2 = 0.897).
    By introducing terrain factors and combining them with the RFR algorithm to effectively
    integrate multimodal data, the complementary and synergistic effects between different
    remote sensing information sources could be fully exerted. The accuracy and stability
    of the aboveground biomass estimation models were effectively improved, and a
    high-throughput phenotype acquisition method was explored, which provides a reference
    and basis for real-time monitoring of crop growth and decoding the correlation
    between genotype and phenotype.

    Wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world. Rapid and nondestructive
    monitoring of wheat growth information is of great significance for accurate management
    and yield estimation during wheat growth (He et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2012).
    Aboveground biomass is an important indicator to characterize the growth status
    of crops, as well as an important physical and chemical parameter in agroecosystems.
    It is an important basis for formulating management measures, such as fertilization
    and irrigation (Araus et al., 2014). The most commonly used method to estimate
    biomass is to take destructive samples, which is time consuming and costly (Xu
    et al., 2018). With recent technological advances, remote sensing has emerged
    as a promising alternative, due to its “fast, efficient and convenient characteristics”
    (Wang et al., 2014; Zaman-Allah et al., 2015). Previous studies have acquired
    different types of remote sensing data from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors
    mounted on different remote sensing scale platforms (spaceborne, airborne and
    ground platforms), which were widely used in crop aboveground biomass estimation
    (Avitabile et al., 2012; Marshall et al., 2015). For near-Earth remote sensing,
    the monitoring accuracy is high, but the monitoring range is limited and the efficiency
    is low, while satellite remote sensing is suitable for large-area crop monitoring,
    but the resolution of freely available data might still be too coarse for small
    holder farmers’ fields (Weiss et al., 2020). At present, the rapid development
    of UAV low-altitude remote sensing technology, with its significant advantages
    such as high resolution, high flexibility, high accuracy and low cost, makes accurate
    monitoring and large-scale application possible (Maresma et al., 2018; Sagan et
    al., 2019). Especially with the miniaturization of sensors, the UAV remote sensing
    platform can freely combine and carry different types of sensors and obtain multi-spectral,
    LiDAR and thermal infrared data, that can be used to estimate texture, vegetation
    coverage, canopy structure and elevation in real time and at a high frequency,
    even under cloud cover. These methods can also produce accurate estimations of
    aboveground biomass in other field crops (Maimaitijiang et al., 2019; Yue et al.,
    2019). Aboveground biomass is the basis for yield formation. It expresses the
    cumulative effect of environmental conditions on crop growth. Previous reports
    based on UAV remote sensing platforms mostly used reflectance and vegetation indices
    to estimate aboveground biomass (Marino et al., 2020). However, only using spectral
    features for aboveground biomass estimation often makes it difficult to distinguish
    the spatial heterogeneity of plant aboveground biomass with high density due to
    spectral saturation, resulting in low detection accuracy. Furthermore, the spectral
    information obtained in remote sensing images is often affected by the plant canopy
    structure and soil background (Li et al., 2020a, 2020b; Zha et al., 2020). In
    addition to spectral information, crop canopy temperature is determined by the
    heat and water vapor fluxes in the soil-crop-atmosphere (SPAC) cycle continuum
    and the crop water status, which is determined by differences in drought resistance
    or water-saving genes in the crops themselves. Thermal infrared imaging technology
    can measure infrared radiation and monitor the spatial distribution of crop canopy
    temperature (Fang et al., 2012; Nicolas et al., 2014). Crop canopy temperature
    can be used to assess changes in water stress and growth, as stomatal closure
    results in reduced crop energy dissipation and increased temperature during plant
    water deficits. Guo et al. (2016) used canopy temperature information to evaluate
    crop transpiration, screen drought-resistant varieties of different genotypes,
    and monitor crop growth and yield status, and predecessors used temperature parameters
    (NRCT, CWSI and CTD) to estimate the growth status and yield status of soybean
    and barley (Elsayed et al., 2015, 2017; Hou et al., 2009; Rischbeck et al., 2016).
    Therefore, canopy temperature information is also an important factor reflecting
    crop aboveground biomass and yield. The crop system is an organic whole of the
    crop itself and its environment. The canopy structure and topographic structure
    information are effective representations of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional
    information of the crop system (Greaves et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2019). For example,
    topographic features, crop height, canopy coverage and crop volume can be obtained
    from the point cloud of a LiDAR system or digital photogrammetry, which in turn
    reflects the horizontal uniformity and vertical spatiality of the crop system
    (Juliane et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017). However, due to the high cost of LIDAR
    technology and the large amount of later data that requires processing, its application
    in crop phenotype information monitoring is limited. Today, the advancement of
    computer vision technology and the improvement of sensor accuracy enable UAV remote
    sensing platforms to generate point clouds with similar quality and accuracy to
    digital photogrammetry, which greatly improves the application and estimation
    of UAV platforms in obtaining structural information of crop systems capability
    (Jayathunga et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2016). The evaluation of crop growth includes
    height, structure, volume and physiological activity. It is difficult to accurately
    reflect the crop growth status in real time using only one kind of remote sensing
    data. Studies have shown that the combination of canopy spectrum, structure, and
    temperature information in different sensor systems is beneficial for improving
    the inversion accuracy of crop parameters and has been successfully applied to
    the evaluation of various crop traits (Maimaitijiang et al., 2017; Shi et al.,
    2016). Canopy spectral information and crop volume models were combined to significantly
    improve the estimation accuracy of soybean biomass (Maimaitijiang et al., 2019).
    Data collected using hyperspectral and LIDAR were used to estimate maize aboveground
    biomass (Wang et al., 2017). The fusion of visible canopy spectral information
    and structural information can effectively improve the AGB estimation effect.
    The data fusion of temperature information and canopy height parameters was used
    to improve the yield estimation accuracy of barley (Rischbeck et al., 2016), indicating
    that the fusion of canopy temperature information and structural information can
    effectively reflect the growth status and yield prediction of crops at different
    developmental stages of crops. The introduction of terrain factors combined with
    vegetation indices to improve the accuracy of soybean aboveground biomass remote
    sensing inversion (Zhang et al., 2017) explained that the fusion of canopy spectral
    information and terrain information can effectively improve the aboveground biomass
    estimation effect. Until now, canopy spectrum, canopy structure, topographic features,
    and temperature information from RGB, multispectral, and thermal infrared sensors
    for crop aboveground biomass prediction have been rarely evaluated in combination.
    Biomass estimations are important for phenotyping as well. The acquisition efficiency
    of field crop phenotypic information (aboveground biomass, plant height, pigment,
    etc.) is a key factor restricting breeding research. The core of our research
    is based on the potential of multimodal data collected by UAVs for crop aboveground
    biomass prediction. The main research contents are as follows: (1) In the framework
    of machine learning, exploring the effect of unimodal data in wheat AGB prediction;
    (2) Testing the effect of canopy spectrum, structure, topography, temperature
    and their combinations in crop AGB prediction; (3) Evaluating the role of different
    machine learning methods in AGB prediction and the stability and adaptability
    of their models. Hence, the methodologies described in this paper will have broad
    applications not only for precision agriculture, but also for phenotyping. Materials
    and methods Overview of the study area and experimental design The experiment
    was conducted in Qi County (34°41′11″N, 114°48′34″E) near Kaifeng city, Henan
    Province, starting in 2019 during two subsequent wheat growing seasons (Fig. 1).
    This area is located in the southern part of the North China Plain and has a warm
    temperate continental monsoon climate, with an average annual temperature of 14–15
    °C and an average annual rainfall of 500–700 mm. The terrain is a slightly undulating
    plain, affecting the spatial distribution of soil moisture and nutrients, as well
    as growth of wheat. (Table 1). Fig. 1 Location of the research areas and experimental
    designs Full size image Table 1 Basic soil nutrients before sowing Full size table
    Ground data acquisition Three widely grown wheat varieties, Zhou27, Kai22 and
    Lankao198, were monitored in this study. We collected in-situ data at the jointing,
    booting, anthesis and mid grain-filling stages on four fields over 2 years. We
    had marked 120 plots measuring 12 m2 for sampling for each growth stage during
    two years. Within each plot, we randomly took three samples, each measuring 0.2
    m2 at each sampling. We combined the samples from each plot for subsequent analyses.
    We measured plant height, fresh and dry weight. The samples were first dried at
    105 °C for 30 min and subsequently to constant weight at 80 °C. This allowed us
    to calculate the aboveground biomass and the water content of the plants. From
    each plot, we took one soil sample from 0 to 0.2 m and another one from 0.2 to
    0.4 m depth. In order to calculate their gravimetric moisture content, we took
    their fresh weight and then dried them to constant weight at 105 °C. Soil samples
    were analyzed for organic matter, alkaline-hydrolysable N, available K and available
    P. The test methods we used in turn were potassium dichromate-volumetric method,
    alkali N-proliferation method, flame photometry and Mo-Sb colorimetric method
    which were derived from Chinese agricultural standard. UAV platform data collection
    Combined with the ground sampling of aboveground biomass and plant height data,
    spectral and thermal infrared data were obtained with a multispectral K6 camera
    (MAPIR, USA) and thermal imaging Capture 2.0 camera (FLIR Systems Inc., Oregon,
    USA) mounted on a DJI M600Pro (DJI Technology, Shenzhen, China) drone, equipped
    with a DJI Ronin series gimbal. The K6 camera can capture light with six channels:
    blue (450 ± 10 nm), green (550 ± 10 nm), red (685 ± 10 nm), red edge (725 ± 10
    nm) and near infrared (780 ± 10 nm) and an RGB primary color channel (4384 pixel × 3288
    pixels). The CCD array of the Capture 2.0 thermal infrared camera has 640 × 512
    pixels. We flew the drone at an altitude of 90 m above ground, which resulted
    in a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 3.26 cm for the K6 sensor. The heading
    overlap was 75%, and the side overlap was 70%. Before each image data collection
    (Fig. 2), 12 ground control points (GCPs) were evenly placed in the experimental
    area with a real-time kinematic T1 (HUACE, Shanghai, China), which were used for
    image georeferencing. Ground data and drone data were collected during the jointing
    stage (2020.3.24, 2021.3.23); booting stage (2020.4.7, 2021.4.10); anthesis stage
    (2020.4.26, 2021.4.27) and filling stage (2020.5.12, 2021.5.10). To obtain stable
    wheat canopy information, the aerial surveys were conducted between 11:00 and
    13:00 local time under clear sky conditions. Four target panels with reflectivities
    of 5%, 20%, 40% and 70% were placed in the UAV flight path. We measured their
    reflectivites at each flight with a handheld ASD (Analytical Spectra Devices.,
    Inc, USA). Fig. 2 Ground control points placement and wind speed measurement Full
    size image Image processing Figure 3 shows the workflow from feature extraction
    to model building. First, Thermal Viewer software 2.1.6 (TeAx Technology, Germany)
    and was used for thermal images screening and saturation adjustment. Stitching
    of UAV RGB, multispectral and thermal infrared images was done with Pix4Dmapper
    software 4.4.12 (Pix4D SA, Lausanne, Switzerland). The twelve GCPs were used in
    Pix4D’s stitching workflow of RGB images to improve the vertical and horizontal
    accuracy of the output orthophoto. We used the stitched RGB image as the base
    layer and aligned all the subsequent images to that base layer to geometric correction.
    The multispectral were calibrated to reflectance using the 4 target panels as
    a reference. Vegetation indices of each sampling point were calculated and extracted
    with ArcGIS software 10.8 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., Redlands,
    USA). The thermal infrared images were geometrically corrected using the stitched
    RGB images as the reference image. The thermal infrared images were linearly calibrated
    by using the temperature measuring gun to obtain four target panels and the actual
    temperature of the water body approximate to a black body. Fig. 3 The workflow

    Full size image Extraction from different data sources Before feature extraction,
    a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for supervised classification in ENVI
    5.3 (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Inc., Boulder, USA) was used to identify
    wheat and soil background in RGB images. The overall accuracy (OA) was used as
    a validation metric to evaluate the performance of the SVM classifier. The overall
    classification accuracy of the three stages was greater than 0.92, with a good
    classification effect, and then a vector file region of interest (ROI) was drawn
    to extract data in batches. After masking out the soil pixels from the multi-spectral
    and thermal infrared images, the respective data were extracted. Terrain and canopy
    structure features To obtain accurate topographic and canopy structure features,
    UAV-based RGB imagery was collected in order to create a bare-earth digital elevation
    model (DEM) and digital surface model (DSM) photogrammetric 3D point clouds. We
    used the digital elevation model (DEM) of RGB to generate the elevation map, slope

    The 3D model is a partial zoom-in detail of the study area (Fig. 4). Then we created
    a Shp file of the same size as the sample plot to extract the topographic factors
    (Fig. 1), including the mean slope (SLOPEmean), maximum slope (SLOPEmax), minimum
    slope (SLOPEmin), slope standard deviation (SLOPEstd), slope variation coefficient
    (SLOPEcv) SLOPEmean, SLOPEmax and SLOPEmin, which represented the vertical distribution
    of terrain, while SLOPEstd and SLOPEcv reflected the vertical complexity and spatial

    (5) Fig. 4 Terrain features of the study fields and 3D model Full size image By
    calculating the difference between DSM and DEM for each pixel, a wheat canopy
    height model (CHM) was generated for each sampling stage. The mask created by
    the RGB image was also used to remove the soil background in the canopy height
    model (CHM) and to extract the average canopy height (CHmean) for each sampling
    point. Then the ratio of the number of classified wheat pixels in each plot to
    the total number of pixels in the sample point was calculated to obtain the vegetation
    fraction (VF). Finally, the plant heights on the wheat pixels were accumulated,
    and the product of the sum of the plant heights and the unit pixel area were calculated
    to obtain the crop volume model (CVM) (Maimaitijiang et al., 2019). The specific
    formulas are as follows: $$VF = \\frac{n}{N}$$ (6) $$CVM = A \\times \\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {{\\text{PH}}_{i} }$$ (7) where \\(n\\) represents the number of wheat
    pixels in the statistical area, \\(N\\) is the total number of pixels in the statistical
    area,\\(A\\) is the area of the unit pixel, and \\({\\text{PH}}_{i}\\) is the
    height of the crop on the ith pixel. Canopy temperature information Normalized
    relative canopy temperature (NRCT) (Elsayed et al., 2015) and canopy-air temperature
    difference (CTD) (Purushothaman et al., 2015) were obtained from UAV thermal infrared
    images through ROI partition statistics and were used to estimate canopy temperature
    information for aboveground biomass. The normalized relative canopy temperature
    (NRCT) is similar to the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) and is calculated using
    the canopy temperature, the minimum temperature measured in the entire field trial
    (Tmin), and the maximum temperature in the entire field trial (Tmax). The deviation
    (CTD) between crop canopy temperature and ambient temperature is the difference
    between air temperature (Ta) and canopy temperature (Ti). The specific formulas
    are as follows: $$NRCT = \\frac{{T_{i} - T_{min} }}{{T_{max} - T_{min} }}$$ (8)
    $$CTD = T_{i} - T_{a}$$ (9) where \\(T_{i}\\) represents the canopy temperature
    of the ith pixel, \\(T_{min}\\) is the lowest temperature measured in the whole
    field trial, \\(T_{max}\\) is the highest temperature measured in the whole field
    trial and \\(T_{a}\\) is the atmospheric temperature, which was obtained from
    the Kaifeng Meteorological Service. Selection of vegetation indices There are
    many types of vegetation indices used for crop aboveground biomass estimation.
    We tested seven vegetation indices (Table 2) suitable for the UAV sensor channels
    to construct the wheat aboveground biomass estimation model. Table 2 Spectral
    indices Full size table Model building and accuracy verification Wheat aboveground
    biomass estimation models were constructed based on the spectral, temperature,
    topographic and structural characteristics of the UAV. At the four growth stages,
    the correlation between different characteristic parameters and aboveground biomass
    was calculated using correlation analysis to explore the relationship between
    characteristic parameters and aboveground biomass. We applied linear and nonlinear
    machine learning methods, including partial least squares regression (PLSR), multiple
    linear regression (MLR), and random forest regression (RFR) to construct regression
    models between feature parameters and crop indicators. 120 samples were collected
    for each growth stage in two years. The 70% of the sample size of each reproductive
    stage was randomly selected for modeling (n1 = 84), and the remaining 30% of the
    sample size was used for validation (n2 = 36). The coefficient of determination
    R2, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate
    the effectiveness of the wheat aboveground biomass estimation models. $$R^{2}
    = \\frac{{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\left( {xi - \\overline{x}} \\right)^{2}
    } \\left( {{\\text{y}}i - \\overline{y}} \\right)^{2} }}{{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n}

    the data of the ith sample point,\\({\\text{y}}i\\) is the measured value of the
    winter wheat phenotype of the ith sample point,\\(xi\\) is the predicted value
    of the crop phenotype of the ith sample point calculated by the model,\\(\\overline{y}\\)
    is the measured average value, and \\(\\overline{x}\\) is the estimated average
    value of the model value. Results and analysis Statistical analysis of topographic
    features and growth parameters of the study area To accurately evaluate the topographic
    conditions of the study area, according to the topographic and geomorphological
    characteristics of the study area, the topographic slope of the investigated field
    area is between 0° and 8°. Pixels between 0° and 8° are divided into 3 levels
    (0°–4°, 4°–6° and 6°–8°). The average slope of the study area was 4.98°. The largest
    proportion 43.3% of the pixels was in the 4°–6°, followed by 31.7% in the 6°–8°
    and 25% in the 0°–4° range. The soil water content, plant water content and aboveground
    biomass distribution of different terrain sampling points were measured and counted.
    As shown in Fig. 5, with increasing slope, the plant water content, soil water
    content and aboveground biomass gradually decreased, but variation increased.
    From the jointing stage to the filling stage, the water content of the plants
    gradually decreased, and the variability increased, with an overall variation
    range of 55.2% to 86.4%. The aboveground biomass gradually increased, from 0.41
    kg m‒2 to 2.31 kg m‒2. The soil water content at the jointing stage, booting stage
    and anthesis stage was significantly higher than in the filling stage. As the
    growth stage progressed, the variation increased, and the overall variation ranged
    from 4.3% to 23.7%. The terrain fluctuations had a large impact on the growth
    of the wheat. Under the same management conditions, the soil water content, plant
    water content and aboveground biomass in different spatial positions in the field
    were significantly different. Slope was an important environmental factor affecting
    the growth of crops. Fig. 5 Changes of growth parameters for different slopes
    (S1: Jointing stage; S2: Booting stage; S3: Anthesis stage; S4: Filling stage;
    Slope scales:0–4º, 4–6º, 6–8º) Full size image Statistical description of remote
    sensing image parameters under different terrain features To accurately evaluate
    the influence of terrain factors on the obtained remote sensing parameters, the
    changes in the normalized greenness vegetation index (GNDVI), canopy temperature
    (CT) and crop volume (CVM) within each slope grade range were assessed (Fig. 6).
    With the increase in slope, the GNDVI and CVM gradually decreased, whereas the
    canopy temperature increased. From the jointing stage to the filling stage, the
    GNDVI first increased and then decreased, with an overall variation range of 0.518–0.837.
    The CVM increased with the advancement of the growth stages, and the overall variation
    ranged from 3.31 to 16.03. When the slope increased, the variation in the GNDVI
    and CVM gradually increased, especially at the maximum slope at the anthesis stage
    and filling stage. During the anthesis stage, the plants grew vigorously, with
    large coverage and high greenness. The canopy temperature gradually increased
    with the growth stage, and the overall change range was 16.49 to 33.97 °C. At
    higher slopes, the temperature variability was larger. The slope causes rainfall
    and irrigation runoff, which affects the field distribution and redistribution
    of water and nutrients, resulting in a spatially different distribution of wheat
    growth, which in turn affects the changes in remote sensing parameters. Fig. 6
    Changes of remote sensing indices for different slopes (S1: Jointing stage; S2:
    Booting stage; S3: Anthesis stage; S4: Filling stage) Full size image Correlation
    analysis between vegetation indices, temperature parameters and structural characteristic
    parameters and aboveground biomass The selected vegetation indices, canopy temperature
    parameters and structural characteristic parameters were correlated with the aboveground
    biomass of winter wheat (Table 3). Most of the remote sensing parameters showed
    a very significant correlation level (P < 0.01). From the perspective of growth
    stages, except for slope, the correlations of other remote sensing parameters
    first increased then decreased with the advancement of the growth process, and
    the anthesis stage was the best. For vegetation indices, the absolute value of
    the correlation coefficient (r) at the anthesis stage ranged from 0.351 to 0.701,
    with the GNDVI performing best (0.701); the absolute value of the correlation
    coefficient at the jointing stage ranged from 0.351 to 0.498, and the GNDVI was
    the best (0.498); the absolute value of the correlation coefficient at the booting
    stage ranged from 0.426 to 0.609, and the SAVI was the best (0.609); and the absolute
    value of the correlation coefficient at the filling stage ranged from 0.395 to
    0.512, and the GNDVI had the highest correlation (0.512). For the temperature
    parameters, the correlation was also highest at the anthesis stage, with the correlation
    coefficients of NRCT and CTD being − 0.604 and 0.497, respectively. In comparison,
    the vegetation indices performed better than the temperature parameters, while
    the vegetation structure parameters changed significantly. The optimal structure
    parameter CVM performed better than the vegetation indices and temperature parameters
    at the four growth stages. The correlation between slope and aboveground biomass
    increased gradually with the development of the growth stage, and it was the highest
    at the filling stage (− 0.453). Table 3 Correlation (r) between vegetation indices,
    temperature parameters, structural parameters and aboveground biomass at different
    growth stages Full size table In general, there were certain limitations in using
    a single type of remote sensing parameter to estimate aboveground biomass in specific
    growth and development stages of wheat. Comparison between different model algorithms
    based on single modal data sources We used three methods to test to what degree
    the combined use of the above mentioned VIs, THs and STs can improve the accuracies
    of biomass prediction. They were multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least
    squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RFR). Among the different modeling
    algorithms, the RFR model had the best estimation effect (R2 = 0.362–0.713). The
    MLR and PLSR models yielded lower accuracies, with coefficients of determination
    ranging from 0.343 to 0.662 and 0.312 to 0.605, respectively (Table 4). As for
    the growth stage, anthesis was the best (R2 = 0.449–0.721). Accuracies at the
    other stages were lower and the differences between the methods were small. The
    model determination coefficients were 0.312–0.512 (Jointing), 0.346–0.617 (Booting)
    and 0.325–0.530 (Filling). From the performance of different data types, no matter
    which method was used for modeling, the model with VIs as input factors had the
    best performance (R2 = 0.405–0.713), followed by STs (R2 = 0.384–0.573), and THs
    had poor performance (R2 = 0.312–0.512). From the optimization effect of different
    algorithms at each stage, RFR was the best at the anthesis stage (R2 = 0.713,
    RMSE = 0.140 kg m‒2, MAE = 0.124 kg m‒2), followed by the MLR model (R2 = 0.662,
    RMSE = 0.145 kg m‒2, MAE = 0.125 kg m‒2). Using just one source of data, i.e.,
    VIs, THs, or STs, the model performance was quite different among the growth stages
    and the inversion algorithms, but the estimation accuracy was relatively low.
    Table 4 Modeling statistics of different models for AGB prediction of wheat based
    on single modal data Full size table Comparison of different algorithms based
    on multimodal data sources fusion Table 5 shows that using a combination of MS
    spectral features, thermal infrared and RGB structural information results in
    a significant improvement in model estimation accuracy compared to using only
    a single sensor parameter. After fusing the TH data on the basis of the VI data,
    the accuracy of the three algorithms was improved, and the RFR model at the anthesis
    stage had the best estimation power (R2 = 0.814, RMSE = 0.126 kg m‒2, MAE = 0.098
    kg m‒2). Compared with the RFR model using only VIs, R2 was increased by 14.17%,
    RMSE was decreased by 10%, and MAE was decreased by 20.97%. Combining VIs and
    STs as input feature variables, the RFR model of the anthesis stage had the best
    estimation effect (R2 = 0.842, RMSE = 0.113 kg m‒2, MAE = 0.082 kg m‒2), which
    was better than the R2 of the VI-RFR model. Compared with the VIs-RFR model, the
    R2 increased from 0.713 to 0.842, the RMSE decreased by 19.29%, and the MAE decreased
    by 33.87%. Combining only THs and STs as input variables, lower accuracies were
    obtained, but compared with the STs-RFR model, the R2 was increased from 0.573
    to 0.654. Table 5 Modeling statistics of different models for AGB prediction of
    wheat based on multimodal data Full size table The above results show that the
    prediction accuracies of wheat aboveground biomass were improved by combining
    VIs, THs and STs. From the average estimation effect of the three modeling methods,
    the performance of different growth stages was anthesis stage (R2 = 0.838) > booting
    stage (R2 = 0.689) > filling stage (R2 = 0.634) > jointing stage (R2 = 0.621).
    Figure 7 shows that with the increase in the number of input features, the model
    estimation accuracies gradually increased, the RMSE and MAE decreased, and the
    stability of the estimation model increased. Fig. 7 Models estimation accuracy
    Full size image Validation of aboveground biomass The best values estimated by
    single or combined remote sensing parameters were compared with the corresponding
    measured values (Fig. 8). Overall, when the aboveground biomass was less than
    0.9 kg m‒2, there was an overestimation phenomenon. In contrast, when the aboveground
    biomass was greater than 1.4 kg m‒2, there was a certain underestimation phenomenon.
    For the best aboveground biomass model (VIs-RFR model at anthesis stage) constructed
    based on single modal data, when the aboveground biomass was less than 0.9 kg
    m–2, the predicted value was overestimated by 13.09% compared with the measured
    value; when the aboveground biomass was greater than 1.4 kg m‒2, the predicted
    value was underestimated by 10.55% compared with the measured value. For the best
    AGB model based on double-modal data (VIs + STs-RFR model in anthesis stage),
    when the AGB was less than 0.9 kg m‒2, the predicted value was overestimated by
    12.49% compared with the measured value; when the AGB was greater than 1.4 kg
    m‒2, the predicted value was underestimated by 8.83% compared with the measured
    value, demonstrating that bimodal data mitigate the bias effect of AGB estimation
    to a certain extent. The optimal aboveground biomass model (VIs + THs + STs-RFR)
    based on three-modal data fusion was investigated. When the aboveground biomass
    was less than 0.9 kg m–2, the predicted value was overestimated by 3.64% compared
    with the measured value; when the aboveground biomass was greater than 1.4 kg
    m‒2, the predicted value was underestimated by 4.06% compared with the measured
    value. This shows that the multisource data fusion significantly alleviates the
    bias of over- and underestimation when compared with the single-modal data. It
    resulted in the most accurate estimation of biomass growth. We evaluated the importance
    of the characteristics of the optimal model at the anthesis stage RFR (VIs + THs + STs)
    (Fig. 8). The variables were randomly drawn from the Out-Of-Bag data of RFR using
    the OOB Permuted Var Delta Error storage (% IncMSE) method, in order to estimate
    the importance of each variable. The most important ones, with an error contribution
    greater than 1 were NDVI, GNDVI, OSAVI, SAVI, MCARI, NRCT, CTD, VF, CH, CVM and
    SLOPE, followed by NDRE and MSR, for which the contribution ranged between 0 and
    1. For this study, all variables contributed positively to the model. Fig. 8 The
    independent validation scatter plots for measured and predicted aboveground biomass
    of wheat with various UAV-based feature types across anthesis stages. RFR model
    was used for each independent validation due to its better performance than that
    of PLSR and MLR. The red dashed lines indicate a 1:1 relationship. The black dashed-line
    circles represent samples with AGB exceeding 1.4 kg m‒2 and under 0.9 kg m‒2.)
    Full size image Fusion of three-modal data sources to estimate the effect of aboveground
    biomass for different slopes Terrain factors affect the field distribution and
    redistribution of water and nutrients, which in turn lead to spatially different
    distributions of wheat growth. Therefore, the performance of the aboveground biomass
    model integrated with the three data sources under different slope levels was
    further investigated to evaluate its reliability and adaptability. Table 6 and
    Fig. 9 show that the estimated aboveground biomass for different slope grades
    performed best at the anthesis stage, with R2 ranging from 0.456 to 0.892, followed
    by the booting stage, with R2 ranging from 0.441 to 0.845, However, the estimation
    effect of biomass at the filling and jointing stages was relatively poor. For
    different slopes, we used the RFR model to estimate biomass with good results.
    On the 0° ~ 4° scale, RFR had an R2 range of 0.561–0.803, followed by MLR, and
    PLSR was poorer, with an R2 range of 0.274–0.456. On the 4°–6° slope scale, the
    R2 range of RFR was 0.493–0.892, followed by MLR, and the PLSR was poorer, with
    R2 range of 0.364–0.793. On the slope scale of 6° ~ 8°, the R2 range of RFR was
    0.798–0.856, followed by MLR. Similarly, the performance of PLSR was poorer, and
    the R2 range was 0.472–0.705. The above results also showed that when the slope
    was small, the prediction ability of the model was limited and the error was high,
    while with the increase in the slope level, the prediction accuracy of the model
    was improved, and the stability was enhanced. Compared with the MLR and PLSR methods,
    the RFR model based on multimodal data had better stability and adaptability to
    different terrain features, which was beneficial for accurately assessing crop
    growth conditions under complex terrain conditions. Table 6 Performance of each
    model in predicting the AGB of slope scales Full size table Fig. 9 Violin plots
    for predicted AGB from best model and measured AGB for different slope scales
    in different stages Full size image Discussion The effect of microtopographic
    factors on crop AGB Topographic features are an important part of crop systems.
    Slope directly affects the scale and intensity of surface material flow and energy
    conversion and is an important factor restricting the spatial distribution of
    productivity (Valtera et al., 2015). The terrain slope in this study ranged between
    0° and 8°. It significantly affected the distribution of soil water, the water
    content of plants, and the formation of aboveground biomass. Previous studies
    also have shown that topography affects crop growth, resulting in differences
    in crop spectra with different slopes and downhill slopes, and this topographic
    effect increases with increasing slope (Ma et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2013). In
    this research, the GNDVI differed significantly under different slope levels.
    The spectral variation was more than 20% as a result of spatial differences in
    crop growth. It is consistent with previous research results (Ediriweera et al.,
    2014; Sun et al., 2020). Topographic properties such as elevation or slope affect
    ecosystem structure and composition, which in turn induces the spatial redistribution
    of solar effective light radiation and precipitation (Batlles et al., 2008). In
    this study, from the jointing stage to the filling stage, the difference in soil
    water content was up to 17.6% under the maximum slope and the minimum slope, resulting
    in the maximum difference in canopy temperature and crop volume of 17.48 °C and
    12.27 m3, respectively. High precision topographic factors at medium and small
    scales affecting aboveground biomass had been observed by (Takyu et al., 2003)
    as well. In this study, under different slope scales, the distribution of aboveground
    biomass at different growth stages and the effect of different models to predict
    aboveground biomass were analyzed. We found that aboveground biomass differences
    were distinct under different slope scales. The growth rate was the most uniform
    at 0° ~ 4°, but with the increase in the slope scale, the growth differences gradually
    increased, the aboveground biomass gradually decreased, and the overall change
    ranged from 0.41 kg m‒2 to 2.31 kg m‒2. In addition to the combination of vegetation
    indices and canopy temperature parameters, this study introduced terrain feature
    data to participate in biomass estimation modeling. This mostly alleviated the
    data bias and saturation problems. The constructed multimodal data fusion aboveground
    biomass models are more applicable and stable in undulating terrains. In crop
    remote sensing estimation of AGB, especially in areas with complex terrain, it
    is necessary to pay attention to the influence of terrain factors on AGB estimation
    results and make full use of the indirect information supplement and contribution
    of terrain factors to maximize the accuracy of AGB estimation. The synergy effect
    among crop canopy spectral, structural and temperature characteristics on AGB
    estimation The use of canopy spectral information obtained from multispectral
    and hyperspectral images of UAVs for crop aboveground biomass and yield estimation
    is currently the most widely used method for crop growth monitoring (Li et al.,
    2020a, 2020b; Ramos et al., 2020). Our study showed that VIs had better estimation
    effects in different growth stages, and compared with other data sources, VIs
    had the best performance, especially in the anthesis stage (R2 = 0.713). Spectral
    information mainly reflects the interaction between light and plants or soil.
    Crop water status is an important factor in evaluating the internal development
    of crops, and canopy temperature information can accurately indicate the comprehensive
    influence of soil water content and atmospheric conditions on crop water status,
    which in turn affects the formation of AGB (Nicolas, et al., 2014; Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). The temperature status of crops is affected by plant transpiration,
    especially when stress occurs. At the same time, transpiration affects stomatal
    conductance to a certain extent, and stomatal conductance is the key for CO2 to
    enter leaves and for photosynthesis. Canopy temperature information can also reflect
    the dynamic changes in crop stomatal conductance and the nutritional status of
    leaves, such as nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations. Canopy temperature information
    can be used to evaluate crop aboveground biomass status to a certain extent. Hou
    et al. (2009) indicated that canopy temperature can reflect the growth status
    of crops. In this study, the correlations between NRCT and CTD and aboveground
    biomass reached a significant level, and the optimal correlation coefficient was
    ‒0.604. The temperature parameters were also used to estimate wheat aboveground
    biomass (R2 = 0.512). Further combining the canopy temperature with the spectral
    information, the prediction accuracy improved (R2 = 0.814), which is consistent
    with previous research results (Elsayed et al., 2015, 2017; Hou et al., 2009;
    Rischbeck et al., 2016). Hence canopy temperature information can be a useful
    supplement to canopy spectral information when evaluating crop aboveground biomass
    and yield. Plant structure is also an important indicator of crop growth, including
    plant height, coverage, leaf inclination and volume. These indicators are sensitive
    to cultivation measures such as water and fertilizer. In this study, there was
    a significant correlation between wheat structural parameters and aboveground
    biomass, among which the strongest effect was at the anthesis stage (R2 = 0.573),
    and the CVM had the best correlation. As the crop approaches maturity, the signal
    of the green leaf area declines and effects of the soil become stronger. Therefore,
    single point observations of the canopy and its temperature become weaker predictors
    of biomass during the grain filling stage. Bendig et al. (2015) and Maimaitijiang
    et al. (2019) indicated that VIs combined with plant height or crop volume achieved
    better results in the prediction of barley aboveground biomass and soybean yield.
    Drones can obtain canopy structure information and capture the dynamic changes
    in wheat populations at each growth stage. Different from the population structure
    information of wheat, topographic factors mainly affect the flow and conversion
    of external energy and are the key environmental factors for the growth and development
    of wheat. Therefore, the combination of canopy structure and topographic structure
    information can comprehensively express the three-dimensional information of the
    system and then accurately reflect the growing status of crops. At present, there
    are few research reports on this aspect. In this study, the combination of spectral
    information and structural information can improve the prediction accuracy by
    18.09%, which shows that STs are a beneficial supplement to VIs and improve the
    estimation accuracy of aboveground biomass, which is consistent with previous
    research results. We combined the three types of information to estimate aboveground
    biomass, and the model based on RFR at the anthesis stage had the highest accuracy
    (R2 = 0.897), which was further improved compared with the model accuracy of the
    double-modal data. The combination of visible spectrum, temperature and structural
    characteristics under different slope grades. The accuracy of the prediction of
    biomass during the four growth stages differed greatly. Between the jointing and
    the booting stage, weak tillers senesced. Benefitting from warmer temperatures
    and higher solar radiation, dry matter accumulation accelerated. At ear emergence,
    wheat had reached the peak of its leaf area. Differences in vegetation conditions
    were most pronounced between ear emergence and anthesis. Starting with the grain-filling
    stage, the chlorophyll content of wheat leaves decreased and senescence accelerated
    towards maturity. The signal from the soil background became stronger, which led
    to a decrease in the accuracy of remote sensing estimation of wheat biomass during
    the filling stage. Prospects for the use of a combined algorithm based on data
    acquired with an UAV platform to estimate aboveground biomass. With the rapid
    development of precision agriculture and UAV platforms, computer modeling sciences
    and machine learning techniques are increasingly being used for crop monitoring
    and classification. Manual sampling of aboveground biomass is time-consuming and
    labor-intensive. Therefore, it is only suitable for small areas and the measurements
    may not be fully representative either. To explore the prediction power of different
    inversion algorithms, this study compared the potential of MLR, PLSR and RFR to
    estimate wheat aboveground biomass. The RFR method achieved the highest AGB estimation
    accuracies. Previous studies have used PLSR and MLR methods for predicting crop
    AGB (Bendig et al., 2015; Elarab et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2020) because these
    types of algorithm can explain the linear relationship between independent and
    dependent variables. However, they also have shortcomings in dealing with complex
    multidimensional relationships and identifying information and noise in the system.
    Consequently, other studies showed that the PLSR and MLR methods have limited
    skills to estimate aboveground biomass (Nawar et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2020).
    The highest estimated R2 using the MLR and PLSR algorithms in this study was 0.837
    and 0.779, respectively, which showed their limitations when dealing with the
    covariation of multiple factors, such as spectral characteristics, temperature
    parameters, plant structure parameters and terrain factors. RFR has the advantage
    of a decision tree system and can process samples with high-dimensional features.
    It also can evaluate the importance of each feature in classification problems
    without dimensionality reduction and can effectively process large datasets with
    high accuracy and stability, which makes it more suitable for solving the inversion
    problem (Hossein et al., 2018; Jeong et al., 2016). Other studies used the RFR
    model to use multisource data as an independent variable and aboveground biomass
    as a predictor variable, and their models performed better than MLR and PLSR,
    which was consistent with the results of this study (Han et al., 2019; Liu et
    al., 2019). Under the conditions of this experiment, the highest R2 estimated
    by the RFR model was 0.897, which indicated that the multi-feature fusion framework
    based on the UAV platform could accurately estimate the aboveground biomass of
    wheat and provide a decision-making basis for crop management. This study made
    full use of the synergistic advantages of multimodal data to better estimate and
    evaluate the spatial distribution of aboveground biomass under different slope
    grades, which provided a base for wheat growth monitoring, yield assessment and
    phenotypic identification at the crop field level in an undulating terrain. Of
    course, this study only involved single-area test data, and the established RFR
    model needs to be tested and verified in different regions to further enhance
    the reliability and applicability of the aboveground biomass estimation models.
    At the same time, production conditions were diverse. The established AGB models
    also need to be tested on different wheat genotypes and other crop types under
    different environmental conditions. Especially with the consolidation of parcels,
    the continuous growth of new agricultural management entities, UAV remote sensing
    will increasingly show wide application potential and practical value. Therefore,
    further research should focus on how to combine the mobility of low-altitude UAV
    remote sensing with the precision of near-Earth remote sensing and the coarser
    nature of satellite remote sensing to estimate crop aboveground biomass at different
    scales. This study showed that different nutrient and water distribution in the
    soil can be attributed to topographic relief, which eventually led to spatial
    variability of biomass within a field. Site-specific crop management based on
    topographic data, spectral indices, thermal data and biomass estimates, as well
    as laser-assisted precision land leveling can be used to address the spatial variability,
    optimize use of inputs and limit negative environmental effects of crop production
    (Jat et al., 2015). Conclusion The UAV remote sensing platform can be equipped
    with various types of sensors to obtain multisource data of crop growth and generate
    an important source of data for precision agricultural production. The slope affects
    the runoff distribution of rainfall and irrigation, which leads to the secondary
    distribution of water and fertilizer, which is an important factor causing the
    spatial difference in growth. The aboveground biomass decreased with increasing
    slope. Through MLR, PLSR and RFR algorithms, different modal data were fused to
    estimate wheat aboveground biomass, and multimodal data fusion was better than
    single-modal data. The power to estimate aboveground biomass using single modal
    data was in the order of VIs > STs > THs, and the VIs-RFR model at the anthesis
    stage was the best (R2 = 0.713). Incorporating the other two types of data on
    the basis of VIs, the model accuracy was significantly improved. The VIs-STs-RFR
    and VIs-THs-RFR models had the highest accuracies of 0.842 and 0.814, respectively.
    The RFR model with the fusion of three modal data achieved the highest accuracies,
    and the anthesis stage was the most effective (R2 = 0.897). Machine learning algorithms
    effectively synergize the advantages of different types of data sources, improving
    the accuracy of crop growth assessment under complex conditions and the reliability
    of accurate phenotype identification. Data availability The data that support

    growth in the agriculture. For the survival the countries in the world utilize
    their three-fourth of their human resource in the occupation of the agriculture.
    But nowadays growing an agricultural field is difficult when compared to the ancient
    days.1 The major reason for the decrease in the crop yield is wastage and shortage
    of the water and fertilizers.2 Many existing systems provide the irrigational
    methodology where the scarcity of water arises in the agricultural field. This
    is because of unavailability of rain and nonstorage of water in the wells. Another
    reason is the water storage body is also placed in maximum heights as well as
    in far distance.3 Based on the survey, agriculture utilizes more than three-fourth
    of the granted water in the world. Due to the growth in population, the maximum
    usage of water for agriculture occur which in turn leads to the rising demand
    in food items. The necessity arises in the current world to face the challenges
    in the shortage and wastage of water in achieving the optimal yield in the agricultural
    crop fields. So, there is a need for the work in maximizing the yield of the agricultural
    field with any of the effective measures. The current world is fully surrounded
    by technological components and improvements in various domains. One of the major
    domains named Internet of Things (IoT) will be highly useful to face the challenges
    in the agricultural crop field. IoT is the combination of various domains such
    as embedded system, wireless sensor networks, data analytics, and cloud computing.
    By using its features, the challenges faced by the current agriculture field can
    be addressed and solutions are provided to increase the yield in the crops of
    the agriculture field. Many feasibility studies have been performed before conduting
    the experimental analysis of the particular crop environments. In any irrigation
    system of an agricultural field, the crops in the soil get the water based on
    the variety of the soil. The water capacity for the crop is also measured based
    on the variety of the soil. The existing smart irrigation system infrastructure
    is built based on the processors like advanced RISC machines and radio frequency
    (RF). The objective of the RF model is to exchange the information to the controller
    in the irrigation model. This existing system consists of three end-user components
    to interact among themselves for the purpose of irrigation of crops of the particular
    agriculture field. The traditional smart irrigation systems are useful in improving
    the procedures of irrigation technology by using the algorithms in a schematic
    way and provide the improvised structure in the required nodes for the irrigation
    model.4, 5 The mobiles phones can be integrated with the IoT components for any
    useful work. IoT connects various electrical components located at various geographical
    locations. This connection establishes the communication between these devices
    using the internet. The sensor in the device acts as input and output of the model.
    The analysis can be performed by the IoT model for the prediction results and
    evaluation. The cloud technology of the IoT model is used to store the data of
    the process in any location of the cloud which is integrated with the IoT model.
    The current state of the component can be changed dynamically at a set interval
    to modify the inputs and to attain different results for the environment. AWS
    cloud storage has been used for this experimental setup and the connections are
    made default by the AWS interface after the login procedure. The processing unit
    of the IoT model contains the interaction devices which establish the communication
    to the user. Wireless fidelity device can be used for the interaction purpose
    in the IoT model. The sensor captures the input of the environment and analyses
    the input and translates into human understandable form and sends to the user.
    The mobile phones or any electronic interfaces can be used to receive the data
    from the IoT model by the user. This IoT model can be used to solve the water
    and fertilizer shortage and wastage problem of the agricultural field. Our proposed
    system will provide an optimal solution and will develop an effective irrigation
    model based on the humidity, temperature, and soil moisture of the field. As already
    mentioned the proposed model provides optimal solution for water scarcity in the
    agricultural crop fields by observation the various parameters such as temperature
    of the environment, humidity of the environment, and soil moisture of the particular
    field using the sensors of the parameters said above. The results of the parameters
    above said are sent to the user''s interface having the allotted IP address where
    the user can view the results of the parameters. The IoT model gathers the information
    from the allocated IP address in a nonstop way for analyzing the information.
    When the resultant values of the parameters such as temperature, humidity, and
    moisture exceed the threshold values of the environment, the IoT model automatically
    controls the motor of the field. Based on the values only the motor will ON/OFF
    automatically. The values are assumed as the threshold value through the proposed
    optimal algorithm called Differential Water-flow algorithm (DWA). The threshold
    value is based on three categories best, moderate, and worst. The working of the
    DWA has been depicted in the forthcoming sections. The interface which is connected
    to the cloud provides the resultant view to the user. The interface is a noncomplex
    utilized application which includes four icons. These four icons mention the state
    of the water motor, soil moisture resultant value view, temperature of the environment,
    and humidity of the environment. The state of the motor represents the current
    state of the pump in the agriculture field. 2 LITERATURE REVIEW A major survey
    has been done on the various layers such as identifying the objectives and working
    of the traditional systems, identifying the needs of the parameters of this problem,
    and identifying the preliminary steps in the generation of the proposed systems.
    The sensors to identify the level of moisture in the soil, the degree of temperature
    of the particular environment, and the sensors which exchange the information
    to the user interface are located at the root level of the crop. The algorithm
    is said to be designed to fix the threshold value of the moisture of the soil.
    The algorithm is appended in the microcontroller to monitor and manage the water
    quantity.6 An automatic model for irrigation to sense the values of the moisture
    in the soil was proposed to develop an irrigation model which automatically works
    for the water motor. It performs the ON/OFF operation based on the wetness of
    the soil of the crop field which is identified by the automatic model for irrigation.
    The limitation in this model was, it concentrated only on the identification of
    moisture level in the soil and transmitted to the user through any sensing devices.7
    The identified information about the parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    and moisture in the soil were transmitted to the famer of that particular agricultural
    field through SMS. Here for doing this operation the model utilizes wireless sensor
    network and observes the green environment of the agricultural field from the
    far away distance.8 For the purpose of plantation in an agricultural crop field
    remote irrigation depending upon the Arduino was proposed to generate the required
    water level by identifying the humidity of the environment from the remote. Here
    the humidity value is set to a point value, if the humidity value goes beyond
    the limit, then the irrigation system automatically provides water for the crops
    in that particular agricultural field.9 This model did not concentrate on the
    moisture present in the soil and temperature of the environment. It is also important
    to consider the power consumption for the motor usage of an agricultural crop
    field. One of the existing systems focused on the usage of power and water by
    developing a control system using GSM and Android. This existing system controls
    and manages the power and water of the particular environment.10 The optimal utilization
    of hardware was also important at that time due to minimization of the infrastructure
    in size. One of the existing system used low memory-utilizing microcontroller
    for controlling and managing the crops in the agricultural field.11 The traditional
    wireless drip irrigation automation was proposed to identify the moisture in the
    soil by using the sensors. Here also the model did not concentrate on the identification
    of temperature and humidity of the environment which helps in the yield of crops
    in the agricultural field.12 The latest microprocessor was used to improve the
    technologies used in the agriculture by updating the procedures in the working
    of the devices used in that environment. It also tried to provide better infrastructure
    by choosing the needed hardware in the building of its structure to establish
    the automation in irrigation.13 The data are stored in the database which is connected
    serially to a personal computer''s receiver board for the further purpose. The
    performance of the database has been improved by the usage of the neural network
    approach in its working procedure.14 The irrigation is done only in the places
    where the soil moisture value goes beyond the threshold value and other places
    of the crop field are not considered.15, 16 A novel resource clustering algorithm
    was proposed to enhance the effectiveness in the wireless personal environment.
    This particular work gave an idea of ways of approaching the personal network.17
    The agricultural growth depending on IoT will provide the highest priority to
    enhance the crop yield and for the improvement in the quality of yielded crops
    of the particular agricultural environment.18-20 An efficient performance evaluation
    model based on continuous Markov chain and Poisson process was proposed to show
    how the performance of the irrigation model can be evaluated.21 Many technologies
    had been deployed based on the convergence technology for the future agriculture
    which identifies the demand and supply of the crops early. It also manages the
    quality of the crop and current conditions for the crop growing which changes
    dynamically at certain time period.22 The relational analysis has been done by
    using the technology called text mining to ensure the analyses in correlations
    of the text based on agriculture, resident situations, inclusion, and removal
    of crops. This type of relational analysis is the initial step to be done for
    a technology to adopt the agriculture production system.23 The agricultural production
    model which depends upon IoT includes three components such as service offered
    by IoT, prediction based on statistics, and analysis done based on the relations.24
    Combining statistical models using modified spectral subtraction method for embedded
    system was proposed to produce an effective IoT environment related to agriculture
    in the future.25 These are the literatures undergone for the above-mentioned agricultural
    problem. Many of the existing systems considered anyone of the parameters, temperature,
    soil moisture, and humidity. The proposed IoT model will concentrate on all these
    three parameters for the efficient growth of the crops in the agricultural field.
    In addition to that the proposed model introduced a novel algorithm called DWA
    which automatically switch ON/OF the motor based on the set threshold value. The
    experimental results of the proposed system have been compared and evaluated with
    many of the above-said existing systems. In maximum cases the proposed algorithm
    performs well and produces the optimal growth for the crops in the agricultural
    field. 3 PROPOSED IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING IoT In the proposed IoT irrigation system
    many inexpensive sensors are used to monitor the temperature, humidity, and moisture
    in the soil of the environment. The proposed model observes the agricultural crop
    field 24/7 and transfers the details to the interface deployed using the cloud
    computing. The input information sensed by the sensor are managed in the cloud
    database. The procedure of the IoT model verifies and analyzes the received information
    with the set threshold value of the parameters such as humidity, moisture, and
    temperature of the environment. Based on these results the motor automation is
    performed by the procedure of the novel algorithm named Differential Workflow
    Algorithm (DFA) which is described through the pseudocode mentioned below. The
    conditions for the motor switch ON/OFF mentioned in the pseudocode of the proposed
    DFA. The structure of the proposed model is depicted by using the sections such
    as information investment, microcontroller component, section for transmission
    of wireless data, sections for storing the data in the database, processing the
    information and model of irrigation automation. The overall scenario of our work
    is shown in the Figure 1. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flow diagram
    of the proposed working environment The flow diagram of the proposed working environment
    comprises three sections such as challenges in agriculture, solutions by the proposed
    system and benefits to the society. These three sections are dominated by the
    major objective “Innovations in Agriculture through IoT”. The first sections depict
    some of the major challenges in the agriculture such as wastage of fertilizer,
    shortage of water, difficulties in managing the costs, and difficulties in facing
    the increase in the needs. The section two deals with our initiatives to address
    the challenges in agriculture and gave solutions through the design of proposed
    systems. The proposed system is deployed using the latest technology IoT. This
    model identifies the level of moisture in the soil, temperature and humidity in
    the environment. By knowing these values, the proposed model switches the motor
    ON/OFF automatically. That is why the proposed model is mentioned as automated
    irrigation system. Section 3 concludes the flow diagram of the proposed working
    environment with the social benefits. The proposed system provided an optimal
    solution for growing the crops in the agricultural field. It increases the crop
    growth, enriches the economy of the society through optimal agricultural, optimal
    usage of water and fertilizer, and encourages the farmers in the cultivating the
    crops. 3.1 Pseudocode of the proposed DWA Input: Temperature value, Humidity Value,

    moisture The microcontroller belonging to Arduino is connected with the sensor
    and the procedures of the DFA are coded into the board for the operation. After
    the code deployed a cylinder structure material has been built to place the IoT
    model in it and located in the crop field. The sensor used to sense the moisture
    present in soil contains two electrodes and they are placed dipped in the soil.
    The electrodes are used to transfer electricity in to the soil. The soil which
    contains low level of moisture will pass more electricity in the soil and the
    soil which contains high level of moisture will transfer less electricity through
    in the soil. This will help in identifying the level of moisture in the soil.
    The objective function for humidity and soil moisture given is 3.3 Working of
    IoT Model in identification of level of humidity and temperature The next phase
    is to identify the humidity and temperature of the environment of the agricultural
    crop field. Humidity is defined as quantity of vapor of water in the atmosphere.
    The identification of comparative humidity is done based on the temperature change
    in the environment. The comparative humidity changes when there is a change in
    the environment''s temperature. The changes of the temperature and humidity of
    the environment occurs in both the cases as before irrigating the field and after
    irrigating the field. The quantity of water vapor level in the atmosphere is maximized
    after the completion of irrigation. Because of this particular scenario, temperature
    is minimized, at the same time the level of humidity is maximized in the environment
    of the agricultural crop field. The continuous notification is sent to the cloud
    interface where the farmer of that particular agricultural crop fields will have
    the knowledge of their environments from anywhere in the world. 3.4 Working of
    IoT model in identification of illumination power of the environment To identify
    the power of luminosity or illumination the luminosity sensor is used in the environment.
    Illumination strength plays a vital role in the growth of the agricultural crops
    and does the photosynthesis for that particular environment. Luminosity-based
    resistor has been utilized for the operation of the identification of illumination
    power of the environment. Here, when the flow of current is minimized indicates
    the maximum power of luminosity occurs in that particular agricultural crop field
    environment. The luminous power may change periodically at that time to identify
    the resistance the component called Ampere segregation switch is used. The level
    of ampere maximizes the power of luminosity when the ampere level is maximized.
    3.5 Procedure for information transmission using the wireless medium The information
    acquired from the sensors are transferred to the database server deployed in the
    cloud data center using the wireless medium. The wireless medium used here is
    MQE5K13. This particular medium is used for transmission of information between
    the agricultural crop field and the database server deployed in the cloud. 3.6GHZ
    transmitter and receiver have been used for this purpose. The microcontroller
    which is the heart of the proposed IoT model is connected to this transmitter
    and receiver to exchange the information. As the agricultural crop field acts
    as one of the end and named as back end and the web interface deployed using cloud
    acts as another end named as front end. The transmitter placed in the back end
    and the receiver is placed in the front end of the proposed model. Unique tokens
    are given to all the transmitter and receiver present in the proposed IoT model
    which is deployed in the agricultural crop fields. The source transmitter will
    have the knowledge of destination receiver''s token to pass the information to
    the particular receiver, because without knowing the receiver''s token the transmitter
    cannot pass the information to the receiver. As already said the receiver is tied
    with the interface of the farmer who can monitor and view the values of the temperature,
    humidity, and moisture level of the soil of the particular environment. The farmer
    as a user can access the interface at anytime and anywhere because the interface
    is deployed in cloud. 3.6 Information processing and concluding the values The
    information obtained from the agricultural crop field are transferred by the wireless
    medium MQE5K13 and loaded in the server present in the cloud datacenter with the
    help of connection-oriented network protocols. At regular intervals the IoT model
    receives the information and loads in the cloud database. The objective of information
    processing is to identify the information received from different sensors of the
    agricultural crop field and compares the information with the set threshold values.
    The set threshold value depends upon the variety of plants. Due to this the set
    threshold value will differ among the plants. Based on the working procedure of
    the DFA the motor will automatically switch ON/OFF according to the sensor values
    produced by the IoT model. 3.7 Smart irrigation model using proposed IoT approach
    The working of the proposed IoT approach start its operation of automation when
    it receives the information from the interface deployed on the cloud datacenter.
    The actuator sensors are used to transfer the managing messages from the interface
    to the input ports present in the physical layer of the IoT model. The actuator
    sensor works as a switch which is operated using the current. The mother board
    which has minimum load inputs is managed by using the actuator sensor. When the
    outside current is appended or flow on the corners of the actuator sensor then
    it enables ON/OFF of the motherboard depends upon the input value. To observe
    and identify the level of water in the well a special type of water sensor is
    used named OE5L928A. 3.8 Deployment of IoT in the proposed smart irrigation model
    The latest technology IoT has been deployed in the proposed model, where the IoT
    is major cause of dynamic technological behavior in today''s world. The main objective
    of the utilization of IoT in the proposed system is to exchange the information
    between the farmer and the proposed model. The data related to the soil is passed
    to the user interface deployed in cloud through many sensors which senses the
    soil parameters. Then the values of parameter such as level of moisture in the
    soil, temperature, and humidity are passed to the user interface in which the
    farmers can view and observe the information. All the information related to the
    crop is analyzed and sent to the user interface. As per the procedure of the proposed
    DWA, when the level of moisture of the soil is decreased, temperature and humidity
    of the environment increase and then the water will be spread to the field through
    the smart automated proposed IoT model which operates the switch ONN/OFF automatically
    based on the condition. When all the parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity satisfies the set threshold value then the motor switches OFF automatically
    based on the condition of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm DWA describes
    the water spreading to the field for all the cases which is depicted in the pseudocode
    of the DWA. 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS The proposed IoT model results are evaluated
    in a real crop agricultural field. The results are evaluated for the parameters
    moisture of the soil, humidity cum luminous power and temperature of the environment.
    The threshold limit is categorized into two ways such as upper control limit and
    lower control limit. Upper control limit represents the best category of threshold
    value limit and lower control limit represents the worst category of threshold
    value limit. The evaluation for these limits is shown by using the sigma calculation
    in the Figure 2. Some of the heterogeneous resources of both wired and wireless
    devices are used for this current research work. The simulation tool used for
    this research is AWS IoT model and a real IoT test bed environment fixed on the
    crop field. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Set threshold upper and
    lower limit The set threshold upper control limit and lower control limit is shown
    accurately using the proposed IoT model interface deployed in the cloud. This
    is shown in the Figure 3. As per this chart the temperature, humidity cum luminous
    power and moisture level of the soil is calculated. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Accurate view of the set threshold limit by proposed Internet of Things
    model Based on the threshold set value the luminous power of the environment in
    the agricultural crop field is calculated and shown in Figure 4. The luminous
    power is calculated in four categories as dark, dim, light, and bright. FIGURE

    5 shows the level of moisture in the soil of the particular environment based
    on the threshold value. The motor will start work automatically by using the procedure
    of the proposed algorithm DFA deployed in the proposed IoT model. Two graphs have
    been shown in Figure 5 soil moisture measurement based on threshold value. The
    first graph depicts the overall measurement of the level of moisture in the soil
    for the particular environment and second graph shows the deeper level of moisture
    present in the soil for the particular agricultural crop field. FIGURE 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture measurement based on threshold value
    After the calculation of level of soil moisture in the agricultural crop field,
    the temperature of the environment is calculated on three categories as temperature
    in minus degrees or cold temperature environment, hot temperature environment,
    and moderate or flexible temperature environment. The calculated minus degree
    temperature is shown in Figure 6. Figures 6-10 contain two graphs, one graph is
    for overall calculation and another one is for accurate calculation. FIGURE 6

    Comparison of existing and proposed algorithms Based on the above calculation
    of humidity cum luminous power, soil moisture calculation, and temperature of
    the agricultural field the motor embedded using the proposed the IoT model automatically
    switches ON/OFF as per the procedure of the proposed DFA as shown in Figure 11.
    The proposed workflow algorithm produces 70% accuracy compared to that of existing
    approaches such as RTR and VTU approaches. The comparison graph is shown to justify
    the performance of the proposed system as shown in Figure 12. 5 CONCLUSION Agriculture
    plays a vital role in the growth of economy of any developing countries. Various
    crops what we had in the ancient days are not present now due to various issues
    in the current world. Agriculture faces various problems many due to the shortage
    and wastage of water. By keeping in this mind, our research work concentrated
    to address these problems and tried to provide solution. The paper proposed an
    IoT model containing a proposed algorithm called DFA. Our proposed IoT model calculates
    the parameters such as temperature, humidity, and level of moisture in the soil
    in most effective by using the set threshold value. The calculated value is given
    as input to the IoT model and the motor embedded with the IoT model switches ON/OFF
    based on the procedure of the algorithm mentioned above. The proposed approach
    DFA is compared with the some of the existing systems and their results are evaluated
    based on the threshold value. The proposed DFA performs well and produces the
    optimal solution to yield better crop percentage comparing to existing approaches.
    Further it is planned to propose an algorithm for the parameter value calculation
    by restricting the sensor and human interface by using the machine learning approach.

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

  description: This paper gives the idea of solving some of the problems faced by
    farmers. The population rate of the world is growing rapidly and will double in
    the coming decades and the need of food is also increasing simultaneously. To
    meet this rapid growth in demand for food, automation in agriculture is the best
    solution. The aim of this paper is to design and develop an automated system to
    monitor the various conditions of soil and moisture on the crops, and the proper

    IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The technical field is racing
    to provide more optimum solutions. The incorporation of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide enough
    scope to predicrocess, analyze situations and improve activities in a real-time
    situation. Green House is one of the best solutions as the crops can be grown
    in a controlled climate without the natural environmental conditions. In the last
    few decades there has been a huge advancement in technology for agriculture, with
    the help of technology we can help farmers for increasing their rate of yielding.
    With this, we can overcome the major problems of farmers. This small processor-based
    unit can be used to control anything from a fan, air- conditioner, humidifier,
    and watering system from 4 relay outputs. A temperature and humidity range can
    be set to control relay outputs. The main focus of this paper is to implement
    the Internet of Things (IoT) in the monitoring of humidity, soil condition, temperature,
    supply of water to the field, level of water, environmental condition, etc. The
    IoT-based Smart agriculture System being planned via this paper is integrated

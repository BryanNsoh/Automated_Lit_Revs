    controlPrecision irrigation 1. Introduction Agriculture is the base of our socio-economical
    model, and its development plays an essential role in the welfare of nations (Gollin
    et al., 2002). However, agriculture has a high environmental impact and can be
    considered one of the most important contributors to global environmental degradation
    (Mueller et al., 2012). Furthermore, as the global population continues to grow,
    there is an urgent need to increase food production. This already complex challenge
    is further intensified by accelerated environmental changes, characterized by
    significant shifts in precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme weather
    events such as heavy rains, heatwaves, and droughts (Bisbis et al., 2018). Consequently,
    it is critical to develop strategies to enhance agricultural production while
    mitigating its environmental impact. In this context, improvements in irrigation
    scheduling play an important role, not only because agriculture is the consumer
    of almost 70% of freshwater resources (Jalilvand et al., 2019), but also because
    appropriate irrigation scheduling can help to increase the yield production and
    minimize the leaching of nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metal to freshwater
    sources (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). Incorporating technological tools could be a
    viable solution to improve irrigation scheduling, where the aim is to make irrigation
    decisions based on the needs of the crops, establishing when the crops need water
    and how much water needs to be applied. Numerous studies have centered on developing
    tools that accurately detect plant water stress conditions to determine optimal
    irrigation. For instance, Torres et al. (2019) employed near-infrared spectroscopy
    to measure in-situ leaf relative water content. In parallel, other approaches
    assess plant water requirements using soil moisture sensors (SMS) positioned in
    the target zone. The use of SMS is the most adopted technology for irrigation
    scheduling in the USA (USDA, 2018, Taghvaeian et al., 2020), and in many scenarios,
    a common response to identified irrigation needs is implementing feedback threshold
    control by using SMS (Dukes et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2010, Zhang et al.,
    2017, Li et al., 2018, Cayuela et al., 2022, Simionesei et al., 2020), or using
    fuzzy-based decision systems (Culman et al., 2019, Stone et al., 2020). Both strategies
    define levels based on measured stress conditions or soil moisture. However, the
    methodology for setting these threshold levels is not versatile enough to accommodate
    the diversity of crops, soils, and environmental conditions. Furthermore, these
    thresholds often remain static, not accounting for the evolving needs of crops
    influenced by environmental factors, intrinsic crop properties, and growth stages.
    Accurately determining the volume of water needed for irrigation entails a comprehensive
    understanding of plant water consumption concerning environmental variables, specific
    crop attributes, and growth stages (Lopez-Jimenez et al., 2022). Many decision
    support systems employ crop measurements coupled with AI to estimate and compensate
    for water losses from the evapotranspiration process (Katimbo et al., 2023). The
    works developed by Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et al. (2019) aim
    to bolster decision-support systems for agricultural irrigation by incorporating
    analytical models such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM). This comprehensive
    model features modules covering soil water balance, nutrient dynamics, equilibrium
    soil chemistry, potential evapotranspiration, surface energy balance, heat transfer,
    pesticide processes, and plant growth, relying on the Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). RZWQM has been widely utilized to simulate
    the impacts of agricultural management strategies on crop yields and soil and
    water quality (Ma et al., 2012). Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et
    al. (2019) use RZWQM for computing irrigation scheduling based on measurable crop
    conditions, predefined threshold values, and numerical solutions generated by
    the model. Nonetheless, employing RZWQM to compute irrigation scheduling in a
    feedback scheme presents significant challenges due to its inherent complexity
    and rigidity. The model’s detailed structure complicates the straightforward analyses
    and inclusion of user-specified requirements and the adaptation to overcome discrepancies
    between the crop and the model. Furthermore, RZWQM is restricted to a predefined
    set of cultivars, limiting its versatility to diverse agricultural settings. The
    complexity also imposes computational constraints, making real-time feedback control
    based on the current soil moisture state and crop stages challenging. These limitations
    underscore the necessity for more versatile, adaptive, and computationally efficient
    irrigation scheduling strategies. To this end, some studies have explored advanced
    control theory as a systematic approach to the irrigation problem (Saleem et al.,
    2013, Delgoda et al., 2016, Shang et al., 2020). As mentioned by Romero et al.
    (2012) and Ding et al. (2018), using advanced control strategies in agriculture
    has a high potential to increase efficiency. However, tangible applications are
    sparse. Much of the documented research revolves around simulations (Romero et
    al., 2012). While comprehensive on paper, some models oversimplify real-world
    scenarios by presupposing fully instrumented crops. Contrarily, in practical settings,
    agricultural systems often struggle with control limitations. In many irrigation
    systems, manual intervention dominates, where operators activate or deactivate
    pumps, manage ditches, and manipulate valves or gates to regulate irrigation.
    In summary, we evidence a lack of irrigation strategies that balance efficiency,
    practicality, and real crop management considerations. Many current methods rely
    heavily on static thresholds or intricate models, which often do not adapt dynamically
    to changing environmental conditions, diverse crop needs, irrigation management
    practices, and different growth stages. Moreover, while advanced control theory
    holds promise, there is an absence of advanced control strategies that account
    for real-world complexities and manual human intervention in the operation of
    irrigation systems, where the timely human response to crop needs, actuation precision,
    and operational reliability are important elements that influence the controlled
    system. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this research is to use
    control theory to enhance the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly in
    real agricultural scenarios that are often human-operated. We propose developing
    a novel control-based algorithm for a DSS for irrigation scheduling capable of
    computing practical irrigation instructions based on field measurements and weather
    forecasting, which is designed to be adaptable to the grower’s or irrigation manager’s
    operational limitations, preferences, and experience and must compensate for uncertainties
    introduced by human intervention. We have formulated our DSS around a simplified
    proposed control-oriented model (COM), which describes the soil moisture dynamics;
    a data processing stage, which makes the measured data compatible with the COM;
    a parameter estimation stage, which guarantees an optimal adjustment of the COM
    parameters based on measured information from the crop; and a control stage, which
    uses the parametrized COM, measured information from the crop, and information
    from weather forecasting to compute the appropriate irrigation instructions that
    maintain the soil moisture close to a desired level. We evaluated our algorithm
    using collected data from a seepage-irrigated commercial sweetcorn field in South
    Florida. Our evaluations covered each component of our system, from model validation
    to overall system performance. As a principal outcome, the proposed algorithm
    presents the potential to save 30% of water in this type of irrigation system.
    This water-saving is facilitated through effective and achievable computed irrigation
    scheduling that maintains soil moisture within a targeted range. Such control
    preserves optimal growing conditions and minimizes environmental risks by preventing
    runoff, percolation, and the leaching of hazardous agricultural chemicals into
    the surrounding ecosystem. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 starts with an overview of soil moisture and irrigation scheduling,
    establishes the problem of formulating a control-oriented DSS for irrigation scheduling,
    and offers a detailed description of the proposed DSS algorithm. Section 3 describes
    the process following to validate the proposed algorithm. In Section 4, the results
    of the validation are presented and discussed. Finally, in Section 5, some conclusions
    are drawn. 2. Methods 2.1. Process description and problem formulation The relationship
    between irrigation, soil, plants, and the environment constitutes a complex system
    that requires practical concepts and analogies to formulate optimal irrigation
    strategies. As delineated in Eisenhauer et al. (2021), soil can be conceptualized
    as a reservoir, with different levels representing the amount of water available
    for plant uptake. We adopt this conceptual framework to simplify a complex problem
    that involves agriculture, control theory, and human interaction and to formulate
    the control problem on a DSS for irrigation management. Within this context, we
    identify key input and output variables, delineate desired conditions or set points,
    and specify agricultural constraints and human limitations. Download : Download

    of soil moisture states significant for plant-water relations and irrigation control
    based on Eisenhauer et al. (2021). The Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) delineates
    the lower threshold of soil water content at which plants cannot recover from
    water stress, marking the limiting boundary for plant survivability. The Maximum
    Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical reference, as soil moisture levels
    below this point result in sub-optimal physiological responses in plants. The
    soil moisture range between MADP and Field Capacity (FC) is optimal for plant
    growth, balancing water availability and stress prevention. Surpassing FC leads
    to inefficient water use, soil structural degradation, anaerobic root conditions,
    nutrient leaching, and the potential for surface water pollution. Beyond the Saturation
    Point (SP), the soil reaches its hydraulic limit, becoming incapable of retaining
    additional moisture. Fig. 1 illustrates this analogy: the base level, or the Permanent
    Wilting Point (PWP), indicates that below this threshold level, plants cannot
    extract water from the soil, leading to irreversible wilting. The next critical
    point is the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP); if the soil moisture drops
    below this level, the plants undergo water stress, potentially reducing yield.
    Consequently, MADP often serves as a guideline for irrigation decisions as the
    lower limit. However, its precise value, i.e., the percentage of MADP as the lower
    limit, can vary based on the crop, its growth stage, and prevailing climatic conditions.
    For instance, Bayabil et al. (2023) demonstrated that using only 75% of the expected
    MADP saved 25% of water consumption, with no reduction in sweet corn yield. Similarly,
    strategic deficit irrigation during certain growth stages of wine grapes enhances
    fruit quality for winemaking (Kang et al., 2023). From a control systems perspective,
    the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical set-point or lower-bound
    constraint that must be maintained. Failure to uphold soil moisture levels at
    or above this threshold can lead to suboptimal plant physiological responses and
    yield reduction. The Field Capacity (FC) is defined as the soil water content
    threshold beyond which the gravitational drainage is negligible and is considered
    the upper limit. Below FC, the capillary actions keep the water stored in the
    soil pores. Irrigating until reaching FC and avoiding exceeding field capacity
    prevents the leaching of nutrients and pesticides applied to the crops. The saturation
    point (SP) is attained when the soil can no longer retain water, leading to runoff
    on the surface, which poses significant environmental concerns. Soil texture significantly
    influences key hydraulic characteristics such as the PWP, FC, and SP. Saxton and
    Rawls (2006) provide detailed hydraulic characteristics across various soil textures,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2. From this figure, it becomes evident that managing irrigation
    in sandy soil is notably challenging. A simple 5% fluctuation in water content
    in such soil can either lead to plant wilting or result in water wastage. In contrast,
    silt soils offer better flexibility: water content can vary by as much as 24%
    without triggering any adverse agricultural or ecological consequences. Therefore,
    the soil’s proportion of sand, silt, and clay plays an important role in the control
    problem definition and for specific irrigation decisions. Conceptually, for control
    purposes, soil can be viewed as a storage unit, where the area depends on the
    soil texture, the control input is irrigation, and the control objective is maintaining
    the volumetric water content to a desired level. However, additional considerations
    must also be included in the case of a DSS for irrigation control. Download :

    Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) of 50% of the available water for each
    soil class. Points over each bar denote the specific values. This figure is based
    on the hydraulic characteristics reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006). 2.1.1. Control
    challenges on a decision support system for irrigation scheduling A DSS for irrigation
    scheduling is particularly useful in farm systems with no automatic control elements,
    where the grower or irrigation manager carries out irrigation actions. In our
    proposed DSS, the control problem is to use available information from crops and
    weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions that help the user minimize
    the error between desired and measured soil moisture. Below, we discuss some considerations
    that must be addressed. Timely Human Response: The grower or irrigation manager
    cannot execute irrigation instructions quickly and suddenly. For that, even if
    sensors and computational capabilities can offer periodic information with sampling
    periods of minutes or seconds, this information will be unhelpful and might overwhelm
    or confuse the operator. Moreover, if an irrigation instruction suddenly appears
    when the operator is unavailable to make an irrigation action, it might not generate
    the expected result. Actuation Precision: Many conventional irrigation systems
    rely on actuators that operate more as binary switches than precision instruments.
    In agriculture, it is common to find devices such as on–off pumps, gates, weirs,
    and valves, which are unsuited for precise operation. Hence, recommendations should
    be straightforward and actionable, such as suggesting irrigation during a time
    rather than maintaining a specific flow rate. Human Reliability: Even with precise
    recommendations from the DSS, human behavior introduces variability. External
    influences can alter the final action taken, introducing a layer of uncertainty.
    Considered Measurable Variables: In most agricultural practices, rain ( ), irrigation
    ( ), and temperature ( ) are the main measurable variables affecting root zone
    soil moisture ( ). While capillary effects from the deep soil also influence root
    zone soil moisture, quantifying these effects necessitates more elaborated measurement
    techniques compared to the direct measurement of the aforementioned variables.
    Integration of Weather Forecasts: Meteorological advancements have made weather
    predictions increasingly accurate. Governments worldwide are making concerted
    efforts to provide weather forecasts as part of impact-based decision-support
    services. These forecasts, especially regarding expected rainfall and temperature,
    are crucial for making informed irrigation decisions, ensuring optimal water use,
    and supporting crop health. 2.2. Proposed approach We address the control challenges
    by proposing a DSS presented in Fig. 3, which integrates measured information
    from the crop and weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions. The
    DSS integrates control theory and accommodates timely human response by working
    periodically and allowing the grower to determine the irrigation period1 for these
    executions. Furthermore, the DSS provides practical and realizable irrigation
    instructions, given in units of volume per irrigation period or irrigation time
    per irrigation period. For instance, if the grower selects a two-day irrigation
    period, the DSS will calculate the necessary volume of water or irrigation time
    that must be applied for each two-day interval. Download : Download high-res image

    proposed Decision Support System (DSS) for irrigation scheduling. The description
    illustrates the measured variables, where represents the instant time when the
    data is obtained, indicates the temperature, rain, soil moisture, and irrigation.
    The DSS is formulated with four main components: (i) the control-oriented model
    (COM), used as a base of the control algorithm; (ii) the data processing stage
    for aligning multi-temporal sensor data with algorithmic components; (iii) a parameter
    estimation stage for updating model parameters ( ); and (iv) a control algorithm
    that utilizes the COM, estimated parameters, processed measurements, and weather
    forecasts to calculate irrigation instructions ( ). The DSS uses measured variables
    from the crop, where rain and temperature can be obtained from a weather station,
    and volumetric water content can be obtained from soil moisture sensors. To address
    the system’s robustness against human variability in irrigation execution, our
    DSS additionally considers measuring this execution, i.e., obtaining measurements
    of irrigation time per irrigation period or volume of water per irrigation period.
    This measurement can be obtained from flowmeters or sensors for flow detection.
    The proposed approach (Fig. 3) is supported by (i) a COM of the SM, (ii) a data
    processing stage, (iii) a parameter estimation stage, and (iv) a control algorithm.
    In this approach, the COM serves as a parametrizable model that characterizes
    soil moisture as a function of processed measured variables and parameters to
    be estimated. At each irrigation period, the estimation stage calculates and updates
    the parameters. Then, the control stage uses the COM, the estimated parameters,
    soil moisture measurements, and weather forecasting data to determine the appropriate
    irrigation action that maintains the soil moisture at the desired value. A detailed
    breakdown of each component of the DSS is provided below. 2.2.1. Proposed control-oriented
    model for soil moisture The most important element of the proposed strategy is
    the COM. In agriculture, traditional models often focus on capturing the complexity
    of various biophysical processes. Although accurate, these models are often computationally
    expensive and not straightforwardly applicable for control design. We have derived
    the COM from a simplified water balance, as Fig. 4 describes. This model considers
    the soil a storage unit, where a linear combination of adaptable parameters and
    measured variables performs a water balance with inputs, including rain, irrigation,
    and upward capillarity. On the other hand, outputs include evapotranspiration,
    deep percolation, and runoff. The choice of a simplified model inevitably raises
    concerns about the sacrifice of modeling accuracy. However, in our DSS algorithm,
    this drawback is mitigated by continual parameter estimation based on real-time
    data and by incorporating feedback in the control equation. Our COM is formulated
    based on three assumptions: Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download

    dynamics, where , and are outputs associated with evapotranspiration, and deep
    percolation; , , and are inputs associated to rain, irrigation, and capillary
    rise. Assumption 1 Model Sampling Period The COM is formulated with a fixed time
    step, denoted by , corresponding to the irrigation period. This fixed period allows
    for the discretization of soil moisture dynamics, indexed by the variable . Our
    DSS algorithm is based on the COM, which is discrete and will describe the soil
    moisture dynamics according to the irrigation period ( ). The grower or irrigation
    manager can configure to suit their operational preferences. Consequently, the
    COM and, by extension, the DSS algorithm are adaptable to those preferences. For
    instance, if a two-day irrigation period is selected, the COM will effectively
    model soil moisture dynamics under this discrete time interval. It is highlighted
    that, in practice, sensors often provide data at multiple sampling frequencies.
    We have designed specific data management techniques to reconcile this multiplicity
    of data with the user-defined irrigation period . These techniques are detailed
    in Section 2.2.2. Assumption 2 Soil Moisture Average During an appropriate irrigation
    period, it is reasonable to presume that the available water for the plants within
    the root zone is closely around an average soil moisture value, denoted as . This
    assumption enables us to formulate the control objective as maintaining this average
    soil moisture close to a desired level . This assumption simplifies both the model
    and the DSS algorithm. However, we clarify that choosing a lengthy irrigation
    period might be comfortable for the irrigation manager but can be risky for the
    plant’s health. Conversely, opting for shorter irrigation periods can mitigate
    potential water deficit issues during this period, but at the expense of demand
    for more managerial time. The optimal irrigation period depends on the crop type,
    environmental conditions, and highly on soil type. For instance, sandy soils,
    characterized by low water retention capacities, necessitate shorter irrigation
    periods than silt soils, which can retain almost six times more water (see Fig.
    2). It is pertinent to note that the temporal resolution of the COM is directly
    correlated with the chosen irrigation period . A shorter irrigation period effectively
    enhances the temporal resolution, allowing the model to capture more rapid fluctuations
    in soil moisture and other variables. However, this comes at the expense of increased
    computational and managerial demands. The adaptability in selecting allows for
    a trade-off between temporal resolution and operational convenience. Assumption
    3 Linear Relation Soil moisture operates as a causal system. The future average
    soil moisture is influenced by its prior water content and the inputs and outputs
    during this irrigation period. We are considering average soil moisture variation
    between successive irrigation periods, which is represented as , as a linear relation
    of the water balance during such irrigation period. We are formulating that in
    the upcoming irrigation period, the soil moisture average will depend on the actual
    soil moisture average and a linear combination between parameters (rates of change)
    and accumulated amounts of water inputs and outputs during the current irrigation
    period. In this form, we denote water input as the accumulated amount of rain
    during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change between and
    . Note that the rain units are commonly expressed in units of the water depth
    accumulated in the area under study. Since is a summation of measurements, it
    retains the same depth units, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture
    per unit of depth. Similarly, we denote the input as the accumulated amount of
    irrigation during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change
    between and . Irrigation can be measured in units of depth, volume, or, in our
    case, for simplifying sensor instrumentation and data acquisition, irrigation
    time. reflects the total time that the crop is irrigated during the irrigation
    period, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture per unit of time. To streamline
    the electronic instrumentation, we are not considering measured variables corresponding
    to the capillary rise input, as this capillary rise comes from the water table.
    Instead, the input associated with capillary rise will be treated as an unknown
    parameter, denoted by . As discussed in the process description (Section 2.1),
    the infiltration and runoff are directly related to the soil moisture. For that,
    we are associating this output to the combination between the soil moisture average
    and the parameter , which is adimensional and represents the rate of change between
    and . The most adopted method to evaluate evapotranspiration is the FAO-56. This
    method requires the measurement of multiple environmental variables beyond the
    scope of our DSS, such as net radiation, soil heat flux, wind speed, saturation
    vapor pressure, and actual vapor pressure. Inspired by simpler models such as
    the Hargreaves Method (Gao et al., 2017), we overcome this issue by relating evapotranspiration
    directly to the temperature average ( ) via the estimated parameter , which has
    soil moisture per temperature units and describes the rate of change between and
    . Therefore, according to the assumptions and the proposed linear combinations
    that describe the system inputs and outputs, our parametrizable COM is formulated
    as (1) where , , , , and are positive parameters to be estimated, and the variables
    , , , and are obtained in the data processing stage from measured raw data. 2.2.2.
    Data processing stage The primary objective of this stage is to utilize measured
    data to compute the average soil moisture, total rainfall, total irrigation, and
    average temperature over the duration of the irrigation period. In that form,
    knowing a fixed irrigation period spanning from the time instant to and considering
    the sampling period of the respective sensor as , the number of samples within
    an irrigation period can be defined as: (2) With this, the average soil moisture
    is determined by: (3) Similarly, the average temperature is given by: (4) The
    accumulated rainfall over the period is computed as follows: (5) The accumulated
    irrigation is: (6) In Fig. 3, the data processing stage also processes rain and
    temperature forecast data. This data process uses the same methods followed in
    Eqs. (5), (4), considering the sampling time used for the forecasting provider.
    The expected accumulated rainfall for the next irrigation period is noted as ,
    and the expected temperature average is noted as . 2.2.3. Parameter estimation
    stage We aim to estimate the parameters inherent to the COM, namely , , , , .
    Our strategy hinges on maintaining a record of processed data, from which we derive
    an optimization-based approach for parameter estimation. This method is a variation
    of the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) technique (Rao et al., 2001). Our variation
    comprises an expanding estimation window, and this is slightly different from
    the conventional MHE, where a fixed-size window is used. Moreover, we propose
    to ensure the estimated parameters’ optimality by formulating a two-step estimator.
    The decision to use an expanding window arises from the unique characteristics
    of seasonal crops and the observed irrigation practices by growers. Notably, some
    crops can be ready for harvest just 30 days post-planting. Additionally, the irrigation
    schedules set by growers can fluctuate significantly, ranging anywhere from one
    to more than five days. Given these dynamics, valuing and utilizing every data
    collected from the crop throughout its growth cycle is imperative. Moreover, with
    a fixed-size estimation window, we risk encountering data windows without rain
    events or irrigation events, which can impact the estimation of parameters related
    to rain and irrigation. We use an expanding estimation window to mitigate this,
    ensuring the algorithm always has access to a sufficient data set. For permanent
    crops, the analysis might benefit from a moving window with a fixed size long
    enough to guarantee optimal parameter estimation. For data aggregation within
    this expanding window, we consider vectors of processed data from the instant
    to the instant . Hence, the processed data for soil moisture, rainfall, irrigation,
    and temperature within each estimation window is defined as: with . In that form,
    according to the corresponding estimation window, the parameters , , , , and are
    estimated at each irrigation period, given adaptive characteristics to the COM.
    We employ a two-step estimation strategy to guarantee the optimality of our estimated
    parameters: the first step estimates parameters in association with measured variables.
    In contrast, the subsequent step estimates the parameter linked to the water table.
    Prior estimation step At this step, we assume a water table’s slow dynamic variation
    in seepage irrigation and general water table elevation. For that, has a low incidence
    in the variation of the soil moisture. Consequently, we exclude in the first estimation
    step. This step estimates the parameters that minimize the quadratic error between
    the soil moisture variation and the linear combination between the measured variables
    and the parameters associated with the measured variables. In this estimation
    step, we are including a constraint to ensure that all the parameters must be
    positive to conserve the proposed physical relation of the mass balance. The proposed
    optimization problem is formulated as follows: Download : Download high-res image
    (40KB) Download : Download full-size image where is the vector of parameters that
    are associated with measured variables , and is the quadratic error described
    as (8) with , and . For the optimization problem (Eq. (7)), the linear constraints
    imply that an optimal solution is achievable if is convex. The convexity of this
    cost function can be established if its Hessian matrix respect to is positive
    definite (Bhatia, 2015), which in turn depends on the linear independence of the
    columns in . Variability in soil moisture and temperature can generally be assumed,
    ensuring the linear independence of corresponding columns in . However, given
    that rainfall and irrigation can exhibit extended periods of invariability, the
    algorithm is designed to commence only when observed variability in and is confirmed.
    Subsequent estimation step After estimating the parameters associated with the
    measured variables, is estimated. As we consider this parameter directly related
    to the soil moisture, we propose to find the parameter that minimizes the quadratic
    error between the measured soil moisture and the estimated soil moisture with
    initial conditions given by . Where the estimated soil moisture is obtained from
    the water balance in Eq. (1), and the numerical solution of the model (Eq. (1)),
    which is described as (9) In that form, we propose a subsequent optimization problem
    described as Download : Download high-res image (40KB) Download : Download full-size
    image where is the quadratic cost function given by (11) with . In this optimization
    problem, the constraints are also linear. In Appendix, it is shown that by appropriate
    substitutions, appear as a linear combination into the numerical solution given
    by , confirming the convexity of the cost function and that optimal solutions
    of also can be guarantee. 2.2.4. Control stage In the control stage, the COM,
    the estimated parameters, the processed measured variables, and the forecasted
    variables are integrated to calculate the amount of water that must be applied
    during the irrigation period. This stage is an adaptive, predictive, and feedback-plus
    feedforward control strategy. The main objective is to use measured and forecast
    information to estimate the appropriate irrigation ( ) that maintains the soil
    moisture close to a desired value. We explain the control strategy in four steps,
    where first, the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the estimated parameters obtained
    in Eqs. (7), and (10), and the processed measured data (Eqs. (3), (4), (5), and
    (6)) are used to predict (or forecast) the soil moisture one step ahead ( ) as
    follows: (12) Second, we use the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the predicted
    soil moisture , forecast rain and temperature data ( , and , and we assume that
    in the next irrigation period, the estimated parameter variation can be neglected
    or in other words that . With this information, we predict the soil moisture two
    steps ahead ( ) as follows: (13) Third, we establish the objective to deduce the
    irrigation amount to be applied, such as two steps ahead, the predicted soil moisture
    will be equal to the desired soil moisture. Therefore, by replacing in Eq. (13)
    and obtaining , we deduce the irrigation amount equation as follows: (14) Fourth,
    to analyze and understand the elements of the irrigation amount equation, we define
    the expected error between the desired soil moisture and the expected soil moisture
    as . Therefore, Eq. (14) can be rewritten as follows: (15) where the elements
    of the irrigation control equation can be described as components of the water
    balance that equilibrates the soil moisture around the desired value as follows:
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate for the difference
    between the desired moisture and the expected average of the soil moisture; is
    the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that, during
    the irrigation period, was lost due infiltration; is the volume of irrigation
    water that can be hold based on the expected rain during the irrigation period;
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that
    is expected to be lost due evapotranspiration; is the amount of water the crop
    will receive from capillary rise. Note that this control action is a case of adaptive
    control, knows a self-tuning regulator, where the stability of the controlled
    system is conditioned to the accuracy of the estimated parameters and the grade
    of uncertainty between the controlled system and the estimated system (Åström
    and Wittenmark, 2008). 3. Experimental verification The algorithm was validated
    using on-field measurements from a commercial sweetcorn field in South Florida.
    This data was initially collected as part of an integrated research and extension
    project focused on improving farmers’ adoption of soil moisture sensors for irrigation
    scheduling in vegetable farms. We evaluated our DSS algorithm using readings from
    soil moisture probes, a weather station, and a pressure transducer deployed in
    the commercial field. In this section, we describe the data collection process
    and the algorithm evaluation towards establishing the potential benefits of the
    algorithm in comparison with the information obtained from the grower irrigation
    practices. As shown in Fig. 5, we installed sensors to measure soil moisture,
    precipitation, environmental temperature, and irrigation management from December
    21, 2022, to January 11, 2023. Due to confidentiality agreements, the precise
    location of the commercial field remains undisclosed in this study. The soil in
    this field is classified as waveland and lawnwood fine sands. Following the hydraulic
    properties reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006) (Fig. 2), this soil is characterized
    by a permanent wilting point of 5%, a field capacity of 10%, and a saturation
    point of 46%. The field water movement and location of the sensors are described
    in Fig. 5, where the field is surrounded by a channel supplied by a pump drawing
    from a natural water source. Water is distributed from this surrounding channel
    to the crops via pipes. This water is then dispersed into ditches across the field.
    These ditches feature interconnected silts that facilitate water transport to
    the plant beds. Irrigation is accomplished by increasing the water level in the
    channel. It is important to note that this system operates under the assumption
    of homogeneous water distribution, with the water supply pump serving as the unique
    control element. Download : Download high-res image (568KB) Download : Download

    deployment of a weather station, a soil moisture sensor, and a pressure transducer.
    The blue lines delineate the water distribution inflow utilized for irrigating
    the agricultural field under study. Under the homogeneous water distribution consideration,
    moisture measurements were taken in the root zone at a depth of 0.3 m, using a
    Sentek Drill & Drop 60 cm soil moisture probe, which is capable of measuring soil
    moisture, temperature, and salinity at uniformly spaced depths every 0.1 m, providing
    a profile up to 0.6 m depth (Sentek, 2018). The sampling time was 1800 s. Rain
    and temperature data were obtained using a Davis Vantage Pro2 GroWeather 6820c
    weather station (Davis, 2023). The sampling time was 900 s. Irrigation measurements
    were taken by installing a KPSI 700 pressure sensor at the bottom of the channel.
    This sensor has a range of 0.7–210 m, an accuracy of 1% with analog output from
    0 to 10 V. The objective was to identify sudden increases related to pump activation
    to establish the irrigation time during the irrigation period. The pressure sensor
    was connected to a CR1000X datalogger of Cambell Scientific (Campbell, 2023) with
    a sampling time of 300 s, and the irrigation management was established by analyzing
    this information. The proposed DSS algorithm was tested using Matlab software
    version R2022a (Matlab, 2022). The irrigation period was selected by analyzing
    the irrigation management given by the grower. We observed that the management
    given by the grower was in function of soil and crop appearance, irrigating when
    required, and turning the pump on and off with an elapsed time between 1 and 6
    days. Given this information, our algorithm testing incorporated an irrigation
    period of two days ( ). We consider that with this period, we can provide reasonable
    timing actions from the grower. We added normally distributed random noise to
    the measured data to simulate the inherent stochasticity in weather forecasts.
    Specifically, the magnitude of this noise was set at 10% of the standard deviation
    of the actual measured data. In the context of rainfall predictions, any resultant
    negative values post-noise addition were truncated to zero. The maximum allowable
    depletion for sweet corn was considered 50% (Bayabil et al., 2023). We determined
    the desired soil moisture between 7.5% and 10%. We selected a desired soil moisture
    of 9% to stay far from the maximum allowable depletion point and accommodate uncertainties
    in soil characteristics. Before initializing the algorithm, we converted missing
    data entries to zeros. Soil moisture and irrigation data underwent homogenization
    through interpolation to match the 900 s rain and temperature data sampling interval.
    In the prior estimation step, the optimization problem was formulated as a quadratic
    programming problem and iteratively solved using the “quadprog” tool in Matlab.
    In the subsequent estimation stage, the optimization problem was iteratively addressed
    using a sequential quadratic programming method with the “fmincon” tool in Matlab.
    Then, in the test, the data is processed at each irrigation period to obtain the
    corresponding averages of the temperature and soil moisture and the corresponding
    amounts of accumulated rain and accumulated irrigation applied by the grower.
    Moreover, the model’s parameters are estimated at each irrigation period, and
    the recommended irrigation is computed. We evaluated the overall DSS algorithm
    by applying the computed control action to the parametrized COM. We are addressing
    the uncertainties related to assuming negligible estimated parameter changes between
    consecutive irrigation periods by adding stochastic variability, which was obtained
    by analyzing the variation of the estimated parameters and adding a randomized
    normal distributed disturbance with a standard deviation equal to the observed
    standard deviation of . In that form, the stochastic soil moisture prediction
    is given by (16) where , , , , and are the corresponding disturbances. In consequence,
    the evaluated control action is also disturbed by including the stochastic soil
    moisture prediction as (17) Below, we present the outcomes of our analysis. 4.
    Results and discussion Fig. 6 shows the results of the data processing stage.
    Note how the temperature ( ) shows a periodic component related to day and night
    patterns, also presented in the soil moisture ( ). However, this periodic component
    is removed in both the processed temperature ( ) and soil moisture ( ). In the
    case of accumulated rain ( ), the processed data is presented as the cumulative
    sum for each irrigation period. The grower irrigation decision represents the
    accumulated hours the grower irrigated during each irrigation period. The data
    processing stage is pivotal in aligning the measured data with the model and significantly
    mitigating uncertainties from the measured parameters of soil moisture, temperature,
    rain, and irrigation. As described, this stage computes the average soil moisture,
    total rainfall, total irrigation, and average temperature over the duration of
    each irrigation period. This computation aids in filtering out uncertainties and
    undesired data anomalies provided by sensors and forecasting methods. By averaging
    soil moisture over an irrigation period, the impact of incorrect measurements
    and transient spikes not contemplated in the model and random fluctuations are
    reduced, leading to more representative information on the available water for
    the plants. For example, in Fig. 6, an anomalous temperature measurement close
    to −20 °C is observed on Jan-08-23. This incorrect measurement was filtered out
    in the processed temperature data, thus attenuating its influence. Furthermore,
    considering accumulated rain and irrigation data in the data processing stage
    notably enhances the DSS robustness by minimizing the influence of uncertainty
    in both the measurement and prediction processes. It is essential to emphasize
    that uncertainties in measured rainfall and irrigation data, sampled every 900
    s, have a diminished impact on the estimation and control stages as the duration
    of the irrigation period increases. This reduction in the influence of data uncertainty
    is pivotal for the robustness, accuracy, and reliability of the entire DSS algorithm.

    and the average and distribution of the estimation errors for each estimation

    The lowest recorded correlation and values are 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. In
    addition, the -value starts at and decreases as the estimation window expands,
    reaching a minimum of . The consistently high correlation and values across all
    estimation windows suggest that the estimation algorithm performs well in describing
    the dynamics of the soil moisture average. The lowest value of 0.84 indicates
    that, in the worst-case scenario, the COM can explain an 84% of the variability
    in the soil moisture average. On the other hand, the lowest correlation value
    of 0.92 indicates that we are reaching a strong linear relationship between the
    proposed COM and the observed soil moisture averages. The low and decreasing -value
    describes a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the estimations, which
    increases as the estimation window increases. Download : Download high-res image

    The figure also visualizes prediction error behavior for each prediction instance.
    The results indicate that the average estimation error across all estimation windows
    is around zero, with maximum standard deviations of . The prediction error is
    similarly centered around zero, exhibiting maximum and minimum errors of . As
    the estimation window increases, the prediction error decreases. However, an increase
    in the prediction error is evidenced on Feb-05. This problem is also observed
    in the estimation analyses, with a decrease in the and correlation. On this particular
    estimation, the commercial sweetcorn field experienced an intense rainfall of
    26.67 mm within 24 h. This led to a substantial change in soil moisture levels,
    which the algorithm failed to estimate accurately, resulting in a peak error of
    3.29%. This behavior shows that close to the desired operation region (between
    the MADP and FC), the soil–water relation can be described as a linear model,
    where our COM can accurately describe the dynamics. However, the COM accuracy
    reduces in extreme events that move the SM content away from the desired operation
    region. Our proposed approach overcomes the uncertainties associated with using
    a simplified modeling approach by considering a recursive parameters estimation
    strategy that lets the model adapt to changing crop and environmental conditions.
    The modeling and estimation approach is capable of accurately describing the soil
    moisture dynamics close to the operation region, overcoming associated uncertainties,
    and can be used as a baseline for making irrigation decisions. To delve deeper
    into the validation and performance of our modeling and estimation approach, a
    comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the estimated parameters is subsequently
    provided. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the parameters and the incidence of
    the estimated parameters in the COM. It can be observed that the parameters associated
    with moisture ( ), irrigation ( ), rain ( ), and temperature ( ) exhibits a low
    dispersion in contrast with the parameter associated to the capillary rise ( ).
    A sensitivity analysis of the estimated parameters can be performed by multiplying
    the obtained parameters by the maximum reported value per respective variable,
    obtaining how much the soil moisture can increase or decrease according to the
    parameter dispersion and the maximum values reported for each variable. The results
    show that during an irrigation period, the soil moisture could (i) decrease a
    1.5% concerning maximum soil moisture of 13.6%; (ii) increase around 3.6% with
    48 h of continuous irrigation; (iii) increase around a 3.7% in relation with 26
    (mm) of rain on a period of 48 h; (iv) decrease around 0.3% with a maximum temperature
    average of 23.3 (°C); and (v) increase around 0.06% in relation with the capillary
    rise. Note that the parameter that shows the high dispersion in the estimation
    process is . However, gives the most significant influence. Moreover, it is observed
    that soil water losses from leaching and runoff could be five times higher than
    the amount lost due to high temperature, which is related to the evapotranspiration
    process. Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Distribution of the parameters and incidence of their distribution
    in the model. Fig. 10 shows that the variations of the estimated parameters are
    distributed close to zero. This dispersion accounts for the expected variation
    that the parameters could present between irrigation periods. For example, in
    the case of rain, from Fig. 9, we have that the parameter associated ( ) is close
    to 0.11. From the standard deviation of , we can expect that this parameter could
    be different around in the next irrigation period. This uncertainty is reflected
    in the prediction of the soil moisture Eq. (16) and in the control action, which
    is taken based on that prediction. For that, the standard deviations of the variation
    of the parameters shown in Fig. 10 are used to add uncertainty and perform a realistic
    simulation in the presence of such uncertainty. The results of the controlled
    system are shown in Fig. 11, where we compare the system’s measured data with
    the expected data if the proposed algorithm is used to manage irrigation. Download

    between and is imperceptible. This is because the added normally distributed random
    data is filtered in the process stage. This is important because a similar result
    can be expected by using data from the corresponding weather forecasting services,
    highlighting the importance of the data processing stage in enhancing the algorithm’s
    robustness. On the other hand, it is observed that due to the processing stage,
    rain presents more sensitivity to the added random data. That is because, in the
    case of rain, the limitation to zero of the applied noise affects his distribution.

    irrigation actions (red) and recommended irrigation actions by our DSS. In Fig.
    11, we are also presenting the comparison between the measured soil moisture and
    the expected soil moisture if the grower uses the computed recommended irrigation
    . In the comparison, we included the desired soil moisture ( ), and we can observe
    how the controlled moisture tries to be around this value. It is important to
    mention that the computation of starts on January 02, when the first prediction
    data is available (see Fig. 7); before that, and are the same. The most notable
    difference between the irrigation scheduling given by the grower and the irrigation
    scheduling computed by the algorithm is that the algorithm does not generate saturated
    irrigation actions of 48 h. The algorithm aims to uphold an average irrigation
    duration of 10 h every two days. This duration fluctuates proportionally with
    forecasted temperature changes (as seen on January 18) and inversely in response
    to anticipated rain events (as evidenced on January 24). On the other hand, the
    decisions taken by the grower show that he is reacting to extreme events. For
    example, on January 18, the irrigation was turned off when the average soil moisture
    reached a maximum of 13.85% (percolation). Also, it is observed that the irrigation
    is turned on on February 01, when the soil moisture is close to reaching the allowable
    depletion point of 7.5%. In contrast, the controlled moisture is close to 9, avoiding
    the environmental impact of percolation and also avoiding the crop risk of reaching
    an allowable depletion point. However, it is important to mention that the decisions
    taken by the grower show expertise in dealing with this complex process on the
    most difficult type of soil (see Fig. 2), avoiding the allowable depletion point
    and maintaining the soil moisture close to the available water region. Fig. 12
    compares the cumulative irrigation hours applied by the grower with those used
    for the proposed algorithm. On February 09, the grower reported a total of 367
    h of irrigation, while the algorithm used a total of 258 h. This result demonstrates
    the potential of our algorithm to save 30% of the water typically used in seepage-irrigated
    crops in Florida. Notably, seepage irrigation systems are known for their low
    efficiency, often falling below 40% (Dukes et al., 2010). Despite this inefficiency,
    they remain prevalent in Florida. According to the current grower records (personal
    communication), a single hectare of seepage-irrigated sweet corn can consume around
    1500 m3 of water per season. Using this volume consumption as a baseline, our
    proposed algorithm has the capacity to increase water use efficiency up to 450
    m3 per hectare per season. This finding underscores the substantial water-saving
    potential of our DSS, highlighting its significance for sustainable agriculture
    if it is adopted in the state of Florida. Download : Download high-res image (176KB)

    of irrigation hours between the grower technique and the recommendations provided
    by the proposed decision support system. Our study demonstrates significant advancements
    in irrigation management, particularly in incorporating information from weather
    forecasting services to optimize irrigation scheduling. Our approach has shown
    reduced irrigation time in response to anticipated rainfall events. This predictive
    capability offers a distinct improvement over fully automated systems as those
    reported by Domínguez-Niño et al. (2020) and approaches that at the beginning
    of the season precalculate irrigation management based on crop models as reported
    by Hodges et al. (2022), where a consistent reduction in irrigation corresponding
    to rainfall is not evident. We also highlight that the proposed strategy integrates
    multiple information sources for optimal irrigation management based on soil moisture
    and water balance. This is an advancement over the traditional approach presented
    by El-Naggar et al. (2020), where the use of soil moisture sensors and soil water
    balances are seen as independent control techniques, which are compared to elucidate
    the most suitable irrigation practices. While the modernization of irrigation
    systems, as discussed by Çetin et al. (2023), is crucial for sustainable agriculture
    and water conservation, it often involves significant initial investments. This
    can be a major barrier in regions still reliant on traditional irrigation methods
    such as seepage. Our research addresses this challenge by demonstrating that substantial
    water savings can be achieved without full-scale modernization and automation
    of irrigation systems. Our study’s results highlight our approach’s environmental
    benefits, presenting it as a cost-effective alternative for enhancing the sustainability
    of irrigation practices in diverse agricultural settings. Future studies involve
    evaluating the algorithm across varied agricultural settings, encompassing different
    soil types, irrigation methods, different regions, and crops. This is crucial
    for assessing its adaptability and efficacy in water conservation. Concurrently,
    efforts will be directed towards integrating this adaptive decision support system
    (DSS) into accessible digital platforms such as smartphone applications and websites,
    simplifying irrigation decision-making for farmers. Enhancing the DSS algorithm
    will involve developing advanced modeling and estimation techniques to accurately
    estimate and forecast soil moisture dynamics under extreme environmental conditions,
    considering their random and complex nature. The enhancement also includes refining
    predictive models and automated control strategies for more precise irrigation
    scheduling. A key aspect is the creation of control algorithms with mixed objectives,
    such as minimizing irrigation while ensuring optimal crop yield. The implementation
    of Kalman filters and stochastic model predictive control techniques to manage
    forecast uncertainty must be explored. 5. Conclusions In this study, we introduced
    a technological solution to enhance the sustainability of water management in
    agriculture. We developed a decision support system algorithm for irrigation scheduling
    using principles from control theory. This algorithm encompasses modeling, processing,
    estimation, and control stages, ensuring the optimality of the model that describes
    the system. During the evaluation, the estimation stage achieved minimum correlation
    coefficients and values of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. The algorithm integrates
    the parametrized model, processed data, weather forecasting, and human limitations
    to conform an adaptive feedback plus feedforward irrigation predictive control
    strategy that considers human action in the control loop. The algorithm can consistently
    regulate soil moisture, ensuring it remains at desired levels. This approach reduced
    the risks associated with leaching and runoff and offered the potential for water
    savings of up to 30% in seepage irrigated crops on sandy soils. Looking forward,
    we plan to move towards end-user implementation to promote wider adoption and
    benefits of this technological solution. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: On-the-go soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) sensors are great
    tools for mapping and monitoring soil properties such as water content, texture,
    and salinity. ECa maps and surveys are most useful and reliable when obtained
    in uniformly wet fields. However, soil moisture in micro-irrigated (e.g., drip
    or micro-sprinklers) orchards is typically non-uniform, with moist soil along
    tree and irrigation lines, and dry soil between tree rows. We developed a mobile
    platform and data post-processing algorithm to facilitate geospatial ECa measurements
    along or near driplines. Gamma-ray (γ-ray) spectrometry is commonly used for clay
    content and type mapping. Fusion between ECa and γ-ray is often reported to increase
    the accuracy of field-scale soil maps. However, contrarily to ECa, γ-ray spectrometry
    is best suited for sensing soils in dry conditions. Micro-irrigated orchards are
    ideal environments for the combined application of these two sensor technologies.
    The fusion of topsoil (top 0.5 m) ECa (measured along the driplines) and γ-ray
    total counts (TC) (measured between the tree rows) data was tested at a 0.4-ha
    sandy loam citrus orchard in Southern California. Here, we discuss sensor data
    acquisition, data processing, sensor-directed sampling scheme delineation, and
    characterization of field-scale soil particle size fraction (0–0.4 m soil profile)
    spatial variability. Pearson correlation coefficients between sand and silt content
    with both ECa and TC were significant (p < 0.05). A principal component analysis
    biplot suggested strong positive relationship with TC and clay content. Backwards
    stepwise multiple linear regression predicted sand content using TC, elevation,
    and spatial coordinates as explanatory variables with mean absolute error (MAE)
    of 3.06 %. Silt content was predicted (MAE=1.55 %) using ECa, elevation, and spatial
    coordinates. The development of this platform enables better characterization
    of soil properties in micro-irrigated orchard systems using on-the-go sensing
    technology.

    in micro-irrigated orchards is presented. • ECa measurements are reliable along
    or near the driplines, where soil is moist. • The developed platform enables accurate
    ECa surveys along or near driplines. • Dry condition of soil in the orchard alleyways
    is optimal for gamma-ray sensing. • Gamma-ray and ECa data fusion was used to
    map soil texture in a micro-irrigated citrus orchard. Abstract On-the-go soil
    apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) sensors are great tools for mapping and

    conductivityGamma-raySoil sensingPrecision agriculture 1. Introduction High-resolution
    soil maps generated from near-ground soil sensing can be used to improve agricultural
    management, especially in precision agricultural operations (Viscarra Rossel et
    al., 2011). On-the-go measurements of soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa),
    either from electrical resistivity (ER) or electromagnetic induction (EMI) instruments,
    are among the most common sensor measurements used in agricultural applications
    (Corwin and Lesch, 2003, Corwin and Lesch, 2005b). Maps of a target soil property
    can be generated from geospatial ECa measurements if a correlation between ECa
    and the soil property can be established via laboratory analyses of ground-truth
    soil samples. As discussed in detail by Corwin and Lesch (2003) and Corwin and
    Lesch (2005b), ECa is influenced by a variety of soil properties, including water
    content, soil-solution electrical conductivity (i.e., soil salinity), porosity,
    temperature, and texture. In the soil, electricity can flow through the liquid,
    the solid, and the solid-liquid pathways (Rhoades et al., 1989). The influence
    of each pathway is determined by soil physical and chemical properties, making
    ECa measurements highly site-specific. According to Archie’s Law (Archie, 1942)
    and similar models (Rhoades et al., 1989, Rhoades et al., 1976), pore-water salinity
    (ECp), soil water content, and other soil-specific parameters all contribute to
    ECa: (1) where ϕ is the soil porosity, S is the relative saturation, and k, m,
    and n are fitting parameters that depend on soil texture, organic carbon content,
    and other physical and chemical properties (Allred et al., 2008, Scudiero et al.,
    2012). In dry soils, the liquid conductance pathways are broken, and consequently,
    a simple, universal calibration of Eq. (1) for a given soil is generally not possible,
    thus limiting the utility of Eq. (1) in practical correlation analysis and soil
    mapping. Lesch and Corwin (2008) argued that linear modeling (linear regression,
    kriging, regression kriging) is often adequate for generating soil maps from geospatial
    ECa measurements without resorting to the parameterization of Eq. (1). For this
    method to be reliable, it is recommended that EMI and ER surveys be conducted
    when the soil water content at the study site is greater than 70 % of field capacity
    throughout the field (Corwin and Lesch, 2003, Corwin and Lesch, 2005b). EMI and
    ER surveys in dry soil can result in ECa data of reduced practical value. For
    example, Pedrera-Parrilla et al. (2016) reported that the ECa correlation with
    clay content was twice as strong when EMI sensor measurements were carried out
    in wet soil conditions as compared to dry conditions. Other geospatial sensor
    data (e.g., visible, near-infrared, gamma-ray spectrometry) were used by researchers
    as stand-alone sensing solutions or for sensor-data fusion with ECa to characterize
    the spatial variability of soil and soil-plant relationships (Castrignanò et al.,
    2012, Corwin and Scudiero, 2019, Li et al., 2019, Scudiero et al., 2013). In particular,
    gamma-ray (γ-ray) spectrometers detect radiation emitted from the soil due to
    naturally occurring radioisotopes of elements such as Potassium, Cesium, Thorium,
    and Uranium. Geospatial γ-ray spectrometry has been used to generate highly accurate
    soil surface texture and clay mineralogy maps (Dierke and Werban, 2013, Heggemann
    et al., 2017, Minty, 1997, Petersen et al., 2012, Priori et al., 2014, Reinhardt
    and Herrmann, 2019, Viscarra-Rossel et al., 2007). The noteworthy paper by Heggemann
    et al. (2017) demonstrates how machine learning (i.e., support vector machines)
    can be used to calibrate γ-ray spectrometry data to highly accurate soil texture
    predictions using calibration data from multiple fields. Although γ-ray is typically
    used to map soil properties in soil surface (typically the first few centimeters),
    under certain conditions (e.g., dry soil with low bulk density), it may be used
    to map soil profiles as deep as 1 m (Reinhardt and Herrmann, 2019). Minty (1997)
    and Reinhardt and Herrmann (2019) reviewed the fundamentals of γ-ray spectrometry.
    Gamma-ray spectrometry is a viable candidate for data fusion with ECa because
    it provides information on soil texture and clay mineralogy, which can help improve
    the understanding of ECa measurements as described in Eq. (1) and discussed by
    Allred et al. (2008), Scudiero et al. (2012), and many other authors. Because
    γ-ray data mostly captures surface soil processes, it cannot be reliably used
    to map subsoil properties. On the other hand, ECa sensors typically provide a
    characterization of topsoil and subsoil simultaneously. Combining ECa data γ-ray
    spectrometry can generate soil maps with superior accuracy than when ECa alone
    is used (Castrignanò et al., 2012, Li et al., 2019). Castrignanò et al. (2012)
    combined EMI-ECa measurements with γ-ray spectrometry to characterize soil texture
    spatial variability at an 80-ha site in Western Australia. The slightly hilly
    site featured a variety of sandy soils and was prone to salinity in low-lying
    areas due to waterlogging. In such a complex site, Castrignanò et al. (2012) found
    that combining ECa and γ-ray spectrometry allowed for characterizing texture with
    higher accuracy than ECa alone. In that study, ECa and γ-ray spectrometry data
    fusion was necessary because salinity, water content, and texture were not collinear.
    Li et al. (2019) observed that the fusion of γ-ray and ECa data was optimal to
    create maps of exchangeable calcium and magnesium (which followed the spatial
    variability of soil classes) in a sugarcane field in Burdekin, Australia, compared
    to the use of a single sensor. Mahnkopp et al. (2018) combined geospatial ECa
    and γ-ray to improve the spatial characterization of apple replant disease (ARD)
    and provide novel insights into the nature of plant-disease-soil interconnections.
    1.1. ECa sensing in micro-irrigated orchards: recent advances, recommended standard
    operation procedures, and industry practices. In many arid and semi-arid regions
    such as California (Taylor and Zilberman, 2017, Tindula et al., 2013), water management
    in recent decades has shifted from flood and sprinkler irrigation towards micro-irrigation
    (e.g., micro-sprinklers, drip or “trickle”). Micro-irrigation is becoming prevalent
    also in orchards in more temperate areas. For example, the majority of pecan orchards
    planted after 2010 in Georgia (a state with a humid subtropical climate), USA,
    are equipped with drip or micro-sprinkler systems (Wells, 2014, Wells, 2017).
    Mapping soil spatial variability in micro-irrigated trees and vines, including
    texture and soil moisture, is often necessary to understand field-scale variability
    in crop yield and quality performance (Mann et al., 2011, Priori et al., 2013,
    Yu et al., 2020, Yu et al., 2021). Moreover, single and repeated (time-lapse)
    measurements of ECa (near the trees) can be used to understand soil-root relationships,
    tree root architecture, and root water uptake (Martínez et al., 2021, Vanella
    et al., 2018). Repeated ECa measurements with Electrical Resistivity Tomography
    along the drip lines were used by Vanella et al. (2022) to identify and monitor
    drip-irrigation wet bulbs and areas with likely clogged drip emitters in an almond
    orchard in California. Recent advances in micro-irrigation systems made site-specific
    (i.e., management-zone-based) irrigation possible (Bali and Culumber, 2018, Sanchez
    et al., 2017). Because of the opportunity to increase water use efficiency with
    site-specific irrigation (Sanchez et al., 2017), growers will likely increasingly
    rely on soil mapping services to characterize soil spatial variability and delineate
    management zones at their micro-irrigated orchards in the near-future. For many
    cropping and irrigation systems (e.g., flood, sprinkler) where ECa surveys are
    common, the variability of water within the soil volume influencing individual
    ECa readings is expected to be essentially one-dimensional, varying only in the
    vertical direction. In micro-irrigated orchards, that is not likely the case,
    even in the vicinity of driplines. Micro-irrigated sites are often characterized
    by large variations in soil moisture over short distances (Bresler, 1978). Water
    infiltration and redistribution around driplines depend on the site-specific irrigation
    system and soil factors, as described in detail by Skaggs et al. (2004, 2010).
    In orchards, where water emitters are generally located along the tree lines,
    the difference in soil water content near the trees and between tree rows can
    be considerable. Corwin and Lesch (2013) provided the first guidelines and protocols
    for ECa surveys and ECa-directed soil sampling for drip-irrigated vineyards and
    other drip-irrigated systems. They showed data from a drip-irrigated vineyard
    in Napa Valley, California, where in-row (i.e., along the driplines) ECa was around
    50 % higher than between-row (between driplines) ECa because of the difference
    in moisture. Corwin and Lesch (2013) recommended both in-row and between-row ECa
    measurement traverses, where ECa-directed soil sampling refers to the methodology
    developed by Corwin and Lesch, 2003, Corwin and Lesch, 2005b for mapping soil
    properties influencing the ECa measurement. In arid areas, between-row soil is
    generally too dry for ECa measurements to be reliably interpreted. In such dry
    conditions, measuring ECa along the driplines where the soil is wet due to irrigation
    is a viable option for obtaining trustworthy soil spatial variability information.
    Alternatively, one could take the in-row and between-row ECa measurements when
    the entire field is at field capacity following a substantial rainfall or series
    of rainfall events, which is, however, difficult to anticipate for ECa-survey
    planning purposes. Furthermore, in water-scarce environments, the most relevant
    ECa measurements with respect to crop yield are those ECa measurements taken where
    water is available to the crop throughout the growing season (i.e., along or near
    the driplines). Unfortunately, especially in orchards with trees with large and
    low canopies (e.g., almond, citrus, pistachio), it is impractical to expeditiously
    and safely measure ECa along or near the driplines with most of the equipment
    solutions currently used by private consultants, farmers, and scientists. Such
    commercially available ECa-sensing platforms are generally towed directly behind
    a field vehicle with collocated geolocation devices (i.e., the GPS receivers located
    above the sensor). Various commonly used ECa on-the-go sensors are discussed by
    many authors (Corwin and Scudiero, 2016, Sudduth et al., 2010). One solution devised
    to map ECa in orchard systems in which the space along the dripline is not easily
    accessible because of low and wide tree canopies is to use small (semi-) autonomous
    robots, such as the robot presented by Campbell et al. (2021). It should also
    be possible to retrofit current commercial systems to measure ECa in otherwise
    inaccessible in-row space, by towing the ECa sensors laterally or slantwise from
    a field vehicle driving between tree rows. In this research, we present such an
    application. An additional hurdle to consider when measuring on-the-go ECa (and
    other soil and plant sensors) is that dense tree canopies obscure satellite signals.
    Because of that, the geolocation accuracy of most GPS and GNSS devices is decreased,
    especially when on-the-go (dynamic) measurements are carried out (Edson and Wing,
    2012). Although methods exist to correct the position of static geolocation measurements
    under tree canopies, such as presented by Naesset and Jonmeister (2002), it is
    very hard to obtain accurate positioning in on-the-go conditions. Min et al. (2008)
    tested the accuracy of six commercially available GPS receivers in dynamic conditions
    in citrus orchards in Florida. Min et al. (2008) concluded that an unobstructed
    sky was the necessary condition to obtain accurate positioning information. Advanced
    positioning systems currently available from several manufacturers are accurate
    to the cm-scale even when placed in proximity to buildings and under trees. Note
    that the reported accuracies for such advanced (and very costly) systems are for
    static positioning applications. When such systems are not available to the soil
    scientist, the GPS/GNSS receiver should be placed away from the canopies of trees.
    The offset between a sensor dragged under tree canopies and the GPS/GNSS system
    placed on top of a field vehicle driving between the tree rows can be calculated
    by analyzing the direction vectors of multiple geospatial records and trigonometry.
    The above reviewed research combining ECa and γ-ray measurements to improve soil
    mapping did not discuss surveys in Mediterranean, semi-arid, arid micro-irrigated
    environments. The naturally dry conditions of soils in these climate are no ideal
    for reliable ECa measurements, but are ideal for γ-ray measurements (Reinhardt
    and Herrmann, 2019). Cook et al.''s (1996) rule of thumb indicates that a 1 %
    increase in volumetric soil moisture results in almost a 1 % reduction in the
    γ-ray emitted by the soil. In micro-irrigated orchards, soil in the alleyways
    is usually not irrigated. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that fusion of
    ECa measured along the driplines and γ-radiation measured in the alleyway should
    be a good means to accurately characterize soil spatial variability in these agricultural
    systems. The objectives of this research are to i) discuss the need for ECa measurements
    along the tree lines.; ii) describe a platform designed for ECa surveys along
    the driplines in micro-irrigated orchards; and iii) test the developed platform
    for concurrent ECa and γ-ray sensing to characterize spatial variability of soil
    particle size fraction. 2. Materials and methods Data from three field tests at
    two farm operations (Table 1) are presented to i) discuss the need for ECa measurements
    along the tree lines and ii) develop and test the presented soil sensing platform,
    and iii) map soil particle size fraction with the novel ECa platform and γ-ray
    spectrometry. Table 1. Description of the three experimental sites. Field USDA

    ECa on-the-go measurements in drip-irrigated soil profiles Following protocols
    for ECa-directed soil sampling by Corwin and Lesch (2013), a non-saline 60-ha
    drip-irrigated privately-owned pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) orchard (Site A) near
    Lost Hills, CA, USA (Fig. 1a) was surveyed in December 2012. Tree rows were approximately
    7 m apart. Along the rows, neighboring trees were about 5-m apart. We carried
    out a hand-held EMI survey with the EM38 Dual Dipole (Geonics Ltd., Mississauga,
    Ontario, Canada). The ECa measurements were taken in the horizontal (EMh-ECa)
    and vertical (EMv-ECa) dipole modes to provide ECa over the 0–0.75 and 0–1.5 m
    depth intervals, respectively. This survey was made to compare ECa measurements
    over wet and dry soil conditions analogously to Corwin and Lesch (2013) and Pedrera-Parrilla
    et al. (2016). ECa was surveyed in dry soil between the tree rows (BR) and wet
    soil along the dripline (AD). The two surveys were carried out by hand on two
    consecutive days. ECa was measured at 2051 locations in the BR survey and 1793
    locations in the AD survey. The BR surveys were carried out approximately 3 m
    away from the driplines, which were approximately 0.3 m away from the tree trunks
    (Fig. 1.b). The average distance between neighboring BR points was 7.5 m. The
    AD survey was carried out right next to the dripline. The average distance between
    neighboring AD points was 8.4 m. Two ECa-directed sampling schemes were generated
    using the Response Surface Sampling Design (Lesch, 2005) method consisting of
    12 soil sampling locations per ECa survey (Fig. 1a). Disturbed soil cores were
    sampled in 0.3 m increments down to 1.5 m. Soil samples were analyzed for gravimetric
    water content (WC, g g−1) at the time of sampling and saturation percentage (SP,
    %) following the methodology of Corwin and Yemoto (2017). SP is the ratio of water
    to soil in a saturated paste multiplied by 100 (U.S. Salinity Laboratory Staff,
    1954). SP correlates strongly with soil texture and can be used as a means of
    quantifying soil texture variability (Fulton, 2009, Stiven and Khan, 1966; U.S.
    Salinity Laboratory Staff, 1954). Download : Download high-res image (889KB) Download

    and procedures for site-specific adjustments To measure on-the-go soil properties
    over wet soil in micro-irrigated orchards, an all-terrain utility vehicle (model
    2014 Ranger 800EFI 6 ×6; Polaris Industries Inc., Medina, MN, USA) was fitted
    with a multi-sensor and power soil sampling system (Fig. 2). We will refer to
    this unit as the mobile platform. Download : Download high-res image (600KB) Download

    soil characterization in micro-irrigated orchards: a) rear view showing the heavy-duty
    non-conductive sled housing an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor; b) picture
    from above the sled depicting the EMI set-up with the CMD Mini Explorer 6 L with
    the CMD-C controller (during operation, the controller is located in the driver
    cabin and connected to the sensor with a 10-m cable), which connects via Bluetooth
    with the Trimble R2 integrated GNSS system (or another geolocation device), located
    on top of the driver’s cabin; and c) front view showing the gamma-ray detector
    placed on a front cargo basket and connected to a spectrometer, laptop, and deep
    cycle battery, which are located in the driver cabin of the all-terrain vehicle.
    The mobile platform consists of: i) a heavy-duty plastic sled (Trek 75; Pelican
    International Inc., Laval, QC, Canada) carrying the CMD Mini Explorer 6 L or ME6L
    (GF Instruments, S.R.O.; Brno, Czech Republic) or the EM38-DD. Other EMI instruments,
    up to 1.9-m long, can also be used with the set-up in Fig. 2. The sled is dragged
    by a rope attached to a retracting hardwood plank that is mounted on the ATV’s
    rear tow-hitch and can be extended laterally (sled offset range 0–4 m away from
    the ATV center) and vertically (0.3–0.6 m above ground); ii) a cargo basket mounted
    on the front hitch of the ATV supports the RSX-1 detector for the RS-701 γ-ray
    spectrometer (Radiation Solutions Inc.; Mississauga, ON, Canada); and iii) a 9100
    ATV power soil sampler (AMS, Inc.; American Falls, ID, USA). In Fig. 2, the ME6L
    is secured with non-static Velcro to a bed of non-static foam inside the plastic
    sled. The ME6L is equipped with six EMI receivers, allowing for simultaneous ECa
    measurement over six depth layers. The sensor can be oriented horizontally (ME6L-EMh)
    or vertically (ME6L-Emv). The nominal depth ranges in the ME6L-Emh configuration
    are: 0.15, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.1 m. The ranges in the ME6L-Emv configuration
    are: 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.3 m. Using a 10-m long 5-pin DIN connector
    cable, the ME6L is connected to the controller and data logging unit (CMD/C) which
    is in the driver cabin during operation. The CMD/C sits in the sled and is connected
    via Bluetooth (2.4 GHz) to an R2 Integrated GNSS System (Trimble, Inc.; Sunnyvale,
    CA, USA) which measures spatial coordinates with a horizontal and vertical maximum
    precision of 0.07 m when using the Trimble CenterPoint RTX (Chen et al., 2011).
    An equivalent set-up is used for the EM38-DD paired with a Trimble Pro-XRT 2 (sub-meter
    geolocation accuracy) for data logging. The Trimble R2 is mounted on the center
    of the roof of the ATV driving cabin to minimize the GNSS signal interference
    from tree canopies. Before analyzing sensor data, it is necessary to correct the
    coordinate offsets that exist between the GNSS antenna and the sensor, which is
    positioned behind and to the side of the antenna, near the tree line. It is relatively
    straightforward to calculate sensor X and Y coordinates from GNSS X and Y coordinates
    given a platform’s fixed sensor offsets and the heading direction of the mobile
    platform at the time of each measurement. The challenge in developing an automated
    data post-processing procedure is that headings are not available, only GNSS coordinates.
    It is therefore necessary to infer the platform heading at each GNSS coordinate,
    which complicates automated data processing considerably. We developed a general-purpose
    Python module for correcting GNSS coordinates for sensor offsets, which is available
    at https://github.com/usda-ars-ussl/sensoff/ and detailed in Appendix A. The RS-701
    γ-ray spectrometer is placed on a wooden board on the passenger seat. The radiometer
    uses an RSX-1 detector (i.e., a four-liter thallium-doped sodium iodide scintillator),
    which is located on a cargo basket in front of the vehicle. A deep-cycle battery
    that powers the RS-701 is also placed in the driver cabin of the ATV. A GPS (the
    RS-701 integrated internal GPS or, e.g., Trimble Pro-XRT 2 with disc antenna)
    receiver placed on top of the ATV cabin and connected to the RS-701 with a SubMiniature
    Version A connector cable. An Ethernet cable connects the RS-701 to a laptop computer
    (Toughbook CF-30, Panasonic corporation, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in which georeferenced
    γ-ray data are logged with the RadAssist v6.2.3.0 software (Radiation Solutions).
    The 9100 ATV power soil sampler can be used for shallow direct push or for hammering
    (122-N-m hydraulic hammer) soil coring. 2.2.1. Testing (site-specific) optimal
    distance of EMI sensors to ATV Proximity to conductive material influences EMI
    sensor measurements (Corwin and Lesch, 2005b). The minimum lateral distance from
    the ATV needed to obtain unbiased EMI measurements was tested for the EM38-EMv
    in August 2019, and the ME6L-EMv in October 2019, at a bare soil plot (Site B)
    at the University of California Riverside Agricultural Experimental Station (Riverside,
    CA, USA). The US National Cooperative Soil Survey classifies the soil at Site
    B as Monserate sandy loam. For both tests, a 20-m long drip-irrigation line with
    0.30 m emitter spacing was set up on a flat soil surface. The soil was irrigated
    abundantly twice using non-saline water (electrical conductivity ∼ 0.5 dS m−1)
    before each EMI test. Between the two tests, the soil was bare and non-irrigated.
    Approximately 48 h after the last irrigation cycle, EMI measurements were recorded
    at the dripline with the ATV idling at 1.8, 2.1, 2.4, 2.7, 3.0, and at least 10 m
    away (i.e., control) from the sensors. The measurements were replicated at ten
    locations along the dripline. All measurements were taken within 20 min. The experiments
    were carried out in the middle of the day to ensure minimal soil temperature changes.
    The EMI sensors were covered with a blanket to minimize sensor temperature fluctuations
    (Robinson et al., 2004). After the EM38-Emv test was carried out in August 2019,
    the soil was sampled at two locations along the dripline at the 0–0.4, 0.4–0.8,
    and 0.8–1.2 m depths. Laboratory analyses included SP, WC, saturated paste electrical
    conductivity (ECe) and pH (Corwin and Yemoto, 2017), and particle size determination
    using the hydrometer method (Gee and Bauder, 1986). To evaluate differences between
    EMI measurements with and without (i.e., control) the presence of the ATV, a paired
    sample t-test was carried out. Significant (p < 0.05) t-tests are an indication
    of the likely influence of the ATV metal body on the EMI measurements. The paired
    sample t-tests were carried out using Excel 2019′s Data Analysis tools (Microsoft
    Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA). 2.3. Estimation of particle size fraction
    using ECa and TC To illustrate the use of the mobile platform, a 0.4-ha navel
    orange (Citrus sinensis L.) orchard (Site C) was first surveyed in August 2019.
    Site C (Fig. 3) was less than 200 m away from Site B. Site B and C share the same
    soil type (Monserate sandy loam) according to the US National Cooperative Soil
    Survey. Using the mobile platform, at a speed slower than 5 miles per hour (8 km
    per hour or 2.2 m s−1), γ-ray spectrometry total counts (TC, counts per second
    or cps, ranging from 0.4 to 2.81 MeV) and ECa for the 0–1.5 m soil profile 2 (hereafter
    EMv-ECa, dS m−1), with the EM38 in the vertical mode, were measured at the site.

    the University of California, Riverside Agricultural Experimental Station, Riverside,
    California. Subfigure a) shows the recorded and shifted locations of the apparent
    electrical conductivity (ECa) taken with the EM38 sensor in the vertical (EMv)
    mode. Subfigure b) shows the gamma-ray sensor survey, a total count map, and the
    estimated total count values at locations with available EM38 measurements. Subfigure

    Subfigure d) shows box plots comparing minimum, maximum, and 25th, 50th, and 75th
    percentiles for the population (entire survey) and sample (RSSD locations) of
    ECa and gamma-ray total counts. The EM38 sensor was about 2.7 m away from the
    ATV during the survey. The EMv-ECa survey consisted of 244 measurements along
    the irrigation driplines, located under the orange trees. The average distance
    between neighboring ECa measurements was 2.4 m. The GPS recorded coordinates were
    corrected to actual EM38 sensor coordinates (Fig. 3a) following the procedure
    described in section “Appendix A”. The γ-ray spectrometry survey comprised 1563
    measurements. The average distance between neighboring γ-ray measurements was
    0.4 m. On-the-go γ-ray sensor measurements are usually characterized by a high
    signal-to-noise ratio (Minty, 1997, Viscarra-Rossel et al., 2007). Spatial interpolation
    was used to reduce the noise from the γ-ray survey data. The TC data were interpolated
    using simple kriging with the Geostatistical Analyst toolbox in ArcMap 10.5.1
    (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). The kriging interpolation was carried out on Normal
    Score transformed data, with a first-order trend removal, based on exponential
    semivariogram models. The semivariogram coefficients (nugget= 36 %, partial sill=
    64 %, and range = 39.2 m) were selected using the Optimize Model tool in Geostatistical
    Analyst. The quality of the interpolation was assessed with leave-one-out cross-validation
    (R2 =0.75). The interpolation was exported to a raster with 2 × 2-m block support.
    TC estimations located with the EMv-ECa measurements were then extracted from
    the TC map. Subsequently, the Response Surface Sampling Design (RSSD) package
    in ESAP (Lesch et al., 2000) was used to identify 20 sampling locations. The RSSD
    package selects sampling sites that best represent the frequency statistics of
    the ancillary geospatial sensor data (i.e., EMv-ECa and TC) and, at the same time,
    spaces the sampling locations as far apart as possible to decrease spatial autocorrelation
    between sampling points. Sensor-directed RSSD strategy is described in detail
    by Lesch et al. (1995) and Lesch (2005). The sampling scheme was evaluated by
    comparing EMv-ECa and TC of the selected locations (i.e., the sample) with the
    entire dataset (i.e., the population) using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Two-Sample
    Test in STATISTICA (version 12, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). To demonstrate
    the use of ECa and γ-ray data fusion to create soil maps in micro-irrigated orchards,
    Site C was surveyed again in October 2021 with the ME6L-Emh paired with a Trimble
    R2 GNSS receiver with a Trimble CenterPoint RTX correction. The ECa survey was
    carried out following the recommendations of Corwin and Lesch (2005b). The survey
    was carried out 2 days after an irrigation event. The sled containing the sensor
    was dragged 3.9 m behind and 3.5 m to the right of the GNSS receiver. These measurements
    were used to shift the coordinates measured by the GNSS to the location of the
    ME6L sensor. ECa maps (1 ×1 m resolution) for the six ME6L-Emh layers were generated
    using the default settings for simple kriging in the Geostatistical Analyst toolbox
    in ArcMap 10.5.1. The simple kriging models had low cross-validation (leave-one-out)
    root mean square errors: 0.010 (Layer 1), 0.015 (Layer 2), 0.018 (Layer 3), 0.018
    (Layer 4), 0.019 (Layer 5), 0.017 (Layer 6) dS m−1. On the same day of the ECa
    survey (October 12), soil cores were collected for the 0–0.4 m soil profile at
    the 20 locations identified in August 2019 (Fig. 3.c). The composite 0–0.4-m soil
    samples were dried and sieved at 2 mm and analyzed for particle size fraction
    (sand, silt, and clay contents) using the hydrometer method. The ME6L-Emh measurements
    for the 0–0.15, 0.25, 0.4, and 0.5 m were tested as predictors for soil texture.
    Additional geospatial predictors that were tested were: latitudinal and longitudinal
    WGS84 UTM 11 N projected coordinates, elevation, and the TC measured at the site
    in August 2019. The Pearson correlations between the measured values of sand,
    silt, and clay contents and available geospatial predictors were investigated.
    Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to visually assess similarities
    and differences between the particle size fraction data and the available geospatial
    predictors (Abdi and Williams, 2010). Subsequently, using a backward stepwise
    procedure, multiple linear regressions to predict sand and silt contents were
    developed according to Lesch and Corwin (2008). In the regressions, TC and ECa
    sensor data and geographical coordinates (i.e., to represent potential spatial
    trends) were used as explanatory variables. The above statistical analyses were
    carried out in STATISTICA. Clay content was estimated as 100 – sand content –
    silt content. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Water content small scale spatial
    variability in drip-irrigated soil profiles At Site A, the BR survey had average
    EMv-ECa of 0.33 dS m−1 (standard deviation or SD = 0.07 dS m−1) and average EMh-ECa
    of 0.24 dS m−1 (standard deviation or SD = 0.05 dS m−1). The AD survey had average
    EMv-ECa of 0.33 dS m−1 (standard deviation or SD = 0.09 dS m−1) and average EMh-ECa
    of 0.22 dS m−1 (standard deviation or SD = 0.09 dS m−1). Fig. 1.c shows the differences
    in water content, by depth interval, for the BR and AD sampling schemes at the
    pistachio orchard site (Site A). Near the soil surface, water content was greater
    at AD locations than at BR ones. The differences in water content between BR and
    AD locations decreased with increasing depth. As we detail below, saturation percentage
    was very similar through all soil profiles, indicating that the increasing similarity
    in observed WC with depth was not due to contrasting soil texture but to water
    redistribution from the irrigated AD locations toward the BR locations. For the
    BR ECa survey, no significant (p < 0.05) Pearson correlation coefficients (r)
    were observed between WC and EMv-ECa. For EMh-ECa, significant correlations with
    WC were observed only for the 0–0.3 (r = 0.65), 0.3–0.6 (r = 0.72), and 0.9–1.2
    (r = 0.67) m depth increments. For the AD ECa dataset, significant Pearson correlations
    were observed for WC at all depth intervals with both EMh-ECa and EMv-ECa. The
    r values for these relationships averaged 0.80 (minimum = 0.65, maximum = 0.93).
    Saturation percentage values were practically the same at BR and AD locations
    (Fig. 1.d). For the BR-ECa survey, correlations between SP and ECa were mostly
    non-significant. Significant r values were observed for EMv-ECa at 0.9–1.2 (r = 0.61)
    m; and for EMh-ECa at 0.3–0.6 (r = 0.65) and 0.9–1.2 (r = 0.77) m. For the AD-ECa
    significant r were observed between EMv-ECa and SP at 0.3–0.6 (r = 0.59) m; and
    between EMh-ECa and SP at 0–0.3 (r = 0.62) and 0.3–0.6 (r = 0.58) m. Soil moisture
    variability in micro-irrigated orchards can be very dramatic in the short scale
    because of a complex mix of factors (Polak and Wallach, 2001), including, local
    soil properties, irrigation type and wetting regime, and water demand (i.e., potential
    evapotranspiration). Martínez et al. (2021) studied soil moisture variability
    in the proximity of olive trees in southern Spain. They concluded that, because
    of the high short-scale variability in these systems, sensors such as EMI should
    be able to accurately describe the overall moisture levels close to a tree because
    of the sensor’s larger footprint in comparison to in situ fixed sensors such as
    time-domain reflectometry or capacitance sensors. In micro-irrigated almond orchards
    located in California, Vanella et al. (2022) found that the majority of root water
    uptake activity happened in the upper 0.5 m of the soil profile in the areas where
    the soil was wetted by the micro-irrigated systems. This indicates that soil moisture
    should be measured close to the driplines in order to understand soil water dynamics
    in such agricultural systems. It is important to note that such need conflicts,
    however, with operational safety. Indeed injuries (e.g., eye injuries) from contact
    with tree branches and thorns are a serious concern for the agricultural workforce
    (Lacey et al., 2007). 3.2. Mobile platform site-specific setup: determining the
    optimal placement of EMI sensors The soil samples from the test area (Site B)
    were all classified as sandy-loam. The information from the soil sampled at Site
    B is reported in Table 2. Table 2. Sand, silt, clay, and gravimetric water content
    information from the 0–0.4 m soil samples collected at Sites B and C at the Agricultural
    Experimental Station of the University of California, Riverside. Empty Cell Site

    The average control ECa for the EM38-EMv was 0.33 dS m−1 (standard deviation =
    0.05 dS m−1). The paired sample t-tests indicated significantly different ECa
    measurements when the ATV was at 1.8, 2.1, and 2.4 m away from the EM38-EMv. The
    average difference in ECa between control and with-ATV measurements in significant
    paired sample t-tests was − 0.04dS m−1. Following the results of this field test,
    the EM38-EMv has been placed at least 2.7 m away from the ATV when operating the
    mobile platform. The average control ECa measurements for the ME6L-EMv were 0.17
    (Layer 1; standard deviation = 0.03 dS m−1), 0.22 (Layer 2; standard deviation
    = 0.02 0 S m−1), 0.27 (Layer 3; standard deviation = 0.03 dS m−1), 0.25 (Layer
    4; standard deviation = 0.02 dS m−1), 0.21 (Layer 5, standard deviation = 0.02
    dS m−1), and 0.18 dS m−1 (Layer 6, standard deviation = 0.02 dS m−1). The paired
    sample t-tests returned non-significant differences for all Layer 1 measurements;
    significant differences for Layers 2, 4, 5, and 6 when the ATV was at or closer
    than 2.7 m from the ME6L-EMv; and significant differences for Layer 3 when the
    ATV was at or closer than 2.4 m from the ME6L-EMv. Subsequent to this field test,
    the ME6L-EMv has been placed at least 3 m away from the ATV when operating the
    mobile platform. It is important to notice that these tests were conducted to
    set up the mobile platform for EM38 and ME6L vertical measurements. With different
    coil configuration and/or different soil types, the results of the tests are likely
    to be different. At any new site, analogous soil tests can be rapidly carried
    out to calculate the optimal distance of the EMI sensor from the ATV. Because
    the sensor offset is likely site-specific, the side arm on the mobile platform
    presented here is retractable (Fig. 2a), allowing for senor-to-vehicle offsets
    up to 4 m. Once the minimum offset distance between the EMI sensor and the field
    vehicle is determined, a decision on EMI sensor placement (i.e., distance from
    the water emitter) and timing of the survey (e.g., hours after irrigation event)
    should be made. This determination may be the case that areas with moist soil
    are easily identifiable via visual inspection and by “feel and appearance of the
    soil” from some exploratory soil cores. Alternatively, if the irrigation schedule
    and rate are known and information about the soil physical properties are available,
    then numerical simulations of wetting dynamics can provide guidance on ECa sensor
    placement and timing of the survey. The distance and timing would depend on several
    factors, including soil type, soil management, irrigation type, scheduling, time
    after an irrigation event, evapotranspiration, and water quality. We repeated
    the methods detailed by Skaggs et al., 2004, Skaggs et al., 2010 with HYDRUS-2D
    to identify soil with moisture exceeding 70 % of field capacity in the 0–0.4 m
    profile. For the soil at our study sites at the Agricultural Experimental Station
    of the University of California, Riverside (Table 2) and with several water application
    scenarios (20–60 liter per meter per irrigation) with subsurface drip, sufficiently
    moist soil was only expected to be at 0.5 m away (or closer) to the dripline.
    After running HYDRUS-2D or similar simulations, the ECa survey operator may add
    the distance of the dripline from the tree (e.g., typically 0.3–0.6 m in many
    applications in California) to the modeling outputs to identify the proper offset
    of the EMI sensor from the tree lines at the University of California, Riverside
    sites. Other commonly used micro-irrigation systems, such as surface drip tape,
    above-ground drip emitter, micro-sprinkler (fanjet) (Gärdenäs et al., 2005) and
    field practices (e.g., raised beds) (Holt et al., 2019) can also be modeled to
    identify the size of the area below the trees with sufficient moisture for reliable
    ECa surveys. It is worth noting that the soil at Site B (and at the other sites
    discussed here) were non saline. Additional considerations on sensor placement
    are in order when conducting EMI surveys in salt-affected micro irrigated orchards.
    Hanson and Bendixen (1995) showed that drip irrigation created a localized wetting
    pattern characterized by both vertical and lateral flows, in which salts were
    transported away from the wetting source and mainly accumulated at the fringe
    of the wetted zone. Berezniak et al. (2018) and Yang et al. (2019) also discussed
    salt distribution in micro-irrigated soils more recently. Characterizing the spatial
    variability of soil salinity and water content in salt-affected micro-irrigated
    systems using EMI is challenging (Burt and Isbell, 2005). Corwin et al. (2022)
    and Bughici et al. (2022) discuss EMI sensor placement and field protocols for
    conducting soil salinity surveys with EMI in micro-irrigated farmland. 3.3. Estimation
    of particle size fraction using ECa and TC Fig. 3 shows the EM38-EMv and γ-ray
    sensor measurements obtained by the mobile platform at the navel orange test site
    (Site C). Fig. 3.a depicts recorded and shifted coordinates for all ECa measurements.
    Soil ECa ranged between 0.31 and 1.44 dS m−1. All values above 0.61 dS m−1 were
    observed in the second row to the west of the orchard. A buried irrigation water
    pipe runs along that tree row, which is likely the reason for the outlying ECa
    measurements. The ECa data for that tree row were removed from further analyses
    (Fig. 3.c), resulting in a dataset ranging between 0.31 and 0.52 dS m−1, with
    average = 0.41 dS m−1, and standard deviation = 0.04 dS m−1. The γ-ray TC measurements
    ranged between 3051.4 and 3780.2 cps, with average = 3447.6 cps and standard deviation
    = 139.5 cps. The TC data were spatially interpolated into a 2 × 2-m grid (Fig.
    3.b) and extracted at the EM38-EMv measurement locations to obtain collocated
    ECa and TC data (Fig. 3.b). The collocated multi-sensor dataset had TC ranging
    between 3217.8 and 3635.8 cps, and averaging 3483.8 cps (standard deviation =
    96.4 cps). The collocated TC and EMv-ECa data (Fig. 3.c) did not show a significant
    Pearson correlation, which was likely an indication that distinct soil spatial
    patterns were being sensed by the two sensors. This was possibly due to the differences
    in depth of investigation between the two sensors: the soil at site C is classified
    by the US National Cooperative Soil Survey in the Monserate series, with topsoil
    (0–0.25 m) in the sandy loam class and subsoil (0.25–0.71 m) in the sandy clay
    loam texture class. The collocated multi-sensor dataset was used to select a subsample
    of 20 locations (Fig. 3.c). These locations had an average ECa of 0.41 dS m−1
    (standard deviation = 0.05 dS m−1) and an average TC of 3477.3 cps (standard deviation
    = 93.5 cps) (Fig. 3.d). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Two-Sample Test indicated that
    the ECa and TC values from the 20 selected locations were not significantly different
    (p > 0.05) from those of the entire collocated multi-sensor dataset. The particle
    size fraction information from Site C is reported in Table 2. At the 20 soil sampling
    locations, the ECa from the ME6L-EMh measurements for the 0–0.15, 0.25, 0.4, and
    0.5 m had an average (standard deviation) of 0.07 (0.02), 0.11 (0.3), 0.18 (0.3),
    and 0.22 (0.04) dS m−1, respectively. Site C is located on a gentle slope, the
    average elevation at the 20 locations was 351.8 m above average sea level with
    a standard deviation of 1.3 m. The average (standard deviation) Easting was 470,514.7
    (23.5) m and Northing 3,759,139.0 (19.8) m. As reported in Table 3, ECa showed
    a negative correlation with sand content, which is expected based on previously
    reported research and soil ECa theory (Corwin and Lesch, 2005a, Friedman, 2005).
    TC also showed a negative correlation with sand content. Similar relationships
    were reported for soils in Australia (Viscarra-Rossel et al., 2007), Germany (Heggemann
    et al., 2017), and Italy (Priori et al., 2014). Silt showed significant positive
    Pearson correlation coefficients with ECa and TC. Pearson correlation coefficients
    between sensors and other geospatial predictors were non-significant, although
    the biplot (Fig. 4.a) for the PCA on the dataset clustered clay content and TC
    in both Factor 1 (which explained 49.0 % of the dataset variance) and Factor 2
    (which explained 20.2 % of the dataset variance). Table 3. Pearson correlation

    at Site C. b) the observed vs. estimated relationships for sand, silt, and clay
    contents. Sand content was estimated using Eq. (2). Silt content was estimated
    using Eq. (3). Clay content was estimated as 100 % - sand % - silt %. The use
    of ECa (best prediction was using ECa values for the 0–0.5 m depth) predicted
    sand content with a Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.31 and a Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE) = 3.88 % and silt content with R2 = 0.35 and MAE = 2.37 %. Equations
    [2] and [3] show how higher goodness-of-fit was achieved when TC and other geospatial
    predictors were used together in addition to the ECa data. The backward-stepwise
    multiple linear regressions to estimate sand content: (2) employed TC, elevation,
    and easting coordinates as predictors. The regression had R2 = 0.56 and MAE = 3.06
    %. The regression was significant at p < 0.01 and had independent residuals. The
    model to estimate silt content: (3) used ECa for the 0–0.4 and 0–0.5 m layers,
    elevation, and easting and northing coordinates as explanatory variables. The
    regression’s R2 was 0.72 and MAE was 1.55 %. The regression was significant at
    p < 0.01 and had independent residuals. Fig. 4.b shows the observed vs. estimated
    relationships for sand, silt, and clay content. Clay content was estimated as
    100 % - sand % - silt %. The observed vs. predicted clay content relationship
    was not significant, yet it had a fairly low MAE (2.33 %). According to the backward
    stepwise multiple regression approach used in this study, TC was a better predictor
    than ECa for sand content whereas the contrary was true for silt content. The
    use of one sensor measurements over the other (ECa vs. TC) resulted in more accurate
    soil mapping models than if a single sensor was available. Nonetheless, both ECa
    and TC were significantly correlated with sand and silt content. In non-salt-affected
    soils, both TC and ECa are expected to be good predictors for soil texture spatial
    variability. These results indicated that the ECa measurements obtained with the
    proposed mobile platform were accurate. Correlations with deeper soil physical
    properties may not be viable with the γ-ray surface soil measurements, whereas
    they are possible with most ECa sensors, as they have deeper sensing abilities
    (e.g., 0–1.5 m). The benefits of concurrent use of ECa and γ-ray observed in this
    research echoed what was reported by others (Rodrigues et al., 2015). Examples
    and discussion of the use of these on-the-go techniques in orchards are limited
    (Caruso et al., 2022, Mahnkopp et al., 2018), especially when dealing with micro-irrigated
    orchards in arid and semi-arid environments. The results from this study indicate
    that γ-ray may be a useful addition to the more commonly used ECa. However, evaluation
    of this tool in a more comprehensive setting (e.g., over several fields and soil
    types), is needed to comprehensively understand the performance of γ-ray for soil
    mapping (Heggemann et al., 2017, Rodrigues et al., 2015). 4. Conclusions Theoretical
    understanding of ECa measurements, experimental ECa data, and soil wetting patterns
    in non-saline micro-irrigated orchards all indicate that ECa surveys in micro-irrigated
    orchards should be carried out along or near the dripline, where the soil is sufficiently
    moist across the entire sensed soil profile (e.g., 0–1.5 m). On the other hand,
    dry soil is the ideal condition for γ-ray spectrometry. Micro-irrigated orchards
    are, therefore, ideal environments for data fusion from these two sensor technologies.
    The novel mobile multi-sensor platform enables new opportunities to increase our
    understanding of i) geospatial measurements of ECa in soils characterized by high
    short-range variability of water content; ii) the use of ECa to better quantify
    tree-root zone water content; and iii) the potential use of ECa and γ-ray data
    fusion for spatial assessment of water content, texture, and other soil properties.

    The GNSS (or GPS) on an on-the-go platform records its position coordinates (xg,
    yg) each time a sensor reading is taken. When a sensor is offset from the GNSS
    antenna on the on-the-go platform, it is necessary to calculate the corresponding
    sensor position coordinates (xs, ys) for each reading before analyzing sensor
    data. The situation is illustrated in Figs. A1a and A1b, where a sensor is offset
    from the GNSS by a lateral distance A and inline distance B. Download : Download

    of an on-the-go platform with the sensor offset from the GNSS/GPS antenna by fixed
    lateral and inline distances A and B, respectively . If the platform heading (direction
    of travel in GNSS coordinates) is known at the time of each reading, the sensor
    coordinates can be calculated as: (A1a) (A1b) where , , and α is the platform
    heading expressed as a standard position trigonometric angle relative to the GNSS
    coordinate x-axis, positive counterclockwise, (Figs. A1a,c). The two-argument
    arctan function is a “quadrant aware” computation of , returning β as a standard
    trigonometric angle relative to the positive B-axis, positive counterclockwise,
    (Figs. A1a,b). The challenge in developing an automated data post-processing procedure
    is that the headings are generally not available, only GNSS coordinates. It is
    therefore necessary to infer the platform heading at each GNSS coordinate. We
    developed a general-purpose Python module called “sensoff” for correcting GNSS
    coordinates for sensor offsets. The module is available from the Python Package
    Index (PyPI) repository (https://pypi.org/project/sensoff) and also on github
    (https://github.com/usda-ars-ussl/sensoff). The sensoff code estimates the platform
    heading at each coordinate based on the bearings of the prior and subsequent legs
    of the transect, weighting the two legs according to their relative length. Specifically,
    the heading angle α at the ith GNSS coordinate ( , is estimated as: (A2) where,
    (A3a,b) (A4a,b) (A5a,b) (A6a,b) and where if and otherwise. The latter adjustment
    to ensures the calculated average splits the acute angle formed by the terminal
    sides of the bearing angles and . Note in Eq. (A2) the bearing angles are weighted
    in proportion to the length of the other leg, so shorter legs are given more weight.

  description: As communication technologies and equipment evolve, smart assets become
    smarter. The agricultural industry is also evolving in line with the implementation
    of modern communication protocols, intelligent sensors, and equipment. This evolution
    is enabling large-scale agricultural production processes to operate independently,
    thus, securing the food supply chain for an ever-growing population. Data processing
    for such a system with multiple heterogeneous sources requires proper management
    for effective agricultural operations. Recognizing the advantages of Machine Learning(ML)
    in performing large-scale data processing, researchers are investigating the implementation
    of ML to design an effective intelligent agricultural architecture. The aim of
    this paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the state-of-the-art in smart
    agriculture, open challenges, and guidelines for the development of further enhanced
    smart agriculture systems. Specifically, we describe how ML is used to create
    intelligent agricultural systems supported by state-of-the-art technology.

    Metrics Impact Statement: The Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture has the
    potential to completely transform the industry by enabling more streamlined and
    effective operations. Sensors based on the Internet of Things (IoT), such as temperature
    sensors, light sensors, pressure sensors, moisture sensors, and others enable
    the automation and simplification of a wide range of trustworthy user-oriented
    information, such as high-quality data, documented vulnerabilities, and appropriate
    measurement using artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence of things
    (AIoT) aims to improve data management and analytics while increasing the efficiency
    of IoT operations. Furthermore, smart agriculture operations necessitate a solid
    understanding of local weather conditions, soil quality, crop monitoring, and
    preventive measures. The paper highlights recent research (2019-2023) on machine
    learning approaches (a subset of AI approaches)) and their prospective applications
    in smart agriculture. The article serves a numbe... Abstract: As communication

  description: 'Precision Agriculture: Evolution, Insights and Emerging Trends presents
    a complete guide from foundational concepts to the economic, commercial and environmental
    implications of the approach. Showcasing recent research improvements, future
    trends, and highlighting innovative use of machine vision, artificial intelligence,
    UAVs, drones, IoT and data analytics to promote sustainable agriculture, the book
    brings the reader up-to-date with understanding and implementing this targeted
    practice. From the basic elements of agronomy to insights on reflectance and remote
    sensing indices, chapters use summary abstracts, case studies and real-world examples
    of implementing the tools of precision agriculture (PA) to demonstrate the latest
    advances. It includes explanations on the origin of the intra-plot variability
    of a culture (spatial and temporal), different types of existing sensors, controllers
    and site-specific management. The book further explores yield monitoring, weed,
    disease and pest control, automated irrigation systems, PA tools for variable
    rate application of inputs within the field, and data processing methods. By also
    exploring the economic profitability of precision farming approaches, and its
    utility for sustainable agriculture, Precision Agriculture: Evolution, Insights
    and Emerging Trends is a truly comprehensive view of this important approach to
    improving global agriculture production. Scientists, researchers, policymakers,
    graduate and postgraduate students, and engineers in the related fields of agriculture,
    computer science and engineering will benefit from this book.'

    paper PDF 1 Introduction Unlike conventional distributed datastore, blockchain
    technology provides advanced cryptographic techniques and emerging tools to store
    and access smart agricultural data that are shared with several untrusted users.
    Blockchain technology solves a number of data integrity issues caused by following
    untrusted operations: 1. single point failure in a supply chain centralized database,
    2. lack of data integrity due to the regular use of smart agricultural management,
    3. hackers can access and modify sensitive data, and 4. third-party assistance
    for providing security. The blockchain technology is applied on smart agriculture
    system to achieve ecosystem of agricultural services. Blockchain-based precision
    agricultural system provides secured environment for storing, exchanging, and
    retrieving confidential data between the several farmers and other persons. The
    integration of smart accuracy agriculture, edge computing, IoT, and blockchain
    technology allows the agricultural environment system to reduce the wastage of
    natural resources and increase the profit. With the new development of edge computing
    and blockchain technology, a precision agricultural system produces more profit
    by increasing crop and food productivity and reducing usage of natural resources.
    In the agricultural land, several sensors and devices are used to capture the
    environmental data and land-related data and these data are transferred to the
    data server in the cloud environment. Edge computing plays an important role to
    reduce the workload of cloud data server and minimize the volume of data moved
    to the data server. Instead of transferring data to the cloud data server, edge
    computing nodes perform the operation locally which is closer to the IoT devices
    in agricultural environment. The edge computing node provides necessary information
    to the farmers, agriculture officers, agents, researchers, and producers to earn
    more profit. The farmers can receive required information at the correct time
    to take better decision. The sensor data are collected, processed, and analyzed
    locally closer to the data center without transforming data to the remote centralized
    cloud server so that network transport latency is reduced. In Fig. 1, we have
    explained the precision farming system constructed on blockchain and edge IoT-based
    computing technology. IoT devices such as cameras, environmental sensors collect
    large amount of data from the farm and transmitted to cloud storage system for
    data analysis. The process of transferring data from IoT application area to the
    cloud service will take more time and reduce the speed of the system. The edge
    computing service is introduced between the IoT application system and cloud system
    to reduce the network traffic and latency in cloud environment. The edge computing
    server increases the speed of the data analysis process and provides solution
    to the farmer and the other users immediately without delay. The edge computing
    paradigm allows sensor data to be stored and analyzed close to the data source
    and application devices using 5G network connection, which reduce the cost and
    increase the crop yield. Fig. 1 A precision agriculture system using blockchain
    technology Full size image The proposed work is explained in this paper which
    is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the related work in a precision smart
    efficient agricultural system using blockchain technology and an edge computing.
    The IoT, edge computing, and blockchain functionalities of the various layers
    are discussed in Sect. 3. The process flow of the projected system is explained.
    In Sect. 5, we have explained the experimental environment and parameters, results,
    and analyses of various algorithm. In Sect. 6, we have explained the result of
    the proposed efficient precision agricultural system and future enhancements.
    2 Related Works In 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.6 billion.
    To provide the food products to the large population, agriculture department should
    integrate with new technology [2, 5, 13]. Precision agriculture is a sensor-controlled
    and software-managed environment for automatic collection of land environmental
    data, data analysis, monitoring, and tracking of operations with advanced technologies
    to meet the food products’ demands in future. Precision agriculture uses IoT and
    blockchain technology to avoid centralized management of data [17]. Traditional
    centralized smart agriculture system has lack of data security, data misinterpretation,
    and data redundancy [1, 3]. Blockchain-based smart agriculture system provides
    efficient services to the different stockholders like farmers, farm product wholesalers,
    supply chain agents, and financial sectors participated in every process from
    farm to our plate [4, 6, 7]. Blockchain is a chain of secured and verified block
    of information with timestamp. Blockchain and smart contract already proved information
    transparency and security-based record keeping [8, 9]. It provides trusted way
    of storing and processing of data in a distributed environment. Blockchain information
    are immutable which avoids alteration of data in the blockchain. Distributed consensus
    algorithm is implemented using tamperproof method to support users to validate
    every transaction in the blockchain network [10, 12]. It ensures no false information
    is added in the blockchain hashed data with the support of timestamp and cryptographic
    footprint data. IoT devices are responsible for monitoring and collecting land
    environment data with minimum power and low cost and lack of information security.
    This security and traceability problem can be solved by smart contract and blockchain
    mechanism [11, 14]. Figure 2 shows the different components of three-layered precision
    agricultural system. Edge computing is a distributed environment, which moves
    storage and computing power nearer to the IoT wireless sensor network to reduce
    the workload of the cloud server and the latency [15, 19]. Edge computing node
    provides immediate response to the farmers to take better and efficient decision
    to improve the crop yield and reduce the usage of resources. It reduces the cost
    and increases the network efficiency by providing better security [16, 18]. Analysis
    of sensor data performed in the edge computing node reduces the network latency
    and increases reliability, modularity, and scalability. Raspberry Pi acts as an
    edge computing node, which executes a machine learning algorithm to predict the
    required information about the crop yield and status of resources using gateways
    [18]. Fig. 2 Precision agricultural system Full size image 3 IoT, Edge Computing,
    and Blockchain Technology in Precision Agricultural System Smart contract controls
    do not allow the third-party intermediate users to fix the price for food products
    in the market. The blockchain technology controls the usage and modification of
    data in the edge server and cloud server node using contracts and consensus algorithm.
    Food supply fully depends on the agricultural process, which is composed of pre-harvesting
    and post-harvesting. Pre-harvesting includes finding best quality seed, cultivation
    process, market demand, finding soil quality, and need of fertilizer. Post-harvesting
    represents distribution of food products in the market to the producer, supplier,
    and consumer. Food supply management involves direct and indirect users to accomplish
    the transfer of food products to consumer or producer through different agents.
    Blockchain allows different levels of users to access the centralized secured
    data and execute different operations on hashed data. 3.1 Proposed Blockchain-Based
    Agricultural Model The proposed system allows the users to trace the food product
    data from land to consumer and ensures the security and adoptability. In Fig.
    3, we have explained the different use cases of blockchain in precision agriculture
    system. The blockchain technology helps to create trustworthy environment between
    the producer and consumers in food supply chain management. Every transaction
    is stored as block in chain with time stamp, which cannot be modified in future.
    Sensors collects crop data and environment data from the agricultural and stored
    in edge computing node for data pre-processing. Some portion of the data is processed
    in the IOT side edge process node to provide information to the different users
    and farmers and other users immediately without any time delay. Machine learning
    algorithm is executed in the edge layer processing node to predict the crop yield
    and demand in the market. Fig. 3 Use cases of blockchain in precision agriculture
    Full size image 3.2 Functionality of Layered Architecture Blockchain-based precision
    agricultural system consists of different kind of components at each layer to
    perform agricultural land sensor data analysis, which are collected from agricultural
    land. In Fig. 4, we have explained different components and layers of the proposed
    system. The different functionalities of various layers are explained below: Data
    collection layer: It is responsible for collecting land- and crop-related data
    from different sensors and drones deployed in the agricultural area. The collected
    data is transferred to the highest level edge computing server node using wireless
    sensor network gateway. Edge computing layer: The edge computing layer comprises
    storage server and processing node, which is responsible for processing the data
    nearer to the data source to reduce the latency and network traffic. It provides
    required information to the user with minimum response time. Bigdata analytics
    layer: Data mining association rule algorithm is executed on the large volume
    of data to generate the pattern to be stored in the knowledge repository with
    contract-based blockchain technology. It can be used by the farmer and other stakeholders
    hashed in the blockchain. Blockchain service layer: Transaction details and data
    from each layer are stored in the blockchain in a distributed environment to support
    the property traceability for all users and security. Application layer: The user
    can access information or knowledge pattern from the knowledge repository using
    laptop, computer, or mobile phones at any time and everywhere. The farmer, retailer,
    agri-officer, supplier, and retailer can access information using mobile devices
    connected via Internet. Fig. 4 Layered architecture using blockchain technology
    Full size image 4 Performance Analysis The proposed blockchain system maintains
    transaction transparency using decentralized ledger when compared with traditional
    approach. The performance of the proposed secured blockchain system is measured
    in terms of speed, average latency, average throughput, resource utilization,
    and user performance. The experiment is performed on 250 transactions in two different
    blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. Ethereum is a distributed
    computing platform with smart contracts, open source, and public. Hyperledger
    Fabric is an open-source permissioned private blockchain technology with distributed
    ledger. Figure 5 shows the comparison of average throughput for Ethereum and Hyperledger
    with varying number of transactions. The experiment was conducted with two platforms
    on five different sizes of datasets. For all datasets, Hyperledger has more throughput
    than Ethereum. The next performance matrix latency is evaluated with different
    number of transactions for Ethereum and Hyperledger. In Fig. 6, we observed that
    the throughput increases when the number of transaction increases. The Ethereum
    has more latency than Hyperledger. Fig. 5 Comparison of throughput Full size image
    Fig. 6 Comparison of latency Full size image 5 Conclusion and Future Work With
    the development of edge computing efficient technologies and blockchain algorithm
    rapidly transfer traditional smart agricultural systems to advanced precision
    agricultural systems. The effective food supply chain system is developed with
    use of consensus algorithm in two different blockchain platforms. In this paper,
    we proposed secured advanced smart precision agricultural system deployed in the
    field of research and food supply, which provides transparency and security to
    the information stored in the knowledge repository. The farm management process
    is optimized with the use of machine learning algorithm and security contacts
    by improvising the food plant and crop yield and minimizing the convention of
    natural resources. The proposed system delivers the needed information or knowledge
    to the farmers at the correct time and correct place. The novelty of the proposed
    advanced system is to maximize the profit for the farmers and minimize the investment
    cost based on blockchain-based food supply system. In future, the proposed method
    can be extended for designing food chain management system in order to increase
    the profit for farmers and crop demand and disease analysis. References Antonucci

    important to the country's economy. Therefore, automation must be used in agriculture
    to solve the issues. The proposed system is based on augmented reality intelligent
    precision agriculture using the smart sensor. It consists of the hardware ESP32
    microcontroller, DHT11 sensor, and Load, and the software unity hub in Augmented
    Reality technology and Blynk application is used. The proposed system uses a deep
    learning algorithm characterized by 4 process categories 1) sensor interface,
    2) wireless transmission, 3) data processing and 4) data monitoring and controlling.
    Agriculture characteristics are mostly maintained in the IoT platform, and the
    AR controls the water outlet during irrigation. To improve system performance
    and reach maximum efficiency, it is helpful for farmers to maintain irrigation
    properly. This leads to alternatives that may be both effective and practical.

    characterized by 4 process categories 1) sensor interface, 2) wireless transmission,
    3) data processing and 4) data monitoring and controlling. Agriculture characteristics
    are mostly maintained in the IoT platform, and the AR controls the water outlet
    during irrigation. To improve system performance and reach maximum efficiency,
    it is helpful for farmers to maintain irrigation properly. This leads to alternatives
    that may be both effective and practical. Published in: 2023 7th International

    India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture is the basic source of food grains and
    other raw materials in human life. The demand for crops rises in tandem with the
    growth of the human population. Food security will rise with real-time monitoring
    of a smart agricultural system''s understanding of soil moisture measurement,
    humidity, and ambient temperature [1]. Additionally, smart agriculture may raise
    production, decrease water waste, and increase crop output. This study suggests
    smart agriculture, which makes use of real-time, sensor-based monitoring without
    human involvement. All sensor data is captured and tracked at all times and from
    anywhere within the internet''s service area, and users have immediate access
    to real-time data [2]. The creation of a mobile application makes it easier for
    users to obtain data and track growth. This study evaluates agricultural elements
    that have an impact on yields, such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.
    One of the disruptive technologies in the IoT space that hasn''t been fully utilized
    is the deep learning algorithm, which may make human-computer interaction in smart
    surroundings more enjoyable and engaging [3]. This research proposes using applications
    in agriculture for water insect irrigation. AR and blynk are highly useful for
    providing customization and privacy to users of smart devices provided by IoT
    technology. This IoT device provides the user with a visually appealing and simple-to-use
    interface [4]. Using simple electronic components like Esp32, DHT 11, relays,
    and vuforia open-source platform, unity hub, and visual studio for operating a
    relay triggering and monitoring temperature and humidity in the agricultural field.
    Smart farming is a modern farming management concept that uses IoT technologies
    to boost agricultural output [5]. Additionally, farmers can lack the expertise
    necessary to effectively employ various instruments to gauge the appropriate environmental
    conditions for their crops [6]. They are given access to an automated system using
    IoT that may work without any human oversight and alert to deal with any issues
    they may encounter while farming [7]. The ability to reach and alert the farmer
    even while he or she is not in the field enables farmers to manage more farmland,
    increasing productivity. Nowadays, most individuals don''t have much time for
    caring for and watering the plants they prefer to cultivate in their irrigation
    systems [8]. Along with real-time temperature, soilmoisture, humidity, and water
    level data received from IoT sensors, fertilizers are also used. Additionally,
    this AR technology is used to provide a 3D view of the plants that are anticipated
    based on the soil conditions to the user [9]. Additionally, they protect plants
    or crops against several illnesses brought on by agricultural areas [10]. The
    temperature in the agriculture area should not go below a specific level, and
    crop humidity should be kept at a reasonable level. As a result, it helps farmers
    generate high returns and grow crops [11]. This study focuses on creating a method
    for managing water in commercial spaces, such as offices and universities, by
    utilizing IoT. Water supply management is crucial since it is such a precious
    resource. For the purpose of maintaining the water''s level and avoiding the agricultural
    area''s dry land, it is imperative to prevent tank overflows and use the water
    properly. The main contribution of the paper is as follows: To propose and assesses
    a cloud-based remote correspondence framework to screen and control a sensor to
    evaluate the plant''s water needs. This technique is significant in the control
    and management of insects in the water process. Farmers may view the entire farm
    in real time with applications. To develop real-time intelligent precision agriculture
    using the suggested deep learning approach to monitor and implemented to control
    the load and monitor the intelligent sensor. To monitor and control using the
    mobile applications AR and Blynk. Application is used to improve fertility testing
    and check the total production quality, see the entire farm on a single dashboard,
    and monitor the temperature and humidity values of the agricultural area. SECTION
    II. Related Works Nowadays, smart agriculture minimizes a variety of farming issues.
    Farmers obtain the necessary information and relevant data to monitor plant development
    by utilizing cloud technology, in which many sensors, actuators, and other embedded
    devices, and some parameters are recognized and controlled using a microcontroller
    [12]. Uncovered in the literature, a step-by-step process is provided for combining
    IoT with AR. With the use of an API request, any cloud server may access the Controller''s
    incoming data and store it in a database [13]. The goal of this research is to
    build IoT using inexpensive components while still keeping track of Blynk-based
    phones. The results of 10 tests using a BlackBox yield a water content of 20 cm,
    soil moisture of 60%, 80% humidity, and an average temperature of 21 C [14]. With
    the use of wireless sensor networks, we can receive and manage the agriculture
    parameters cloud to provide individual farmers with up-to-date information about
    the field so they may take corrective action to increase crop productivity [15].
    Intelligent IoT platform development Smart farming is gaining ground in wealthy
    countries. As a result, it is minimizing resource waste such as water, fertilizers,
    and operational costs [16]. Augmented reality is highly useful for providing users
    with smart devices equipped with IoT technologies. Such AR-enabled IoT devices
    provide the user with a visually beautiful and easy-to-use interface, as well
    as load control through Vuforia [17]. Three more services were employed in the
    plant development process: sensor data, a hosting provider, and a plant database
    accessible via an API [18]. To extract data such as soil moisture, temperature,
    and water levels, a variety of sensors have been used. This needs a greater emphasis
    on increasing water efficiency in irrigated agriculture [19]. To decrease water
    waste and make better use of it, sustainable irrigation methods are essential.
    IoT-based real-time alarm system and revolutionary weather monitoring system Arduino
    UNO is used to monitor temperature (t) and humidity in real-time appliances using
    a sample size of 10 values and 80% g power [20]. To decrease water waste and make
    better use of it, sustainable irrigation methods are essential. The drip irrigation
    system is an efficient strategy to minimize water use while maintaining agricultural
    output [21]. This study examines and describes approaches for reducing energy
    usage and managing power in embedded systems. The emphasis is on the design and
    deployment of energy-efficient embedded systems in wireless sensor networks, as
    well as the prospects for reducing energy consumption in such systems [22]. This
    study details the creation and assessment of an instructional augmented reality
    software whose goal is to promote aquaponics-based sustainable agriculture [23].
    The research discusses how augmented reality has to be used in conjunction with
    other technologies and application domains to be effective. As related-work examples
    are used to examine appropriate hardware techniques and limitations, attention
    is also given to how augmented reality should be used in agriculture (e.g., mobility)
    [24]. This system may design, construct, and automate a hydroponics system for
    managing and monitoring plant development, as well as assess the impact of utilizing
    a prototype of this system Important environmental parameters that affect plant
    growth are temperature, humidity, and water [25]. Gathering, processing, and uploading
    data to control information are the functions of this gateway. The data will be
    kept and uploaded later if the network connection fails. SECTION III. Methodology
    Agriculture must become more technologically advanced to meet these rising needs
    or demands of the cultivates. In this paper cloud technology is used to provide
    the AR and Blynk application that uses sensors to monitor crop fields. Farmers
    can monitor agricultural conditions from anywhere in the world. DHT11 sensors
    are being used by smart agriculture to evaluate the farm area''s temperature and
    humidity weather report. When it is necessary to insect the water in the irrigation
    system, the water insect the agricultural land by using the application. And these
    are all monitored and controlled by the AR. In addition, undertaken the implementation
    of low-cost IoT devices using blynk to monitor them Initia lly, create an account
    in vuforia and process the target image after will get the license key, the unity
    file is opened, and update the file to be opened AR camera and delete the main
    camera, add the vuforia engine license key, and create a 3D image in the unity
    hub. This research is required since automation is required in a variety of sectors.
    Other requirements, as a result of the recent increase in busyness. The goal of
    this research is to build IoT using inexpensive components while still keeping
    track the values in Blynk-based mobile applications and this used to control and
    monitor the data and load respectively. Fig. 1. Proposed system block diagram

    experiment with a real area of agriculture to test the suggested deep learning
    approach used in the blynk and AR app. And this approach is being utilized to
    construct our prototype, allowing us to create an effieient, accurate, and low-cost
    solution for farmers. As a result, the prototype will help farmers on their farmland
    to effectively monitor their crops with the user-friendly application. The hardware
    of the sensor node is based on an ESP32 microcontroller equipped with sensors
    for environmental monitoring. The data is collected and integrated using Blynk''s
    cloud-based web application and AR application developed by controlling and monitoring
    the system Blynk cloud platform provides features for storing, managing, and visualizing
    data received from the monitoring device. In this future scope we will develop
    the system is replace the light to the motor and supply the irrigation area for
    water by controlling AR and Blynk at the same time will control it automatically
    for the soil moisture sensor used. These sensors sense the irrigation land wet
    and dry if it needs the water outlet by controlling the AR application and the
    values are updated in both the AR application and Blynk. Authors Figures References

    US has been facing environmental and economic sustainability issues. There has
    been an increase in trend for the application of fertilizers (nitrogen & phosphorus),

    1. Introduction Row crop corn and soybean production in the Midwestern US region
    has economic and environmental concerns, based on an increasing trends in the
    application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers [1]. Operational costs and
    fuel consumption costs have increased with a decrease in labor productivity [1].
    As a result, sustainable practices such as profitability (return on investments),
    operational cost reduction, hazardous waste reduction, delivery performance and
    overall productivity might be adopted through IoT-based precision agriculture
    applications, namely variable rate irrigation, variable rate fertilization, cloud-based
    analytics, and telematics for farm machinery navigation to improve agriculture
    operations and net profitability. However, [2] note the low rate of adoption for
    variable rate fertilizer (39%), variable rate pesticide (8%), variable rate irrigation
    (4%), cloud-based data analytics (21%) and telematics (10%) amongst Midwestern
    US row crop producers. The technical and operational barriers include operational
    costs, power consumption requirements, communication range limitations, data latency,
    data scalability, data storage, data processing and data interoperability and
    are highlighted in the literature [3,4,5]. This paper explores answers to the
    following questions: what are barriers to the adoption of IoT-based precision
    agriculture (PA) practices among row crop producers, how are the barriers operationally
    defined, and how are they related to each other? Section 2 highlights research
    background, discussing related PA literature on technologies and barriers to the
    adoption of IoT-based PA practices, Section 3 describes materials and methods
    adopted for this study based on semi-structured focus group interviews conducted
    with subject matter expertise (SME) (n = 18), Section 4 presents results from
    thematic content analysis of interview data describing operational definitions
    of variables and their relationships, Section 5 discusses results and significance
    in reference to previous studies, and Section 6 describes conclusions highlighting
    major takeaways, limitations and future research. 2. Background This section highlights
    research background supported by literature review on PA practices, barriers to
    the adoption of IoT-based PA practices, current adoption in the Midwestern US
    region and IoT-based wireless sensor technologies. 2.1. Precision Agriculture
    (PA) Practices Precision agriculture (PA) practices foster optimized application
    of agriculture inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, water, pesticides and energy
    that result in savings on the input applications, resulting in increased yield
    and improved profitability. Precision agriculture (PA) practices potentially provide
    producers with improved tools to manage inputs and optimize factors of production
    such as fertilizer, pesticides and seed application. The definition of precision
    agriculture published by the National Research Council (1997) defines precision
    agriculture as “a management strategy that uses information technology to bring
    data from multiple sources to bear on decisions associated with crop production”.
    Precision agriculture (PA) tools include information-gathering tools such as yield
    monitors, targeted soil sampling and remote sensing tools; variable rate technology;
    and guidance systems such as light bars and auto steer equipment. Precision agriculture
    technologies include soil mapping, variable rate application, yield monitoring
    mapping, automatic steer global position guidance systems and autonomous vehicles
    [6]. Management zones in the field are developed by using crop and field information.
    Varying input rates increase yields or reduce costs depending on the managers’
    goal for the management zones [7]. The potential benefits of PA practices include
    an increase in the accurate placement of inputs, reduction of machinery costs
    from an increase in machinery field capacity and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions due to reductions in input usage for a given level of production [8,9].
    Precision agriculture (PA) practices have an impact on increasing profitability,
    reducing operational costs, increasing labor productivity, reducing cycle times
    of operation, optimizing fertilizer (nitrogen & phosphate application) and decreasing
    fuel consumption in farm machinery [10]. These technologies may consist of variable
    rate application (water & fertilizer), real-time kinematic (RTK) autosteer, guidance
    systems (GPS-guided autosteers, yield monitors), submeter accuracy auto steering
    (SUB) and telematics. In a study by [11], the authors note the impact of PA technologies,
    such as autosteer guidance, automatic section control spray application and real-time
    kinematic precision tractor operations on the carbon emission and economic operational
    cost in the corn and soybean production in the US state of Kentucky. The findings
    indicate that automatic section control spray application has the capability to
    spray more precisely, reducing the over-application of inputs and giving a mean
    net return of 0.47% [11]. Real-time kinematic precision tractor operations provided
    the most significant improvement in carbon footprint ratio of 2.74% with increased
    technical efficiency in applying nitrogen and seeds more accurately [11]. Labor
    productivity also increased, allowing more desirable production practices to be
    employed [11]. Global navigation satellite systems-based autosteering reduces
    overlap between tractor passes and overall operator fatigue increasing productivity
    [12]. A study conducted by [13] to assess the impact of implementation of PA practices
    in potato and olive production highlighted that variable rate application (VRT)
    of potassium and phosphorus fertilizers lead to a strong reduction in nutrient
    use and an increase in operational profits of 21%, with an increase in overall
    profits of 26%. Precision agriculture (PA) can help in managing crop production
    inputs in an environmentally friendly way by utilizing site-specific knowledge
    targeting rates of fertilizers, seed and chemicals in improving soil conditions
    [14]. 2.2. Adoption of Precision Agriculture Practices among Midwestern Row Crop
    Producers The Midwestern (Indiana) region of the US has been facing environmental
    and economic sustainability issues. There has been an increase in trends for the
    application of fertilizers (nitrogen & phosphorus) and in farm machinery fuel
    costs and a decrease in labor productivity leading to non-optimized usage of farm
    inputs [1]. Precision agriculture (PA) technologies foster optimized application
    of agriculture inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, water, pesticides and energy,
    resulting in savings in the input applications, resulting in increased yield and
    improved profitability [12]. The adoption of PA technologies among row crop producers
    in the US Midwest region has been increasing [2]. The study conducted by [2] notes
    the adoption of different precision agriculture technologies among Midwest region
    producers. Yield monitoring technology has the highest adoption rates as 69% of
    farmers reported adopting it. Variable rate fertilizer (39%), variable rate pesticide
    (8%), variable rate irrigation (4%), cloud-based data analytics (21%) and telematics
    (10%) all reported lower adoption rates [15,16,17]. Different types of IoT sensors
    (temperature, humidity, light, pressure, wind speed) receive and collect data
    managed by cloud information management systems for data analysis solutions through
    application programming interfaces (API) [17]. A wireless sensor IoT framework
    for PA applications consists of: (1) perception layer, (2) communication layer,
    (3) processing layer and (4) application layer [4]. Therefore, it is important
    to understand the barriers and related decision factors involved in developing
    IoT-based PA applications. 2.3. Barriers to Adoption of IoT-Based Precision Agriculture
    Multiple studies note socio-economic factors (farmers’ educational level, age),
    agro- ecological factors (soil quality, farm size, ownership of land), farmers’
    perception (perceived benefits vs. profitability), technological factors (computer
    education, data aggregation) and informational factors (extension services) as
    factors having a positive relationship with adoption [16,17]. The research study
    focuses on cost, technical, operational and data management barriers highlighted
    in Figure 1 and validated in the study conducted by [3,4,5,7]. The factors include
    enumerating cost, power consumption, communication range, data latency, data scalability,
    data storage and data interoperability [3,4,5,8]. A more recent study conducted
    by [5,6,8] highlighted cost of equipment, less benefit, training, data scalability,
    communication range and time of implementation as the IoT precision agriculture
    barriers. Figure 1 highlights cost, operational, technical and data management
    barriers explored in this study. Figure 1. Cost, Technical, Operational and Data

    for PA practices. This framework was used to develop the semi-structured interview
    questionnaire highlighted in Appendix B, where questions related to barriers are
    categorized under these framework layers: (1) perception layer, (2) communication
    layer, (3) data processing and (4) application layer. Figure 2. IoT framework
    layers for wireless sensors-based PA. Source: “Reprinted/adapted with permission
    from Ref. [4]. 2019, Junhu Ruan ”. Structured literature review (SLR) methodology
    described in the following section was used to identify technical and operational
    barriers to adoption of IoT-based PA practices. Internet of things (IoT) wireless
    sensors-based PA technologies, namely monitoring row crop diseases, smart irrigation,
    smart fertilizing, cloud-based analytics and telematics for farm machinery navigation,
    have a low rate of adoption among Midwestern (Indiana) region row crop producers.
    These barriers include technical (power limitations, communication range), operational
    (data scalability, sensor distribution, data latency), management (data storage,
    data interoperability & data processing) and finance (cost, return on investment).
    3. Materials and Methods This section describes the research methodology approaches
    adopted for this study. Structured literature review conducted for this study
    is described in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 describes semi-structured focus group
    interviews conducted with (n = 18) subject matter expertise (SME), Section 3.3
    describes thematic content analysis approach and Section 3.4 highlights validity
    and reliability of research methods. 3.1. Structured Literature Review The research
    methodology framework followed a structured literature review and thematic content
    analysis of semi-structured focus group interviews conducted with subject matter
    expertise. Content analysis is defined as “content analysis is a research technique
    for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content
    of communication” [18]. The four-step process model of content analysis by [19,20]
    delimits the material to be analyzed by defining a unit of analysis, creating
    analytical categories, defining the material collection (creating and defining
    categories), pretesting the categories defined, refining through pretesting categories
    and analyzing the data by coding for thematic analysis. The first step was defining
    the unit of analysis, i.e., sample size of relevant peer reviewed journals and
    data reports. The period of analysis chosen was 1990–2019, and in the initial
    review a sample of n = 90 journals was selected. The peer-reviewed literature
    was selected from top-tier publishers Elsevier, Emerald, IEEE, Taylor Francis
    and Inderscience. The second step defined screening categories with inclusion
    and exclusion criteria. Preliminary research criteria were defined based on the
    broader research objectives, screening the selected unit of analysis, relevant
    theories, and a review of the initially selected sample journal articles. Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based precision agriculture technologies were used as initial
    inclusion or screening criteria. Abstract, introduction and findings of the initial
    sample were analyzed as per the research objectives, and 20 articles were screened
    out of 90 articles not meeting the initial screening criteria. The third step
    was pretesting and refining categories in which the sample of n = 70 articles
    was carefully analyzed for progressive refining and validating of the category
    scheme. The fourth and the last step was coding and analyzing the themes, as per
    defined categories in the previous step. The content themes identified for this
    study were based on keywords from the research questions explored in this research,
    i.e., “precision agriculture technologies” and “Barriers to adoption of IoT-based
    precision agriculture practices” were also used to develop the semi-structured
    focus group interview questionnaire in Appendix B 3.2. Focused Group Semi-Structured
    Interviews The data collection methods included focus group semi-structured interviews.
    In this study, a purposive sampling was adopted [21] (p. 94) to collect data from
    the SME’s involved in three focus groups interview sessions. The focus groups
    were categorized based upon the knowledge and expertise of the participants in
    three layers of IoT wireless sensors framework: (1) perception layer, (2) communication
    layer, and (3) data processing & application layer. The credentials of the participants
    and their current roles and expertise in the IoT framework layer are highlighted
    in Appendix A. The researcher contacted 22 individuals, of which 18 participated
    (response rate of 81%) in 3 focus group interview sessions (See Supplementary
    Material) with 6 participants in each session. Each of the focus groups consisted
    of at least one expert representing each layer of the IoT wireless sensor framework
    to reduce bias. The study conducted by [22] defined the term “focus group” to
    apply to a situation in which the interviewer asks group members very specific
    questions about a topic after considerable research. Focus groups are used in
    the studies to investigate complex systems where the research can interact with
    participants and there is further opportunity to ask for clarification questions.
    The study by [21] (p. 18) defines a focus group as a “carefully planned discussion
    designed to obtain perceptions in a defined area of interest in a permissive,
    non-threatening environment”. The critical element of focus group interviews is
    the involvement of people where the information encourages a nurturing environment
    [23]. Diagnosing potential problems, programs, services, products and stimulating
    new ideas results in frameworks for further validation with empirical research
    [24,25]. Because the characteristic of focus group interviews helps to investigate
    complex systems where the research may interact with the participants providing
    an opportunity to further ask for clarification questions, it was appropriate
    to adopt these research methods [21] (p. 18). The studies conducted by [23,24]
    highlighted that purposive sampling may be employed for focus group interviews
    that consist of representative members of larger populations. Most focus groups
    interviews consist of between 6–12 participants [25]. The study conducted by [25]
    suggests that “the size of the group is governed by the objectives of the research
    as well.” Smaller groups (4–6 people) are preferable when participants share information
    about the topic [21] (p. 24). The study also highlighted that the typical focus
    group interview might have up to 10–15 questions, depending upon the length of
    the interview and research objectives. The semi-structured interview questionnaire
    in Appendix B, developed for this study, consisted of 12 questions structured
    in four sections, namely (1) demographics (2) perception layer (3) communication
    layer and (4) data processing & application layer. 3.3. Thematic Content Analysis
    Data analysis is the part of qualitative research that mostly distinctively differentiates
    from quantitative research methods [26]. Qualitative data analysis is a more dynamic,
    intuitive and creative process of inductive reasoning, thinking and theorizing
    [27]. Data analysis in qualitative research is defined as the process of systematically
    searching and arranging the interview transcripts. The process of analyzing qualitative
    data involves coding or categorizing of data, which reduces the volume of raw
    information, followed by identifying significant patterns drawing meaning from
    the data, developing a logical chain of framework or adding to grounded theory
    [28]. The NVivo coding software was used to code the data from interviews. Inter-reliability
    of the coding thematic analysis of the data was checked with another rater to
    ensure the reliability kappa value k > 0.70 for acceptable reliability [29,30].
    3.4. Validity and Reliability Validity and reliability of the research design
    for this study follows a triangulation method, which is a typical practice for
    rigor in qualitative research methodologies [29,30]. Triangulation may involve
    combining multiple data sources (data triangulation), using multiple research
    methods to analyze the same problem (methodological triangulation) or using multiple
    investigators [31]. In this study, the approach of triangulation was followed
    by the researcher collecting and analyzing data from different sources, i.e.,
    the SLR (n = 70) and the three focus group interview sessions. The content analysis
    from the focus group interviews was triangulated by three non-subject matter expertise
    appraisers for inter-reliability. 4. Results This section highlights the results
    and findings from thematic content analysis conducted on the focused group interviews
    (See Supplementary Material). The frequency of emerging themes from content analysis
    conducted on focus group interviews is shown in Figure 1. How the variables are
    defined in the context of barriers and their potential relationships with each
    other are described in Table 1. Subsequently operational definitions for variables
    identified and defined through content analysis are highlighted in Table 2. Table
    1. Variable Relationships and Descriptive Content Analysis. Table 2. Operational
    Definitions. 4.1. Themes from Content Analysis Figure 3 highlights the reference
    frequency of emerging themes identified and analyzed following the content analysis
    approach on the focus group interviews (See Supplementary Material). The themes
    analyzed were as per the research questions based on identifying, exploring and
    defining variable relationships related to cost, technical (power consumption,
    wireless communication, communication range), operational (data scalability, data
    latency) and data management (data storage, data processing, data interoperability)
    barriers. Figure 3. Frequency of text references identified in focus group interview
    transcripts. The emerging themes identified through content analysis in decreasing
    order of their reference frequency are as follows. Data latency—type of wireless
    communication (9), data latency—autonomous applications (8), data storage—type
    of precision application (8), data interoperability—type of wireless communication
    (6) and data storage—type of sensor (6) were the most recurring themes identified.
    Data latency—power consumption (4), data interoperability—data storage (4), data
    interoperability—type of precision application (4) and data latency—data processing
    (4) were the other recurring themes identified. The emerging themes were explored
    further for descriptive analysis, and findings are reported in the following section.
    4.2. Variable Relationships The variable relationships identified as themes through
    the content analysis approach were further explored. The participants’ quotations
    in the context of variable relationships are reported in Table 1, along with descriptive
    analysis findings. The Kappa value for each of the themes analyzed through content
    analysis shows the reliability of findings. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient is a statistical
    measure of inter-rater reliability, which many researchers regard as more useful
    than the percentage agreement since it considers the amount of agreement that
    could be expected to occur through chance [30]. NVivo calculates the Kappa coefficient
    individually for each combination of emerging themes [31]. If the two users are
    in complete agreement about which content of the source should be coded at the
    node, then the Kappa coefficient is 1. A value between 0 and 1 indicates the scale
    of agreement. The Kappa (k) value ≤0.40 means weak agreement, between 0.40–0.75
    means good agreement and above 0.75 means excellent agreement [31]. The average
    Kappa (k) value is calculated for each individual node by using the mean k value
    calculated for each comparison rating between individual raters (n = 3 raters)
    involved, as per the typical practice mentioned in the studies [30,31]. The descriptive
    analyses for the variable relationships are interpretations from the participants’
    quotes. For instance, data latency requirements tend to depend upon power consumption,
    type of wireless communication technology and type of precision application, which
    might be important to consider before designing an IoT-based data pipeline for
    precision agriculture applications. Similarly, data scalability depends upon power
    consumption and cost requirements, which might be critical to understand for cost-
    and energy-efficient IoT wireless sensors-based data pipeline design. 4.3. Operational
    Definitions The operational definitions of variables identified through the content
    analysis approach are highlighted in the table. The operational definitions are
    stated as findings of content analysis from focus group interviews. The supporting
    participant quotes are also mentioned in Table 2. Therefore, the subjective interpretations
    for operational definitions are limited in the context of this study. 5. Discussion
    The variable relationships in the contexts of technical and operational barriers
    identified through this research might help to inform precision agriculture practitioners,
    researchers and producers. The findings are based on potential dependency relationships
    between cost, data latency, data scalability, data storage, data interoperability,
    type of sensors, type of wireless communication, type of precision agriculture
    application and power consumption, which might help to understand barriers from
    an IoT systems perspective. The findings suggest that data latency requirements
    depend on the type of precision agriculture application. For autonomous applications,
    specifically farm machinery navigation, the latency requirements are lower (ms
    or s) as compared to monitoring applications (days or weeks). Data latency further
    depends upon power consumption as low latency means higher power consumption.
    This is an important finding as it suggests that Wi-Fi/5G/4G are the suitable
    wireless communication technologies for low-latency autonomous applications. This
    finding is supported by the studies [3,4,15] where a comparative analysis based
    on power consumption and communication range is conducted for different types
    of wireless communication technologies. Another key finding based on data interoperability
    depends upon the data storage requirements as data collected from different types
    of sensors require more cloud storage compatibility to interoperate and perform
    data processing for different types and structure of data [32,33,34]. This finding
    resonates with the studies conducted by [4,32,33] which highlights the compatibility
    of cloud data storage platforms to interoperate for different types and structures
    of data coming from different types of sensors [32,33,34]. In addition, the findings
    of the study suggests that monitoring row crop diseases applications require data
    from multiple type of sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, topography,
    satellite imagery data) which require more data interoperable cloud storage platforms
    [35,36]. The operational definitions for variables defined in Table 2, through
    descriptive analysis of interview data, are significant results to help digital
    agriculture practitioners, producers and researchers to understand the adoption
    barriers. Understanding the variable relationships highlighted in Table 1 might
    help to design cost- and energy-efficient solutions for IoT-based precision agriculture
    applications. 6. Conclusions The dependency of data latency requirements on power
    consumption, type of wireless communication and precision agriculture applications
    is an important finding to consider for designing IoT-based wireless sensors autonomous
    applications (i.e., smart irrigation, smart fertilization and farm machinery navigation)
    [34,35,36]. Low data latency requirements for autonomous applications and comparatively
    higher data latency for monitoring applications is an important takeaway which
    might help to design energy- and cost-efficient IoT systems [32,33,35]. Higher
    data latency means low power consumption, and therefore using low-power wider-coverage
    technology such as Lora WAN holds significance. Data interoperability depends
    upon compatibility of cloud storage to store and process different formats and
    structures of data collected from different types of sensors [36,37]. Data scalability
    depends on cost as large data require more storage and processing capabilities
    at the cloud end; the cost might be insignificant but the cost of more sensors
    collecting data is significant [37,38]. Further dependency of types of wireless
    communication on data latency, communication range and power consumption are another
    critical finding to inform stakeholders for cost- and energy-efficient wireless
    communication protocol technologies [32,34,35]. The decision variables identified
    and operationally defined through this study might be explored further for dependency
    relationships and to develop an empirically validated framework for sustainable
    IoT. Interpretation of research findings following qualitative content analysis
    approaches are subjective and have limitations in context generalizability. However,
    researchers have tried to reduce biases, keeping high rigor for reliability and
    validity of findings. The findings of this research define and describe potential
    relationships between variables which might help digital agriculture practitioners
    and researchers to develop cost- and energy-efficient IoT systems for adoption
    of precision agriculture practices. Supplementary Materials The following supporting

    1. Introduction Advances in technology and industry have helped humanity to increase
    life quality and expectancy. This includes delegating laborious processes traditionally
    performed by hand to machines that can perform these tasks more efficiently. However,
    it has brought with it several problems as well [1] relating to the overexploitation
    and nonrational use of Earth’s natural resources, which in turn causes disruption
    of the natural balance expressed by climate change effects, such as global warming
    and severe climate events (droughts, flooding, storms, hurricanes, etc.). In response
    to this alarming situation, humanity is asked more than ever to rethink and reconsider
    its way of dealing with the environment, especially in the context of a world
    population that grows at a higher rate [2]. This puts a lot of pressure on our
    food systems to meet the increasing demand and feed the planet. Agriculture is
    the sector that must be addressed, and agricultural management practices need
    to be optimized and become more efficient and sustainable to address these challenges.
    With water resources as an example, agriculture comes in as the largest consumer
    of this resource, with about an average of 70% in use around the world [3]. In
    this sector, water resources are used mainly in irrigation activities that still
    follow unsustainable methods such as gravity irrigation, the most widely used
    type of irrigation globally [4,5]. Additionally, even when using modern methods
    of irrigation, such as drip irrigation, they can be inefficient in the absence
    of good management [6]. The crucial step to achieving an efficient irrigation
    system, whatever the type of irrigation system used, is to know the proper amount
    of water to supply and the time to apply it (when and how much). To this end,
    we need to monitor either the soil, the crop, or the weather. Monitoring the weather
    enables the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET), which is the sum of transpiration
    from plants and soil surface evaporation. Accurately estimating this parameter
    allows compensation of the lost water quantity to the atmosphere. There are two
    methods of estimating the evapotranspiration of a crop. One uses a single crop
    coefficient (Kc) that incorporates all physiological and physical variations between
    the crops and the second where the Kc is split into two separate coefficients:
    Kcb for crop transpiration and Ke for soil evaporation. The Kc coefficient, then,
    is multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0), which reflects the rate
    of evapotranspiration for a specific crop (grass). It is obtained by monitoring
    various meteorological parameters (air temperature, solar radiation, air relative
    humidity, wind speed, etc.). Therefore, weather monitoring is a key step toward
    implementing efficient irrigation systems and ensuring sustainable agriculture.
    Today, we are able to collect weather data with high spatial and temporal resolution
    thanks to advances in science and technology, including advances in remote sensing
    such as the availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) [7] equipped with cutting-edge
    sensors with affordable prices, satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal
    resolutions, open-access reanalysis data such as European ReAnalysis data [8],
    MERRA [9], the JRA-55 [10] or NCEP–DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis data [11]. Additionally,
    advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) field have enabled cost-effective sensor
    data acquisition [12,13,14,15,16]. This huge amount of data raised issues regarding
    the efficiency, complexity, interfaces, dynamics, robustness, and interaction
    between these new types of peer-to-peer connected systems that need to be re-examined
    on a large scale, as discussed in [17]. This unprecedented amount of generated
    data is also contributing to what is known as big data, which needs adequate infrastructure
    to be stored and gain insights for assisting agricultural decision making. This
    work aligns with this objective and is intended to provide intelligent ways to
    deal with these abundant data by applying the concepts of big data analytics and
    leveraging the potential applications of artificial intelligence in agriculture
    to help farmers minimize their risks, or at least make them more manageable, which
    represents a step towards the development of smart and precision agriculture.
    2. State of the Art Several researchers have tried to leverage the challenges
    and opportunities of the big data wave in the agricultural field and how it can
    be the driver of sustainability and precision in this sector by gaining insights
    from massive volumes of data that can be used to assist decision making. As surveyed
    in [18], big data analytics is leading to advances in various industries, but
    it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The work presents a range of
    suggested solutions, tools, algorithms, and data, including how they were used
    and their impact upon the sector as a whole. It also emphasizes the enormous potential
    of big data analytics in agriculture for smarter farming, demonstrating how the
    accessibility of big data analytics tools, methods, and software, as well as the
    growing openness of heterogeneous data sources (the “open data wave”), will encourage
    more academic research, public sector initiatives, and business ventures in the
    agricultural sector. The paper concludes that the adoption of big data practices
    in agriculture is still challenging and faces several obstacles when applied to
    real-world applications. In the paper [19], the authors developed a system composed
    of three components: (i) hardware to capture crop data, (ii) a web application
    for crop data and field information manipulation, and (iii) a mobile application
    to control irrigation via mobiles. The objective of this work is to analyze the
    suitability of crops in terms of air temperature, air relative humidity, and soil
    moisture to optimize future plans and strategies. The authors of the work [20]
    propose a solution to be adopted in India to help farmers face the unpredictable
    nature and variability of climate and weather circumstances. They built a system
    for managing local weather stations in real time that would keep farmers well-informed
    about the current weather conditions in advance, allowing them to make the right
    decisions at the right time and prevent crop loss. High-speed internet infrastructure
    available even in rural areas is the main motivation for conducting this work.
    It facilitates the communication of collected data to remote servers. Once received
    and analyzed, the information derived from these data gives farmers a way to automate
    their agricultural management practices (irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting)
    by triggering the right action at the right time. Article [21] also presented
    a smart weather station management system intended to be used in agriculture and
    to manage meteorological stations. It is based on Internet of Things technology
    (IoT) to minimize costs. The connected sensors measure air temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, air pressure, and wind speed. It then sends the collected data
    to the server part of the system through the Global System for Mobile Communications
    (GSM) module. The application layer is powered by the ThingSpeak platform, which
    offers standard services to the proposed system such as data visualization and
    data analysis. In regards to dealing with the challenges related to handling huge
    amounts of data generated by sensors, the paper [22] proposed a standard architecture
    for a data infrastructure platform called WALLeSMART, which is a cloud-based solution
    that provides a general architecture to handle the difficulties of gathering,
    processing, storing, and visualizing extremely large amounts of data in batch
    and real-time modes. An initial prototype has been developed and tested at various
    farms in the Wallonia region of Belgium, showing prominent results. This proposed
    system can be used as the basis for developing customized smart agricultural services
    to meet our needs. Our contributions not only propose an architecture containing
    some of the standard pipelines used in the literature to build data platforms,
    namely data acquisition, storing, visualizing, and analysis, but a complete system
    with the aim of going from data to decision making. The proposed system provides
    services such as weather time series forecasting, missing values handling using
    a multisource approach (reanalysis and situ data), and estimating important parameters
    needed in the day-to-day life of farmers, such as the evapotranspiration (ET).
    3. Study Area The study area is situated 40 km east of Marrakesh in the semiarid
    Haouz plain in the heart of Morocco (Figure 1). About 2800 ha of this area is
    irrigated, and it is nearly flat. Cereal crops such as wheat and barley are the
    main dominant crops. The region’s climate is typically Mediterranean semiarid,
    with an average annual rainfall of about 250 mm [23,24], temperatures that range
    from hot in the summer (38 °C in July) to cool in the winter (5 °C in February),
    significant daily and monthly variations that are concentrated primarily from
    autumn to spring, and an average annual ET0 of 1600 mm [25]. Figure 1. R3 district
    study area in Morocco and a Photo of the meteorological station installed. 4.
    System Architecture The proposed system is designed to enable the smart management
    of weather data, which represents the key to implementing smart agriculture. By
    monitoring and analyzing the weather effectively, we can optimize various agricultural
    management practices such as irrigation scheduling and choosing the appropriate
    crop to sow [26]. The design of the platform follows a service-oriented architecture
    (Figure 2) to offer services that address each of the four categories of big data
    analytics. As part of a descriptive data analysis that tries to understand what
    happened in the past, a scenario would be: rainfall declined, and the frequency
    changed over the last decade. The answer to why this happened, in turn, is very
    important, and it takes us to the diagnostic data analysis, where the focus is
    to identify anomalies in data to explain the reasons behind events, such as linking
    this event with long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns observed
    in weather evolution charts. The third type covered by the platform is predictive
    data analysis. It looks beyond the present and tries to predict the future using
    statistical methods and machine learning algorithms that learn from historical
    data in an iterative approach, trying to identify the optimal way to predict the
    future. One such service is weather forecasting. The output of the forecasting
    service can be used to support decision making about what actions to take that
    aim to prevent severe events from occurring in the future. This is carried out
    through the last type, which is prescriptive data analysis. Figure 2. General
    architecture of the platform. The platform can be decomposed into four main layers:
    the data acquisition layer, the data storage layer, the processing layer, and
    the application layer. 4.1. Data Acquisition Layer Heterogeneous data from a variety
    of sources, including meteorological station data, IoT weather sensors, reanalysis
    data, third-party meteorological services, and raw files (CSV, Excel, etc.), are
    used as the input for this layer. The concept of big data is introduced to the
    field by the volume, velocity, and variety that characterize these data. Missing
    values are handled in this layer using the method developed in Section 4.4.1 prior
    to being stored in the NoSQL MongoDB database. 4.1.1. Weather Station Data The
    weather dataset used in this study was collected from a meteorological station
    installed in the study area (Figure 1) at the half-hour scale from 2013 to 2020.
    The used tower is equipped with different sensors [27,28] to measure: Incoming
    solar radiation using (Kipp and Zonen CM5 Pyranometer, Delft, The Netherlands).
    Air temperature in Kelvin, relative humidity (R3_Hr, as a fraction between 0 and
    1) and vapor pressure by using (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). Wind speed
    using (A100R Anemometer, R.M. Young Company, Traverse City, MI, USA). Rainfall
    using (FSS500 Tipping Bucket Automatic Rain Gauge, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA). Next, records are stored in data loggers before being collected manually
    by agents or sent to a centralized server via a cellular connection. A full description
    of these data is shown in Table 1, which also includes statistics for missing
    values. Table 1. Meteorological station data description. 4.1.2. ERA5-Land Reanalysis
    Data Advances in measurement technologies have enabled us to use various observation
    methods to monitor the Earth’s weather, including weather stations, weather balloons,
    and satellite imagery, to name a few. However the distribution of these observation
    methods does not cover the entire globe, they may have overlapping footprints
    between covered areas, and fewer of them were available in the past, which makes
    it challenging to conduct studies of past years. To deal with this, climate reanalysis
    emerges as a new way of trying to deliver a complete picture of the past and of
    the entire globe by combining the laws of physics, modern weather models, and
    available weather sources. Such data, if accurate, are crucial and will certainly
    assist decision making in several domains such as smart cities, smart management
    of renewable energy stations, sustainable and climate-smart agriculture [29,30],
    climate change assessments, hydrology [31], and much more. In our study, we used
    the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) [32] available to be downloaded
    for free through the Climate Data Store (CDS) web platform [33]. ERA5-Land is
    the successor to ERA5 [8], which in turn is the successor to ERA-Interim [34].
    This new product covers the period from 1950 to the present. ERA5-Land has the
    benefit over the predecessors of its high horizontal resolution (9 km against
    31 km for ERA5 and 80 km for ERA-Interim). These strengths were achieved thanks
    to the integration of the ECMWF land surface model forced by the ERA5 climate
    reanalysis with corrected elevation for the thermodynamic near-surface state and
    then applied to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. The data used in this
    study concern the two pixels that cover our study area (Figure 3). We downloaded
    ERA5-Land weather data from 2013 to 2020. Since the cloud service Climate Data
    Store API (cdsapi) has a limit of 100,000 records per request, we downloaded each
    year separately and combined them all at the end. The downloaded data were then
    converted to a pandas dataframe data structure using the Python language. We also
    developed a function called “get_era5_land_grib_as_dataframe”, available as a
    part of the GIS class of the public library Data Science Toolkit (DST) [35] that
    accepts an ERA5-Land grip file as a parameter and returns a pandas dataframe,
    which is the most commonly used data structure in the data science field. The
    full description of the downloaded parameters is described in Table 2. Figure
    3. The projection of ERA5-Land pixels over the study area. Table 2. ERA5-Land
    downloaded data description. 4.2. Data Storage Layer In our system, most of the
    collected data are time series (meteorological data, reanalysis data, satellite
    data, etc.). This type is characterized mainly by variety (multisource), volume,
    and velocity (each half-hour). To deal with this, the system uses MongoDB, a big-data-driven
    database for storing and retrieving meteorological data. The choice of using the
    MongoDB database comes after several strengths it presents and its suitability
    for our use case, including that it was designed to replace or enhance the classic
    Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), providing it with a variety of
    additional characteristics such as scalability being schema-less. It is also powerful
    at handling large amounts of real-time data and efficiently handling memory, as
    it is written using the C++ programming language. Not to mention the geospatial
    indexing feature, which makes it perfect for real-time geospatial data collection
    and analysis. Figure 4 shows the Entity Relationship Diagram of the weather data
    subcomponent. Figure 4. The Entity Relationship Diagram used in the climate database
    design; ta: air temperature (R3_Tair), rg: global solar radiation (R3_Rg), hr:
    air relative humidity (R3_Hr), p: rainfall (R3_P), ws: wind speed (R3_Vv), wd:
    wind direction (R3_Dv). 4.3. Data Processing Layer The data processing layer takes
    the data from the data storage layer as input and applies the statistical, machine
    learning, and deep learning models to gain insights from the data and turn that
    into services (Figure 2). 4.3.1. Statistical Models Statistical models are used
    in this platform for forecasting purposes. Initially, the model Facebook Prophet
    [36] was used to conduct long-term weather time series forecasting, since it was
    tested on the same data in previous work. 4.3.2. Machine Learning Models The system
    also makes use of machine learning models, given the fact that they can perform
    well on small datasets, for example, the XGBoost [37] model for reference evapotranspiration
    estimation based on stored metrological data [38]. 4.3.3. Deep Learning Models
    Deep learning models or neural networks have gained success in solving complex
    tasks that were previously human-specific and have required some level of human
    intelligence to be solved in different fields. They derive their power by trying
    to mimic the way the human brain works. They are composed of neurons able to process
    huge amounts of data in order to map the output from a set of inputs using internal
    mathematical operations. These neurons are organized into groups called layers
    and, during the propagation of signals between layers in two senses (Forward and
    backpropagation), the deep learning network learns to perform tasks. In our case,
    this is a regression task, where the input is ERA5-Land reanalysis data and the
    output is meteorological station data. 4.4. Application Layer The application
    layer contains multiple services related to weather times series. 4.4.1. Time
    Series Data Imputation Service It is common in real-world meteorological data
    to have missing values for various reasons. Missing values can be due to a network
    error or due to technical issues with certain measurement sensors, etc. These
    missing data can affect the performance of any type of model (machine learning,
    numerical, physical, etc.). As such, they need to be identified and handled efficiently
    during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing stages. There are
    several techniques for dealing with missing data depending on the use case: Deletion:
    Deleting rows or columns with missing values will remove this unwanted type of
    data from our dataset, but it may drastically reduce the size of the dataset,
    especially in the context of data scarcity. Imputation in time series data: In
    the case of a time series with a trend and seasonality, missing data can be replaced
    using seasonal adjustment, such as using the data from the same period of the
    previous year, which is the case for most weather data. However, this method may
    not be as efficient due to changes in weather patterns around the world. In contrast,
    if the time series do not present a trend or a seasonality, it can be treated
    the same way as imputation for a normal dataset. Imputation in normal datasets:
    Replacing it using statistical measures of central tendencies such as the mean,
    median, or mode of a given window of data that require some assumptions about
    the distribution type of the data to be efficient. This service proposes an approach
    based on reanalysis data and artificial intelligence to build models that can
    learn rules to map ERA5-Land reanalysis data to station meteorological data, which
    is also useful for the surrounding regions of our study area (Section 3), since
    we are in relatively homogeneous areas in terms of elevation and climate. We use
    the ERA5-Land data presented in Section 4.1.2 and two different architectures
    of deep learning models. The steps to implement the method workflow are shown
    in Figure 5. Figure 5. The flowchart of the deep learning approach. a. Exploratory
    data analysis Before implementing the proposed machine learning approach, exploratory
    data analysis (EDA) was the first exercise we conducted. It enabled us to understand
    our collected data, as well as to create hypotheses for further analysis and investigation.
    In this step, we made no underlying assumptions about the variables, and we were
    guided only by the observed data. We first calculated the correlation matrix (Figure
    6). This matrix allowed us to choose potential estimators for each target variable.
    Table 3 shows in the second column the potential estimators based on correlation
    coefficients (|r| > 0.5 means high relationships between variables). In the third
    column are the estimators that are used in the literature. Figure 6. The correlation
    heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the station and ERA5-Land parameters. Table
    3. Potential estimators of meteorological parameters. The variable 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 in
    the matrix is calculated using the rule of thumb (Equation (1)), which uses both
    air temperature ( 𝑡2𝑚 ) and dewpoint temperature ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) to estimate air relative
    humidity efficiently for moist air (relative humidity above 50 percent) [39].
    According to the matrix, 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 has a high negative correlation with 𝑡2𝑚 but a
    very weak correlation with 𝑑2𝑚 . Despite this, using the latter ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) combined
    with 𝑡2𝑚 gives a correlation of 0.87 for 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 instead of −0.77, if we take
    only 𝑡2𝑚 into consideration. This motivated us to take both variables as input
    to neural networks for the estimation of 𝑅3 _ 𝐻𝑟 . This is also a confirmation
    for other rule-based (physics-based) approximations that use the same variables
    for air relative humidity estimation derived from the Magnus formula [40] (Equation
    (2)). 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟=100−5(𝑡2𝑚−𝑑2𝑚) (1) 𝑑2𝑚= 𝜆(ln( 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 ))+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 𝛽−(ln(
    𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 )+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 ) (2) Equation (2) is valid for air temperatures ranging
    from −45 to 60 degrees Celsius, the Magnus parameters are, in this case, 𝛽 = 17.62
    and 𝜆 = 243.12 degrees Celsius. For global solar radiation ( 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔 ), the study
    uses the surface solar radiation downwards (ssrd) as estimator. Since the objective
    is to predict meteorological station data based only on ERA5-Land data, we evaluated
    the performance of two deep learning models, namely a Feed Forward Neural Network
    (FFNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict 𝑅3_𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 , 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔
    given the ssrd, and 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 and 𝑑2𝑚 . b. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN):
    In this type of neural network, the input signals (ERA5-Land data) are fed into
    the input layer composed of 100 neurons. In each neuron, the data are processed,
    taking the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias and then applying an activation
    function (Figure 7), before forwarding the output to the next layer. The activation
    function introduces nonlinearity to the output. The choice of this function has
    a real impact on the training process and performance of models and must be chosen
    according to the problem at hand. For example, sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
    activation functions (Equations (3) and (4)) can be used to capture nonlinearity
    that may exist between inputs and outputs. Figure 7. A single neuron model. For
    our case, and given the fact that moving from ERA5-Land reanalysis data to meteorological
    station data is the inverse of inference in statistics, that is, estimating the
    mean of an individual (station data) given the mean of the population (ERA5-Land
    pixels), the error with this assumption is supposed to be linear (polynomial of
    degree one); that said, we used the Rectified Linear Unit function (ReLU) (Equation
    (5)) as the activation function in our neural network layers, which is true for
    both proposed architectures (FFNN and LSTM). 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)= 1 1+ 𝑒 𝑥 (3) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=tanh(𝑥)=
    𝑒 𝑥 − 𝑒 −𝑥 𝑒 𝑥 + 𝑒 −𝑥 (4) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑥)={ 0, x, if𝑥<0 if𝑥≥0 (5) c. Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM): The choice behind using this neural network as a comparison is
    due to its ability to deal with data that have long-term dependency, which is
    the case for climate data. LSTM belongs to the Recurrent Neural Networks family
    (RNN), and therefore also has an internal recurrence, that is, during the learning
    process, a signal is fed back to a neuron or layer that has already received and
    processed it (Figure 8), as well as its ability to remember data through gated
    cells, which are a kind of memory that accept values in the interval [0, 1] and
    are used to decide when the flow of a signal passes through the corresponding
    neuron. LSTM was first developed to resolve the limitations of the vanishing [41]
    and exploding gradient problems that may occur during the training phase. This
    problem stops the learning of the neural network because the updates to the various
    weights become very small. Figure 8. Architectures of FFNN and LSTM used in the
    approach. These two architectures (Figure 8) are trained using the Mean Squared
    Error (MSE) as a loss or cost function that enables calculating the error of a
    network at the end of a forward pass. To optimize the network weights, we used
    the adaptive moment estimation optimization algorithm (Adam), which is characterized
    by fast convergence to the optimal solution and combines the strengths of other
    optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and RMSProp
    during the training phase. Like most other optimization algorithms, Adam uses
    the partial derivative during backward propagation to calculate the error function
    with respect to each weight within the network (Equation (6)). The Adam algorithm
    then updates the network weights for a minimized loss or cost function using rules
    in Equations (7), (8) and (9), respectively. 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑= ∂𝐽 ∂𝜃 (6) 𝑚 𝑡 = 𝛽 1 𝑚 𝑡−1 +(1−

    (9) d. Data normalization Data normalization is performed as part of the data
    preprocessing step and is the process of bringing data to a similar scale. The
    process is also known as feature scaling. In some cases, such as for statistical
    machine learning models, it may not be beneficial, but for deep learning models,
    it is proven to help models to perform better [42,43] in terms of faster convergence,
    reduced training time, and improved stability (preventing models from oscillating
    or divergence). There are multiple methods for data normalization: Min–max standardization:
    Min–max scales the feature values between [0, 1], with 0 being the feature’s minimum
    value and 1 being its maximum value, while maintaining the original distribution
    (Equation (10)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) (10) Decimal scaling: This form
    of scaling is used where values of different decimal ranges are present. For example,
    two features with different bounds can be brought to a similar scale using decimal
    scaling (Equation (11)) 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥 10 𝑛 (11) Such that n is an integer representing
    the order of the scalings. Z-score: This transformation scales the value toward
    a normal distribution with a zero mean and unit variance using the z-score formula
    (Equation (12)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝜇 𝜎 (12) such that 𝜇 is the mean and 𝜎 is the standard
    deviation of the features’ distribution. This method is very efficient for datasets
    with a Gaussian distribution. In our case, we applied the min–max method (Equation
    (10)). Next, we initialize the hyperparameters of the two proposed architectures
    (Table 4). These parameters are not updated during the learning phase. Table 4.
    Hyperparameters used during the training of FFNN and LSTM models. e. Dataset splitting
    Before training begins, we split our dataset into three sets: training, validation,
    and test sets. The validation set is used to assess the performance of the model
    during each epoch of the training phase. Next, the test set is used to evaluate
    the final trained model. We used 80–20% splitting for the training–test sets,
    respectively, and took 20% of the 80% for the validation set. f. Evaluation Metrics
    To evaluate the trained deep learning models’ performance on the test dataset,
    we employed the most commonly used metrics for regression tasks (Equations (13)–(16)):
    Training time: The time it takes for the model to complete 20 epochs. R2 score
    or R2: The coefficient of determination informs about how well the unknown samples
    will be predicted by our model. It ranges between 0 and 1, but it can be negative
    as well (Equation (13)). R 2 =1− ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 )
    2 (13) The Pearson correlation coefficient (R): It measures the linear relationship
    between two normal distributed variables (Equation (14)). R= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥
    ̲ )( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 ̲ ) 2 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − √ (14) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The average of the squares
    of the errors between real and predicted values by the model (Equation (15)).
    RMSE= 1 𝑛 ∑ 1 𝑛 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (15) Mean
    Absolute Error (MAE): This is the average of absolute errors between real and
    predicted values (Equation (16)). MAE= ∑ 𝑛 1 | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 | 𝑛 (16) Given the
    fact that we applied the scaling in our data using the formula in Equation (10),
    all metrics (from Equations (13) to (16)) are unitless. 4.4.2. Forecasting Service
    The forecasting service helps make projections of the future state of the atmosphere
    (air temperature, air relative humidity, global solar radiation, etc.) by performing
    a univariate time series forecasting task. The Facebook Prophet model is used
    according on the performance it has provided when trained and evaluated using
    the same meteorological dataset to perform long-term weather forecasting tasks.
    4.4.3. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation Service One of the most
    important agricultural practices in the day-to-day life of a farmer is irrigation.
    To achieve efficiency, we need to accurately estimate crops’ water needs at each
    phase of crop growth throughout the agricultural season. This can be performed
    through several methods, among others is the estimation of the evapotranspiration
    (ET). It indicates the amount of water loss caused by transpiration from the crop
    and soil surface evaporation. We can obtain the ET of a crop (ETc) by multiplying
    the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient Kc, which holds all
    the physical and physiological differences of a given crop. This service proposes
    to estimate the ET0 using machine learning, namely the XGBoost model constrained
    by the physical model FAO Penman–Monteith. The proposed approach follows the steps
    presented in Figure 9. First, we resampled the air temperature, global solar radiation,
    air relative humidity, and wind speed to the daily average, and precipitation
    to the cumulative daily values, and then the missing values were deleted. Figure
    9. The flowchart of the proposed method. To select the most important contributor
    variables to the ET0 estimate, the method uses a random-forest-based technique
    that ranks the importance of features based on their occurrences in nodes across
    all trees: the bar chart (Figure 10) shows sorted meteorological variables’ importance
    scores. Next, the dataset containing meteorological data and the corresponding
    FAO Penman–Monteith ET0 estimated values are split and fed into the XGBoost model,
    and the model is then evaluated. Figure 10. The features’ importance bar chart
    of meteorological parameters. The objective of this service is to provide an alternative
    to the FAO Penman–Monteith calculation procedure by learning the behavior of this
    procedure using a limited number of climatic variables (Figure 11). It is either
    suitable for stations that lack the necessary hardware and sensors to provide
    the entire set of meteorological data required for FAO Penman–Monteith or in the
    case of technical problems with sensors, among other things. Figure 11. The logic
    of the Evapotranspiration estimation component. 4.4.4. Weather Data Analysis and
    Visualization Service It is well-known that data in their raw form are useless,
    but the information, knowledge, and wisdom derived from them are not. Moving from
    one state of data to another is known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD),
    which is a subset of the modern data science field and can be performed using
    various methods, such as CRISP-DM [44], which stands for CRoss-Industry Standard
    Process for Data Mining, or the proposed standard method in [45]. One example
    of insights data visualization and analysis which can be given in our use case
    is shown in Figure 12. This is achieved by following a hybrid methodology that
    includes the following steps: collecting, storing, cleaning, visualizing, analyzing,
    and mining. Figure 12. An example of the data analysis scenario. The first three
    steps are common for all other services available on the platform. The added value
    of this service is providing different types of visualization options, including
    comparison plots (line charts of weather time series), relationship plots (scatter
    plot of weather data), and automatically generating correlation heat maps, which
    are important steps in the data analysis phase to study how one variable affects
    another. 4.4.5. Custom Early Warning Alerts Service This service is classified
    as an outlier or anomaly detection problem. These special types of data can be
    detected in time series by using, among others, rule-based methods, in which case
    the service alerts administrators via SMS and email once the given condition is
    satisfied. An example of such a condition is a threshold of temperature or rainfall.
    The second method of sending warnings is to identify sequences that are notably
    different from the rest of the historical time series data. These sequences can
    be the result of measurement error or noise and can inform administrators about
    the status of the different sensors installed in the meteorological station and
    inform them about events that could require urgent action. To perform this, we
    use unsupervised machine learning methods that do not require an annotated series
    of anomalies to be trained, in contrast to supervised machine learning algorithms.
    The unsupervised method we used is Local Outlier Factor ( 𝐿𝑂𝐹 ) [46]. It uses
    the KNN algorithm principle to calculate the distance of a point with respect
    to its neighbors. This distance is used, in turn, to obtain the Reachability Density
    ( 𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (17)). 𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )=𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐾−𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑗 ),𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑖 ,
    𝑥 𝑗 )) (17) Next is measuring the local deviation of the density of a given point
    using Local Reachability Density ( 𝐿𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (18)), which tells us how far
    the point is from the nearest dense cluster of points. 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥)= 1 ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁
    𝑘 (𝑥) 𝑅𝐷(𝑥, 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| (18) where 𝑁𝑘(𝑥) is the number of neighbors of
    x whose distance from x is not greater than the k-distance. As a final step, the
    algorithm calculates the 𝐿𝑂𝐹 (Equation (19)). Conventionally the points that have
    a higher anomaly score than their neighbors 𝐿𝑂𝐹 > 1) will be considered as potential
    outliers, but that is not always true, since in anomaly detection there is no
    clear and standard validation approach, and the final decision must relies on
    domain expertise to consider the detected point as an outlier or not, and the
    role of the service ends by notifying the administrators and letting them decide.
    𝐿𝑂 𝐹 𝑘 (𝑥)= ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁 𝑘 𝐿𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| × 1 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥) (19) 5. Results
    and Discussions 5.1. Time Series Data Imputation As a result, for handling missing
    data using deep learning, Figure 13 shows the curves for the loss function (MSE)
    and R2 in both training and validation sets during each epoch. For both architectures
    (FFNN and LSTM), the learning curves indicate a good fit of the model represented
    by an initially high training loss that steadily decreases as more training instances
    are added and flattens over time (0.04 for air temperature, 0.098 for global solar
    radiation, and 0.116 for air relative humidity), and the same way for R2, which
    begins with nonoptimal values in training and validation and converges to stable
    change (0.96 for air temperature, 0.84 for global solar radiation, and 0.77 for
    air relative humidity). Table 5 shows the performance comparisons between the
    two deep learning architectures used in the test set. Figure 13. Monitoring of
    MSE and R2 during training and validation phases: air temperature: (a) FFNN, (b)
    LSTM, global solar radiation: (c) FFNN, (d) LSTM, air relative humidity: (e) FFNN,
    (f) LSTM. Table 5. Performance of deep learning models. Table 5 shows the performance
    comparisons between the two deep learning models used in the test set. Once trained,
    the final deep learning model will be ready for deployment in the production environment
    and used to make inferences about meteorological station data given the ERA5-Land
    data. In contrast to Numerical Methods for Weather Prediction (NWP), which take
    considerable time to run [47], predictions based on our model are made instantly.
    5.2. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation We split our dataset into
    five randomly shuffled parts (five folds). We used one fold for model evaluation
    and the remaining four to train it. Finally, we assess the model’s performance
    by calculating the regression metrics across the five folds of the dataset (Root
    Mean Squared Error RMSE and the coefficient of determination R2). According to
    the results of Table 6, the main point is not the perfect results obtained by
    using all parameters as estimators but using only air temperature and global solar
    radiation (average RMSE = 0.27 and average R2 = 0.93), which gave promising results.
    This represents a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0
    by combining two criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using
    limited and simple-to-obtain meteorological variables (air temperature with global
    solar radiation or only air temperature). Table 6. Cross-validation results for
    the three scenarios. According to the results, the proposed method represents
    a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0 by combining two
    criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using limited and simple-to-obtain
    meteorological variables (air temperature with global solar radiation or only
    air temperature). The results obtained are in agreement with the approach followed
    in [48] for the most contributing variables for ET0 estimation, but it outperforms
    it in terms of RMSE (0.19). In addition, the XGboost model used in this study
    outperforms [49] when using all meteorological variables to train a neural network
    (RMSE = 0.19). 5.3. Prototype of the System The platform is named “FLA7A”, which
    means agriculture in Arabic. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the platform’s dashboard.
    By default, it contains the real-time visualization of the last three days of
    hourly weather data (line charts). However, the user can customize the period
    according to their needs. Figure 14. A screenshot of the platform’s real-time
    weather time series visualization service. The black dots represent the original
    measurements, while the black line represents the linear interpolation of the
    dots. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the dashboard that visualizes the last three
    days of hourly weather data. Figure 15 shows the interface of the forecasting
    service. By default, the forecasting period is set to one year. However, the user
    can change this parameter and also customize the number of years it will take
    into consideration when training the model. As mentioned in Section 4.4.2, the
    service initially uses the statistical model Facebook Prophet, which is powerful
    in long-term forecasting. In future work, the platform will integrate more models,
    especially those known for their performance in the task of short-term and mid-term
    weather forecasting, as surveyed in [50]. Figure 15. A screenshot of the platform’s
    forecast service. The light blue is the uncertainty bounds of the uncertainty
    interval around the final predictions (upper and lower), while the dark blue is
    the predicted values, and the black dots represent our original data. This platform
    is the first incremental step towards our goal of creating a decision support
    system intended to implement smart agriculture in Morocco by using artificial
    intelligence and data science to solve real-life problems facing farmers. More
    studies will be performed to add and optimize different parts of this system.
    For example, for data storage, we used MongoDB as a database to deal with real-time
    big data, however, in terms of system scalability or dealing with batch processing
    or long-running ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) jobs, other technologies should
    be considered. A potential candidate for this could be other NoSQL databases [51]
    or the Hadoop ecosystem (Spark, MapReduce, Hive, etc.) [52,53]. Additionally,
    MongoDB has fault tolerance issues, which is true of practically all distributed
    databases. Moreover, in the proposed deep learning method to deal with missing
    data, we do not cover hyperparameter fine-tuning [54], which is one of the biggest
    drawbacks to using deep neural networks. This task can be performed using GridSearch
    [55] or other optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms or the Monte
    Carlo method, which can lead to better results. Despite this, we found promising
    results, confirming the reliability of the ERA5-Land reanalysis data for our study
    area, which could lead to the application of this method using several stations
    in regions with challenging conditions. Finally, for the anomaly detection part,
    we presented an unsupervised machine learning method that is based on how isolated
    a measure is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood to alert administrators
    via SMS and emails, but other efficient methods can be investigated, such as Conformal
    Anomaly Detection (CAP) [56,57]. 6. Conclusions The work conducted in this paper
    makes use of artificial intelligence and big data analytics to develop a platform
    intended for intelligent weather data management, which is essential to implementing
    smart and sustainable agriculture in Morocco. The platform exploits huge amounts
    of generated data to gain insights and help assist decision making. The proposed
    platform offers a number of weather-data-related services such as handling missing
    data, visualization, analysis, estimation, and forecasting. Combining ERA5-Land
    reanalysis data and deep learning algorithms to learn the relationship between
    the two data sources gave promising results (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.04) for the
    air temperature variable. The same is true for the estimation of the reference
    evapotranspiration using XGBoost (R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.07). The platform is
    designed to be service-oriented and will incorporate other services and solutions
    to help farmers and policymakers. Author Contributions Platform and machine learning

  description: Climatic factors affect various stages of plant growth, thereby affecting
    agricultural productivity and production stability. The growth and development
    of various tissues and organs during the complete growth period of plants are
    affected by changes in climate and environment. The genotype is the internal cause
    for the expression of the phenotype, while the environment is the external conditions
    for the appearance of various morphological characteristics. With the rapid progress
    of high-throughput plant phenotype measurement technology, combined with genomics,
    bioinformatics, and big data computing, plant phenotyping will greatly promote
    the process of functional genomics research and crop molecular breeding and efficient
    cultivation. Phenotypes can effectively track the links between genotypes, environmental
    factors, and phenotypes. Without detailed phenotype data, it is difficult to fully
    understand the complex effects of genomic and environmental factors on plant phenotypes.
    Therefore, difficulties in plant scientific research are gradually shifting from
    genetic analysis to phenotypic analysis. Plant phenotyping began at the end of
    the 20th century, and its core was to obtain high-quality, reproducible trait
    data, and then quantify the interactions of genotype and environment and their
    impact on key traits related to yield, quality, and stress resistance. As more
    and more plant and trait parameters must be measured quickly and accurately, many
    of the world's top scientific research institutions have shifted their research
    focus to solving practical problems such as experimental design, quantitative
    analysis, and interpretation of conclusions. Characterizing key traits through
    phenotypic analysis can provide big data-based decision support for breeding,
    cultivation, and agricultural practices. Plant genomes have undergone rapid development
    in recent years, but the lack of sufficient phenotypic data has limited human
    ability to parse quantitative trait genetics. This can be addressed by developing
    a plant phenotypic information collection platform and performing image analysis.
    High-throughput, automated, high resolution plant phenotypic information collection
    platforms and analytical technologies are critical to the acceleration of plant
    improvement and breeding, increasing yield, and resistance to pests and diseases.
    These systems are used to analyze genomic information and quantitatively study
    complex traits related to growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress.
    It is an important pathway for integration, which can fulfill the gaps between
    genomic information and plant phenotypic plasticity. With the growth in the demands
    of scientific research and the development of imaging sensor technology, it has
    become possible to collect high-throughput, high-efficiency, high-precision, low-error,
    and low cost automatic phenotypic information. The data monitored by imaging sensors
    is objective and can monitor and analyze plants in real time. Therefore, automatic
    phenotype information collection technology has begun to be widely used in plant
    phenotype information collection platforms. With the development of modern and
    intelligent agricultural equipment, scholars hope to discover functionally diverse
    species and compare performance and plant response to the environment in a large
    number of plants. To generate a correlation between phenotypic traits, genes,
    environment, and expression, high-throughput plant phenotype information collection
    has been invented. High-throughput refers to the ability to measure more samples
    and/or more data points than manual phenotyping, not only with a high number of
    samples per unit time, but also with the synchronization and efficiency of data
    processing and parameter acquisition. The hardware platform scans the source data
    to match. High-throughput phenotyping relies on rapid transportation, automated
    sensing, data acquisition, data analysis methods and technical equipment, and
    is carried out by various sensors, such as CCD camera, near-infrared instrument,
    infrared instrument, thermal imager, spectral imager, fluorescence imager, etc.,
    to monitor indoor and field plants, so as to obtain more phenotypic parameters
    in a short time. Due to the huge potential of plant phenotype information collection
    technology in the agricultural field, scientific research institutions and enterprises
    in various countries are actively developing and constructing high-throughput
    plant phenotype information collection platforms. Phenotypic data collection and
    analysis methods are the core part of plant phenotyping research, including indoor
    and outdoor parts. Modern indoor high-throughput plant phenotype detection platforms
    generally detect plants closely related to plant genetics and variation through
    automated transmission equipment and integrated sensors (such as visible light,
    near-infrared, far-infrared, fluorescence, multispectral, laser, hyperspectral,
    etc.). The acquisition of a plant dynamic growth and developmental phenotype dataset.
    Its advantages are high resolution, high controllability and high-throughput,
    which can provide high-quality multidimensional images and experimental data for
    subsequent plant phenotyping. Whether it is aboveground or underground, indoor
    phenotype monitoring usually takes the individual plant as the unit and describes
    the population characteristics by collecting the characteristics of the individual
    plant. Depending on the image sensor accuracy, the extracted phenotypic data can
    often be accurate down to the tissue cell level. Thus, the scale division of indoor
    phenotypic traits can range from populations to histiocytes. Field-oriented plant
    phenotyping platforms provide accurate and continuous collection of single leaves
    or plant organs, single plants, small plots, and entire farms from proximal to
    long distances, mainly including vehicle-mounted, self-propelled, gantry, and
    suspension as well as several types such as drones, aerial remote sensing and
    spectral satellite imaging. The field high-throughput platform mainly includes
    two types of field machinery and UAVs equipped with multi-sensors, which can achieve
    rapid and non-destructive acquisition of plant population phenotype information
    under field conditions. The combination of agricultural machinery and equipment
    with a multi-sensor platform can effectively reduce the variation in measurement
    results but is limited by the distribution of crops and soil conditions after
    irrigation. Therefore, it is difficult to quickly realize cross-regional applications,
    the operation efficiency is low, and it cannot be used over a large range. However,
    the rapid analysis of field crop phenotype information based on an UAV-equipped
    multi-sensor platform has high technical efficiency and low cost and is suitable
    for complex farmland environments. It has a wide range of applications in the
    analysis of crop height, chlorophyll content, LAI, disease susceptibility, drought
    stress sensitivity, nitrogen content and yield, making it an important means to
    obtain crop phenotype information. Plant roots are an important part of plants
    and have very important functions such as water and nutrient absorption and transport,
    organic matter storage, plant anchoring, and interaction with soil. Since roots
    grow underground, the core of collecting root phenotypes is how to visualize roots
    growing under natural conditions. Therefore, the collection and analysis of root
    phenotypic traits has become the focus and challenge of biological and phenotypic
    research. At present, the research progress of cultivation and improvement based
    on root traits is very slow, and the screening of root traits is still a very
    time-consuming task. Researchers must continue to develop systematic and large-scale
    high-throughput root phenotyping platforms suitable for different cultivation
    goals, so as to accelerate the screening of root traits and the understanding
    of root function, and to gain an in-depth understanding of how root traits are
    related to whole plant stress resistance strategies correlate to increase crop
    productivity and ultimately successfully identify key root traits for crop improvement.
    In recent years, with the continuous development of remote sensing and related
    sensor technologies, a variety of non-destructive plant detection technologies
    have emerged, providing effective means for crop phenotype monitoring, disease
    and insect pest monitoring, and crop identification. RGB cameras are a relatively
    common sensor device in crop phenotyping technology. In the experiment, a digital
    camera with visible light imaging on a UAV can be used to improve the efficiency
    of data collection and achieve rapid acquisition of high-definition images. It
    can be used to monitor crop emergence during agricultural production, rate, flowering
    dynamics, canopy coverage, and lodging. Thermal imaging sensors use an infrared
    detector and an optical imaging lens to receive infrared radiation energy in a
    photosensitive element infrared detector. Infrared imaging technology is used
    to measure plant canopy temperature to infer plant water use efficiency and photosynthesis
    efficiency. It is also used to measure the response of crops to osmotic stress
    such as salinity or drought. It can also measure the impact of other abiotic stresses
    on organisms and detect the presence of pests in the grain. Because the crop canopy
    temperature changes with time, conventional handheld infrared temperature measurement
    equipment is limited by its low measurement efficiency, and it is difficult to
    be widely used in large-scale breeding areas. However, UAVs are equipped with
    thermal imagers for breeding areas, where canopy temperature provides a new efficient
    and reliable method. At present, thermal infrared technology is increasingly used
    in the field of precision agriculture. To ensure stable agricultural production,
    increased production and food security, optimized agricultural production structure,
    and a reduction in the use of pesticides and fertilizers, it is necessary to accurately
    monitor and warn the occurrence of diseases during agricultural production. Experts
    at home and abroad have carried out a series of thermal infrared imaging technology
    to detect crop disease research. The importance of data interpretation in phenotyping
    research cannot be overstated. With the continuous development of phenotyping
    platforms and related technologies at home and abroad, the current plant high-throughput
    phenotyping platform can obtain massive digital images, point cloud data, spectral
    imaging and thermal imaging data, and undergo geometric correction, radiometric
    correction, and data modeling. And a series of processing processes, and finally
    realize the use of remote sensing means to analyze plant phenotype information.
    High-throughput phenotyping is expected to become the latest tool for sustainable
    production under global climate change. However, at present, there are few plant
    species as the research objects of plant phenotype information, and there is a
    lack of analysis and identification of plant phenotype information in complex
    natural environments. The breadth and depth of plant phenotype analysis research
    must be continuously expanded to establish a unified plant phenotype monitoring
    system and specifications, form a network resource sharing library, and strengthen
    mutual cooperation among developers of various phenotype platforms. Using modern
    mathematical analysis methods, the rapidity and effectiveness of the algorithm
    can be achieved in image processing and recognition software design to improve
    the analysis ability of the analysis module of the plant phenotype monitoring
    system. It is necessary to use multi-domain knowledge to carry out comprehensive
    control and establish background expert decision-making support systems to automatically
    monitor and analyze target plants in real time.

    Abstract Climatic factors affect various stages of plant growth, thereby affecting
    agricultural productivity and production stability. The growth and development
    of various tissues and organs during the complete growth period of plants are
    affected by changes in climate and environment. The genotype is the internal cause
    for the expression of the phenotype, while the environment is the external conditions
    for the appearance of various morphological characteristics. With the rapid progress
    of high-throughput plant phenotype measurement technology, combined with genomics,
    bioinformatics, and big data computing, plant phenotyping will greatly promote
    the process of functional genomics research and crop molecular breeding and efficient
    cultivation. Phenotypes can effectively track the links between genotypes, environmental
    factors, and phenotypes. Without detailed phenotype data, it is difficult to fully
    understand the complex effects of genomic and environmental factors on plant phenotypes.
    Therefore, difficulties in plant scientific research are gradually shifting from
    genetic analysis to phenotypic analysis. Plant phenotyping began at the end of
    the 20th century, and its core was to obtain high-quality, reproducible trait
    data, and then quantify the interactions of genotype and environment and their
    impact on key traits related to yield, quality, and stress resistance. As more
    and more plant and trait parameters must be measured quickly and accurately, many
    of the world''s top scientific research institutions have shifted their research
    focus to solving practical problems such as experimental design, quantitative
    analysis, and interpretation of conclusions. Characterizing key traits through
    phenotypic analysis can provide big data-based decision support for breeding,
    cultivation, and agricultural practices. Plant genomes have undergone rapid development
    in recent years, but the lack of sufficient phenotypic data has limited human
    ability to parse quantitative trait genetics. This can be addressed by developing
    a plant phenotypic information collection platform and performing image analysis.
    High-throughput, automated, high resolution plant phenotypic information collection
    platforms and analytical technologies are critical to the acceleration of plant
    improvement and breeding, increasing yield, and resistance to pests and diseases.
    These systems are used to analyze genomic information and quantitatively study
    complex traits related to growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress.
    It is an important pathway for integration, which can fulfill the gaps between
    genomic information and plant phenotypic plasticity. With the growth in the demands
    of scientific research and the development of imaging sensor technology, it has
    become possible to collect high-throughput, high-efficiency, high-precision, low-error,
    and low cost automatic phenotypic information. The data monitored by imaging sensors
    is objective and can monitor and analyze plants in real time. Therefore, automatic
    phenotype information collection technology has begun to be widely used in plant
    phenotype information collection platforms. With the development of modern and
    intelligent agricultural equipment, scholars hope to discover functionally diverse
    species and compare performance and plant response to the environment in a large
    number of plants. To generate a correlation between phenotypic traits, genes,
    environment, and expression, high-throughput plant phenotype information collection
    has been invented. High-throughput refers to the ability to measure more samples
    and/or more data points than manual phenotyping, not only with a high number of
    samples per unit time, but also with the synchronization and efficiency of data
    processing and parameter acquisition. The hardware platform scans the source data
    to match. High-throughput phenotyping relies on rapid transportation, automated
    sensing, data acquisition, data analysis methods and technical equipment, and
    is carried out by various sensors, such as CCD camera, near-infrared instrument,
    infrared instrument, thermal imager, spectral imager, fluorescence imager, etc.,
    to monitor indoor and field plants, so as to obtain more phenotypic parameters
    in a short time. Due to the huge potential of plant phenotype information collection
    technology in the agricultural field, scientific research institutions and enterprises
    in various countries are actively developing and constructing high-throughput
    plant phenotype information collection platforms. Phenotypic data collection and
    analysis methods are the core part of plant phenotyping research, including indoor
    and outdoor parts. Modern indoor high-throughput plant phenotype detection platforms
    generally detect plants closely related to plant genetics and variation through
    automated transmission equipment and integrated sensors (such as visible light,
    near-infrared, far-infrared, fluorescence, multispectral, laser, hyperspectral,
    etc.). The acquisition of a plant dynamic growth and developmental phenotype dataset.
    Its advantages are high resolution, high controllability and high-throughput,
    which can provide high-quality multidimensional images and experimental data for
    subsequent plant phenotyping. Whether it is aboveground or underground, indoor
    phenotype monitoring usually takes the individual plant as the unit and describes
    the population characteristics by collecting the characteristics of the individual
    plant. Depending on the image sensor accuracy, the extracted phenotypic data can
    often be accurate down to the tissue cell level. Thus, the scale division of indoor
    phenotypic traits can range from populations to histiocytes. Field-oriented plant
    phenotyping platforms provide accurate and continuous collection of single leaves

    The majority of countries rely largely on agriculture for employment. Irrigation
    accounts for a sizable amount of water use. Crop irrigation is an important step
    in crop yield prediction. Field harvesting is very reliant on human supervision
    and experience. It is critical to safeguard the field’s water supply. The shortage
    of fresh water is a major challenge for the world, and the situation will deteriorate
    further in the next years. As a result of the aforementioned challenges, smart
    irrigation and precision farming are the only viable solutions. Only with the
    emergence of the Internet of Things and machine learning have smart irrigation
    and precision agriculture become economically viable. Increased efficiency, expense
    optimization, energy maximization, forecasting, and general public convenience
    are all benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT). As systems and data processing
    become more diversified, security issues arise. Security and privacy concerns
    are impeding the growth of the Internet of Things. This article establishes a
    framework for detecting and classifying intrusions into IoT networks used in agriculture.
    Security and privacy are major concerns not only in agriculture-related IoT networks
    but in all applications of the Internet of Things as well. In this framework,
    the NSL KDD data set is used as an input data set. In the preprocessing of the
    NSL-KDD data set, first all symbolic features are converted to numeric features.
    Feature extraction is performed using principal component analysis. Then, machine
    learning algorithms such as support vector machine, linear regression, and random
    forest are used to classify preprocessed data set. Performance comparisons of
    machine learning algorithms are evaluated on the basis of accuracy, precision,
    and recall parameters. 1. Introduction Agriculture is very important to the country’s
    economic well-being because it provides food for everyone. One of the most important
    things that happened in the country is linked to it. If a country has a lot of
    farmers, it is thought to be both economically and socially wealthy. Agriculture
    is the main source of jobs in most countries. When there are a lot of people on
    a big farm, they often need help with planting and caring for the animals. These
    large farms can use nearby processing facilities to finish and improve their agricultural
    goods [ 1]. As human civilization has progressed, there have been big changes
    in agricultural output. These changes have made it possible to use less resources
    and carry out less work. Despite this, demand and supply have never been able
    to meet due to the high population density. In 2050, the world’s population is
    expected to grow to 9.8 billion people, a 25 percent increase over the current
    amount [ 1]. There is a strong likelihood that the majority of population growth
    will occur in developing countries [ 2]. Despite this, 70 percent of the world’s
    population is anticipated to live in cities by 2050, up from 49 percent now [
    3]. In addition, as incomes rise, so will the need for food, particularly in developing
    countries. As a result, these countries will become more aware of the quality
    of their food and diet. As a result, consumers’ tastes may move away from grains
    and cereals toward legumes and, eventually, meat. In agriculture, water is a valuable
    yet finite natural resource [ 4– 6]. In a country like India, a considerable amount
    of water is used for irrigation [ 7]. Many environmental conditions influence
    crop productivity, including air temperature, soil temperature, and humidity [
    8]. Crop irrigation is an important component in affecting crop output [ 8]. Farmers
    rely substantially on human supervision and experience for harvesting fields [
    9]. The water supply for the field must be preserved [ 10]. In today’s globe,
    water scarcity is a big issue. It is already a problem for people all across the
    world [ 11, 12]. The scenario could get even worse in the coming years. Smart
    farming is a term that refers to a well-known and better way to run a farm that
    has become more common in modern farming. Agricultural and information technologies
    are used to keep an eye on the health and production of crops. This includes keeping
    an eye on field crop conditions and other indicators [ 13, 14]. Finally, the goal
    of smart farming is to cut the cost of agricultural inputs while still keeping
    the quality of the end product the same. If you use a lot of pesticide or fertilizer
    at the same time, the whole field is treated as a single unit. The principal sources
    of natural water resources are rainwater, subterranean water, and surface water.
    96.5 percent of the world’s water is found in the oceans. Only 0.001 percent of
    the remaining water on the globe can be found in clouds, mist, and precipitation,
    which is 1.7 percent of the world’s total water supply. The majority of the world’s
    surface water is found in the ocean, which is made up of salt water. Therefore,
    there is a shortage of fresh water in most of the countries around the world.
    The survival of all ecosystems depends on the availability of fresh water. According
    to the World Resources Institute (WRI), most of the countries are expected to
    face water scarcity in upcoming years [ 15]. There is a considerable impact on
    downstream ecosystems due to the vast majority of freshwater being used for agricultural
    and industrial uses. There is a need to utilize fresh water in such a way that
    the upcoming generations do not get affected by the scarcity of fresh water. The
    soil contains a variety of soil types, including sandy, salty, and clayey soils.
    Each type of soil has its own advantages and disadvantages. A good example of
    this is sandy soil, which has a high capacity for drainage. Drainage, on the other
    hand, swiftly removes nutrients from the soil. The soil’s properties are crucial
    to determining how much water a plant needs [ 16]. Agricultural jobs, in particular,
    can benefit greatly from data mining approaches. One of these operations is the
    use of association rule restrictions to regulate water use in agricultural areas.
    In addition, the Internet of Things has made smart farming possible by various
    data acquisition and storage techniques. Field values for optimal plant irrigation
    are collected by smart sensor networks in modern irrigation systems. Machine learning
    is used in a wide range of real-world applications such as smart farming, smart
    healthcare, smart logistics, and smart production. In the framework [ 17], data
    are acquired using soil and moisture sensors, and then they are stored on a centralized
    cloud server. On a cloud server, various analytics are performed using machine
    learning algorithms. This framework provides the exact water quantity required
    for a particular crop. This framework is shown in Figure 1.    Figure 1  A framework
    for smart irrigation. An IoT-enabled global smart city concept is possible. There
    are many different types of intelligent communities, such as smart homes, smart
    farms, smart environments, smart fitness, and smart governance, for example. Additionally,
    the Internet of Things is employed in the oil and gas extraction, manufacturing,
    and refining industries. The Internet of Things (IoT) improves efficiency, optimizes
    costs, maximizes energy utilization, maintains forecasts, and provides a great
    deal of convenience for the general public. Security concerns are increasing as
    more and more systems and data processing become more diversified. Security and
    privacy concerns are the primary impediments to the growth of the Internet of
    Things. Computer security is the act of securing computer systems from external
    threats in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
    computing resources. When an intrusion occurs, the network resources and the victim
    server are put in danger [ 18]. System administrators can take action if intrusions
    are detected by the intrusion detection system (IDS) because it monitors and reports
    on intrusions. As the number of cyberattacks has risen, so has people’s mistrust
    of the Internet. A denial of service (DoS) is a well-executed security attack
    (DoS). It is possible to use IDS to detect attacks from the outside as well as
    from within a company’s computer network. It looks like a burglar alarm, but an
    intrusion detection system is different. It is proposed in this article a framework
    for detecting and categorizing intrusions into Internet of Things networks that
    are utilized in agriculture. Security and privacy are important considerations
    not only in IoT networks linked to agriculture but also in all Internet of Things
    applications in general. As an input data set, the NSL KDD data set is used in
    this technique and is available online [ 19]. The NSL-KDD data collection is preprocessed
    by first translating all symbolic features to numeric features and then transforming
    all numeric features to symbolic features. In order to extract features, principal
    component analysis is utilized. After that, the preprocessed data set is categorized
    using machine learning methods such as support vector machine, linear regression,
    and random forest to determine its classification. When comparing the performance
    of machine learning algorithms, the accuracy, precision, and recall measurements
    are taken into consideration. 2. Literature Survey 2.1. Review of Existing Irrigation
    Systems A wide range of industries, including the military and agriculture, rely
    on wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A lot of research is going on the power consumption
    of wireless sensor network. Metaheuristics and WSN life spans were also examined
    in their research. Using metaheuristic algorithms, they propose a transition,
    evaluation, and determination procedure that helps to find the optimal solution
    to the problem. It is clear from their explanation that the metaheuristic method
    requires a thorough comprehension of the many field characteristics and domain
    expertise associated with the longevity problem. Metaheuristic algorithms have
    already been studied by a large number of academics. Even though these strategies
    increase the WSN’s effectiveness, there are still a number of issues that need
    to be addressed. Contingency planning may lead to a reduction of sensors or cluster
    heads. Furthermore, metaheuristic approaches are meant for optimization and are
    not suitable to solve scalable problems. According to Li et al. [ 20], the nodes
    should be as small as possible to enhance connection and coverage. The proposed
    method is compared to other existing methods to perform the similar task. The
    efficacy of the suggested strategy was proven in four unique instances using two
    well-known ways. WSN nodes are used in mobile network topologies when a significant
    level of communication frequency is required. Hassan and colleagues explored the
    use of frequencies for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) objectives [
    21]. The premise of their reasoning is frequency reuse at sensor nodes along busy
    pathways. In order to spread the load across the macro cells, we employed the
    CR approach. In turn, this results in a reduced crash area and greater space for
    passengers in their suggested design. Using an underground sensor network, soil
    humidity and temperature may be monitored in real time. Thus, sensors and power
    adjustments for input setup and regular energy maintenance are appropriately installed
    and maintained [ 22]. Verma et al. [ 23] investigated the use of wireless sensors
    for irrigation scheduling. Using a sensor array and sensor network-based accuracy
    technologies, they are able to predict real-time watering demands in the soil
    and so save unnecessary watering. For irrigation systems to function more efficiently,
    data transmission demands improved energy savings. Multiple access time division
    (MATD) is claimed by Ushakov et al. [ 24] to be more efficient for data transfer
    in WSN irrigation systems (TDMA). Energy is saved by immediate transmission and
    the addition of data. TDMA also enhances the performance of the network. Goumopoulos
    et al. [ 25] developed an ontological technique for a wireless sensor or actuator-based
    autonomous zone irrigation system. In precision agriculture, plants communicate
    with one other in order to preserve water. Detecting node problems in the network
    is the primary goal of this system, which employs many machine learning approaches.
    In the past, irrigation activities were made more automated and user-friendly
    by creating end-user apps. Cotton crops can be irrigated more efficiently according
    to a system devised by Rakhra et al. [ 26]. Researchers have used a wide range
    of data sets to predict the exact amount of water decided for a particular combination
    of soil. The output of the analytical study is made available to the farmers or
    other users by a mobile application. Lopez et al. [ 27] investigated the agricultural
    uses of wireless sensor networks. Time-dependent agriculture industry characteristics
    were discussed extensively in their debate. As a consequence, they compiled a
    list of sensors that may be used to monitor agricultural factors. In the end,
    they looked at a variety of communication networks and made comparisons. According
    to [ 28, 29],field productivity can be improved by sending out notifications in
    the form of text messages or emails when certain variables have been measured
    over a threshold. Some sensors, such as those used to assess agricultural fields’
    statistical features, were thoroughly examined, as were the products they are
    linked to and the specifications attached to them. The model had sensors for soil
    water content, soil moisture content, soil electrical conductivity, pH, temperature,
    and wind speed. Dou et al. [ 30] designed an ecofriendly framework to implement
    the basic functions of smart agriculture including the optimization of farming
    resources, decision support, and land surveillance. Water and fertilizer consumption
    may be maximized while crop yields can be improved at the same time thanks to
    a new technique they have devised. Deepika and Rajapirian [ 31] have created a
    wireless sensor network prototype for precision agriculture that makes use of
    a constrained power source. For their model, they employed sand soil with varying
    amounts of water in order to demonstrate the impacts of off-the-shelf technology.
    According to Deepika and Rajapirian [ 32], a research study on the current status
    of precision agriculture’s wireless sensor networks assessed some of the more
    cutting-edge possibilities. In order to monitor a plant, an FPGA-based control
    system is employed. Imam et al. [ 33] examined various issues and challenges related
    to wireless sensor networks and sensors for IoT-based agriculture in order to
    optimize farmer advantages. In precision agriculture, microcontroller families
    and sensor nodes were compared. Researchers also detailed the demands of relative
    humidity sensors and their interfaces. 2.2. Review of Existing Intrusion Detection
    Methods Computational intelligence is a new generation of information systems
    that are being built with the help of soft computing [ 34]. With a soft computing
    system, you can build intelligent machines that can solve complicated real-world
    issues that cannot be mathematically modeled because they are too hard to model.
    In order to attain a likeness to human decision-making, it uses tolerance for
    approximation, ambiguity, imprecision, and partial reality [ 35]. Soft computing
    methods for intrusion detection are summarized in this section. The research is
    broken into four sections: fuzzy logic, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms,
    and artificial immune systems. Intrusion detection has yet to benefit from the
    use of coupled map lattices. Since its inception in Holland, the genetic algorithm
    (GA) has been shown to be a flexible and effective search engine. Evolution in
    the wild is simulated using computer technology. As a stochastic global search
    process, the GA is based on the survival of the fittest principle and creates
    ever-closer approximations to a solution. New solutions are generated every generation
    by selecting people based on their performance in the issue area and spawning
    children. Individuals that are better suited to the problem area than their predecessors
    can be formed by using this method of recruiting new employees [ 36]. The fitness
    function provides an indication of how people did in the issue area. As a result
    of the flocking and schooling behavior of birds and fish [ 37], they created PSO
    in 1995 [ 38]. Artificial life, psychology, physics, and computer science all
    played a role in the development of PSO in some capacity. A “population” of particles
    moves around the problem region at specific rates in order to solve it. Particle
    velocities are adjusted via stochastic calibration based on their prior best position
    and their best nearby position. Both the particle best and the neighborhood best
    are calculated using a user-defined fitness function. As each particle moves,
    it naturally results in a near-ideal solution or a near-optimum solution. “Swarm”
    is used to describe the movement of particles in the issue room, rather than a
    flock of birds or school of fish. As an approximation logic known as fuzzy logic
    (FL), two-valued logic is expanded to include operations on fuzzy sets, such as
    equalization, enclosure, complementation, intersection, and union, in the context
    of fuzzy logic. Machine learning optimization and classification paradigms based
    on evolutionary processes like genetics and natural selection are used in evolutionary
    computing. In the field of evolutionary computing, concepts such as genetic algorithms,
    evolutionary programming, genetic programming, and evolution techniques are all
    included. Genetic algorithms are the most frequently used in applications [ 39].
    The hidden naive Bayes classifier (HNB) is more adaptable than the classic naive
    Bayesian classifier. In the HNB model, the hidden parent of each attribute is
    specified by adding a new layer. The structural properties of HNB can be inferred
    using naive Bayes. Hidden parents are created for each trait so that the forces
    of its other characteristics can be brought together. The average of weighted
    one-dependence estimators [ 40] is used to describe hidden parents. The support
    vector machine (SVM) is a classification method based on statistical learning
    theory (SLT). Hyperplane classifiers are another example of this. Using SVM, an
    ideal hyperplane maximizes the difference between two groups while minimizing
    any overlap. There are several layers of latent variables (hidden units) in DBNs
    in machine learning, and the relations between the levels but not the units inside
    each layer are generative graph models or deep neural networks. A model created
    by researchers in [ 42] can be used to select the features of an intrusion detection
    system. Using genetic algorithms and PSO, the data set has an accuracy percentage
    of 91.75%. 3. Methodology Figure 2 presents a framework for intrusion detection
    and classification system for IoT network for agriculture fields. The main components
    of this framework are IDS data set, data preprocessing algorithm, machine learning
    algorithms, and prediction module.    Figure 2  A framework for IDS for IoT networks
    for agriculture fields. In preprocessing of the NSL-KDD data set, firstly all
    symbolic features are converted to numeric features. The target class is also
    allocated unique numbers. Continuous numeric features such as duration (duration
    of connection) and SRC bytes (data bytes) present in the dataset are normalized
    using z-score normalization. Feature extraction is carried out using the principle
    component analysis (PCA) approach in this article. Data analysis and compression
    may benefit from PCA’s linear approach to dimensionality reduction [ 30]. It is
    based on finding orthogonal linear combinations of the original characteristics
    with the greatest variance in order to convert a large number of uncorrelated
    features. 3.1. Support Vector Machine Approach When it comes to handling two-class
    categorization problems, a support vector machine (SVM) is the most common method.
    It is possible to perform classification and regression with SVM in addition to
    other uses. In addition, SVM uses the kernel phenomenon to alter the data before
    determining an appropriate boundary between the most likely outcomes. In addition,
    the decision line between the two classes on a graph must be wide enough to be
    discernible. SVM creates an ideal boundary that divides the new data point into
    the correct categories. For that reason, the hyperplane is often referred to as
    the ideal boundary. 3.2. Logistic Regression Logistic regression is the technique
    used to link a dependent variable to one or more independent variables. In some
    contexts, the dependent variable and the independent variable are referred to
    as predictors and predictors, respectively. Temperature and humidity differential,
    soil moisture, and pH rate are variables independent of plant type prediction
    (c). The following formula has been established: 3.3. Random Forest All of the
    predictors in a random forest are built from random variables with the same distribution
    across all the trees in the forest. The forest’s generalization error decreases
    as time passes. In the woods, there is a record number of trees. The generalization
    error of a tree classifier forest depends on the relative strength of the individual
    forest trees and their comparison. As compared to AdaBoost, using a random selection
    of features to split each node results in error rates that are more stable. Variance,
    frequency, and consistency of internal measurements are used to indicate the reaction
    to an increase in the number of attributes that are split. The parameter importance
    estimate is also based on external measurements. Regression is based on the same
    principles. 4. Results and Analysis In fact, the NSLKDD dataset is used for anomaly
    detection. This enhanced version of the KDDCUP99 dataset has no redundancy, no
    duplication of records, and a lower complexity level than NSLKDD [ 43]. Twenty
    percent of the NSLKDD dataset is training data (25192 records), and the remaining
    eighty percent is testing data (100781 records). In this paper, we use only 20%
    of the training data to generate decision rules. In the experimental analysis,
    three classification algorithms, namely, SVM-support vector machine, logistic
    regression, and random forest classifiers, are used. To calculate accuracy the
    following formulae were used: where TP represents true positive, TN represents
    true negative, FP represents false positive, and FN represents false negative.
    The results proved that the accuracy of the SVM classifier is better than that
    of the random forest and logic regression algorithms. It is shown in Table 1 and
    Figure 3. Also, Figure 4 shows a graphical representation of the accuracy results
    of machine learning algorithms. Table 1  Accuracy of machine learning algorithms.    Figure
    3  Accuracy of classifiers.    Figure 4  Graphical representation of the accuracy
    results of machine learning algorithms. Precision and recall parameters are also
    used to measure the performance of machine learning algorithms. Precision and
    recall of SVM, random forest, and logistic regression for intrusion detection
    of agriculture fields are shown below in Figures 5 and 6.    Figure 5  Precision
    of classifiers for intrusion classification for agriculture fields.    Figure
    6  Recall of classifiers for intrusion classification for agriculture fields.
    In this graph, SVM exceeds random forest and logistic regression in terms of machine
    learning algorithm accuracy. The accuracy of SVM is higher than 98%, but random
    forest and logistic regression accuracy is less than 78%. 5. Conclusion Agriculture
    is crucial to the country’s economic well-being since farmers produce food for
    everyone. It connects a varied spectrum of enterprises around the country. A country
    with a sizable agricultural sector is considered wealthy economically and socially.
    Agriculture is critical in the majority of countries as a source of employment.
    Irrigation accounts for a sizable portion of overall water use in a country like
    India. Among the several elements affecting crop productivity are the surrounding
    environment’s temperature, soil temperature, and relative humidity. Agricultural
    irrigation is crucial in crop production since it has a direct effect on crop
    yield. Harvesting fields successfully is highly dependent on human supervision
    and experience. It is vital to safeguard the field’s water supply at all costs.
    Water scarcity is a significant issue in contemporary civilization. The issue
    is global in scope, affecting individuals on a daily basis. As a result, we are
    concerned about the possibility of the situation deteriorating worse in the next
    few years. To address the issues highlighted above, smart irrigation and precision
    farming are the answer. Smart irrigation and precision agriculture are only possible
    with the development of the Internet of things and machine learning. Numerous
    benefits accrue from the Internet of Things, including enhanced efficiency, cost
    optimization, optimal energy consumption, forecasting, and convenience for the
    general public (IoT). The diversity of data processing technologies and methodologies
    raises issues regarding their dependability and security. Concerns about security
    and privacy are impeding mainstream adoption of the Internet of Things. This article
    proposes a system for detecting and categorizing intrusions into IoT networks
    in agricultural regions. SVM has a precision of greater than 98 per cent; however,
    random forest and logistic regression have a precision of less than 78 percent.

    Download chapter PDF Introduction The term “precision irrigation” commonly refers
    to water according to plant necessity in the appropriate place, duration, and
    quantity. Utilizing variable rate of water application is possible with effective
    systems using current controllers in irrigation machines can be attainable in
    the market. Nevertheless, this application requires data from space and time inadequate
    quality and appropriate accuracy of water status in vegetation cover, achievable
    primarily through aerial monitoring and images [1, 2, 3]. The digitized aerial
    image turned to be inexpensive and publicized because of the availability in the
    market with a small price, severe results, and unmanned aerial vehicles of small
    size holding high-quality digital cameras, and examining these recent conductive
    technologies precision irrigation data acquiring is required. Satellite multispectral
    imageries (MSI) attributable to sensor characteristics and high-altitude platforms
    (HAPs). These satellites are covering vast territories. Furthermore, several satellite
    programs such as Landsat, Modis, Aster, SPOT, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 currently
    offer free data, therefore encouraging satellite images employed in effective
    agricultural applications [4, 5]. Furthermore, new techniques and algorithms employing
    satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle integrated multispectral imaging have been
    created for the vegetation of pixel classification [6, 7]. Unmanned aerial vehicles
    as low altitude platforms provide images with high spatial quality and flexible
    flight schedule [8], allow distinction between clear canopy pixel and elements
    in the environment [9, 10], and categorize various elements detailed in canopy
    [11, 12]. There have been many investigations at various phenological phases on
    the spectral reflectance of the plants in the visible and near-infrared spectrums
    as an element of electromagnetic radiation. It is possible to use data at the
    canopy level to have such a sufficient understanding of the spectral reaction
    of the leaf and the operation through this tier [13]. The use of spectral indicators
    helps improve data obtaining through remote sensing information because they improve
    intended obtained characteristics by diminishing the outcome soil, view angle,
    and topography by diminishing in outcome view angle, topography, and soil [14].
    As an alternative way to identify water potential, canopy temperature measurement
    was proposed [15]. Basing on the water tension caused by closed stomata decreased
    transpiration and evapotranspiration cooling [16]. The indicator of water tension
    in plants, which is determined as crop cover water tension index CWSI was recommended
    to be identified [17]. The use of infrared sensors or imaging for detecting the
    canopy temperature has exhibited excellent ability for the calculation of CWSI
    also has shown exceptional performance for water status in the plant assessment
    in various crops has seen in irrigation programming [18, 19, 20, 21], This chapter
    aims to (i) reporting most latest and common techniques for the use of UAV imagery
    in precision agriculture for crop fields monitoring. (ii) discovering most important
    UAV system technologies and effective methods for data processing that can be
    utilized in order to exploit the agricultural data acquired by UAV system, and
    (iii) using thermal infrared imagery taken by employing UAV anticipate the changes
    in plant water use because of irrigation management. This method can be a decision-making
    aid in the future for the successful irrigation management of crops. 1 Remote
    Sensing Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remotely piloted aircraft, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, has recently gained remote sensing popularity.
    In the last 35 years, UAV has been widely used for tracking cultivated fields
    and offering efficient precision agriculture solutions [22]. Images at different
    wavelengths can be used to track various crop and vegetation parameters by using
    remote sensing. Previously, remote sensing was frequently dependent on satellite
    images [23, 24]. Precision agriculture and smart farming are two domains where
    several reviews exist about the application of the UAV. The majority of the articles
    concentrate on the various forms of applications that UAV can have in environmental
    monitoring in general [25]. 1.1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Surveillance of Crops
    Unmanned aerial vehicle systems have proven to be successfully applied in various
    precision agriculture applications to the present, including various applications
    in herbicide, water shortage recognition, disease identification, etc. For calculating
    yield to solve the problem that found and optimize production, many decisions
    can be taken depending on the information gathered by the UAV. The following are
    the popular usage of unmanned aerial vehicles utilized in precision agriculture
    that has been documented in the literature: Weed mapping and management [26, 27]
    Plants growth monitoring and yield calculation [28, 29, 30] Disease identification
    and vegetation quality control [31, 32] Irrigation management [33, 34] Spraying
    by the Corps [35, 36] Through visual analysis of images is used in many remote
    sensing operations, the Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies are widely
    applied to help in the localization and georeferencing of images obtained by remote
    sensing, which allocate reality accords to a picture. Remote sensing information
    is such a valuable source of data’s environment, and also with other datasets,
    it is reviewed and incorporated frequently through importation into GIS. In their
    study, experts in remote sensing generally utilize GIS in conjunction with remote
    sensing imagery, GPS, and different type of spatial data. Other sensors, such
    as RADAR and LIDAR produce, calculate electromagnetic radiation returns [37].
    The sensor’s distance from the detected target is less than a given threshold,
    normally in the range of a few meters, by using remote sensing techniques [38].
    1.2 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System Technologies In precision agriculture, main
    elements such as the following are often used in remotely sensed aircraft [39].
    1.2.1 Ground Control Station (GCS) The UAV is controlled and tracked specifically
    due to a computing devise termed ground control station connected to UAV’s system
    control. The information relevant to the UAV’s flight is tracked by the GCS. The
    consumer may obtain data relating to the aircraft’s operation and data collected
    by the sensors that assist the flight. Moreover, GCS includes tools needed for
    UAV’s information to be processed and the data that the device operator needs
    for field tracking to be extracted. 1.2.2 UAV Control System (UAV CS) The UAV
    Control System controls the UAV, which could be as obvious as the control from
    a remote or a constructed GPS. The system of flight control and/or the system
    of autopilot that controls UAV movements are included in the UAV CS. For proper
    functioning of UAV, collecting information and data processing are managed from
    the autopilot or flight control system due to control system. Processing data
    from sensors by the control system fix any issues that may occur and connect with
    the GCC wirelessly and simultaneously transmit and receive information. 1.2.3
    Data Collection Using Sensors The data needed is captured by cameras, defined
    as sensors for collection information. There are various methods for gathering
    data and the technology used. When UAVs aren’t used for data collection but are
    instead used for something else, for example, splattering, the sensors have been
    replaced with the appropriate constituents. 1.3 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle advantages
    In addition to the most crucial UAV technologies above and being used in precision
    agriculture, the size of the UAVs is used for classification. Nevertheless, since
    it includes more parameters influencing the application of UAV and their efficiency
    in precision agriculture, the categorization used is more common. Most of recent
    precision agriculture research has used multirotor for UAVs. This would be mainly
    because the field that is taking into account in most applications isn’t very
    extensive. Consequently, a high rapidity of UAVs and good capacity for covering
    vast regions in a few flights, such as fixed-wing UAVs, are unnecessary. As a
    result, aircraft with rotary wing are favored due to the following benefits: Ability
    to move around Simple to operate Slower rates Costs are relatively minimal These
    advantages make it easier to collect data from crops using photography, which
    is how UAVs are often used in vegetation tracking. Aircraft fixed wing has opted
    where the location of the control regions seems to be wide since they can follow-up
    the whole area in a limited amount of time [39]. 2 Precision Agriculture Using
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Equipped with advanced sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles
    become strong systems for sensing, which is a supplement based on the Internet
    of Things methods. The sensor’s function is to gather photographs with high resolution
    in space and time. Several various forms of sensors may be used based on crop
    parameters that need to be monitored [40]. Nonetheless, many constraints have
    been posted on the sensors due to the need for low payload capability and small
    platforms. The sensors must satisfy three key requirements: lightweight, low energy
    consumption, and small size. All of the preceding would, of course, be paired
    with the capability to take high-quality photographs. Current trading sensors
    that meet the precedent requirements and are applied for precision agriculture
    primarily fall into one of four classifications: Visible light sensors Hyperspectral
    sensors Thermal sensors Multispectral sensors Other various types of sensors are
    known as light detection and ranging sensors in the literature. Laser scanners
    can be employed in addition to the ones previously mentioned, also named LiDAR.
    Laser scanners are well-known technique, which are widely applied in the science
    of the environment, but they are frequently employed for scanning on the ground.
    Since 1994, scanning laser airborne has been used [41]. 2.1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    Data Acquisition The information acquired with employing these sensors makes it
    possible to apply it to assess moisture in soil, control plant biomass, crop quality,
    and more essential vegetation specifics at different stages of development. The
    most important varieties of sensors utilized are: 2.1.1 Visible Light Sensors
    (RGB) They have the ability to capture high-quality photographs. The photographs
    can be taken in various conditions, with both sunny and cloudy conditions. Still,
    a strict timescale dependent on climate conditions is needed in order to prevent
    under or overexposure of the image. 2.1.2 Multispectral Imaging Sensors Imaging
    sensors that are multispectral or hyperspectral are supplied in UAVs can collect
    data on absorption and reflection in the spectral range for the crop through many
    bands (Fig. 1). Data from the spectral may be very useful for evaluating various
    biological and physical features of crops, despite their higher costs [40]. Fig.
    1 (a) A multispectral example of five wide bands, (b) a hyperspectral example
    carries various narrow bands [42] Full size image 2.1.3 Thermal Infrared Sensors
    Infrared thermal sensors have to capture the temperature of the surfaces. Thermal
    cameras receive infrared energy by using infrared sensors and an optical lens.
    The temperature is higher than zero (273.3°C/459°F), and all objects send out
    infrared rays at various wavelengths LWIR and MWIR bands in proportion to the
    corresponding temperature. As a result, thermal imaging cameras concentrate and
    sense radiation in the same wavelengths, converting them into gray scale images
    to represent heat. Several sensed thermal imaging can produce image color. This
    kind of sensor is only found in a few applications for irrigation management.
    Consequently, infrared imaging sensors are rarely employed in precision agriculture
    implementations of UAV focused on tracking crop features. The spectral and spatial
    data related to each acquiring method were measure by applying a categorization
    based on a rating with a bullet (1–3), as shown in Table 1. Table 1 The important
    distinction exists in hyperspectral and multispectral imaging, spectroscopy, and
    RGB imaging (merging viewpoints Wu and Sun [43] and Boreman [44] Full size table
    2.2 UAS Data Processing Various forms of the UAV data captured can be exploited
    to investigate various types of vegetation characteristics. The most shared characteristics
    that can be tracked using unmanned aerial vehicles for precision agriculture are
    the following in Table 2. Table 2 Monitoring crops features with UAVs Full size
    table 2.3 Techniques to Analyze UAV Imagery Sensors for a specific purpose can
    help the unmanned aerial vehicle for obtaining information in different cultivated
    domains. The most frequent utilized image processing techniques to examine UAV
    imagery are the following: 2.3.1 Photogrammetry Techniques Photogrammetric techniques
    may procedure the two-dimensional information and set up the geometrical liaison
    among the various images and objects, achieving 3-D models. This type of method
    has been exploited in order to extract 3-D digitized models of terrain [58, 59,
    53] and also employed in orthophotos [60, 61]. 2.3.2 Machine Learning Techniques
    Using machine learning (ML) methods can be employed in order to procedure the
    information procured to forecasting and detection aim, with important effect in
    a variety field, as an example, healthcare systems [62, 61] marketing strategies
    [63], biology projects [64], and so on. This method can evaluate parameters concerning
    yield development, detect illness, or still identify objects in the images. 2.3.3
    Vegetation Indices Calculation Vegetation Index (VIs) calculation can utilize
    various mathematical combinations of a minimum of two bands spectral in the electromagnetic
    spectrum, intended for optimizing the crop specifics part although reducing the
    outward confusion element. They can provide trustworthy space-based and temporary
    data about the agricultural data of yield controlled. 3 The Thermal-Based Crop
    Stress Sensing Crop irrigation technology has become an important domain where
    UAVs could be used in precision agriculture. Crop irrigation consumes 70% of the
    world’s water [65, 66]. Emphasizing precision irrigation techniques’ importance,
    precision irrigation methods may help to improve the quality of water by ensuring
    the efficient exploitation of the resource: in the proper places, at the appropriate
    times, with the correct quantities. Precision agriculture application divides
    the field into different sections of irrigation areas to better manage water.
    Unmanned aerial vehicles with suitable sensor variations may be used for detecting
    areas where vegetation requires much water. The precedent methods simultaneously
    enable customized maps that show the soil morphology to be developed so that the
    irrigation of every crop can be planned more efficiently separately. The use of
    infrared sensors for sensing temperature or imaging displays an important ability
    to calculate CWSI and valuate irrigation plant water status [18, 19, 20, 21, 67].
    The upper baseline and the water baseline were recorded as nonwater stressed baseline
    for CWSI measurement. [68]. 3.1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Thermal Imaging The
    thermal pictures captured with the UAV helps for vegetation’s temperature measurement
    by measuring the temperature of the pure plant pixels and averaging them using
    a thermal camera with specific characteristics (Table 3). Therefore, a segmentation
    algorithm ranked R-based can be determined by histogram examination of each thermal
    picture. The full width at half limit (FWHM) allows pure vegetation pixel to be
    obtained from the thermal picture. The FWHM rule enables the pixels to have vegetation
    with a high possibility of absolute purity and be identified, as stated [69, 70].
    Table 3 The thermal camera’s main characteristics (Thermal Camera Tau 2324) [33]
    Full size table 3.1.1 Water Stress Cumulative Integration The evaluation of the
    water status in the vegetation cover is dependent on the difference among the
    temperature average in the crop and the current temperature of air through the
    time of flight ΔT, which is determined with the sensor of air temperature. Values
    ΔT are also utilized to calculate a cumulative integration of water stress in
    the vegetation degree throughout the season of irrigation. ΔT Values can also
    be applied during the irrigation season to calculate a cumulative integration
    of water tension in the plant. In addition, the difference among ΔT and a canopy
    nonstressed for a particular sampling date gives the difference exist mainly in
    temperature of canopy or the level of stress. K. C. DeJonge [71] adapts this indicator.
    Water stress integral WSI helps integrate the water stress effect during the entire
    day, initially suggested by Myers [72]. To measure water potential in predawn
    leaf for the whole irrigation season, we will use the total integral of water
    stress as determined by canopy temperature differences according to the following
    equation (1): $$ \\boldsymbol{WSI}\\left({}^{{}^{\\circ}}\\boldsymbol{C}\\ \\boldsymbol{day}\\right)={\\sum}_{\\boldsymbol{i}=\\mathbf{0}}^{\\boldsymbol{i}=\\boldsymbol{t}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}
    \\mathbf{T}}_{\\boldsymbol{i},\\boldsymbol{i}+\\mathbf{1}}-{\\mathbf{C}}_{\\boldsymbol{i},\\boldsymbol{i}+\\mathbf{1}}\\right)\\boldsymbol{n}
    $$ (1) t: the number of ΔT calculations, according to the number of flights conducted.
    ΔT i,i + 1 : average of ΔT for any interval i, i+1. C i,i + 1 : non-water-stressed
    values ΔT for any time frame i, i+1. n: days number in the interval. C: nonwater-stressed
    baseline value (NWSB) [68]. 3.1.2 Measurement of the Crop Water Stress Indicator
    Though irrigation programs, sensing the temperature of canopy employing infrared
    thermal sensors or imagery has revealed a big potentiality for determining the
    crop water stress index and identifying water status in the vegetation [17]. Equation
    2 is using to measure the CWSI for the plant: $$ {\\mathbf{C}}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}=\\mathbf{a}+{\\mathbf{bVPD}}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}
    $$ (2) VPD i: The total vapor pressure deficiency (kPa) at flight time through
    the ith day of calculation. a, b: variables got for every species at particular
    environment conditions [17]. In the case study of Quebrajo et al. [33], they collect
    the vapor pressure deficiency and the temperature of air values and at a height
    of 2 meter in a weather station adjacent to the Andalusia government’s Agroclimatic
    Information Network. To calculate the value of CWSI of the ith sampling day, the
    NWSB from Idso [68] can also be used as shown in Eq. 3: $$ \\mathbf{CWSI}=\\frac{{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}
    \\mathbf{T}}_{\\boldsymbol{i}-{\\mathbf{C}}_{\\boldsymbol{i},\\boldsymbol{i}+\\mathbf{1}}}}{{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}
    \\mathbf{T}}_{\\boldsymbol{dry},\\boldsymbol{i}}-{\\mathbf{C}}_{\\boldsymbol{i},\\boldsymbol{i}+\\mathbf{1}}}
    $$ (3) ΔT dry: The maximum value ΔT, according to a nontranspiring canopy. ΔT
    dry: The maximum value ΔT, following nontranspiring canopy. Based on this study
    [33], the sugar beet leaf temperature value can meet 8°C above air temperature;
    thus, ΔT dry,i =8 C can be used as a constant. For other herbaceous crop types,
    similar values of ΔT dry,i were found [69]. Crop water stress indicator’s calculation
    is based on aerial thermal pictures provides an effective decision-making instrument
    in terms of adding value to soil humidity data during irrigation programs [15].
    CWSI employment can reveal the variation between plants grown in different soil
    types and between well-irrigated plants and plants being sensitive to water deficiency
    for irrigation programming. Growth features related to humid baseline are specific
    to Mediterranean and geographical variations and the irrigation control establishment.
    Threshold values are based on alliances with other physiological variations in
    vegetation cover. It must be determined [33]. 4 Conclusion In this chapter, we
    present the most often used monitoring detectors for the vegetation, and we highlight
    the techniques of processing employing UAV imaging and the important exploitation
    of UAV. Using the remotely sensed aircraft systems in irrigation management can
    be more similar to a normative process, consisting of applying remote sensors:
    thermal and/or multispectral in order to follow-up the necessity of water in various
    crop portions. Furnished with thermal sensors, the UAV can identify possible shortages
    through irrigation in various spots. Such data is converted via photogrammetry
    methods to a high-quality mapping, noting the regions in stress. In that case,
    a map is created with VI application when multispectral imaging is employed. As
    a result, a map like this will encourage farmers to apply variable-rate water
    irrigation control. The differences in the temperature of canopy-air and the CWSI
    values obtained from an infrared thermal picture taken employing a remotely sensed
    aircraft were detected to determine changes in plant water usage generating through
    precision irrigation. References A. H. E. Nahry, R. R. Ali, and A. A. E. Baroudy,

    Introduction Maintaining adequate food supply has become challenging due to worldwide
    population expansion and climate change [1,2]. With the advancement of technologies,
    such as sensors, image processing techniques, and computing capability, precision
    agriculture has been promoted. Precision agriculture aims to use minimal inputs
    to generate maximal yields by taking into account the crop’s local field environment.
    Precision agriculture includes precise irrigation quantity, correct and appropriate
    application of chemicals, and weeding, for which the topological characteristics
    of the crop field are a key component that needs to be considered. For instance,
    the quantity of irrigation varies drastically due to the change of terrain slopes.
    Hussnain et al. [3] described that low areas of the crop field are likely to collect
    more water from either the irrigation or rainfall, meaning that irrigation for
    those areas should be less compared to that for other areas with high slopes.
    Mareels et al. [4] concluded that precision agriculture especially for the irrigation
    system relies heavily on the topological characteristics of the crop field. Topological
    terrain attributes also influence the efficiency of implementing large agriculture
    machines. Machine and tractor fleets used in agriculture improve the efficiency
    of the farming process, while they also require appropriate terrain attributes
    to be able to perform and maneuver [5]. Without information about the specific
    topological characteristics of the field, large farming tractors and implements
    could become stuck in the field or create unnecessary field ruts. Therefore, information
    collection for detailed topological characteristics is essential in precision
    agriculture. This need will only be heightened as farming transitions to autonomous
    vehicles. Advanced sensors and computer vision techniques provide an opportunity
    to collect the topological characteristics from the environment required by precision
    agriculture. Sensors are becoming smaller and more powerful [6]. In addition,
    the costs of sensors are decreased, enabling their widespread deployment in practice.
    The development of computer vision technique has reached the level at which users
    can efficiently process collected data for decision-making. However, collecting
    all information from the crop field not only increases the burden of memory needed
    by the equipment but also adds more useless information required to be proceeded
    by the researchers. A method to extract critical and useful information from the
    field is needed. We propose a method that combines the advanced sensors and inertial
    measurement units (IMUs) as well as the algorithm to monitor the crop field in
    real time at a low cost and in a practical manner. In addition, the automated
    monitor system also performs a field analysis of the relationship between the
    topological characteristics and crop growth to provide useful information for
    farmers to adjust their crop management strategies accordingly and in a timely
    manner. Thermal remoting sensing is another commonly used technique in this field.
    Different from optical remoting sensing on the basis of reflected radiation, thermal
    remoting sensing relies on the emitted radiation of the target objects [7]. It
    allows the farmers to collect information such as temperature, crop stress, and
    crop diseases [8,9,10] so the corresponding activities could be performed timely
    and accordingly. Unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) has been extensively implemented
    in modern agriculture due to their light weights and low costs, combined with
    remote sensing technologies. Honkavaara et al. [11] integrated UAVs and remoting
    sensing techniques to realize consistent data collection and processing for wheat
    production. Costa et al. [12] implemented UAVs and wireless sensor network to
    detect crop diseases and applied pesticide, significantly minimizing the amount
    of pesticide inputs. Maes and Steppe [13] combined thermal remoting sensing and
    UVAs for crop weed detection and achieved favorable results. However, in addition
    to the above remoting sensing and 3D maps that researchers build based on cameras
    [14], additional information such as the landform and more accurate topography
    is still a requisite. The terrain will not only affect the growth of plants but
    also the management process by robot farmers. For example, it significantly increases
    the processing time and fuel cost for a large machine if there are a lot of turns,
    and an unbalanced landform could result in different soil and water conservation.
    Moreover, the algorithms for map maintenance [15] are susceptible to adverse surface
    conditions, such as unexpected pits, washouts from precipitation, steep slopes,
    or barriers. These drawbacks can limit the ability of autonomous mapping and further
    lead to the failure of localization. As a result, high-quality map building is
    challenging when attempting to include all these details [16]. Moreover, different
    landforms may result in various growing statuses [17], for example, steep slopes
    have a higher chance of causing severe erosion processes. Energy costs associated
    with sensors constrain their applications. Traditional sensors, such as stereo
    vision cameras or LiDAR, can provide accurate prediction of the images collected
    from the fields, but their high power consumptions are too high to be implemented
    for the needs of large farmland (hundreds and thousands of acres) monitoring.
    Differently, the IMU sensor is a perfect substitute to be deployed in large farmland
    monitoring with a tradeoff between performance and energy costs. Table 1 lists
    the power consumption and market price for different types of sensors, showing
    that IMU sensors have advantages over other types of sensors with super low energy
    consumption and market price. Table 1. Power consumption and market price of different
    types of sensors. To solve these problems, we propose an approach that addresses
    the proper hardware implementation and associate algorithms for the sensors data
    as shown in Figure 1. This work aims to augment the dimensional information of
    the existing farm mapping system. The hardware implementation includes the sensors’
    selection, application, and configuration. We build upon this hardware with a
    customized data fusion algorithm to process the collected data. Figure 1. Architecture
    of multiple-sensor-based sensing algorithm. First, IMU sensors [18] are used as
    the main tool for data collection, especially in autonomous vehicle areas. Many
    existing solutions for motion tracking and gesture recognition rely on the IMU
    sensors’ built-in mobile devices [19]. Magnetic sensor [20,21] readings are used
    to determine device orientation changes, and in future may be applied to detect
    the detailed environment. Then, certain frames [22] can be captured with a trigger
    mechanism by the camera sensor mounted in the front of the robot for future analytics.
    Next, analysis and data fusion are conducted on motion sensors’ data in real time
    with moving robot vehicles. The use of multiple sensors, such as a gyroscope [23]
    and an accelerometer [24], is advantageous because of the low-cost and easy combination,
    which makes it possible to collect continuous motion data in real time. With the
    data fusion algorithm, we can judge the topological information in real time according
    to the robot vehicle’s motion. If topological features change significantly, which
    we name it as an “event”, the camera is woken up to capture frames and saved them
    in association with the location on the map. This is for future reference of the
    current environment. 2. Related Work 2.1. Remote Monitoring Agriculture industries
    traditionally implement optical and multispectral techniques on the images collected
    by satellites to analyze and evaluate the plant growth condition and yields [25].
    The existence of chlorophyll, for instance, could be revealed by the light absorption
    from the leaf and, hence, determines plant health. It is of importance since decisions,
    such as fertilizing the soil and spreading insecticide or fungicide, should be
    taken based on this information. The treatments should be applied in time to ensure
    their functionality, requiring the filed information to be collected and analyzed
    frequently, which challenges the traditional method [26]. In addition, traditional
    monitoring methods are expensive to be implemented with regard to time efficiency.
    Remote sensing plays a critical role in precision agriculture by allowing farmers
    to collect various types of information to help improve the quality and yields
    of crops [27]. Optical remoting sensing, taking advantages of collected images
    by using visible and near infrared sensors to detect different target objects
    on the ground based on the radiation variation, has been utilized in many aspects
    of crop production [28]. Frolking et al. [29] developed new maps by combining
    the optical remote sensing and ground census data to investigate the diversity
    of rice production. Hall et al. [30] reviewed the applications of optical remoting
    sensing in viticulture by taking advantage of the information, such as soil structure
    and vine shape and size, from the collected images to ensure the quality and yields.
    2.2. Motion Sensing With the advancement of precise Global Positioning System
    (GPS) equipment and cameras detecting structures, various autonomous machines
    are employed in the agriculture sector [31]. The QUAD-AV project tested the performance
    of using microwave radar, stereo vision, LiDAR, and thermography to detect obstacles
    in the context of agriculture [32]. The project concluded that stereo vision stands
    out for its accuracy in ground and non-ground classification. Zhao et al. [33]
    proposed a method to gather road information on a large scale through the combination
    of phase cameras and motion sensors. An environment map was developed [34] for
    detecting the relative positions of nearby objects with multiple phone cameras.
    In addition, the turning movement of vehicles was captured by comparing the centrifugal
    force with a reference point. Then the authors extended this work by designing
    an efficient algorithm to reduce the computing time. Non-vision sensors are utilized
    in [35] to realize the detection of vehicle maneuvers, including lane changing,
    turning, and moving on a curvy path. Qi et al. [36] proposed to utilize the front-
    and rear-mounted cameras in a phone to identify dangerous road conditions. Chen
    et al. [37] developed a multiview 3D network to detect objects on the road, combined
    with a sensory-fusion framework to analyze data collected by LiDAR and cameras.
    2.3. Robot Vehicles with Autonomoust Driving Techniques in Agriculture Robots
    are gaining interest in precision agriculture due to the potential capability
    to automatically remove weeds and minimize the usage of pesticides and herbicides
    in crop production [38]. Different from the traditional methods that treat the
    whole field uniformly, robots apply resources to the target plants individually
    and, therefore, improve the resource efficiency. For this sake, the datasets focus
    on providing the field data to those who design automatic systems with robots
    to perform activities, such as classification, navigation, and mapping in modern
    agriculture [39]. 2.4. Sensor Data Fusion in Agriculture Fusion of sensor data
    has proved its capability in agriculture. Fusion of GPS and machine vision is
    leading the way to improve the applications of large machine guidance systems
    in agriculture. Plants cultivated in patterns facilitates the usage of autonomous
    machine systems with satisfying accuracy. However, the adverse environments where
    trees might disable the GPS signal negatively impact the system’s efficiency [40].
    Acceleration data provided by the IMU devices compensate the impact of signal
    loss of GPS and ensure the accuracy of guidance systems. Therefore, the combination
    of GPS and IMU sensors can be implemented. 3. Methodology 3.1. IMU Sensor-Based
    Data Collection Approach Two IMU sensors, a gyroscope, and an accelerometer were
    used to measure the attitude of an agricultural robot [41]. Inertial sensors come
    with intrinsic noises. To improve their usability and accuracy, we designed a
    coordinate alignment algorithm on both sloped surface and flat surface to detect
    sensor orientation changes and model stability. The proposed that the slope-aware
    algorithm first conduct coordinate alignment and estimate linear acceleration
    via dynamically withdrawing the gravity effect on recorded accelerometer readings.
    Then, it uses a clustering technique to identify relative orientation changes.
    A gyroscope is an inertial sensor for measuring orientation based on the principles
    of angular momentum. However, because of noise jamming, temperature variation,
    and unstable force moment, algorithm drift error will occur and increase with
    time. Therefore, a gyroscope may have noise during a long period of data collection.
    A supplementary option is to use an accelerometer, which is a device that measures
    proper acceleration. When the accelerometer is motionless, the attitude angles
    can be calculated based on the acceleration of the gravity component in every
    axis via trigonometric functions. Slope-Aware Alignment The accuracy of coordinate
    alignment is mainly affected by the slope of the field. Hence, we developed a
    slope-aware coordinate alignment method to reduce or eliminate the negative effects
    caused by the slope. Traditional approaches fail to consider the slope, because
    they make the assumption that all the motion data is through the origin motion
    data point, and calculate the fit curve based on all motion data [42]. However,
    these approaches could encounter chaos with a random rough surface. Therefore,
    our slope-aware approach dynamically segments the whole path into pieces and uses
    each piece of the path as an independent input. Due to forces created by slopes,
    readings from each path deviate from the origin point. If we combine all the paths,
    we can estimate the slope and further improve the alignment accuracy. A rotation
    matrix will be derived by combining sensor readings from all paths. To derive
    the rotation matrix, we fitted the curve to find the direction unit vector. Different
    from traditional approaches, we trained the horizontal unit vector for each segment
    and combined them by assigning different weights for each segment. One segment
    will be selected if the recorded data indicates the car is in motion. The more
    data points we can include in this segment, the more we can increase the statistical
    power of the measurement. As shown in Figure 2, the vector [ 𝑉 1 , 𝑉 2 , 𝑉 3 ]
    represents the orientation of a gyroscope sensor and [ 𝑉 1 ′ , 𝑉 2 ′ , 𝑉 3 ′ ]
    represents the orientation of a robot vehicle. The rotation matrix 𝑅=[ 𝑅 𝑖 , 𝑅
    𝑗 , 𝑅 𝑘 ] can be estimated during the coordinate alignment process. In the rotation
    matrix 𝑅 , 𝑅 𝑖 , 𝑅 𝑗 , and 𝑅 𝑘 are the unit coordinate conversion vectors along
    each demission, such that [ 𝑉 1 ′ , 𝑉 2 ′ , 𝑉 3 ′ ]=[ 𝑉 1 , 𝑉 2 , 𝑉 3 ]×[ 𝑅 𝑖
    , 𝑅 𝑗 , 𝑅 𝑘 ] . Figure 2. Slope-aware rotation alignment concept. 3.2. Motion
    Pattern Recognition Different field surfaces can lead to various accelerations
    and further affect the moving speed and motion patterns. Hence, recognizing motion
    patterns can help us understand the running environment of the robot vehicle.
    In this work, we use the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to identify similar
    robot motions with varying speeds and further detecting running environments.
    The DTW algorithm is well known for evaluating the similarity between two temporal
    sequences. To measure the similarity, temporal sequences are “warped” by shrinking
    or stretching in the time domain. To achieve the best performance, the training
    set should be carefully prepared and include representatives of different types
    of events as much as possible. In order to improve detection accuracy, we chose
    to loosen some of the constraints of the DTW matching algorithms during the training
    process and also when conducting evaluations. As a theoretical result, our DTW
    algorithm was able to identify all the motions. There were four categories of
    motion patterns in our study as shown in Figure 3a–d. Figure 3. Motion sensor
    theoretical patterns: (a) moving on a flat field; (b) moving over a slope; (c)
    moving across a depression; (d) moving on a muddy field. 3.3. Data Fusion Approach
    The sensor fusion method avoids the measurement limitations of using only a camera.
    An advanced data fusion method was used to integrate data from the camera, accelerometer,
    and gyroscope [43]. In this study, two methods were discussed and compared. One
    is a self-adaptive complimentary principal component analysis (PCA) and the other
    one is the DTW. Data collected from different sensors need to be synchronized
    as the clock on each device is different. After clock synchronization, we used
    principal component analysis (PCA) to speed up the data analysis process and detect
    various activities promptly as shown in Algorithm 1. PCA is able to extract the
    most important features from the collected dataset and convert a high-dimensional
    dataset to one with lower dimensions. PCA simplifies the dataset by discarding
    the least important features while maintaining the interpretability of variables.
    Algorithm 1. Pseudo-code of the algorithm for generating principal components
    DTW (A, G) contains: # A = ( 𝑎 1 , …, 𝑎 𝑛 ) is the accelerometer data. G = ( 𝑔
    1 , …, 𝑔 𝑚 ) is the gyroscope data collected with continuous time series -> Here,
    we claim M [0, … , n, 0, …, m] is a 2D data matrix which stands for the similarity
    measures between the 2 timeseries. # Data matrix initialization -> M [0, 0]: =
    0 -> For i = 0 to m Step 1 Do:    -> M [0, i]: = Infinity -> End -> For i: = 1
    to n Step 1 Do:    -> M [i, 0]: = Infinity -> End # Calculate the similarity measures
    between the 2 different time-series into M [n, m] -> For i : = 1 to n Step 1 Do:    ->
    For j : = 1 to m Step 1 Do:    #Evaluate the similarity of the two points -> diff
    : = 𝑑 𝑚𝑛 (𝐴(𝑖),  𝐺(𝑗)) -> M [i, j] : = diff + Min (M [i-1, j], M [i, j-1], M [i-1,
    j-1])    -> End -> End -> Return M [n, m] Additionally, PCA also combines original
    variables in such a way that only the most valuable features are retained. Hence,
    we extract features from our accelerometer and gyroscope dataset using the PCA
    algorithm. The algorithm is described by the following steps. Data Normalization
    𝑋 ∗ = 𝑋−𝜇 𝛿 (1) where 𝜇 is the mean and 𝛿 is the standard deviation of all the
    data. Covariance Matrix Calculation 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥(𝐶𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)=[ 𝑉𝑎𝑟[ 𝑋 1 ] 𝐶𝑜𝑣[ 𝑋 1 ,
    𝑋 2 ] 𝐶𝑜𝑣[ 𝑋 2 , 𝑋 1 ] 𝑉𝑎𝑟[ 𝑋 2 ] ] (2) where 𝑋 1 represents the accelerometer
    readings and 𝑋 2 represents the gyroscope readings. Note that 𝑉𝑎𝑟[ 𝑋 1 ]=𝐶𝑜𝑣[
    𝑋 1 , 𝑋 1 ] and 𝑉𝑎𝑟[ 𝑋 2 ]=𝐶𝑜𝑣[ 𝑋 2 , 𝑋 2 ] . 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥(𝐶𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒) is the covariance
    matrix, which is a 𝑑×𝑑 matrix. The covariance matrix stores the covariance between
    two features. Once the covariance is established, PCA will perform the eigen decomposition
    on it. The covariance matrix can be calculated using the equations below: 𝐶𝑜𝑣[
    𝑋 𝑗 , 𝑋 𝑘 ]= 1 𝑛−1 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 − 𝑥 𝑗 − )( 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 − 𝑥 𝑘 − ) (3) 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥(𝐶𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)=
    1 𝑛−1 ( (𝛸− 𝛸 − ) 𝑇 (𝛸− 𝛸 − )) (4) where 𝛸 − represents the mean vector, and it
    can be calculated using the following equation: 𝛸 − = 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑥 𝑖 . The mean
    vector (d-dimensional vector) stores the mean of each feature column in the dataset.
    3. Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Calculation Next, we need to calculate the eigenvalues
    and eigenvectors for the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is a square
    matrix, so the eigenvalue can be calculated using the characteristic equation
    below: 𝑑𝑒𝑡(ƛ𝐼−𝐴)=0 (5) where, ƛ represents the eigenvalue for matrix 𝐴 , 𝐼 is
    an identity matrix which has the same dimension as 𝐴 to satisfy the requirement
    of matrix subtraction. “ 𝑑𝑒𝑡 ” is the determinant of the matrix. We can find a
    corresponding vector 𝑉 for each eigenvalue ƛ by solving the following equation:
    (ƛ𝐼−𝐴)𝑉=0 (6) 4. Principal Component Selection The eigenvalues are sorted in descending
    order such that they reflect the significance of the components. The eigenvector
    that has the highest eigenvalue is the principal component of the dataset. Given
    that our dataset contains two variables (accelerometer and gyroscope), we should
    have two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors. We use a feature vector ( 𝑉 1 , 𝑉 2
    ) to store the two eigenvectors. 5. Principle Component Formation The eigenvectors
    represent the direction of the principal components. The original data need to
    be re-oriented to the new coordinate system using the eigenvectors. To re-orient
    the data, the original data were multiplied by the feature vector, and the re-oriented
    dataset is called a score as shown in Equation (7). 𝑆𝑐=[𝑂𝑟𝑖𝑔.𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎]×[𝑉] (7) As
    discussed in previous sections, we built an event library (different motion patterns
    listed in Figure 3) using motion data collected by different robot vehicles. The
    motion data contain all the typical events. When a new event is detected, the
    corresponding motion data will be processed using the PCA algorithm and compared
    with all the predefined events in the event library. We used the DTW algorithm
    to evaluate the distance between the new event temporal sequence and all temporal
    sequences in the library. Based on the derived distance, a k-nearest neighbor
    algorithm was used to predict a label for the new event. To evaluate the distance
    between two vectors, we used the following distance metrics. Euclidean distance—the
    root sum of squared differences: 𝑑 𝑚𝑛 (X,Y)= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 ( 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚 − 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛 )∗( 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚
    − 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛 ) − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (8) Manhattan
    distance—the sum of absolute differences, also known as the Manhattan, city block,
    taxicab, or ℓ 1 metric: 𝑑 𝑚𝑛 (X,Y)= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 | 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚 − 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛 |= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 ( 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚
    − 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛 )∗( 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚 − 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛 ) − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (9) Squared
    distance—the square of the Euclidean metric: 𝑑 𝑚𝑛 (X,Y)= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 ( 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚 − 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛
    )∗( 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚 − 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛 ) (10) Symmetric Kullback–Leibler metric distance—only valid
    when X and Y are real and positive numbers: 𝑑 𝑚𝑛 (X,Y)= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝐾 ( 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚 − 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛
    )(log 𝑥 𝑘,𝑚 −log 𝑦 𝑘,𝑛 ) (11) 4. Experiment Design and System Implementation 4.1.
    System Design A robot machine usually has limited battery capacities, so it is
    important to reduce unnecessary operations as much as possible if the machine
    is expected to do long-term work. Hence, it is better not to use the camera to
    monitor the machine during the whole trip, we only need to focus on some specific
    environmental images when an unusual topography is detected. Keeping this in mind,
    our algorithm leverages inertial sensors to continuously detect robot vehicle
    movement, only collecting corresponding camera data once an unusual motion pattern
    is detected. This, in addition to the fact that IMU sensors consume much less
    power than cameras, can dramatically decrease the energy requirement and the computing
    overhead of the whole algorithm. 4.2. System Implementation Processing motion
    sensor data in real time is very important for our method. Additionally, capturing
    the associated environment images in time also offers accurate reference data
    for future analysis. Moreover, we also plan to add a real-time image processing
    function in future research. To achieve the best performance and extensibility,
    we chose an embedded computing platform and optimized the inference engine as
    the hardware container [44]. Our inference engine is optimized to run on this
    specific embedded computing platform [45,46]. In this work, we choose the NVIDIA
    Jetson TX2 embedded computer as the embedded computing platform. The Jetson TX2
    has a hexcore ARMv8 64-bit CPU complex and a 256-core Pascal GPU. Our system is
    built upon the multithread framework, written in C and C++. We use independent
    pipelines to manage different tasks, e.g., we created a pipeline to collect data
    from motion sensors and monitor various events and implemented another pipeline
    to collect environment images. Each pipeline consists of a series of elements.
    The element is where a data stream is processed. In the hardware platform for
    small agricultural machine development, size and price are the two main parameters
    that must be considered in the design idea. In this study, we used a small-sized
    and low-cost IMU to capture acceleration and angular speed change. 4.3. Simulation
    Experiment Scenarios In this study, we wanted to test our proposed algorithms
    and have precise control on knowing the terrain. Therefore, a simulation was built
    using a sand table that could easily create different terrain conditions. The
    sand table is a narrow rectangle that is like a downscaled racing track. During
    the data collection, we counted each run from one end of the sand table to the
    other end as one instance. To augment the datasets, we collected data with both
    ends as starting points and the other ends correspondingly as the end points.
    The different setups for each kind of terrain conditions as shown in Table 2 were
    chosen for the experimental tests. These simulated field conditions mainly included
    dry flat path, slope, depression, and muddy path. Each scenario was set up on
    the sand table. The lengths of these four experimental scenarios were approximately
    2–3 m. Table 2 shows detailed information about each scenario. While the tested
    speeds of the robot vehicle in different scenarios vary according to the roughness
    of the fields, these speeds are helpful in guaranteeing high-quality data with
    proper passing period of each topography. Table 2. Indoor experiment scenarios.
    4.4. Real-World Validation Experiment Scenarios In this study, we collected the
    real-world field data with the vehicle (2019 Tacoma TRD Sport 4 × 4) as shown
    in Figure 4. Figure 4. The vehicle used for data collection. Data collection activities
    included investigating and selecting locations of experiment scenarios in the
    field and collecting sensor data for various types of experiment scenarios. After
    the investigation in the field, four types of experiment scenarios were determined
    by researchers as shown in Table 3 with an IMU sensor. When collecting data for
    each experiment scenario, the researchers set the vehicle with a constant throttle
    to move straight forward with a fixed steering. The driving distance for each
    experiment scenario per trail was about 60 feet. Vehicle motion data in terms
    of gyroscope and acceleration (without g) were collected. Table 3. Real-world
    experiment scenarios. 5. Result and Discussion We demonstrate and discuss the
    performance of our approach in recognizing dry flat surface field, slope, depression,
    and muddy field separately. In each scenario, a motion pattern and corresponding
    topological feature are plotted and discussed together in the following subsections.
    For different scenarios, we applied different speed and data collection rate setups
    for better quality data, and we also conducted some data processing, such as normalization,
    denoising, etc. Because the vehicle size and topological scale used for the simulated
    environment and the real-world field are significantly different, the ranges and
    slopes of both gyroscope and acceleration vary. However, our algorithm can still
    recognize the patterns with a data processing step. 5.1. Single Slope As is shown
    in Figure 5, the field slopes were estimated using a gyroscope via coordinate
    alignment. The downslope with a sharply increasing incline and the downslope with
    a deep decrease are also marked. The derivative could easily address the gradient
    of the slope. If the gyroscope value drops down fast, then the slope is steep,
    while the slope has a minor gradient if the gyroscope value change is gradual.
    The results in Figure 5a give us an accordant pattern of slope detection in practice
    to the theoretical pattern. If, in some cases, the collected data could not perfectly
    match the pattern, the estimated linear acceleration was calculated as alignment
    using the accelerometer to reduce noise in the sensor data as shown in Figure
    6. However, in most cases, the single slope could be recognized only using gyroscope
    data. Figure 5. Field slope with segmental gyroscope data: (a) simulated environment
    result; (b) real-world observed result. Figure 6. Field slope with segmental linear
    acceleration data: (a) simulated result estimate; (b) real-world observed. Figure
    5b shows the real-world observed downslope from the field using a gyroscope via
    coordinate alignment. The climbing movement starts from around data point 100
    and ends at around data point 175. The pattern is obvious and could be easily
    detected, but the noise from the observation, particularly at the end of the process,
    is significant. The results regarding the linear acceleration in Figure 6b, however,
    produce an unclear pattern of the downslope compared with the results from the
    gyroscope. 5.2. Depression or Soil Erosion The depression can be identified from
    changes of values along the z-axis as shown in Figure 7. If the z-axis readings
    stay somewhat stable, then it should be a smooth field without bumps or depressions.
    If the readings start fluctuating, then there might exist a bump or depression.
    If the magnitude of readings along the z-axis changes from positive to negative,
    and readings of the x and the y axis also change, then it is very likely there
    is a depression. Similar patterns are also revealed by the real-world observed
    segmental gyroscope data collected from the experiments. The depression location
    starts from data point 100 and ends at around data point 270. The depressions
    between simulated environment and real-world environment are a little different
    in slope and distribution, so the valleys and peaks have different ranges. For
    example, the second valley in Figure 7a,b is different, but it was still recognized
    as similar to the second drop down according to pattern recognition. Figure 7.
    Field depression with segmental gyroscope data: (a) simulated result estimate;
    (b) real-world observed. 5.3. Rough Field The rough field is indicated by a continuous
    occurrence of bumps or depressions as shown in Figure 8a. If continuous peaks
    and valleys can be observed from z-axis values, then it is highly likely that
    there is a rough patch of the field. It can be divided into several depressions,
    which means the pattern of the rough field is a combination of depression patterns.
    The same pattern appears in the real-word observed segmental gyroscope data collected
    from the rough roads, shown in Figure 8b. With a short segment of the flat road
    before and after the rough segment, the fluctuations from all the directions continuously
    occur and show a clear pattern as estimated. Figure 8. Rough field with segmental
    gyroscope data: (a) simulated result estimate; (b) real-world observed. 5.4. Flat
    Field vs. Muddy Field A muddy field could cause sudden deceleration as shown in
    Figure 9, where the muddy field starts from 9 s. The deceleration can be inferred
    from changes in readings along the y-axis. As we can see from this example, there
    is a deep valley at around 12 s, and the readings of both the x- and the z-axis
    are also fluctuating. Similar real-world results are shown in Figure 9b. Figure
    9. Deceleration happens with the field surface changes: (a) Simulated result estimate;
    (b) real-world observed. 6. Conclusions and Future Work Precision agriculture
    requires maps with localized topographies to properly adjust irrigation, route
    planning, and other crop management practices. Current approaches to this problem
    include the use of cameras and advanced computer vision algorithms or using distance
    sensors for gathering depth information for 3D map construction. Both methods
    are power-expensive, constraining their use. Our work presents an alternative
    method using a sensing algorithm with a low-cost, robot-vehicle-mounted, multidimensional
    map augmentation method that can track robot vehicle movements, monitor the surrounding
    environment by collecting key images, and link all the factors to the existing
    map, thereby providing useful analytics for task planning, route planning, and
    robot operators. The method leverages IMU sensors to gather mobility data for
    the robot vehicle. We also present data fusion techniques to detect topological
    changes in the field that could potentially cause a negative influence on farm
    machines. The results indicate this method works well and should lend itself to
    many useful agricultural applications. In the future, we will continue exploring
    algorithms that can improve the robustness of this sensing method. Additionally,
    a deep neural network (DNN)–based mechanism will be developed that enables the
    algorithm to detect some categories of environmental objects alongside with the
    map points under good lighting conditions. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    global population of 7.8 billion (2020) persons is expected to reach 9.7 billion
    by 2050 [1]. It is expected that the world would require 70% more food than what
    available at the moment with less natural resources like land and water due to
    urbanization, soil erosion, climatic changes, water shortages and excessive use
    by livestock. It is estimated that there is about 33% wastage of agriculture production
    due to poor logistics and storage [2]–[4]. As result, the key for coping strategies
    in the contexts of climate change and food security is to implement precision
    agricultural or smart farming. Precision agriculture is a technology-enabled approach
    to farming management that observes, measures, and analyzes the needs of individual
    fields and crops [5]. Smart farming is defined as the application of information
    and data technologies for optimizing complex farming systems. It focuses on how
    the collected agriculture related information can be used in a smart way, rather
    than the storage of data, access to data and the application of these agriculture
    data. Big data and machine learning algorithms are two main important components
    in paddy rice smart farming. Big Data can be defined as a data that can be described
    using three key concepts: volume, velocity, and variety. Volume refers to size
    of the data, variety refers to the various types of data (e.g., text, numbers,
    images, videos and audios) and Velocity refers to the increasing speed at which
    big data is created (e.g., live stream data). Machine learning focuses on the
    development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
    Applying smart farming technologies will definitely assist farmers in various
    tasks to increase crop productions. In order to narrow down the scope of this
    paper, we focus on paddy rice smart farming as rice is an increasingly important
    staple food in Asia Pacific region and other parts of the world. The changes over
    time in land use and soil salinity levels have significant impact on the production
    of rice yields [6]. In addition to that, unpredictable weather conditions and
    inefficient techniques to predict weather conditions are amongst the few factors
    that reduce rice yields production [7], [8]. For instance, most farmers in Myanmar
    face heavy rains during the rice growing season and that crop damage and yield
    losses due to heavy rains cause extensive losses among farmers [9]. As a result,
    the ability to predict weather or climate trends and environmental factors (e.g.,
    soil nutrient) is very important in enhancing paddy farmers’ productivity [7].
    The current practices, which heavily rely on fertilizers and pesticides to increase
    productivity are not supporting the sustainable rice yields production because
    these activities are not environmentally friendly farming systems [10]. In addition
    to that, the timing for rice yields harvesting also influences the production
    of rice yields as the best timing for paddy harvesting showed a linear relationship
    with grain loss [11]. As a result, monitoring the growth of paddy is very crucial
    to sustain rice yields production. Rice production in coastal areas is frequently
    affected by typhoons. The lack of ability to manage impacts from natural events
    and disasters that include contamination of water bodies, loss of harvest, and
    destruction of irrigation systems and other agricultural infrastructure is another
    shortcoming that requires attention [12], [13]. With smart farming, the application
    of data mining and analytical techniques designed so far for prediction, detection
    and development of appropriate disaster management strategy based on the collected
    data from disasters can be used to manage these impacts and consequently support
    agriculture or farming activities with more effectively and efficiently. Variation
    within farms and region based on resource endowments, location topography and
    farmers circumstances make it difficult to apply the same strategy in maximizing
    rice yields productivity. Towards the end of the twentieth century, precision
    agriculture began to be utilized that applies information technologies to capture
    and integrate data from multiple sources (e.g., farmers, sensors) in order to
    have a more robust strategy associated with crop management and thus can be used
    to maximize agriculture productivity [14]. Unsustainable rice yields production
    [6], inefficient techniques to predict weather conditions, lack of ability to
    manage calamities [7], [8], [12], variation within farms and region [14] and poor
    logistics and storage [2]–[4] are among the reasons why smart farming should be
    adopted to sustain and optimize rice yields productivity. In this paper, we conduct
    a systematic literature review (SLR) of the latest research on intelligent data
    processing technology involved in rice smart farming focusing on the rice production
    and post-production phases of the agriculture supply chain. We describe the main
    datasets or features extracted for data modelling. We then elaborate role of machine
    learning algorithms in smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine
    learning in various scenarios in the rice production and post-production phases
    of the agriculture supply chain. This paper also presents a framework that maps
    the activities defined in rice smart farming, datasets or features used in data
    modelling and machine learning algorithms used to analyze these features for each
    activity defined in the early stage of agriculture supply chain. The remainder
    of this article is organized as follows. Section II provides the literature review
    of the most recent reviews conducted related to smart farming. Section 3 describes
    the existing frameworks related to agriculture supply chain. Section 4 provides
    an in-depth analysis of the type of big data used in rice smart farming agriculture
    focusing on the variety of sources used, the variety of machine learning algorithms
    used and finally the variety tasks involved in the rice production and post-production
    phases of smart farming. The research work presented in this section is classified
    based on the sources and types of data that are used, the types of tasks involve
    in smart farming and also the type of machine learning algorithms used to model
    these data. Section 5 presents a framework that maps the activities defined in
    smart farming, datasets or features used in data modelling and machine learning
    algorithms used to analyze these features for each activity defined in the early
    stage of agriculture supply chain. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper and
    presents challenges and technological trends towards the exploitation of multiple
    sources in the era of big data in agriculture. SECTION II. Literature Review A
    survey has been conducted to look into the global coverage in terms of innovation
    related to smart farming and the usage of machine learning in smart farming. The
    survey was conducted by using two methods; looking at the trends of number of
    scholarly works over time related to Smart Farming, Machine Learning in Smart
    Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence in Smart Agriculture and Internet of Things
    in Smart Agriculture, and reviewing all review studies that were conducted on
    several elements of I4.0 and its applications in smart farming for improving the
    productivity. Firstly, the trends of number of scholarly works over time related
    to Smart Farming, Machine Learning in Smart Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence
    in Smart Agriculture and Internet of Things in Smart Agriculture, can be obtained
    by using the Lens website (https://www.lens.org). Lens provides open datasets
    of patent documents, scholarly research works and any inventions related to machine
    learning, artificial intelligence, internet of things and smart farming disclosed
    in patents [15]. The Lens serves global patent and scholarly knowledge as a public
    resource to make science- and technology-enabled problem solving more effective,
    efficient and inclusive. This knowledge may help show ways forward such as new
    or repurposed ideas and inventions, better strategies and targeted partnerships
    for collective action. Based on these four keywords used in searching for trends
    in smart farming research, the usage of Machine Learning (ML) in smart farming,
    the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart farming and the usage of Internet
    of Things (IoT) in smart farming, Fig. 1 through Fig. 4 display the increasing
    trends of number of scholarly works over time related to these keywords. For instance,
    based on these Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, several scholarly works have
    been filed and recorded and the number of scholarly works filed has increased
    between the year of 2018 and 2019. FIGURE 1. The trends of scholarly works over
    time related to Smart Farming. Show All FIGURE 2. The trends of scholarly works
    over time related to Machine Learning in Smart Farming. Show All FIGURE 3. The
    trends of scholarly works over time related to Artificial Intelligence in Smart
    Farming. Show All FIGURE 4. The trends of scholarly works over time related to
    Internet of Things in Smart Farming. Show All Secondly, in the past, few review
    studies were conducted on several elements of I4.0 and its applications in smart
    farming for improving the productivity in agriculture sectors as mentioned in
    Table 1. These studies have focused on I4.0 applications in the smart farming
    covering specific aspects like Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Big Data
    Analytics (Machine Learning). Table 1 shows several reviews that were conducted
    recently that are related to smart farming or precision agriculture. Several reviews
    conducted were focusing on the application of machine learning algorithms in smart
    farming [16], [17]. For instance, Sharma et al. investigated the current state
    of research on machine learning (ML) applications in Agriculture Supply Chain
    (ASC) that includes the application of ML in four different phases in ASC; pre-production,
    production, processing and distribution [16]. It was concluded that all three
    ML algorithms can be leveraged to develop a sustainable ASC. A Machine Learning-Agriculture
    Supply Chain performance framework was introduced in which the machine learning
    algorithms are mapped into all four different phases in ASC based on the type
    of data used. However, these data are not explained and categorized comprehensively.
    TABLE 1 Review Papers: Elements of I4.0 and its Applications in Smart Farming
    Mekonnen et al. conducted a review on the application of various machine learning
    methods in analyzing data captured from sensors within the agricultural ecosystem
    [17]. In this review, a limited number of machine learning algorithms is listed
    based on the data that are captured using different types of Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (e.g., ZigBee WSN, GSM and GPS WSN, LoRa WSN, Wifi and MQTT Sensor based
    with Raspberry pi and Arduino) and also remotely sensed data (multispectral or
    hyperspectral data) and vegetation indices. Based on the trend obtained from this
    review, there will be an increased use of more advanced techniques like distributed
    (or edge) deep learning. Several reviews also conducted focusing on the application
    of deep learning algorithms only in smart farming [18]–[21]. One of the findings
    from these reviews is that the deep learning algorithms are proven to be better
    in providing high accuracy results compared with other machine learning algorithms
    in terms of accuracy when applied to various agricultural problems, such as disease
    detection and identification, fruit or plants classification and fruit counting
    among other domains. The evolution of agriculture systems involves the adoption
    of incoming data from various sources [27] and also the application of big data
    applications in smart farming [26]. Together these big data technologies and the
    capability of machine learning algorithms in forecasting certain outcomes will
    cause major changes in the scope and organization of smart farming [16], [17],
    [26]. Lytos et al. conducted a survey paper that covers the state-of-the-art big
    data architectures and agriculture systems in order to bridge the knowledge gap
    between agriculture systems and exploitation of big data. However, in this review,
    the authors list out the name of the databases and features used in the agriculture
    systems only without outlining how these data are processed or analyzed. The quality
    and type of dataset collected from sensors greatly influence the performance of
    the forecasting algorithm in predicting the crop yields. For instance, in optimizing
    the performance of forecasting crop yields, Fabrizio Balducci et al. have investigated
    the performance of several machine learning algorithms based on different subsets
    of features extracted from the environmental sensors [29]. There are quite a number
    of reviews conducted related to Internet of Things (IoT) technologies [38]. The
    emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has also improved the performance
    of a real-time monitoring of the data related to smart farming [20]. IoT are mainly
    used in monitoring crop, soil and weather, forecasting disease and crop yields,
    controlling irrigation machinery and autonomous vehicles and robots [22]. Based
    on several reviews, it can be concluded that incorporating precision livestock
    farming technologies (Sensors), big data analytics, and the IoT in smart farming
    practices puts forth a possible solution to assist us to improve agriculture productivity
    and meet projected global agricultural product demands [23]–[25], [28]. The increasing
    amount and variety of data captured and obtained by these emerging technologies
    in IoT offer the smart farming strategy new abilities to predict changes and identify
    opportunities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such studies are conducted
    to review comprehensively the present mapping of datasets or features and machine
    learning algorithms based on different types of tasks involved in the paddy rice
    production and post-production phases of the ASC. There are several related works
    conducted about the applications of machine learning on the paddy rice smart farming.
    Several researches have been conducted that apply machine learning algorithm (e.g.,
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) [46], [98], [127], Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    [94], [95], and hybrid approaches [103], [124]) in paddy rice sample recognition
    and classification using high-resolution images. Remotely sensed, vegetation indices
    and climate data are commonly used to predict paddy rice yield estimation [34],
    [35], [48], [76], [77], [109] and to monitor paddy rice growth [63], [73], [84]
    using artificial neural networks and its variants and also linear regression approaches.
    In addition to that, hyperspectral and high-resolution images have been used to
    accurately and affectively monitor paddy rice disease [40], [41], [87], [88],
    [118] and assessing quality of paddy rice [93], [104], [105] by using deep learning
    algorithms. In this paper, we will present a framework that maps three elements
    which include a) Paddy rice production and post-production activities defined
    in the ASC, b) datasets or features related to agriculture components captured
    from sensors, and c) machine learning algorithms used to analyze these features
    for each activities defined in the early stage of ASC. This is done by Identifying
    the phases and tasks involved in the paddy rice smart farming that require intelligent
    data processing technologies. Describing the main datasets or features captured
    and used by intelligent data processing technologies in each task identified in
    the paddy rice smart farming. Elaborating the roles of machine learning technology
    in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine learning
    in various tasks and phases in the paddy rice smart farming. SECTION III. Phases
    and Tasks in Paddy Rice Smart Farming This paper focuses on the smart farming
    technologies used in paddy growth and production. This section elaborates the
    selected phases and tasks involved in the paddy rice smart farming [16]. The applications
    of machine learning algorithms and smart technologies in the agriculture supply
    chain can be divided into 4 phases and include pre-production, production, post-production
    and finally distribution phases [16], [30], [31]. However, in this work, we focus
    on several tasks that require intelligent data processing technologies that can
    be fully utilized to improve the production of paddy rice. Thus, this review focuses
    on the rice production and post-production phases. In the rice production phase,
    several activities are conducted sequentially such as planting, managing water,
    monitoring soil fertility, managing weed and finally managing pests and diseases.
    Then, in the rice post-production phase, the activities can be divided into harvesting,
    drying, storage and milling and processing. Based on these phases and tasks, we
    will look into the features or datasets that are applied by machine learning algorithms
    in this rice production processes. The SLR framework used for presenting the review
    findings is presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 highlights two main categories which are
    the paddy growing activities and the smart farming activities associated with
    the paddy growing activities. The paddy growing activities can be divided into
    production and post-production phases. The first step in rice production phase
    is planting. Rice crops can either be direct seeded or transplanted. Next, ensuring
    the rice plant to get adequate water is very important since rice is extremely
    sensitive to water shortages. Managing good practices for smart paddy irrigation
    is very critical to maximize water efficiency and yield. Smart irrigation for
    paddy rice deals with maintaining a predetermined water height in paddy fields
    automatically based on the growth stages of the paddy rice [32], [33]. Managing
    weeds is crucial to reduce the amount of weed pressure in the field. Next, monitoring
    soil fertility is also very essential to optimize the growth of a rice plant.
    At the same time, timely and accurate diagnosis of paddy diseases and managing
    pests are highly required to reduce loses. Monitoring paddy rice disease involves
    activities such as detection and recognition of diseases from paddy plant leaf
    images [37], [39] or classifying, detecting, and predicting infestation patterns
    of the Brown Planthopper in rice paddies [40], [41]. Generally, monitoring the
    growth of paddy rice involves analyzing the growth of paddy rice based on climate
    data or remotely sensed data and vegetation indices. This also includes developing
    an approach for mapping rice-growing areas at field level using phenology-based
    rice crop classification or paddy growth stages classification [34]–[36]. Predicting
    paddy rice yield estimation involves tasks such as yield assessment of paddy fields
    using machine learning algorithms [42] or mapping rice planted area using the
    hyperspectral data or remotely sensed data and vegetation indices [43]. FIGURE
    5. Rice production and post-production phases in paddy rice smart farming. Show
    All In the rice post-production phase, paddy harvesting activities include reaping,
    stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Harvesting paddy should
    be performed efficiently as the speed of paddy harvesting showed a linear relationship
    with grain loss [11]. When rice is harvested, it will contain up to 25% moisture.
    High moisture level during storage can lead to grain discoloration, encourage
    development of molds, and increase the likelihood of attack from pests. It can
    also decrease the germination rate of the rice seed. Assessing the quality of
    paddy rice can be performed by using any machine learning algorithms. Assessing
    the quality of paddy rice usually involves activities such as assessing the quality
    of the rice [44] or investigating the impact of climate change on paddy rice production
    [45]. Next, drying process will involve the process of drying paddy by using traditional
    or mechanical systems. It is important to dry rice grain as soon as possible after
    harvesting (ideally within 24 hours). After that, these dried rice grain will
    be stored to prevent grain loss caused by adverse weather, moisture, rodents,
    birds, insects and micro-organisms like fungi. Finally, the last activity in the
    post-production phase is the milling process which remove the husk and the bran
    layers, and produce an edible, white rice. Paddy rice sample recognition and classification
    can be applied to perform the milling process. In paddy rice sample recognition
    and classification, the main task is to separate and classify objects of rice
    sample based on color and texture features with the help of image processing and
    machine learning techniques [46], [47]. SECTION IV. Application of Big Data and
    Machine Learning in Rice Production Tasks A. Big Data Used in Rice Production
    Tasks Data that are commonly used in paddy rice smart farming can be categorized
    into sensor data, remotely sensed data and vegetation indices, drone based data
    and finally paddy rice leaf analysis data. Table 2 tabulates the types of data
    and features used in paddy rice smart farming according to the smart farming activities
    described in Fig. 5. TABLE 2 Types of Data and Features Used in Paddy Rice Smart
    Farming TABLE 3 Applications of Smart Technologies (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT))
    in Various Scenarios in the Paddy Rice Pre-Production and Production Phases of
    the ASC 1) Sensor Data Firstly, the typical types of sensor data captured that
    can be used in monitoring paddy rice growth or yield estimation of paddy rice
    are data related to meteorological. Meteorological data (or climate data) can
    be used to monitor paddy rice growth [45], [48] and disease [41]. For instance,
    Guruprasad et al. conducted a yield estimation modeling paddy crop at different
    spatial resolution (SR) levels based on weather and soil data as input features.
    These features include day and night temperature (min, max, mean), diffused irradiance,
    precipitation (cumulative), relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, pH, soil
    moisture and temperature (0-40cm) [48]. It was observed that the disease incidence
    on paddy rice growth is also directly affected by the level of temperature, wetness
    duration [50], [51]. Paddy rice production is also affected by the level of precipitation.
    For instance, the paddy rice production was found to be affected by the decreasing
    post-monsoon precipitation as this time coincides with the sensitivity of the
    paddy fruiting and ripening stages [54]. Besides that, winds may also affect the
    growth and production of paddy rice plants as strong winds are very detrimental
    to the growth and production of rice plants, especially when they occur during
    the flowering and ripening phases of rice [49]. Rainfall was found to be the main
    climate driver of the paddy rice yield [111]. The suitable soil pH for rice cultivation
    is at pH 6.0 [52] or 6.25 [53]. Analyzing the nitrogen level of paddy rice can
    also be used to assess the quality of paddy rice [105]. 2) Remotely Sensed Data
    and Vegetation Indices Secondly, remote sensing data or remotely sensed data and
    vegetation indices can be used in different ways in estimating paddy yield, monitoring
    paddy growth and diseases. Many studies are based on the mapping of rice-growing
    are [35], [43] [57], mapping cropping patterns [57]–[59], mapping paddy vulnerability
    to flooding [58]. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors
    have a total of 36 spectral bands and seven of them are related to vegetation
    and land surfaces that include several ranges [60]. Seven of the most used spectral
    bands includes Red (620–670 nm) - Band 1 Near Infrared One (NIR1) (841–875 nm)
    - Band 2 Blue (459–479 nm) - Band 3 Green (545–565 nm) - Band 4 Near Infrared
    Two (NIR2) (1230–1250 nm) - Band 5 Shortwave Infrared One (SWIR1) (1628–1652 nm)
    - Band 6 Shortwave Infrared Two (SWIR2) (2105–2155 nm) - Band 7 Based on these
    spectral bands, several measurements can be derived and computed such as Land
    Surface Water Index (LSWI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Leaf
    Area Index (LAI) (see Table 2). LSWI is sensitive to the total amount of liquid
    water in vegetation and its soil background. LSWI was developed by considering
    two bands of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and the NIR regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum to compute the estimation of water content of the land surface [61].
    LSWI is computed based on Eq. 1; LSWI= ρNIR−ρSWIR1 ρNIR+ρSWIR1 (1) View Source
    where ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ SWIR1 is the reflectance in the Shortwave
    Infrared One. LSWI can be used to detect and classify paddy rice phenology in
    paddy fields with complex cropping patterns [35], [62]. It was also used to assess
    the damage of regional rainfed paddy rice after severe floods [44] and monitoring
    rice growth [63]. Liou and Sha found that the value of LSWI increases and becomes
    higher that NDVI and EVI [44]. EVI can be used to quantify vegetation greenness
    [64]. Son et al. have constructed a time-series EVI and LSWI data in order to
    perform the phenology-based rice crop classification [35]. EVI can be measured
    as follows; EVI=G× ρNIR−ρRed ρNIR+( C 1 ×ρred− C 2 ×ρBlue)+L (2) View Source where
    ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ Red is the reflectance in the red, ρ Blue
    is the reflectance in the blue, C1, C2, and L are coefficients and G is the gain
    factor. The coefficients adopted in the MODIS-EVI algorithm are; L=1 , C 1 =6
    , C 2 =7.5 , and G=2.5 . EVI is normally combined with other vegetation indices
    (e.g., NDVI, LSWI) to predict paddy rice yields’ estimation [35], [58] [59], [62],
    assess damage of regional rainfed paddy rice [44] and monitor rice growth [62],
    [63]. The results of applying MODIS-based paddy rice phenological detection algorithm
    in classifying paddy growth stages are found to be encouraging and can be used
    to monitor paddy rice agriculture at a larger scale [62], [63]. Indices that correlate
    with vegetation cover are also used in estimating paddy yield and monitoring paddy
    growth such as the NDVI, which is mostly used to predict paddy rice yields’ estimation
    [43], [57], [59], assessing damage of regional rainfed paddy rice [44] and monitoring
    rice growth [63]. NVDI is used to measure the level of greenness and biomass of
    vegetation. NDVI measurements are most often taken from satellites in orbit around
    the Earth. NDVI can be computed based on differences in the response patterns
    of vegetation in the red and NIR ranges as follows [65]; NDVI= ρNIR−ρRed ρNIR+ρRed
    (3) View Source where ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR and ρ Red is the reflectance
    in the red and this NDVI ranges between -1 (no vegetation) and +1 (green vegetation).
    Both the NDVI and EVI are most commonly used vegetation indices to monitor the
    health of vegetation on the fields [35], [43], [57], [59], [66]–[69]. However,
    some researchers have reported that EVI is often preferred than NDVI as EVI is
    more responsive to biophysical variables, such as LAI [35], [67]. For instance,
    EVI is more robust in capturing the difference in well-vegetated areas [67]. MNDWI
    is computed based on differences in the response patterns of vegetation in the
    green and SWIR1 ranges for the enhancement of open water features [70] and can
    be measured as follows; MNDWI= ρGreen−ρSWIR1 ρGreen+ρSWIR1 (4) View Source where
    ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ SWIR1 is the reflectance in the Shortwave
    Infrared One. The integration of NDVI and MNDWI from Sentinel-2A image has shown
    increased accuracy of predicting the paddy rice yield estimation [57]. LAI is
    a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies that typically can
    be defined as the ratio of one sided leaf area per unit ground area ( m 2 / m
    2 ) and can be considered as a measure of paddy crop growth and productivity since
    it characterizes plant canopy structure and gives an idea of the amount of biomass
    available in a field. LAI can be measured using a plant canopy analyzer [71].
    Some works have been conducted to estimate paddy rice LAI with a fixed point continuous
    observation of near infrared reflectance using a calibrated digital camera [71],
    [72]. Estimating paddy rice LAI can also be done using machine learning methods
    [69] and also statistical methods [73] based on hyperspectral data. The leaf area
    index (LAI) and plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) were also used to estimate
    the nitrogen nutritional index (NNI) in paddy rice [74]. Hyperspectral images
    (Red, Blue, Green and Near Infrared One) can also be used to predict paddy rice
    yield estimation [75]–[77], assess the quality of paddy rice [69], [71], [72],
    [78], [79] and monitor paddy rice disease [80], [81]. Another remotely sensed
    data that is widely used in smart farming called C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data. C-Band SAR data can be obtained from the Sentinel-1A satellite which
    provides a collection of data in all-weather, day or night. C-Band SAR data has
    been used in a wide range of applications that include sea and land monitoring.
    For instance, C-Band SAR has been used in predicting paddy rice yield estimation
    [82], monitoring paddy rice growth [83] and monitoring paddy rice disease [40].
    3) Drone Based Data Next, drone based data include all imageries captured using
    the drone technology. The high resolution images captured using drone can be used
    to estimate the paddy rice yield [42], [84]–[86], monitor paddy rice disease [37],
    [39], [87]–[92], classify paddy rice samples [46], [47], [93]–[101] and also assess
    the quality of paddy rice [102]–[104]. For instance, a near real-time deep learning
    approach for detecting rice phenology has also been designed based on high resolutions
    images taken by using drones [86]. For instance, a SVM classifier can be used
    to perform segmentation and classification of paddy rice samples [46]. The prediction
    of nitrogen deficiency of rice crop can also be done to access the quality of
    the rice using deep learning methods [104]. B. Applications of Machine Learning
    Algorithms in Paddy Rice Smart Farming This section elaborates the roles of machine
    learning technology in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications
    of machine learning algorithms and smart technologies in various scenarios in
    the paddy rice production and post-production phases of the ASC. As mentioned
    earlier, intelligent data processing technologies can be applied in various scenarios
    in all the paddy rice production and post-production phases of the ASC and these
    tasks include smart irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation,
    monitoring paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality
    of paddy rice, paddy rice sample recognition and classification. The state-of-the-art
    for the tasks involved in the smart paddy rice farming is illustrated in Fig.
    6. First, all the acquired data (Sensor, Remotely sensed data and vegetation indices,
    and drone based data) will be cleaned, fusioned or integrated. Then, the dimensionality
    of the data can be reduced using feature selection, construction, transformation
    and weighting processes [162]–[164]. Next, once the data are prepared, then they
    will be divided into training and testing data depending on the types of task
    (e.g., classification, regression or clustering) or machine learning algorithms
    (e.g., estimation, linear and non-linear methods) used to model the data. Finally,
    model evaluation and interpretation will be performed to extract knowledge that
    supports the tasks in the smart paddy rice farming (e.g., Paddy Yield Estimation,
    Monitoring Paddy Growth, Assessing the Quality of Paddy Rice, Determining Paddy
    Rice Classes and Monitoring Paddy Rice Diseases). FIGURE 6. State-of-the-art for
    the tasks involved in the smart paddy rice farming. Show All 1) Smart Irrigation
    System for Paddy Rice Automatic drip irrigation system requires a lesser amount
    of water to maintain a predetermined water height in paddy fields [32], [33] and
    this system can be controlled based on the captured climate data (e.g., temperature,
    humidity, light and rain) from sensors. Using a wireless sensor and actuator network
    (WSAN) to build a smart irrigation system for paddy fields can also conserve significant
    amount of water [106], [107]. Automatic irrigation system can cause a significant
    increase of rice production by making more arable land available for paddy rice
    plantation [33]. Besides that, smart sensors for climate and soil [36], [36],
    Radio-frequency identification (RFID), load Sensor and Global Positioning System
    (GPS) are also used in estimating paddy rice yield [113], [114]. Table 3 tabulates
    the applications of smart sensors (Internet of Things (IoT)) in various tasks
    involved in paddy rice smart farming. 2) Predicting Paddy Rice Yield Estimation
    Most researches model the paddy rice estimation based on the hyperspectral and
    climate data in predicting paddy rice yield estimation (see Table 4). These studies
    conducted using various types of remotely sensed data and vegetation indices to
    predict paddy rice yield estimation [34], [35], [57], [58], [67]. Thus, one of
    the issues is determining the best combination of data obtained from remotely
    sensed data and vegetation indices to improve the accuracy of predicting paddy
    rice yield estimation. For instance, the integration of NDVI and MNDWI from Sentinel-2A
    image with temporal backscatter increased the accuracy by 0.08 [57]. Combining
    hyperspectral data (e.g., NDVI and MNDWI) will also increase the accuracy of estimating
    the paddy rice yield by using Classification And Regression Trees (CART) [57].
    CART is one of the variants of Decision Tree (DT) classifiers that can be used
    for classification or regression predictive modeling problems [57], [66], [144].
    DT is one of important types of algorithm for supervised learning, particularly
    in predictive modeling [78], [81], [126]. DT are constructed via an algorithmic
    approach that optimizes the splitting of a data set based on different conditions
    of the data features. In addition to that, using multi-features fusion method
    can also improve the accuracy of predicting paddy rice yields using a deep learning
    approach [112]. TABLE 4 Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting
    Paddy Rice Yield Estimation Partial Least Squares (PLS) algorithm can be found
    in many researches conducted to estimate the paddy rice yields [34], [35], [75].
    For instance, short wave infrared region was found to be very essential for estimating
    the paddy yield using PLS algorithm [34]. PLS was developed based on the principal
    component regression that can be used to build models that can predict more than
    one dependent variable [63], [69], [136]. PLS was also found to produce higher
    R2 of 0.984 compared to Principal Components Regression (PCR) in predicting paddy
    rice yield estimation [75]. PCR is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    that is used to analyze the multiple regression data that suffer from multicollinearity
    [132] (e.g., predicting paddy rice yield estimation [75]). Before any modelling
    can be performed, PCA can be used to extract features of the datasets [128]. PCA
    is a well-known technique used for reducing the dimensionality of the datasets
    [129]. This is done to increase the interpretability but at the same time minimizing
    information loss [130], [131]. A few variants of deep learning algorithms have
    also been used to predict paddy rice yield estimation based on NDVI [109], climate
    data [48], [110]–[112], [155] and hyperspectral data (Bands 1~4) [75]–[77] with
    higher accuracy results. These deep learning algorithms include Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) [48], [77], [110], [111], Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [76],
    [109], [112], Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [155]). For instance, neural network
    algorithms achieved better overall accuracy compared to Random Forest (RF) and
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) using either the hyperspectral or climate data [48],
    [109], [110]. Inspired by the way biological nervous systems, ANN is basically
    an information processing technique that works like the way human brain processes
    information [150]. An ordinary neural network may consist of hidden layers and
    weights while CNN has filters which collectively make up the convolution layers.
    CNN is most commonly applied to analyze images and it is a class of deep neural
    networks. CNN is suitable to be used for spatial data such as images. In contrast,
    RNN is suitable to be used for temporal data which is also called sequential data.
    Compared to ANN, RNN is able to learn time-series data since it has a recurrent
    connection on the hidden state and this looping constraint ensures that sequential
    information is captured in the input data [151], [155]. Although, deep learning
    algorithms are known to be very effective and robust to forecast yields paddy
    rice yield estimation, [76], [77], [109], [111], [155] they require a large amount
    of time-series data to improve the prediction performance [112]. RF requires two
    parameters namely the number of trees and the number of features to split the
    data set based on different conditions [143]. RF has been found to be effective
    in predicting paddy rice yield estimation and monitoring paddy rice growth [48],
    [82]. Several works related to applying SVM in paddy rice smart farming have been
    reviewed in this paper [48], [109]. However, they produced lower accuracies compared
    to deep learning algorithms. SVM is a supervised machine learning model that can
    be used for binary classification tasks [146]. The objective of the SVM is to
    find the optimum hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can distinctly classifies
    the data points. Unsupervised learning algorithm can also be used to predict the
    paddy rice estimation using the hyperspectral data [58]. For instance, Iterative
    Self-Organizing (ISO) has been used to generate paddy cropping pattern to predict
    paddy rice yield estimation [58]. ISO is an unsupervised learning algorithm that
    can be used to generate rice cropping patterns [58]. The ISO algorithm is a modification
    of the k -means clustering algorithm. The merging and splitting of clusters are
    based on a predefined threshold by the user. If the difference of distance in
    multispectral feature space is less than the predefined threshold, the merging
    or splitting of clusters will be performed [153]. There are several optimization
    approaches that produce estimates of unknown variables or parameters based on
    a series of measurements observed over time, such as the Extended Kalman Filter
    (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Moving horizon estimation (MHE) [133],
    that can be used to predict paddy rice yield estimation. Moving Horizon Estimator
    with Pre-Estimation (MHE-PE) is an optimization-based estimator introduced and
    use an auxiliary estimator to describe the dynamics of the state over the horizon
    [134], [135]. MHE-PE is found to be more effective compared to MHE [68] for crop
    start date estimation in tropical area [68]. Some of the limitations found in
    these studies include the resolution limitations, topographic effects and limited
    and small size of time-series data that lead to estimation errors. For instance,
    the low fractional coverage of small-size rice paddies in the complex and hilly
    landscapes could also lower the probability of identification using the OTSU’s
    algorithm [108]. OTSU’s method is an image segmentation algorithm that segments
    a gray level image with only one modal distribution in gray level histogram [100],
    [148]. Stepwise classification (SW) is another classification approach that applies
    a strategy that combines two heterogeneous data sets in a novel way, and this
    can be used in estimating rice yields production [67]. Table 4 tabulates the applications
    of machine various learning algorithms found in some of works to predict paddy
    rice yield estimation. 3) Monitoring Paddy Rice Growth Monitoring the growth of
    paddy rice can be performed by mapping paddy rice and assessing the growth stages
    of the paddy rice. One of the issues or challenges in monitoring paddy rice growth
    using machine learning algorithms is to determine the optimum features combination.
    With optimum features combination, the overall accuracy of the classification
    results can be improved [115]. For instance, the optimum features combination
    can be achieved by using the robust adaptive spatial temporal fusion model (RASTFM)
    [116]. NDVI [63], [66], [69], [115], EVI [63] and Hyperspectral bands 1~4 [73],
    [78] are the most commonly used in monitoring the growth of paddy rice. The Multilayer
    Perceptron (MLP) [63], a class of feedforward ANN, and RF [69], [115] algorithms
    show better accuracies [69], [115] compared to PLS, SVM [63], [78], [83] and Support
    Vector Regression (SVR) [69] in performing the paddy growth stages classification.
    SVR is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and the original
    control of the margin and the number of support vectors [141]. SVR trains using
    a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates
    and it has been proven to be an effective algorithm in estimating real-value [69].
    Least-squares support-vector machines (LS-SVM) is found to produce better results
    compared to Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and PLS, in estimating LAI of paddy
    rice from optimal hyperspectral bands [73]. LS-SVMs are least-squares versions
    of SVM which can be used for classification and regression analysis problems [73],
    [123], [140]. MLR is a statistical technique that uses several independent variables
    to predict the outcome of the dependent variable [34], [73], [111], [137]. Multiple
    regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that applies only one independent
    variable. Besides remotely sensed data, vegetation indices, climate and soil data
    obtained from smart sensors are also used in monitoring paddy rice growth [36],
    [36] (see Table 3). Table 5 tabulates the applications of machine various learning
    algorithms in monitoring paddy rice growth. TABLE 5 Applications of Machine Learning
    Algorithms in Monitoring Paddy Rice Growth 4) Monitoring Paddy Rice Disease The
    color of the paddy rice leaves will change when they are infected by any disease
    and these colored spots are created on leaves. For that reason, most of the researches
    used high-resolution images in monitoring the paddy rice disease [37], [39], [41],
    [87]–[92], [117]–[120] and hyperspectral images [80], [81] to detect and assess
    the paddy rice diseases. The ANN algorithm and its variants, CNN, are found to
    be very effective in classifying task for monitoring the paddy rice diseases [39]–[41],
    [81], [87], [88], [90], [118]. For instance, the ANN achieved better classification
    results compared to FC and SVM algorithms [39] and the calibrated CNN model still
    showed good classification ability in a small-scale sample set and it was selected
    as the best classification model compared to DT, k -NN and SVM [81]. However,
    CNN requires a large number of samples for training purposes [88], [112]. In fuzzy
    classification (FC) applications, once a set of classes has been defined, one
    can determine the degree of membership of every object x under consideration [149].
    Fuzzy classification allows object x to belong to two or more classes. k -Nearest
    Neigbour ( k -NN) algorithm is also very effective in detecting diseases from
    paddy plant leaf images and identifying Brown Planthopper in paddy field and other
    classification problems [37], [81], [92], [96], [117]. Given an unknown sample,
    k -NN finds k samples that are nearest to this unknown sample based on certain
    distance functions (e.g., Euclidean or Cosine distance methods) and take the average
    of the response variables from these k samples as the label (class) of the unknown
    samples [145]. k -NN can be used for paddy rice sample classification [59], [99],
    [103]. Compared to SVM, k -NN produces better accuracy in detecting and recognizing
    diseases from paddy plant leaf images [37]. Some combined approaches show promising
    results that involve deep learning approaches [40], [41] and SVM algorithms [40],
    [91]. For instance, a combination approach of two machine learning algorithms
    (e.g., CNN+SVM ) has been used to identify the cultivated paddy regions (e.g.,
    Using CNN), and to detect areas damaged (e.g., Using SVM) by Brown Planthopper
    attacks [40]. Other works include building a semantic framework that models an
    ontology related to rice plant knowledge and applying this framework to help farmers
    to identify rice diseases, receive early warnings of possible spreadable diseases,
    and receive treatments based on multiple observations [121]. Minimum Distance
    Classifier (MDC) achieved better accuracy compared to k -NN in classifying high-resolution
    images for monitoring paddy rice disease [117]. MDC classifies unknown sample
    data to classes which minimize the distance between this sample data and the class
    in multi-feature space [147]. One of the works reviewed has applied MDC to classify
    images in the task of monitoring and controlling rice diseases using Image processing
    techniques [117]. There are also researches conducted on developing expert systems
    using optimized fuzzy inference system (OFIS) [122] and forward chaining [89]
    for monitoring paddy rice disease. Table 6 tabulates the applications of machine
    various learning algorithms in monitoring paddy rice disease. TABLE 6 Applications
    of Machine Learning Algorithms in Monitoring Paddy Rice Disease 5) Assessing Quality
    of Paddy Rice The quality of paddy rice can be assessed using the hyperspectral
    data [74], [79], climate and soil data [105] and also high-resolution images of
    the paddy rice [93], [104], [123]. SVM and CNN algorithms are the two most commonly
    used machine learning algorithms for assessing the quality of paddy rice [79],
    [93], [104], [105], [123]. CNN is found to be more effective compared to SVM algorithm
    in assessing the quality of the paddy rice [93]. However, a combination of classical
    artificial neural networks and SVM also has been used to predict nitrogen deficiency
    of rice crop [104]. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) has also been used to assess the quality
    of the paddy rice. FCM is a method of clustering which allows one piece of data
    to belong to two or more clusters [74], [154]. Table 7 tabulates the applications
    of machine various learning algorithms in assessing quality of paddy rice. TABLE
    7 Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms in Assessing Quality of Paddy Rice
    6) Paddy Rice Sample Classification Machine learning algorithms are normally combined
    with computer vision techniques to perform paddy rice sample classification with
    more effectively. Applying computer vision and machine learning techniques to
    recognize and classify rice varieties is a method that can be used to increase
    the accuracy of classification process in real applications. Several studies have
    been conducted that apply and examine several morphological and textural features
    of rice seeds’ images to evaluate their efficacy in identification of rice varieties
    [97] and classification of paddy rice adulteration levels [96]. In most studies
    related to the application of machine learning algorithm for paddy rice sample
    classification, deep learning algorithms are found to be very effective in classifying
    rice samples [94]–[97], [99], [101], [124]. The classification of the paddy rice
    samples can be improved with PCA-based reduced features [96], [103], [124]. PCA
    can be combined with other classifiers to improve the accuracy of paddy rice sample
    classification [96], [103], [124] and also to perform qualitative analysis in
    monitoring paddy rice disease [80]. Deep learning algorithms (e.g., BPNN, CNN)
    produced better accuracy compared to SVM algorithm [46], [101] in classifying
    paddy rice samples [95], [96]. When the label or number of varieties are not available,
    an unsupervised learning algorithm, such as clustering algorithm, can also be
    used to cluster paddy rice samples. For instance, k -Means clustering algorithm
    provides clusters with considerable separability as measured using separability
    index measures [103] based on the PCA-based reduced features. In k -means clustering,
    n observations are partitioned into k clusters in which each observation is assigned
    to the nearest cluster centroid. The k -means clustering is also known as a method
    of vector quantization [152]. By using the k -means clustering method in paddy
    rice sample classification, the H channel data can provide clusters with considerable
    separability as measured using separability index measures [103]. k -means clustering
    also can be used as part of the approach to classify the annual cropping patterns
    of paddy crop based on k number of classes [59]. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
    has been used to classify paddy rice samples. AdaBoost algorithm combines multiple
    weak classifiers to form a single strong classifier [91], [95], [142]. AdaBoost
    is also known as ensemble method as it consists of multiple weak classifiers.
    However, deep learning algorithms are found to be more superior than AdaBoost
    algorithm in classifying paddy rice samples [91], [95]. A multi-classifier cascade
    based rice spike detection method has also been proposed that consists of SVM,
    CNN and k -Means algorithm [99]. Other works include training machine learning
    algorithms to predict weight and size of rice kernels [125], application of machine
    learning algorithm in detecting adulterated admixtures of white rice based on
    mass spectrometry data [126] and classifying organic rice samples using original
    rice elements [127]. Table 8 tabulates the applications of machine various learning
    algorithms in paddy rice sample classification. TABLE 8 Applications of Machine
    Learning Algorithms in Paddy Rice Sample Classification SECTION V. Results and
    Conclusion Based on the reviews of several works in this paper, a new framework
    is proposed that maps three entities that include big data, machine learning and
    paddy rice smart farming tasks. In this review, the types of machine learning
    algorithms used are highly dependent on the availability of data. At the same
    time, the type of data required depends directly on the type of tasks stated in
    each production and post-production phases of paddy rice smart farming. These
    machine learning algorithms are used to perform the intelligent data processing
    that will assist farmers in various tasks mentioned in the production and post-production
    phases. Based on the findings summarized in the previous sections, machine learning
    algorithms and smart technologies can be used to improve the overall efficiency
    of the paddy rice production system. The potential benefits lead to an improvement
    in the return of investment (ROI) for all paddy rice production systems by minimizing
    the losses or costs involved in the production of paddy rice. As a result, we
    use these findings found in the literature to map these three components (e.g.,
    datasets, machine learning algorithms and tasks stated in the production of paddy
    rice) and develop a Big Data-ML-Task applications framework that can be used by
    the practitioners. The proposed framework shown in Fig. 7 has three main components,
    the types of datasets, types of ML algorithms, the types of tasks in paddy rice
    smart farming and paddy rice supply chain performance. FIGURE 7. Mapping of big
    data, machine learning and paddy rice smart farming tasks. Show All With smart
    irrigation system, the usage of water can be reduced and at the same time fully
    utilized to increase the paddy rice yield [32], [106], [107]. Automatic irrigation
    system also may cause a significant increase of rice production by making more
    arable land available for paddy rice plantation [33]. The task of estimating the
    yield of paddy rice precisely is very important for national food security and
    development evaluation. The development of an integrated aerial crop monitoring
    solution using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has motivated researchers to apply
    vegetation indices retrieved from hyperspectral images to estimate paddy rice
    yield [77]. Several studies have estimated the paddy rice yield based on time-series
    climate data [48], [110]–[112], [155]. Rainfall was found the main climate driver
    of the rice yield [111]. Other studies considered hyperspectral data to estimate
    the yield of paddy rice [34], [35], [57], [58], [67], [68], [75], [76], [108],
    [109]. Deep learning algorithms were found to be more effective compared to other
    machine learning algorithms for modeling paddy rice yield [48], [76], [77], [109]–[112],
    [155]. Maximum quality of paddy rice harvested can be obtained by using sensors
    to monitor humidity, temperature, pH, soil moisture and light intensity in real
    [113], [114]. Monitoring the growth of paddy rice is critical for understanding
    the growing status and yield estimation of paddy rice. For instance, the self-sufficient
    level (SSL) for paddy rice in Malaysia is only 70%. As the world population is
    increasing, intensifying paddy rice farming is more preferable over the expansion
    of agriculture land due to limited arable land [156]. Monitoring the growth of
    paddy rice is difficult for traditional farmers due to climate change, soil conditions,
    age of the farmers and time consumed to monitor the whole area. With remotely
    sensed data, creating paddy rice crop growth map is possible using the hyperspectral
    images [66] and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data [83], [115]. For example,
    the paddy rice growth based on rice growth parameters (e.g., rice height and biomass)
    can be monitored with the backscattering coefficient from RADARSAT-2 data [83].
    The paddy rice leaf chlorophyll contents can also be retrieved from the rice canopy
    hyperspectral imagery to analyze the paddy rice plant growth [63]. Leaf area index
    (LAI) is commonly used as a surrogate for productivity in precision agriculture
    (PA) and is widely used in plant growth [69], [73]. In short, the applications
    of machine learning algorithms have enabled us to timely and accurately monitor
    paddy rice planting area for national food security and management [115]. Using
    smart sensors to monitor soil pH, lux and temperature also provides insight in
    understanding the stages of paddy rice growth [36], [36]. Due to the lack of knowledge
    and awareness of suitable management to rectify rice plant leaf diseases, the
    rice production is being reduced in recent years [157]. The manual detection of
    plant diseases based on naked eye observation of experts is very time consuming,
    expensive and sometimes it produces an error when identifying the disease type
    [158]. Machine learning (ML) algorithm can be used to provide early warnings to
    anticipate rice blast and detect its presence, thus supporting the applications
    of biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms used to kill parasitic
    fungi or their spores. Based on several studies reviewed in this paper, the applications
    of ML, in detecting the presence of rice blast, has also provided suitable solutions
    for preventive remedial actions targeting the mitigation of yield losses and the
    reduction of fungicide use [159]. This review will be beneficial for modelers,
    farmers and stakeholders, to guide them in model development and selection for
    the most suitable models for the effective paddy rice disease detection and forecasting.
    The identification of paddy diseases may also assist farmer in providing them
    the remedies based on the types of disease [160]. The quality of paddy rice production
    depends highly on the quality of soil properties. These soil properties include
    soils’ pH and moisture, nitrogen and organic carbon content of the soil. For instance,
    a CNN produced promising results in assessing the nitrogen deficiency of paddy
    rice crop [104]. These soil properties can be captured using sensors or retrieved
    from the hyperspectral images [74]. SVM and CNN are the two most common machine
    learning algorithms used in assessing the quality of paddy rice. Compared to SVM,
    CNN produced better assessment accuracy [93]. Besides soil properties [105], some
    studies have conducted the assessment of the paddy rice quality based on the high-resolution
    images of the paddy rice leaf [93], [104], [123] and the hyperspectral images
    of the paddy rice field [74], [79]. Improving the management and productivity
    of the paddy rice farming is important to strengthen the food security initiatives.
    Due to variation in economic value of different varieties of rice, rice quality
    identification is very important in the international and national rice market
    [97], [100], [101]. The quality of the rice is used to evaluate the milling process.
    Rice sample may consist of full rice, broken rice, damaged rice, paddy, stones
    and foreign objects. Image processing and machine learning techniques can be used
    to separate and classify objects of rice sample [46]. Other than hyperspectral
    images [98], most of the studies related to paddy rice sample classification use
    high-resolution images and apply machine learning techniques such as SVM [46],
    [96], [98]–[100], [127] and deep learning algorithms [94]–[98], [101], [124].
    Combining efficient feature extraction method (e.g., PCA) [103] with neural network
    algorithm (e.g., Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN)) shows better accuracy
    results in paddy rice sample classification [96], [124] and also better clustering
    results for paddy rice grade identification [103]. Other image pre-processing
    such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) also affects the performance of
    the classifiers [94], [99]. Combining features in paddy rice sample classification
    also improves the classification accuracies [96]. Multi-classifier cascade can
    also be used to improve the performance of the paddy rice sample classification
    [99]. In order to get a good model, low bias and variance are required in order
    to have high accuracies or lower errors. An optimal balance of bias and variance
    would never overfit and underfit the model. Reducing variance of the final classifier
    model can be achieved by fitting multiple final models or using hybrid approaches
    [99], [103], [124] or increase the training size. In addition to that, example
    of low-bias machine learning algorithms include DT, k -NN and SVM. Based on the
    findings of this review, the performance of all these three machine learning algorithms
    are very competitive in predicting paddy rice yield estimation [109], monitoring
    paddy rice growth [78], [83], monitoring paddy rice disease [37], [40], [81],
    [91], [117], [119], [120], assessing quality of paddy rice [79], [104], [123]
    and paddy rice sample classification [46], [98], [99], [127]. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper provides a structured overview of the recent applications of machine
    learning algorithms and smart devices for paddy rice smart farming. In addition
    to that, this paper has proposed a framework that maps big data, machine learning
    and paddy rice smart farming tasks. The review study reveals considerable benefits
    to the production of paddy rice that have applied the machine learning techniques
    and smart devices in the paddy rice smart farming. As with any research, here,
    we also summarize the following guidelines based on the findings obtained from
    this review for future works. First, there is a need to explore further the capability
    of ensemble models or hybrid models based on deep learning methods using multi-source
    data, as these have been shown to improve the performance of the base model. However,
    deep learning methods require large number of samples to come up with efficient
    models. For instance, in predicting paddy rice yield and monitoring paddy rice
    disease using the deep learning approach, a large amount of time-series data is
    required to improve the prediction performance [88], [112]. Since most of the
    studies conducted for paddy rice sample classification are based on image processing,
    the optimization of the classification accuracy (e.g., using hybrid or ensemble
    approach) is another issue that requires more explorations. For instance, more
    works on the variety of wavelet transforms for texture analysis and different
    classification techniques (decision tree, random forest) for paddy rice sample
    classification can be explored [96]. Second, a limited number of investigations
    conducted in the area of the application of machine learning algorithm based on
    multi-sources data as the findings from existing studies have shown that a more
    comprehensive understanding can be obtained by integrating multi-sources data
    or determining the optimum features combination. We can produce better modelling
    results comprehensively by analysing these complex relationships among multi-sources
    data or by finding the optimum features combination. For instance, using only
    spectral reflectance, shape and texture of paddy rice will not provide better
    results and additional ground truth data is required in order to classify and
    differentiate paddy rice accurately [161]. Using multi-features fusion (e.g.,
    combining Landsat and SAR Time Series Data) can also improve the accuracy of predicting
    paddy rice yield using a deep learning approach [112]. Limited works are found
    in exploring and combining multiple sources of data (e.g., Sensored data (climate
    and soil properties), Remotely sensed data, vegetation indices and drone-based
    data (e.g., high-resolution images)) to improve the modelling of data for smart
    irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation, monitoring
    paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality of paddy rice,
    paddy rice sample classification. Finally, a more comprehensive analysis needs
    to be conducted to investigate the efficiency of processing software to perform
    image preprocessing for modelling. For example, Monitoring the growth of paddy
    rice based on spectral reflectance has limitations of the processing software
    and the complicated steps to process the images [66]. More researches need to
    be conducted to acquire high resolutions remotely sensed time series imagery data
    in both time and space through effective and efficient image segmentation process
    using data blending approaches [108]. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  description: Precision agriculture (PA) constitutes one of the most critical sectors
    of remote sensing applications that allow obtaining spatial segmentation and within-field
    variability information from field crops. In the last decade, an increasing source
    of information is provided by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) platforms, mainly
    equipped with optical multispectral cameras, to map, monitor, and analyze, temporal
    and spatial variations of vegetation using ad hoc spectral vegetation indices
    (VIs). Considering the centimeter or sub-centimeter spatial resolution of UAV
    imagery, the geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach, is becoming
    prevalent in UAV remote sensing applications. In the present paper, we propose
    a quick and reliable semi-automatic workflow implemented to process multispectral
    UAV imagery and aimed at the detection and extraction of olive and citrus trees’
    crowns to obtain vigor maps in the framework of PA. We focused our attention on
    the choice of GEOBIA data input and parameters, taking into consideration its
    replicability and reliability in the case of heterogeneous tree orchards. The
    heterogeneity concerns the different tree plantation distances and composition,
    different crop management (irrigation, pruning, weeding), and different tree age,
    height, and crown diameters. The proposed GEOBIA workflow was implemented in the
    eCognition Developer 9.5, coupling the use of multispectral and topographic information
    surveyed using the Tetracam µ-MCA06 snap multispectral camera at 4 cm of ground
    sample distance (GSD). Three different study sites in heterogeneous citrus (Bergamot
    and Clementine) and olive orchards located in the Calabria region (Italy) were
    provided. Multiresolution segmentation was implemented using spectral and topographic
    band layers and optimized by applying a trial-and-error approach. The classification
    step was implemented as process-tree and based on a rule set algorithm, therefore
    easily adaptable and replicable to other datasets. Decision variables for image
    classification were spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, CVI) and topographic
    layers (DSM and CHM). Vigor maps were based on NDVI and NDRE and allowed to highlight
    those areas with low vegetative vigor. The accuracy assessment was based on a
    per-pixel approach and computed through the F-score (F). The obtained results
    are promising, considering that the resulting accuracy was high, with F-score
    ranging from 0.85 to 0.91 for olive and bergamot, respectively. Our proposed workflow,
    which has proved effective in datasets of different complexity, finds its strong
    point is the speed of execution and on its repeatability to other different crops
    with few adjustments. It appears worth of interest to highlights that it requests
    a working day of two good skilled operators in geomatics and computer image processing,
    from the on-field data collection to the obtaining of vigor maps.

    1. Introduction Bergamot (Citrus bergamia, Risso) crops are mainly located on
    the Ionian sea coast in the province of Reggio Calabria (South Italy). The fruit
    was primarily cultivated for the extraction of essential oil from the peel to
    use it in the cosmetic, perfumery (Jin et al., 2016) and food industries (Pernice
    et al., 2009). Since 2001, these productions awarded the European protected designation
    of origin (PDO) label Bergamotto di Reggio Calabria – olio essenziale (“Bergamot
    of Reggio Calabria – essential oil”). In the food industry, an increasing interest
    has focused on the use of bergamot’s juice as a beverage and in a blend with other
    fruit juices (Giuffrè, 2019). This interest is related to the antioxidant properties
    of juice, beneficial for health (Da Pozzo et al., 2018). From the dried and processed
    waste is obtained the so-called pastazzo, which can be used as animal feed (Nesci
    and Sapone, 2014). Over 90% of the world’s bergamot production comes from Calabria
    while the remaining 10% from Africa (Côte d''Ivoire, Mali, Cameroon, Guinea) and
    South America (Argentina and Brazil) (Nesci and Sapone, 2014). Clementine (Citrus
    clementina Hort. ex Tan.) is one of the essential cultivated varieties of citrus
    mandarins in the Mediterranean Basin (Benabdelkamel et al., 2012). Italy is one
    of the largest producers in Europe, and its crops are located in the southern
    part of the country. Productions made in the Calabria region are labeled with
    the European protected geographical indication label “Clementine di Calabria”
    (Benabdelkamel et al., 2012). Olive (Olea europaea L.) crops represent a critical
    agricultural production in the Mediterranean Basin, and the Calabria region is
    one of the primary Italian olive oil producers. Moreover, olive crops can be considered
    as a distinctive trait of the historical rural landscape of the Mediterranean
    Basin (Di Fazio and Modica, 2018). To achieve an effective, sustainable environmental
    management of crop productions coupling with an improvement of agriculture competitiveness
    of the agriculture sector, precision agriculture (PA) methodologies and technologies
    currently represent a reliable and cost-effective approach (Solano et al., 2019).
    The International Society for Precision Agriculture (ISPA), defines the PA as
    “a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial
    and individual data and combines it with other information to support management
    decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency,
    productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural production
    (www.ispag.org/about/definition, last access 30 April 2020). PA that can be viewed
    as a management strategy aiming at implementing agronomic interventions in line
    with real crop needs and the biochemical and physical characteristics of the soil
    constitutes one of the most critical sectors of remote sensing applications (De
    Montis et al., 2017). As highlighted by several scholars, PA allows to increase
    crop productivity and farm profitability through the better management of farm
    inputs (Larson and Robert, 1991, Zhang et al., 2002) and using intensive data
    and information collection. In the framework of PA, remote sensing techniques
    allow obtaining spatial segmentation and within-field variability information
    from field crops (Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2005). Traditionally, remote sensing
    has been associated with satellite platforms or manned aircrafts equipped with
    a series of sensors (Pajares, 2015) while, since the last decade, the advent of
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) platforms constitutes one of the primary sources
    of remote sensing imagery in PA. Moreover, continuous technological improvement
    concerns UAV platforms as well as the typology of mounted sensors in terms of
    radiometric resolution, weight, optical characteristics, etc. (Romero-Trigueros
    et al., 2017). Compared to satellite platforms, UAVs have the advantage of providing
    images with very high spatial and temporal resolution coupled with an ever-increasing
    radiometric resolution that is leading to a production cost efficiency. As highlighted
    by Benincasa et al. (2018), UAV surveys are more suitable than satellite remote
    sensing in cloudy conditions, in case of small surfaces and when a centimeter
    spatial resolution is needed. Typically, UAV applications in PA dealing with the
    following research issues: weed and disease detection (Abdulridha et al., 2019,
    Albetis et al., 2018, De Castro et al., 2018, De Castro et al., 2015, Maes and
    Steppe, 2019, Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2016, Torres-Sánchez et al., 2015), assessment
    of vegetation coverage and typology (Ampatzidis and Partel, 2019, Candiago et
    al., 2015, Senthilnath et al., 2017), analysis, monitoring and assessment of biomass
    and vegetation vigor (Bendig et al., 2015, Díaz-Varela et al., 2015, Li et al.,
    2016a, Li et al., 2016b, Malambo et al., 2018, Panagiotidis et al., 2017, Roth
    and Streit, 2018, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2014). The increasing interest of several
    scholars focused on the trees’ crown extraction from UAV imagery in the framework
    of PA applications (Caruso et al., 2019, Díaz-Varela et al., 2015, Koc-San et
    al., 2018, Ok and Ozdarici-Ok, 2018a, Ok and Ozdarici-Ok, 2018b, Solano et al.,
    2019). Currently, UAVs equipped with multispectral cameras represent the most
    commonly exploited remote sensing systems in agriculture (Khanal et al., 2017).
    These systems have the advantage of being able to obtain spectral information
    in the red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum
    that allow deriving vegetation indices (VIs) useful for applications in PA (Yao
    and Qin, 2019). In the framework of PA, remote sensing applications can provide
    essential information to map, monitor, and analyze temporal and spatial variations
    of vegetation vigor. Although an increasing number of VIs is currently available
    for PA applications, most of them are obtained combining information in R and
    NIR regions of electromagnetic spectrum. Beyond a high correlation with the biophysical
    parameters of plants, VIs have a reduced sensitivity to all those factors that
    hinder the interpretation of remote sensing data, such as soil background and
    atmosphere (Wójtowicz et al., 2016). In the last two decades, remote sensing technologies
    have been improved in order to be able to use more effective methods of extracting
    reliable and reusable information in the framework of PA applications (Solano
    et al., 2019). Among these techniques, the geographic object-based image analysis
    (GEOBIA) approach, that allows detecting geographical entities through the definition
    and the analysis of object-images instead of single pixels (Blaschke, 2010, Hay
    and Castilla, 2008), is becoming prevalent in UAV remote sensing (Li et al., 2016a,
    Li et al., 2016b). Moreover, the GEOBIA approach allows capturing the rapid change
    of geographic objects in very high-resolution UAV imagery, including the shadow
    effect of trees, typically higher than in satellite or aerial imagery, due to
    a larger parallax effect considering the lower distance between the surveyed objects
    and the sensor. GEOBIA defines a typology of a digital remote sensing image analysis
    approach that studies geographical entities through the definition and analysis
    of object-based instead of single pixels (Blaschke, 2010, Blaschke et al., 2014,
    Hay and Castilla, 2008). Image objects are objects that can be visually distinguished
    in the image and made up of groups (or clusters) of neighboring pixels that share
    a common context or meaning, such as pixels that join together to form the canopy
    of a tree or crops in a field (Chen et al., 2018). GEOBIA demonstrated effectiveness
    in classifying weeds, herbaceous (De Castro et al., 2018, De Castro et al., 2017,
    De Castro et al., 2018, Peña et al., 2015, Peña et al., 2013, Peña Barragán et
    al., 2012, Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2016, Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2015), and tree species
    (Csillik et al., 2018, Díaz-Varela et al., 2015, Koc-San et al., 2018, Ozdarici-Ok,
    2015, Solano et al., 2019). Within the scientific and technological framework
    briefly outlined, the present paper has a twofold research objective. The first
    one is devoted to showing a quick and reliable semi-automatic workflow implemented
    to process multispectral UAV imagery. The proposed workflow is aimed at the detection
    and extraction of olive and citrus trees’ crowns in the framework of PA with the
    final production of vigor maps showing the vegetative state of the tree crowns.
    The second one focuses on the choice of GEOBIA data input and parameters reliable
    in the case of heterogeneous tree orchards. The heterogeneity concerns the different
    tree plantation distances, the different crop management (irrigation, pruning,
    weeding, etc.), the different crop composition, and on the different tree age,
    height, and crown diameters. The proposed GEOBIA workflow was implemented in the
    eCognition Developer 9.5 (Trimble Inc., 2019), coupling the use of multispectral
    (radiometric bands and their different combinations/ratios) and topographic information.
    Three different study sites in heterogeneous citrus (Bergamot and Clementine)
    and olive orchards located in the Calabria region (Italy), were provided. The
    structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we provided a brief description
    of the three analyzed study sites. Section 3 deals with materials and methods,
    providing details about data acquisition, data processing workflow, GEOBIA procedures,
    the analyzed VIs, and about the implemented accuracy assessment procedure. In
    Section 4, the results of segmentation, classification, trees extraction processes,
    accuracy assessment, and final vigor maps produced, are presented and discussed.
    Finally, Section 5 deals with conclusions and future research outlooks. 2. Study
    sites All three-study sites are located in the province of Reggio Calabria (Calabria,
    Italy) (Fig. 1), A1 and A2 in Antonimina municipality (38°15′52″ N, 16°11′12″
    E, 111 m a.s.l., and 38°16″12″ N, 16°11′ 04″ E, 193 m a.s.l., respectively), study
    site B in the municipality of Palizzi (37° 55′ 06″ N, 15° 58′ 54″ E, 4 m a.s.l).
    Study A1 is a 15-year even-aged (3.5 m height) citrus orchard (clementine, Citrus
    × clementina) with a 5 m × 5 m single-tree planting distance covering an area
    of 4.6 ha. The study site A2 covers 7.12 ha and is a 20-year even-aged specialized
    olive orchard with a 6 m × 6 m single-tree planting distance. Both orchards are
    managed according to organic farming methods. The study site B is an uneven-aged
    citrus orchard (bergamot, Citrus bergamia) with long windbreak barriers made up
    of olive trees, and covering an area of 5.13 ha. This orchard is particularly
    heterogeneous, being composed of trees with age ranging from 5 years (1.5 m height)
    to 25 years (4 m height). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download :

    orchards. 3.1. Surveys equipment UAV surveys were carried out with the Multirotor
    G4 Surveying-Robot (Service Drone GmbH), a multirotor equipped with six high-efficiency
    electric brushless motors, gimbal and flight control with a dual 32-bit processor,
    able to correct the position 512 times per second of flight, thus ensuring a much
    more stable flight (Fig. 3). The imagery was captured by the µ-MCA06 snap, a multispectral
    camera with a global shutter sensor produced by Tetracam Inc. (Chatsworth, USA).
    The µ-MCA06 snap consists of 6 individual 1.3 megapixel CMOS sensors (4:3 format,
    1280 × 1024 pixels) with interchangeable bandpass filter housed in one unit, one
    named as “master,” responsible for synchronizing the other named as “slaves” (Table

    are stored as single shots of 1.3 megapixels per bands, exposing the entire image
    at the same instant in time, at either 8 or 10 bit, giving a total of 7.8 megapixels
    across the six bands. The µ-MCA06 snap was equipped with its own global navigation
    satellite system (GNSS), the FirePoint 100 GPS. 3.2. Data acquisition and pre-processing
    Flight missions were planned with the UAV Planner 3D (www.alto-drones.com, last
    access 31 January 2020), a commercial plugin available for version 2 of QGIS,
    and that allows us to take into account the 3D morphology of the study area (Fig.
    3). All flights were carried out with 80 m above ground level (a.g.l) of flight
    height, a field of view (FoV) of 51.5 × 41.25 m, ground sample distance (GSD)
    of 4 cm, and with 2.5 m s−1 of cruise speed (Table 2). To ensure a high quality
    of the obtained imagery, overlap and side lap were set at 80% and 75%, respectively.
    Within each study site, 50 cm × 50 cm white polypropylene panels with two black
    cardboard quadrants to locate the point, were used as ground control points (GCPs).
    Every GCP was georeferenced in the field, using the Leica GS12 RTK-GNSS, in the
    coordinate system WGS84/ETRF1989 UTM33N (EPSG 32633) (planimetric accuracy ±2.5
    cm, altimetric accuracy ±5 cm). Table 2. Flight and UAV dataset characteristics.

    2 49 5.13 2825 80 75 0.03 0.03 0.09 With the aim to calibrate the conversion of
    the original digital numbers (DN) to band reflectance, three 50 cm × 50 cm polypropylene
    calibration panels (in white, black, and grey) were placed on the field. During
    the flight, for each of them, the reflectance was recorded with the Apogee M100
    spectroradiometer. The grey panel was chosen as reference, and its reflectance
    value in correspondence of each central band was extracted. These values were
    used, together with radiometric correction parameters written in the EXIF metadata
    of the images, to compute the radiometric calibration of each pixel, allowing
    to generate the reflectance maps. UAV images were acquired in the *.RAW native
    format then converted to 10-bit TIFF format using PixelWrench II (version 1.2.4,
    Tetracam, Inc., Chatsworth, USA). Data pre-processing was implemented in Pix4Dmapper
    (Pix4D SA, Switzerland) Pro 4.3 that allows managing the alignment, stacking,
    and radiometric calibration of the original single band images as camera rigs
    systems. Internal camera orientation was performed based on the camera specification
    and the alignment parameters provided by Tetracam (X and Y translation, rotation,
    and scaling). External orientation was firstly based on the GNSS geotags recorded
    for each shot and further improved through the GCPs positions. Then, classical
    digital photogrammetry processes based on structure from motion (SfM) and aerial
    triangulation were carried out obtaining sparse and dense 3D clouds, digital surface
    model (DSM), digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height model (CHM). After
    the radiometric calibration, a reflectance orthomosaic for each of the six-layer
    bands was obtained and then stacked into a six-band orthomosaic (B, G, R, RE,
    NIR1, NIR2). 3.3. Radiometric analyses and statistics of collected datasets Before
    proceeding with image processing, the radiometric characterization of datasets
    and correlation analysis of bands was performed using pairwise scatter plots based
    on Pearson’s correlation coefficient (rij) according to eq. 1 and organized as
    scatter plots matrix. (1) (2) where Covij (eq.2) is the covariance of layer bands
    i and j, DNik the digital numbers (i.e., the cell value of each pixel), is the
    mean of the DNs in the specific band (i and j) while σi and σj are their standard
    deviations calculated as follows (eq. 3). (3) The dataset was analyzed in Python,
    employing the pandas library and using the rasterio toolbox to read and implement
    the data array of input data. As input data (i.e., the layer bands), we used the
    six spectral bands B, G, R, RE, NIR1, NIR2 plus DSM, and CHM, that we concatenated
    in a unique data frame through the NumPy library. To perform correlation analysis,
    we used scipy and numpy libraries while the implementation of the scatters plots,
    and the final correlation matrix was based on the matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
    The graphical representation of scatter plots was improved using a kernel density
    estimation (KDE) with a Gaussian kernel. 3.4. Image segmentation The first phase
    of a GEOBIA procedure is the segmentation of the original image into separate,
    non-overlapping regions (Aguilar et al., 2016) and extracted as vectorial objects.
    This process is a fundamental pre-requisite for classification/feature extraction
    (Drǎguţ et al., 2014). Segmentation consists of the partitioning of objects into
    smaller entities in the creation of new ones and the alteration of the morphology
    of the existing ones according to precise rules. Concerning the approaches in
    performing the segmentation, two different ways are possible: a top-down strategy,
    which involves cutting large objects into small objects, and the bottom-up strategy
    that merges small objects to form larger ones. In the present research, we adopted
    a bottom-up strategy, the multiresolution segmentation (Baatz and Schape, 2000),
    implemented in eCognition Developer 9.5. Multiresolution segmentation is an optimization
    process that, for a certain number of image objects, minimizes the average heterogeneity
    and maximizes their respective homogeneity (Trimble Inc., 2019). This algorithm
    first identifies single objects of the size of a pixel and then merges them with
    other neighboring objects according to a criterion of relative homogeneity. This
    criterion measures the level of homogeneity within each object. The procedure
    continues selecting another image object’s best neighbor and proceeds until no
    further image object mergers can be realized without infringing the maximum allowed
    homogeneity of an image object (Trimble Inc., 2019). The result of a good image
    classification process is affected mainly by the process quality of segmentation,
    which in turn depends on the choice of segmentation parameters values (El-naggar,
    2018). Several criteria should be accurately evaluated to obtain proper segmentation
    (El-naggar, 2018). The homogeneity criterion derives from the combination of the
    spectral and shape properties of the initial object and of that obtained by the
    merging process. Color homogeneity results from the standard deviation of spectral
    colors, while the shape homogeneity derives from the deviation of a compact (or
    smooth) shape. Homogeneity criteria can be established by two parameters: shape
    and compactness. The shape parameter determines the importance on the segmentation
    of the shape of the segmented objects with respect to the color and can assume
    a value between 0 and 0.9. Shape and color are two interrelated, and their weight
    is chosen by the user: the higher the weight of the first, the lower the weight
    of the second in the segmentation, and vice versa (Drǎguţ et al., 2010). Compactness
    determines the influence of shape respect to the smoothness. This parameter can
    be defined by the product of width and length calculated on numbers of pixels
    (El-naggar, 2018). Several scholars demonstrated the importance of the scale parameter
    in determining the final size and dimension of the resulting objects (Drǎguţ et
    al., 2014, Ma et al., 2017). Inserting higher values or smaller values of scale
    parameter larger and smaller objects are obtained, respectively. The scale parameter
    defines the maximum allowed heterogeneity with regard to the weighted image layers
    for the obtained image objects (Trimble Inc., 2019). Therefore, datasets of homogeneous
    environments will lead to larger segments and vice versa (El-naggar, 2018). Moreover,
    in implementing a segmentation process, a different weight can be assigned to
    each of the different input data (i.e., band layers). In our proposed workflow,
    orthoimages were segmented using a multiresolution algorithm and adopting an equal
    weight for all band layers. Layers used in this phase were spectral bands B, G,
    R, RE, NIR1, NIR2, and the DSM in study site A1 while, in the study sites A2 and
    B, the NIR2 band has been excluded, considering its very close correlation with
    the NIR1 band (0.99). The optimal multiresolution segmentation parameters were
    obtained by applying a trial-and-error approach (Aguilar et al., 2016). As reported
    in Prošek and Šímová, 2019, Kaufman and Remer, 1994, the visual interpretation
    of segmentation is an effective method to assess the quality of the obtained results.
    In the study site A1, segmentation settings were as follows: weight 1 for all
    layers, scale parameter 60, shape and compactness 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. In
    the study site A2, displaying the image in the different band combinations, and
    on the basis of a better distinction from the rest of the image of canopies and
    their own shadows, a different weight was assigned to the different layers bands.
    Higher (band weight = 2), for NIR1, RE, DSM and DTM, lesser (band weight = 1)
    for B, G and R bands. The scale parameter has been assigned a value of 200, while
    the shape and compactness parameters have been assigned a value equal to 0.7.
    In the study site B, the segmentation settings were 1, 85, 0.5 and 0.1 for band
    weights, scale, shape and compactness, respectively. 3.5. Derivation of vegetation
    indices (VIs) and topographic elevation layers A reliable radiometric measurement
    of vegetation vigor can be obtained combining the information provided by some
    specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as those characterizing
    the curve between the maximum absorption of photosynthetic pigments (Jones and
    Vaughan, 2010). VIs are derived from the math combination of two or more bands
    with the aim to obtain useful information on specific vegetation properties (e.g.,
    chlorophyll) in the R region and the maximum dispersion in RE and NIR regions
    per single-pixel (Campbell and Wynne, 2011). VIs, developed since the 1970s (Glenn
    et al., 2008), have been widely recognized to have good sensitivity for the detection
    and monitoring of vegetation (Barrett and Curtis, 2013). In the present research,
    six VIs were derived (Table 3): normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),
    normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI),
    green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), green and red normalized
    difference vegetation index (GRNDVI), chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI). Table

    Index (CVI) (Vincini et al., 2007) Green and Red Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (GRNDVI) (Wang et al., 2007a, Wang et al., 2007b) *ρ is the reflectance
    at the given wavelength. In addition, two topographic elevation layers were derived,
    the DSM (Digital Surface Model) entered as input while the DTM (Digital Terrain
    Model) was used to calculate the CHM (Canopy Height Model) (Popescu, 2007). NDVI
    is one of the most widely used indices derived from the multispectral information
    and is calculated by the normalized ratio between the Red and NIR bands (Rouse
    et al., 1974). The index that can assumes values between −1 and 1 measures healthy
    vegetation utilizing the highest chlorophyll absorption and reflectance regions
    and is useful to characterize canopy growth or vigor (Xue and Su, 2017). NDVI
    is very sensitive to background factors, such as the shade and the brightness
    of the vegetation canopies and soil backgrounds. For this reason, Huete (1988)
    developed the SAVI index with the aim to minimize the effects of soil background
    on the vegetation signal by inserting a constant soil adjustment factor L in the
    original formula of NDVI (Taylor and Silleos, 2006). L, which is a function of
    vegetation density, can assume values between 0 and 1, depending on the vegetation
    amounts. In the presence of shallow vegetation, the value of L suggested is 1,
    while a value of 0.5 is used for intermediate levels of vegetation. Obviously,
    when the value of L is 0, SAVI corresponds precisely to the NDVI. NDRE has a range
    of values from −1 to 1 and formula similar to that of NDVI but exploits the sensitivity
    of the vegetation to the RE by replacing the R. GNDVI (Gitelson et al., 1996)
    was proposed using a G band rather than the R band as in the classic NDVI and
    has been developed for the estimation of leaf chlorophyll concentration. CVI (Vincini
    et al., 2007) was initially proposed as a broad-band VI sensitive to leaf chlorophyll
    content and insensitive to LAI variation. The index’s formula was obtained from
    that of green SR multiplying the G/NIR ratio by R/G ratio. R/G ratio, developed
    by Gamon and Surfus (1999), has been used to estimate foliage development in canopies.
    GRNDVI was developed together with a series of indices in whose formulas the R
    band of NDVI formula was substituted with several combinations of R, G, and B
    bands to verify the response and capability to estimate LAI of these indices (Wang
    et al., 2007a, Wang et al., 2007b). 3.6. Image classification and trees’ crowns
    extraction The classification was based on a rule set implemented in eCognition
    as an automated process-tree, therefore adaptable and replicable to other datasets.
    It was based on the algorithm Assign Class that allows assigning a class to an
    object which falls within one or more chosen conditions (or rules), based on values
    attributed to features (e.g., threshold values of VIs and topographic layers).
    Therefore, working as a masking-approach, as shown in De Castro et al., 2018,
    Peña Barragán et al., 2012. In our case, the classification was performed by assigning,
    to each target land-use class, different threshold values for each of the different
    input layers and VIs (Table 4). In the case study A1, the classification was implemented
    for four classes: “citrus”, “buildings and roads”, “other vegetation”, and “bare
    soil”. Being this dataset derived from UAV flights carried out at midday, and
    in November, the presence of shadows can be considered as irrelevant. Therefore
    it was decided not to create a specific class for these objects. The classification
    algorithm was set to start with the class “buildings and roads” using SAVI values
    ≤ 0.1. “Citrus” were classified using SAVI ≥ 0.7 and CHM ≥ 1.6, while “Other vegetation”
    was classified using CHM values higher than 6. All unclassified objects were classified
    as “bare soil”. In the case study A2, the classification was implemented for five
    classes: “olive”, “shadows” (due to the different sun position with respect to
    the horizon line in the month of February), “buildings and roads”, “other vegetation”
    and “bare soil”. “Olive trees” were identified using CVI values ≥ 1.5 and CHM
    ≥ 1.5, while “Shadows” were classified using the NIR1 band. “Building and roads”
    were classified using SAVI values ≤ 0.1 and CHM ≥ 1.1. “Other vegetation” was
    classified, taking into consideration their larger canopy size (≥30 m2) than olive
    trees. Unclassified objects were inserted in the class “bare soil”. Table 4. Results

    of pixels. Also, in the study site B, the classification was implemented for five
    classes: “Citrus”, “olive”, “shadows”, “other vegetation” and “bare soil”. Since
    the citrus orchard is uneven-aged, there were significant differences in the size
    of the trees’ canopies, we subdivided the image into parcels (Fig. 4). This choice
    is further justified by the presence of many olive trees constituting long windbreak
    barriers in the citrus orchard. Therefore, the orthomosaic was divided into ten
    parcels based on the layout scheme of the irrigation sectors that roughly correspond
    to the different plantation age of bergamot trees. In detail, in sectors 4–6 and
    7, trees are 5 years old. This operation was performed using the open-source software
    QGIS, creating a specific thematic layer subsequently imported in eCognition.
    For this study site, using threshold values of SAVI between −0.16 and 0.45, all
    the vegetation, without distinguishing between the two species present (olive
    and bergamot), was inserted in a temporary class called “vegetation”. In sectors
    1 to 5 and 7, characterized by the presence of olive trees, these were identified
    using DSM and NDVI ≥ 0 and CVI ≥ 1.3, reclassifying the above-mentioned class.
    The remaining objects belonging to this class were reclassified as “Citrus”. Anything
    object that did not belong to the temporary class “vegetation”, was classified
    as “bare soil”. Finally, by establishing a threshold value in the NIR1 band, from
    the three classes “bare soil”, “olive” and “citrus”, we extracted those objects
    belonging to the “shadows” class. Download : Download high-res image (687KB) Download

    was based on the comparison of the total number of correctly detected crown pixels
    by classification algorithm with a reference vector data. The reference segments
    for each image were manually digitized by on-screen photointerpretation from UAV
    true-color orthophotos. Differently to other research works (Ok et al., 2013,
    Solano et al., 2019, Koc-San et al., 2018), to obtain a comprehensive picture
    of the implemented approach, we digitized all the trees’ crowns following in the
    three analyzed study sites. The evaluation metrics used in this work were described
    and used in several previous studies, each of which has given different descriptions.
    This aspect had already been clarified by Shufelt, 1999, Ok et al., 2013 which
    said that the specific definitions of this approach are subject to varying interpretations.
    Some of these works used an approach object-based (Ok et al., 2013, Ok and Ozdarici-Ok,
    2018a, Ok and Ozdarici-Ok, 2018b, Ozdarici-Ok, 2015, Solano et al., 2019) in which
    the validation took place by means of an overlap percentage threshold between
    the image objects, classified by the algorithm, and the reference segments. In
    these researches, the object-based evaluation approach was used in cases where
    the objects were clearly separable from each other and had well-defined edges.
    In our case, to cope with the heterogeneity of the tree crowns structure in some
    parts of the images, a pixel-based accuracy assessment was implemented. Superimposing
    trees’ crowns with the reference vector data, each pixel into one of the three
    distinct accuracy categories defined below (Goutte and Gaussier, 2005, Ok et al.,
    2013, Shufelt, 1999, Sokolova et al., 2006): • True Positive (TP): when a pixel
    is labeled as a tree by the classification algorithm and corresponds to a tree
    in the reference vector data (pixel correctly classified). • False Negative (FN):
    when a pixel is labeled in the reference vector data as a tree but it not labeled
    as a tree by the classifier (pixel not detected). • False Positive (FP): indicates
    a pixel labeled as a tree by the classifier, but that does not correspond to any
    of the pixels labeled by the reference vector data (pixel erroneously detected).
    To evaluate the accuracy, the number of TP, FP, and FN pixels were counted for
    each image. Then the Recall (r), Precision (p), F-score (F) and Branching Factor
    (BF) metrics are computed, using the following equations (Eqs. (4)–(5)–(6)–(7))
    (Goutte and Gaussier, 2005, Li et al., 2012, Ok et al., 2013, Shufelt, 1999, Sokolova
    et al., 2006): (4) (5) (6) (7) The r parameter, measuring the fraction of pixels
    that were correctly denoted as object pixels by the algorithm, allows to represents
    the omission error (derived from 1-r). The parameter p is indicating the correctness
    of detected crowns, and then, in the same way, it is representative of the commission
    error (1-p). F measures the overall accuracy through the harmonic mean of commission
    and omission errors. The values of r, p, and F vary from 0 to 1. In order to obtain
    a higher F, both r and p should be high. For example, if all of the trees are
    correctly segmented, the values of r and p are 1, resulting in F being equal to
    1 (Goutte and Gaussier, 2005, Li et al., 2012, Shufelt, 1999, Sokolova et al.,
    2006). The BF is a measure of the degree to which an algorithm over classifies
    background pixels with the target label (i.e., tree crown in our case). If the
    classifier never “over-delineates” the extent of any reference segment, its branching
    factor value is 0. If every classified pixel in the image scene is wrongly labeled,
    the BF is equal to 1 (Shufelt, 1999). All these measures taken together give a
    clear and objective picture of a classification algorithm performance (Shufelt,
    1999). 4. Results and discussions 4.1. Geometric and radiometric characteristics
    All consecutive images of the three datasets were processed via aerial image triangulation
    with the geo-tagged flight log and the GCPs’ coordinates through the software
    Pix4D Mapper. 3D densified point clouds, DSM, DTM, and for each band reflectance
    orthomosaics for each spectral band were generated. For DSM and orthomosaics,
    the obtained GSD was comprised between 4.1 and 4.3 cm pixel−1. As far as the method
    applied in the three datasets is concerned, the scenario is different, prior to
    proceeding with the classification step, for each study site, a correlation analysis
    between all input layers was performed through the Pearson’s correlation coefficient
    (rij) and implemented in a scatter plots matrix (Figs. 5, 6 and 7). Moreover,
    to have a comprehensive view of the spectral correlation between the six derived
    VIs, we analyzed it on the whole datasets as a correlation matrix (provided as
    Supplementary material). Referring to the whole datasets, in the study site A1
    (Fig. 5 and Supplementary material), high correlations of SAVI with NDVI (0.99),
    GNDVI (0.95), and GRNDVI (0.98) were evident. SAVI was very important in the classification
    of “buildings and roads” and then for classification of the “citrus trees” class,
    coupled with the CHM, and using a threshold value ≥ 0.7. NDRE showed a high correlation
    with GNDVI (0.89) and low correlations with NDVI (0.77), SAVI (0.77), and CVI
    (0.78). Download : Download high-res image (677KB) Download : Download full-size

    high correlations between the NIR bands and the RE (0.88) and between the two
    NIR bands (0.99). This last significant correlation led to the choice to exclude
    the NIR2 band as an input layer from the segmentation phase onwards. Download

    classification, tree crown extraction and accuracy assessment The image classification
    was based on six land use classes, “citrus”, “olive”, buildings and roads”, “other
    vegetation”, “bare soil” and “shadows” (Fig. 8). In the study site A1, the identification
    of the class “buildings and roads” allowed to isolate from the rest of the image
    elements of no interest using SAVI. For the trees’ classification, the minimum
    height of the objects was identified by means of verification of CHM’s values.
    All trees were included in the “citrus” class by combining the SAVI index with
    CHM. The third class created, called “other vegetation”, included different tree
    species, distinguishable from citrus trees, as they are larger in canopy size.
    Other vegetation was identified based on CHM values higher than those used for
    citrus trees class. The part of the image excluded from the first three classes
    was assigned to the class “Bare soil”. Download : Download high-res image (892KB)

    obtained applying the implemented image object classification workflow. A1(Clementine),
    A2 (Olive) and B (Bergamot and Olive). In the study site A2, the classification
    of “Olive trees” was performed using CVI combined with CHM in order to avoid the
    attribution of the class to some specific regions of grass sensitive to the used
    VI. About “Shadows”, the use of the NIR1 band allowed to easily classify them,
    while “Building and roads” were isolated from the rest of the image by combining
    the CHM with the SAVI. In the case of “Other vegetation”, this class was easily
    identified based on a larger canopy size than the elements classified in “Olive
    trees”. Unclassified objects were included in the class “Bare soil”. The dataset
    B was the most complex of the three analyzed study sites and is occupied by two
    species (olive and bergamot) that coexist in several parts of the orchard. Olive
    trees can be found separately from the bergamot orchard at the right end of the
    image, while in the remaining part, they act as a windbreak. The latter are not
    of the same age and consequently have different heights and sizes of the canopies.
    The same trees were not properly pruned, and, as a result, most of the canopies
    of larger trees touch on one or more sides. On the contrary, there are small trees
    (especially in the sectors 4–6 and 7) whose canopies reveal relevant portions
    of bare soil. Given this situation of heterogeneity characterizing the entire
    image in different aspects, it was decided to subdivide it by grouping the bergamot
    trees based on the layout scheme of the irrigation sectors that roughly correspond
    to the different plantation age. The differences in height between the trees within
    the individual sectors led to the decision to classify only using VIs. Initially,
    the entire tree vegetation was classified without distinction of species, using
    a temporary class, “Vegetation class”, operating by sectors with different threshold
    values of SAVI. Depending on the presence of bare soil or grass, a value of 1
    or 0, respectively, was set as factor L in SAVI’s formula. Then, the isolation
    of the olive trees from the rest of the orchard’s trees was done using the SAVI
    (L = 1) in the sector (1) where olive trees have a regular plantation scheme and
    the CVI where olive trees served as a windbreak barrier (2–5, and 7). The proposed
    method, tested on the three datasets, is based mainly on the identification of
    characteristics of spectral response that allows enhancing the detection and classification
    of an object of interest (citrus trees in dataset A1, olive trees in dataset A2,
    and both species in dataset B). Further measures could provide useful information
    on the classification step but were not considered since, as explained, for example,
    in Laliberte and Rango (2009), it is time-consuming to compute several features
    during the object-based analysis. This method, which has proved effective in datasets
    of different complexity, finds its strong point is the speed of execution and
    on its repeatability to other different crops with few adjustments. As far as
    the processing speed is concerned, the net of the time needed to obtain the orthomosaics,
    the time is taken in total for the three datasets, was 4 h. Of which one hour
    was used for each of the first two datasets, A1 and A2, including visual analysis
    of images, followed by segmentation and classification. The remaining time was
    requested by the dataset B. Indeed, the time requested for the manual digitizing
    of the reference canopies (explained below), and for the verification of the accuracy
    of the results, is not added to the total computation time of the entire process.
    As for the repeatability of the proposed method in other contexts, it is worthy
    of interest to consider the obtained accuracy on the three datasets in the crown
    extraction phase. Results showed that most of olive and bergamot''s trees were
    correctly classified and extracted in all the three analyzed study sites. Concerning
    the obtained accuracy, Fig. 9 shows the extracted trees when they were overlaid
    on the reference data, and provided for each dataset. The green color (TP) indicates
    the correctly detected trees’ crowns according to the manual digitization, and
    that represents the reference data. The yellow color (FP) denotes crowns that
    were found by the algorithm, where there was no tree in the reference data. The
    red color (FN) represents missing crowns, i.e., where the algorithm did not detect
    tree canopies or parts of trees, and which were instead present in the reference
    data. As can be found analyzing the results reported in Table 4, in study site
    A1, the value of r (omission error) is 0.80, while the p value (commission error)
    is 0.94. The F that takes into account both r and p is 0.86. In the study site
    A2, where the classification concerned only olive trees, r is 0.81, and p is 0.89.,
    while the F is 0.85. In the study site B, the values of r, p, and F are 0.96 (F-score
    of bergamot trees is 0.91 and that of olive trees 0.85), 0.84 and 0.90, respectively.

    onscreen digitized canopy boundaries as reference data. Reference crowns (Rc)
    are in blue, true positives (TP) are in green, false negatives (FN) in red, and
    false positives (FP) in yellow. Analyzing the precision in identifying and extracting
    the trees’ canopies, the best results in terms of percentage of TP pixels and
    F, among all the three analyzed datasets, were obtained in the study site B (81.66%
    and 0.90, respectively). The percentage of FP was also the highest of the three
    datasets (15.22%) and is mainly found in zones where there was a short distance
    between canopies, and there was, at the same time, a thick layer of grass. The
    percentage of FN was the lowest (3.12%) concerning the failure of the classifier
    in identifying parts of canopies and some trees on edge the image, at the top
    of the image, where there is, of course, a distorting effect, and some trees in
    sector 3, where some tiny trees can be found. FN pixels represent 18.5% and 16.65%
    in the study sites A1 and A2, respectively. This is due to both the sporadic presence
    of canopies identified by the classifier and the error caused by the surrounding
    grass of background in identifying the canopy along the edges. As shown in Koc-San
    et al. (2018), it is difficult when the background’s spectral values are similar
    to those of trees (i.e., grass). Moreover, in the study site A2, considering the
    parameters used for the classification (CHM > 1.5 and CVI > 1.5), tiny olive trees
    with a low vegetation vigor, were not correctly identified and classified. Given
    the complexity and heterogeneity of the classified orchards and considering that
    we adopted a pixel-based accuracy assessment, the obtained results can undoubtedly
    be considered as very satisfactory. Moreover, it appears worth of interest to
    highlight that the TP category (i.e., crowns correctly detected and extracted),
    contains only pixels correctly classified, differently from an object-based accuracy
    assessment. In this latter case, all polygons, whose overlap area with the reference
    area is higher than a minimum threshold value (i.e., Ok and Ozdarici-Ok, 2018a,
    Ok and Ozdarici-Ok, 2018b, Rutzinger et al., 2009), are classified as TPs, therefore
    also containing pixels not correctly classified. Moreover, also referring to the
    F-score observed in the study site A2 (0.85), and comparing these results with
    those reported by other scholars (Ok and Ozdarici-Ok, 2018a, Ok and Ozdarici-Ok,
    2018b, Ozdarici-Ok, 2015), in more regular and well-managed orchards, our results
    can be considered very promising. The same consideration can be made by comparing
    the results of this work with those obtained by using other methods including
    convolutional neural networks, LiDAR’s data and algorithms based on the use of
    DSMs (Csillik et al., 2018, Li et al., 2012, Mohan et al., 2017, Ok and Ozdarici-Ok,
    2018a, Ok and Ozdarici-Ok, 2018b). On the other hand, the results obtained in
    study site B (the more complex among the three analyzed), with an overall F-score
    of 0.90 and with an FN comprised between 2.28% and 3.3%, strongly corroborated
    our proposed methodology. Our results suggest that our proposed workflow can allow
    us to classify and extract trees’ crowns in an easier, faster, and more effective
    way in well-managed orchards. To better understand the results of the trees’ canopy
    extraction, we analyzed the average spectral profile of reference crowns (Rc),
    TP, FP, and FN (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (682KB) Download

    A2 (Olive) and B (Bergamot and Olive). In study site A1, FP has the same mean
    radiometric profile of TP and Rc, while TP differs only in the NIR1 band. Similarly,
    in the study site A2, the spectral behavior of FN and FP is the same and very
    near to that of TP and Rc. Therefore, these objects were easily misclassified.
    Analyzing the mean spectral behavior in the study site B, the situation is quite
    different. FN and FP have the same spectral behavior but further to that of TP
    and Rc, compared to study sites A1 and A2. Several of them are located where the
    bergamot and olive tree canopies touch each other and on the border of the study
    side, where the number of overlapping images of the orthomosaic was lower than
    the rest of the image. 4.3. Vegetation indices (VIs) and vigor maps Vigor maps

    trees’ crowns in the study case A1, a high correlation there was between, GNDVI
    and GRNDVI (0.97), GNDVI and NDRE (0.91) while the correlation is not very high
    between GNDVI and NDVI (0.79). NDVI corresponds to SAVI (1) but is low correlated
    with NDRE (0.59). For these reasons, NDRE and N were chosen for the production
    of vigor maps of the orchards. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    the study-site A1, the NDVI map (Fig. 12) highlights the presence of two distinct
    zones of the citrus orchard. One where the clementine trees show a reduced vegetative
    vigor and with index values ranging between 0.4 and 0.65 and one with NDVI values,
    comprised between 0.7 and 0.9, shows a better tree vigor. NDRE (Fig. 13) takes
    average vigor values between 0.2 and 0.3 in most parts of the citrus orchard.
    The lowest values, highlighted in red in the vigor maps (Figg. 12 and 13), are
    found where, being the foliage less dense, the soil of the background appears.
    As for the case study A2 observing correlation matrices on VIs applied on trees’
    crowns, there were evident high correlations between the NDVI, GNDVI, and GRNDVI.
    At the same time, SAVI and CVI had no significant correlations with the other
    VIs. The olive orchard was classified using the CVI coupled with CHM, as in the
    case of study site A1, while shadows and buildings were identified using the NIR
    band and the SAVI coupled with the CHM. GNDVI was a good correlation with NDRE
    (0.89), NDVI (0.89), SAVI (0.89), and a very high correlation with GRNDVI (0.98).
    SAVI was a high correlation with GNDVI (0.89) and GRNDVI (0.96) and NDVI (1).
    NDRE showed a high correlation with GNDVI (0.89) and low correlations with NDVI
    (0.77), SAVI (0.77), and CVI (0.76). As in the previous dataset, NDRE and NDVI
    were chosen to map vigor in this study site. The NDVI vigor map (Fig. 12) showed
    that the vegetative status of the olive grove is not good, with values ranging
    from 0.15 to 0.7. Therefore, highlighting the vegetative stress of this orchard,
    planted in unsuitable land characterized by a very clayey and compact soil. The
    NDRE vigor map (Fig. 13), on the other hand, assuming low to medium values, ranging
    between 0.2 and 0.3, confirms what has already been highlighted by the NDVI index.
    Considering correlation matrices on VIs applied on trees’ crowns in case study
    B, similar correlations to those concerning the indices applied on the entire
    scene were verified with regard to the NDVI, but there is an apparent low correlation
    between NDRE and NDVI (0.63). Therefore these two indices were chosen to map vigor.
    The NDVI vigor map (Fig. 12) still proves to be suitable for monitoring the health
    status of the vegetation. In particular, in the lower part of the image and on
    the right, where both bergamot and olive trees are closer to the sea, and where
    the vegetative vigor is lower than the rest of the image, the NDVI assumed values
    between 0.15 and 0.5. The highest values, as well shown on the map, can be found
    in sector 5, with values comprised between 0.75 and 0.9. Looking at the NDRE (Fig.
    13) map, the contrast between the vegetative vigor of olive trees and bergamot
    trees is evident. While olive trees are characterized by NDRE values from 0.25
    and up, the highest value for bergamot trees is 0.25 and can be found only in
    sectors 5 and 8. As also shown by the NDVI, the lowest values of NDRE are in the
    lower part of sector 4 and in the middle between sectors 2 and 1, which are the
    areas closest to the sea. Besides, two aspects cannot be overlooked. The first
    one concerns the size of the analyzed study sites, comprised from 4.6 to 7.9 ha,
    and whose surface is comparable to operational conditions. The second aspect also
    concerns an operational issue. The time needed for the complete implementation
    of our proposed workflow, from the on-field data collection to the obtaining of
    vigor maps, can be estimated in one working day of two good skilled operators
    in geomatics and computer image processing. All data processing was implemented
    in a workstation with the following characteristics: OS MS Windows 10 Pro, CPU
    Intel dual Xeon E5-2687 W v2, 64 GB RAM DDR3 1866 MHz, GPU NVIDIA K6000. 5. Conclusions
    In the present research work, we propose a quick and reliable semi-automatic workflow
    implemented to process multispectral UAV imagery and aimed at the detection and
    extraction of olive and citrus trees’ crowns in the framework of precision agriculture
    PA. As confirmed by Solano et al. (2019), in the GEOBIA approach, the extraction
    of the trees takes advantage in orchards characterized by regular planting patterns
    with minimal overlap between the canopies. In our work, we demonstrated that the
    high spatial resolution of UAV allows overcoming these limitations. Moreover,
    the use of a UAV platform, coupled with a multispectral camera as Tetracam µ-MCA06
    Snap, has proved to be flexible and reliable in obtaining the photogrammetric
    reconstruction at the farming scale. Therefore, using high-resolution contents
    from UAV data, more focused analyses were performed only on the cultivated areas,
    excluding ground and shadows, in order to obtain a reasonable reconstruction of
    the orchards and the description of the crop conditions. On the other hand, to
    obtain good results, good quality of UAV field surveys is a need. As highlighted
    in discussing the obtained accuracy, the correct UAV flight planning has a crucial
    role in obtaining good results, and the same is true of measures taken in the
    field, such as the laying of GCP. In our case, referring to study sites A2 and
    B, a higher buffer beyond the orchard boundary could have improved the accuracy
    in extracting the trees’ crowns. In this regard, we suggest providing a buffer
    distance of at least 20 m outside the surveyed area. In the proposed workflow,
    we focused our attention also in simplifying the classification step and on the
    speed of execution. First, visual interpretation is applied to UAV imagery to
    acquire prior knowledge of the imagery (Ma et al., 2015). Concerning the segmentation
    step, scale parameters were chosen for generating segmented objects that represent
    real objects (Blaschke, 2010), single canopies in our case. As far as the classification
    is concerned, we proposed an unsupervised approach that has the advantage not
    to provide a training phase, and therefore the need for the selection of training
    samples set for training the classifier (Ma et al., 2015). The novelty of the
    proposed approach relies, therefore, on its speed, replicability, and reliability
    demonstrated with promising results in three different datasets. Agricultural
    environments may be more uniform than natural ones (Csillik et al., 2018). However,
    the present work has, among other things, dealt with the application of the proposed
    approach on a case (especially in dataset B) of heterogeneous tree orchards. The
    heterogeneity concerns different tree plantation distances and composition, different
    crop management, and different tree age, height, and crown diameters, therefore,
    resulting in the high spatial variability of the scene. Following our promising
    results, we think that our methodology can be used in different orchards worldwide,
    setting the segmentation parameters properly, and after a spectral analysis. As
    also demonstrated by our experience and by those we cited in this paper, the use
    of topographic data (DSM, CHM), helps to improve the obtained results. Indeed,
    in implementing our workflow, we took into account its operational application.
    It appears worth of interest to highlights that it requests a working day of two
    good skilled operators in geomatics and image processing, from the on-field data
    collection to the obtaining of vigor maps. In this regard, for its application
    in different conditions of those analyzed in the present research, the time needed
    for its complete implementation can be estimated in one working day of two good
    skilled operators in geomatics and image processing. These characteristics are
    in line with the need of the PA to provide information, in a short space of time,
    useful to guide farmers’ decisions. CRediT authorship contribution statement Giuseppe

    A recent common aim of Industry 4.0 is finding a solution that integrates the
    modern technologies with the agricultural sector’s needs, taking into account
    low environmental impact by means of renewable energy sources [1, 2]. With the
    help of Internet of Things (IoT), a huge number of low cost and low power sensors
    can easily be deployed in farmlands, in order to gather precise climate and soil
    data. Thereafter, the collected data are then forward, by Internet connection,
    to the so called on-cloud IoT framework. In this context, some recent examples
    for agricultural applications are shown [3,4,5,6,7] and a survey of several researches
    of IoT applied to various agricultural, food production and manufacturing challenges
    are reported [8,9,10]. The specific aspect of the characteristics of the Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) used in the applications of smart fertigation has also been
    widely investigated (i.e. [11,12,13,14].). Moreover, recent researches have analyzed
    and suggested the use of low cost photovoltaic station for powering the entire
    fertigation system [15,16,17]. The innovative system, considered in this paper,
    is an energy self-sufficient fertigation system powered by photovoltaic energy
    and integrated with a low-cost WSN in order to monitor the crops directly on-field
    [15]. The smart system aims to guarantee a rational use of fertilizers, water
    resources and, consequently, a reduction of the environmental impact. The solution
    allows the integration and optimized management of traditional cropping systems
    with existing innovative technologies (thanks to the use of low-cost wireless
    electronic modules). Both receive and process data from connected sensors. The
    fertigation system calibrates the periodicity and fertilizer amounts to be used
    in the irrigation and fertilization phases based on sensors data related to temperature
    and humidity of both soil and air. The WSN is directly distributed on the land
    and acquires the soil and environmental parameters by sending the data to a central
    control unit. In this paper, the important problem of the fertilizer, granular
    or liquid, dosing system, is considered, whose accuracy and behavior is a crucial
    problem for precision agriculture (some specific applications in [18, 19]) and
    the considered smart fertigation system. The dosing system of the fertigation
    [15] has been strongly investigated in the manuscript starting from its design.
    An innovative solution for dosing liquid and granular fertilizers is presented,
    starting from the details of its design and construction. This also includes a
    complete experimental testing procedure in order to define a mathematical expression
    depending on the type of fertilizers useful for accurately controlling the dosing
    system. Four types of dosing systems have been designed, realized and discussed
    in the present work; two types for granular fertilizers and two types for liquid
    fertilizers, with different flow rates characteristics. The norms [20, 21] have
    served as guideline for the design of the augers (for granular fertilizers) and
    peristaltic pumps (for liquid fertilizers). The detailed description of the setup,
    used for testing the four realized dosing systems, with different type of fertilizers
    and the presentation and analysis of the data obtained constitute the main body
    of this paper. The final results permit to be confident about a high accuracy
    of the fertilizer dosage for several types of liquid and granular ones and permit
    to consider the fertigation system as a suitable possibility for optimizing environmental
    sustainability and production in terms of quantity and quality. The paper is organized
    as follows: Sect. 2 includes a general description of the considered solar powered
    fertigation system with the low cost WSN used for getting the environmental data.
    Section 3 shows in detail all the design step of the four dosing systems, the
    choice of the main components and the realization of the prototypes. Section 4
    shows the experimental setup used, Sects. 5 and 6 the results of the experimental
    tests carried out testing the dosage systems with 3 different types of granular
    fertilizers (Sect. 5) and 3 types of liquid fertilizers (Sect. 6). In the same
    section detailed comments about the experiments, the accuracy of the devices,
    the problems during the tests, generalization of the results and the possible
    application on the fertigation system are also reported; finally, Sect. 7 shows
    the conclusions of the research. 2 General Description and Design of the Innovative
    Fertigation System The considered system [15] allows the agricultural fields fertilization
    in automatic way and is powered by a solar energy. Furthermore, its central unit
    is composed by the following main elements (depicted in Fig. 1 and detailed in
    Fig. 2): photovoltaic panels, wood container, control panel, batteries, dosing
    system for the liquid fertilizing with relative storage tank, dosing system for
    the granular fertilizing, mixture tank, electric pump, pipelines and connection
    cables for the hydraulic and electrical part. Fig. 1 Design of the fertigation
    system central unit Full size image Fig. 2 a inverter and battery, b control panel,
    c peristaltic pump, d cochlea Full size image The necessary power for all the
    system is generated by photovoltaic panels connected in series to the charge regulator
    that stabilizes the produced energy to 24 V for charging the batteries. The dosing
    system is powered with alternate current 230 V 50 Hz obtained transforming the
    batteries energy by means of a stand-alone solar inverter (Fig. 2a). The control
    panel (Fig. 2b) is made by a logic board (Raspberry PI 3 model B) that receives
    the parameters detected by the sensors on the field through the WSN, compares
    them with the threshold values and, programmed with opportune algorithms that
    considers the particular farming, controls the drive of the different actuators,
    the granular dosing, the liquid dosing, the electric pump and the opening of the
    irrigation electro valves. The liquid fertilizer dosing system is composed by
    a peristaltic pump that permits the dosing of the fertilizer from the storage
    tank; the peristaltic pump (Fig. 2c) is made by a rotor where three rollers are
    applied which, during the rotation, throttles the tube and provoke the fluid advancement.
    The granular fertilizer dosing system is realized by a dosing cochlea that permits
    the fertilizer of handling from the collection hopper to the mixture tank. The
    cochlea (Fig. 2d) is constituted by a shaft that has, on the external surface,
    a certain number of helixes; the shaft rotation driven by an electric motor handles
    a quantity of granular fertilizer depending on the velocity and duration of the
    shaft rotation. The fertigation central unit (A in Fig. 3a) starts up the pump,
    opens the electro valves of the interested zone (indicated with B, C in Fig. 3a)
    and holds the other zone close. The system detects through sensor nodes of the
    WSN physical magnitudes on the field (i.e. humidity and temperature), depending
    from threshold values locally set or remotely programmed through web server, and
    automatically controls the drives using programmed electronic boards. The considered
    sensor node is a ground humidity sensor, Soil Moisture DF Robot (Fig. 3b), that
    is a capacitive level sensor able to measure the percentage of water in a ground
    volume. A preliminary configuration of the sensor nodes and of the WSN, of the
    control electronic boards and transmission devices, will be presented for the
    completeness of the paper; anyway other studies and improvements of the control
    system and its hardware are not object of the present research and have been recently
    published [22, 23]. The data transmission is realized by a xBee (xBee S2) module
    which is a low cost module that uses a serial communication for (wireless) data
    transfer at radiofrequency. An appropriate dimensioned photovoltaic panel powers
    the sensor and the wireless module; the considered panel has an output voltage
    of 5 V. In the considered setup, a step-down tension converter DC-DC LM2596 decreases
    and stabilized the panel output voltage to a value of 4 V for charging the above
    lithium battery. Finally, in order to correctly power the xBee S2 module (3.3
    V) and the soil moisture DFRobot sensor (1.2 V), two voltage dividers have been
    realized; a complete scheme of the sensor node configuration is shown in Fig.
    3c), where all the considered elements have been indicated. Fig. 3 a Scheme of
    the fertigation system, b ground humidity sensor, c scheme of each sensor node
    Full size image 3 Sizing Dosing Systems Starting from the analytical sizing, defined
    by the relative reference standards, the selection of the most suitable components
    to the subsequent 3D CAD modeling of the dosing systems has been carried out.
    In total, four devices were designed, two for the dosage of the liquid fertilizer
    and two for the dosage of the granular fertilizer; for each system, three different
    types of fertilizer were analyzed. 3.1 Granular Fertilizer Dosage Systems Design
    For the transportation of the granular fertilizer, from the loading hopper to
    the mixing tank, metering augers are used. The dosing auger is a machine commonly
    used for the transportation of the material, inserted by one or more loading ports,
    using the thrust of a rotor. The rotor is a tube that carries at its end the helical
    elements. Therefore, once the fertilizer transported strip is rotated on the bottom
    and on the helical thrust body, it ensures the displacement of the fertilizer.
    This happens once the dosing screw has been selected, its dimensional and geometric
    characteristics have been defined, and the relative reference standard for sizing
    has been considered, namely the UNI 10,468 standard [20]. The processed volumetric
    flow rate Iv of the cochlea, considering its geometrical characteristics depicted
    in Fig. 4a), can be determined by the speed for the auger passage section as expressed
    in (1), Fig. 4 Geometrical characteristics of a cochlea Full size image $${I}_{v}=v\\mathrm{*}A$$
    (1) where \\(v\\) is the ground speed, expressed by (2), depending on the cochlea
    step S (Fig. 4a), $$v=S \\,*\\, \\frac{n}{60}$$ (2) and A is the area defined
    by (3) where De and Di are cochlea geometrical characteristics described in Fig.
    4. \\(\\varphi\\) is the filling coefficient that allows to take into account
    the non-total filling of the cochlea during operation; it is equal to 0.9 for
    the extraction screw conveyors and between 0.15 and 0.45 for the others. $$A=\\varphi

    In this research two different granular fertilizer dosing systems with different
    cochlea having different geometrical characteristics and different velocities
    (n), as reported in Table 1, have been designed, constructed, and tested. The
    CAD design of the cochlea and all the granular fertilizer dosing systems are reported
    in Fig. 5a, b respectively for the dosing system 1 and 2 (bigger cochlea). Table

    be calculated by (4), where ρ is the density of the considered granular fertilizer.

    supplied by the company “Agritecs.r.l.” have been considered for each system:
    “Idrosoyl 10–40-10 + Micro” named Fertilizer 1, “Idrosoyl 15–5-30 + 2MgO + Micro”
    named Fertilizer 2, “Idrosoyl 18–18-18 + Micro” named Fertilizer 3. The mass flows
    and the physical characteristics for each fertilizer for the 2 granular dosing
    systems by considering (4) are reported in Table 2. Table 2 The mass flows and
    the physical characteristics for each fertilizer for the 2 granular dosing systems
    Full size table The total resistant power P(kW) to ensure the transport of the
    material is given by (5) [20]: $$P = P_{e} + P_{h} + P_{n} + P_{st} \\,[{\\text{kW}}]$$
    (5) in (5) \\({P}_{e}\\) is the resistance due to the extraction motion (kW),
    \\({P}_{h}\\) is resistance due to the movement of the material (kW), \\({P}_{n}\\)
    is resistance due to vacuum friction (kW), \\({P}_{st}\\) is resistance due to
    lifting of the material (for inclined screw conveyors) (kW). Applying in (5) the
    formulas in [20] for the 2 dosing systems, it is possible to estimate a total
    resistant power of 0.352 W for the first granular dosing system and of 1.35 W
    for the second one; considering the angular velocity (see Table 2 where the mass
    flows or the 3 fertilizers are reported) of the 2 dosing systems, from the necessary
    torque two motor models were chosen for the two systems to satisfy, with a certain
    margin, the technical specifications of the systems. At this proposal a Kenta
    motor model K9119600 was chosen for the first system and a Kenta motor model K9119157
    was chosen for the second one. A schematic 3D CAD model of the two designed granular
    dosing system is shown in Fig. 5. 3.2 Liquid Fertilizer Dosing System Design The
    device for transporting the liquid fertilizer from its accumulation tank to the
    mixing tank, where it will be mixed, has been considered a peristaltic pump. Also
    in this case two different dosing systems have been designed. The following relationships,
    (6)–(8), were considered for the determination of the flow Q, (6), where in (6)
    v is the liquid velocity and D the diameter of the tube, of the pump prevalence
    H (7) [21] where in (7) ρ is the fluid density [kg/m3], g is the gravity acceleration,
    p1 and p2 the downstream and upstream pressure [Pa], v1 and v2 the downstream
    and upstream liquid velocities [m/s], Hg the height difference, R the load less
    and of the absorbed power P.(8), where in (8) \\(\\mu\\) is the pump efficiency.
    $$\\mathrm{Q}=v\\cdot\\uppi \\cdot \\frac{{D}^{2}}{4}$$ (6) $$\\mathrm{H}=\\frac{{p}_{2}-{p}_{1}}{\\rho
    \\cdot g}+{H}_{g}+\\frac{{v}_{2}^{2}-{v}_{1}^{2}}{2\\cdot g}+R$$ (7) $$\\mathrm{P}=\\frac{\\rho
    \\cdot g\\cdot Q\\cdot H}{\\mu }$$ (8) During the design, some simplifying hypotheses
    have been carried out, such as the absence of load, the lack of loss due to the
    short length of the considered tubes and the possibility of setting the same speed
    of the fluid in the suction duct and in the delivery duct, considering the fluid
    speed constant for the ducts having the same diameter. For the liquid fertilizer
    dosage system 1 it is set equal to \\({v}_{1}\\)=0.45 m/s, while for the dosage
    system 2 it is fixed equal to \\({v}_{2}\\)=1.5 m/s. Considering the PVC connecting
    pipes consist of a transparent plastic tube, diameters were chosen for the first
    liquid fertilizer dosing system equal to 3/8″, while for the second liquid fertilizer
    dosing system equal to 1/2″. Since the lengths of these very small pipes are always
    less than 0.3 m, load losses have been assumed to be negligible. Applying Eq.
    (6) with the fixed velocities and the diameters chosen, an estimated flow of 1.92
    l/min for the liquid in the first dosing system and an estimated flow rate of
    11.58 l/min in the second one have been valued. Once calculated the flow rates,
    the peristaltic pump \"SingFlo” model “FLO-2401\" able to process a volumetric
    flow rate equal to 2 l/min has been chosen for the first dosing system and the
    \"SingFlo\" model \"FL-44\", able to process a volumetric flow rate equal to17
    l/min has been chosen for the second dosing system. The corresponding powers,
    equal to 21.6 and 134.4 W respectively, is eligible to satisfy the requested powers
    given by (8) for all the liquid fertilizers and taking into account the technical
    characteristics of the pumps. A representation of the selected peristaltic pumps
    with 3D CAD and photo is given in Fig. 6a for the dosing system 1 and in Fig.
    6b for the dosing system 2. Fig. 6 a Peristaltic pump for dosing system 1:3D CAD,

    different liquid fertilizers have been considered for testing each of the two
    dosing system: “Fluitek” named Fertilizer 1, “Thonerboro plus” named Fertilizer
    2, “Trys plus” named Fertilizer 3. The maximum mass flows for the fertilizers
    referred to the 2 granular dosing systems, by considering (4), are reported in
    Table 3. Table 3 The mass flows and the physical characteristics for each fertilizer
    for the 2 liquid dosing systems Full size table 4 Experimental Tests 4.1 Experimental
    Setup for Granular Fertilizer Dosing Systems Several experimental tests were carried
    out for analyzing the real behavior of the fertilizer dosing systems designed
    and realized as shown in the previous sections. The objective of the tests with
    3 different granular fertilizers and as many different liquid fertilizers was
    to investigate on the influence of the chemical-physical fertilizers properties
    on the accuracy of the dosing system. Moreover, several tests in the same conditions
    were useful to evaluate the repeatability of the flow rate processed by the system,
    so as to avoid incorrect measurements. By varying the operating time of the fertilizer
    handling system, several tests were carried out in order to evaluate the correspondence
    between the working time of the dosing system and the real flow rate of fertilizers
    at the dosing system exit. In this way a flow rate-time diagram has been considered
    evaluating the linearity of the system with respect to different quantities of
    fertilizers necessary. Each point of the plotted flow rate-time plot is the average
    of three diverse tests in the same conditions. Finally, considerations about the
    accuracy of the dosing systems that permits to optimize the control strategy for
    placing the correct quantity of fertilizer avoiding excesses or lacks of fertilizers;
    moreover, comparisons with the theoretical values of flow rate previously estimated
    will complete the extensive experimental campaign of measurements. Four experimental
    setups have been realized for the tests; two setups related to the granular fertilizers
    (one for each dosing system) and other two setups related to the liquid fertilizers.
    For each type of fertilizer (granular or liquid), the difference is the type of
    cochlea or pump used. In all setups the motor driving the cochlea or the pumps
    is powered by 2 batteries of 12 V connected in series in such a way to have a
    powered voltage of 24 V. The control is made by a low cost digital board ‘Arduino
    1′ that supplies a relay module at 5 V connected by appropriate cables to the
    servomotor. A scheme and a photo of the control unit are shown in Fig. 7 where
    the connections between the electronic digital board (Arduino) and the relays
    module are shown schematically and with a photo. The setups related to the granular
    fertilizers with the two different types of cochlea are shown in Fig. 8a, b with
    a measurement tank placed at the exit of the cochlea for measuring the quantity
    of deposed fertilizer on a balance; in Fig. 9 the tank at the exit of the cochlea

    Setup for Liquid Dosing Systems The setup related to liquid fertilizers (as shown
    in Fig. 10) has, differently from the previous setup, an accumulation tank for
    the liquid fertilizer at the pump entrance and a measuring vessel for quantifying
    the deposed fertilizer at the pump exit. The control board is the same used in
    the previous setup (depicted in Fig. 7 with the relative relays module). The complete
    setup systems are shown in Fig. 10 (view from top), where Fig. 10a) depicts the
    dosing system 1 (smaller pump) and Fig. 10b the dosage system 2, while Fig. 11
    is a photo that shows the top, frontal and lateral view during a test (referred
    to the liquid fertilizer 1 and the dosage system 2). Fig. 10 a Setup for liquid

    image 5 Granular Fertilizer Dosing System Tests 5.1 Theoretical Aspects Several
    tests were carried out considering the two previously dimensioned dosing systems
    for granular fertilizers. The tests have been carried out by changing the drive
    time of the cochlea motor; starting from an opening time of 5 s, until a final
    time of 300 s, with at least 2 repetitions for each test in order to evaluate
    the process repeatability. In order to have a wider range of data, the step considered
    is 5 s in the first part and then it is has been increased for the last tests.
    Considering the almost coincidence of the results obtained with the repetitions,
    in the results reported in Table 4 only the average value for each test is reported
    for the 2 dosage systems and for the 3 granular fertilizers with respect to the
    different opening times. In Fig. 12 a graphical evaluation of the results for
    the dosage system 1 and in Fig. 13 for the dosage system 2 is reported; it is
    possible to appreciate the extreme linearity of the behavior of both dosage systems
    for all the 3 considered fertilizers for all the opening times and the corresponding
    quantities of deposed fertilizer on the tank. In order to have a more clear idea
    of the linearity, the determination coefficient R2 defined by (9) and the fitting
    straight line equation are reported foe each case. Table 4 Experimental results

    \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({y}_{i}-f\\left({x}_{i}\\right))}^{2}\\) is the sum of the square
    of the errors between the n experimental points yi and the corresponding points
    f(xi) on the fitting straight line and \\(SQD= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({y}_{i}-\\stackrel{-}{y})}^{2}\\)
    that is the sum of the square of the errors between the n experimental points
    yi and their average value \\(\\stackrel{-}{y}\\). The determination coefficient
    may permit to have an idea of the real linearity of the proposed dosage systems
    and, consequently, may give important information about the possibility of easily
    using the proposed dosing system in the central unit of an automatic an innovative
    fertigation system (previously described). The large number of tests carried out
    permits also to understand if, considering the similar density of the considered
    granular fertilizers, other physical parameters (excluded the density) may substantially
    influence the dosage system behavior. 5.2 Results Analysis The following important
    considerations may be pointed out from the analysis of the experimental tests
    shown in Table 4 and Figs. 12 and 13: the two granular fertilizer dosing systems
    have an excellent repeatability and a linear behavior for all the 3 different
    fertilizers considered and the fitting straight lines shoes an error always minor
    than 1% that means that it is possible with high accuracy to dose the quantity
    of granular fertilizers to use in all the cases; the two dosing systems have a
    behavior that depends from the type of fertilizer; the dependency is light, it
    may be appreciated for the tests with a big quantity of fertilizer (last rows
    in Table 4), anyway all the considered fertilizers are included in a range of
    10% of the indicated value, and if this accuracy may be considered acceptable,
    it is not necessary to tune the dosing system for each fertilizer to use. This
    result is perfectly coherent with the densities of the granular fertilizers, that
    is quite similar for all 3 the fertilizers with a maximum difference of 10% (see
    Table 2); the tests with fertilizer 3 and dosing system 2 shows a behavior similar
    to the other fertilizers until the working time of the cochlea overpasses 120
    s. When the cochlea working time overpasses 120 s, it was not possible anymore
    getting experimental data (see Table 4) because, after that time, the cochlea
    is not anymore able to move the granular fertilizer and the mass flow remains
    constant. This anomalous behavior is due to the fact that the fertilizer, compacting
    inside the loading hopper, is not able anymore to be transported and a kind of
    empty area arise around the cochlea that idles. Figure 14 shows clearly this empty
    area. During the experiments it has been considered the possibility of reversing
    the rotation direction of the cochlea after passing 120 s, but with a negative
    exit due to the big extension of the empty area around the cochlea. There is to
    underline that, with the same fertilizer, the first dosing device system could
    work properly without any problem, for its lower mass flow rate; Fig. 14 Empty
    area around the cochlea for dosing system 2 fertilizer 3 after 120 s Full size
    image Fig. 15 Analysis of experimental results for the liquid fertilizer dosage
    system 1 Full size image in Table 5 a comparison between the theoretical mass
    flow rates of the designed dosing systems for the 3 fertilizers with the experimental
    mass flow rates estimated by the tests is reported; the experimental mass flow
    rate is lower than the theoretical one with a reduction that depends from the
    reality of the experiments different from the ideal conditions considered in the
    design phase. Anyway a mass flow of around 80% of the theoretical one is obtained
    for both the dosing systems and for the 3 fertilizers. Table 5 Experimental analytical
    data comparison granular fertilizer systems 1 and 2 Full size table 6 Liquid Fertilizer
    Dosing System Tests 6.1 Theoretical Aspects The tests carried out on liquid fertilizers
    considering the two previously dimensioned systems were organized as the tests
    referred to granular fertilizer. The two liquid fertilizer dosing systems were
    tested with three diverse liquid fertilizers. At least two repetitions were carried
    out for each configuration in order to verify the repeatability of the results.
    Moreover, the working time of the motor of the peristaltic pump was increased
    starting from the value of 5 s, measuring, after the end of each test, the quantity
    of liquid fertilizer deposed in the tank placed at the exit of the peristaltic
    pump (see corresponding setup shown in Fig. 11). The results referred to the average
    value of 2 or 3 tests and to the 3 analyzed fertilizers are shown in Table 6 (dosage
    system 1 and dosage system 2) and the corresponding plots with the evaluation
    of the fitting straight lines with their equations and of the determination coefficient
    R2 are shown in in Fig. 15 (three liquid fertilizers for dosage system 1 vs the
    pump opening time) and Fig. 16 (three liquid fertilizers for dosage system 2 vs
    the pump opening time). As clear from the characteristics of the liquid fertilizers,
    fertilizer 3 has a higher value of density, so it needs less time to achieve the
    same value of mass of the other fertilizers, and its characterization can be stopped
    with lower values of working time for the motor of the pump. Finally, it is important
    to underline that all the tests were carried out by completely filling of fertilizer
    the tank located at the entrance of the pump (the white tank in Fig. 10). Table
    6 Experimental results for liquid fertilizer dosage systems 1 and 2 Full size
    table Fig. 16 Analysis of experimental results for the liquid fertilizer dosage
    system 2 Full size image 7 Results Analysis The following important considerations
    may be carried out from the analysis of the experimental tests shown in Table
    6 and Figs. 15 and 16: also in the case of the dosing systems designed for the
    liquid fertilizers, the behavior of both the systems has an excellent repeatability
    and a linear behavior for all the 3 considered fertilizers and the fitting straight
    line can give with a very low error an excellent model of the systems; for the
    two dosage systems, in all the cases, the average error is lower than 3%. This
    error is mainly due to the generation of air bubbles that generate small variations
    on the processed fertilizer. This low error, that is a bit bigger that the error
    for granular fertilizers, guarantees that it is possible with high accuracy to
    dose the quantity of granular fertilizers to use in all the cases. Of course,
    the behavior of the most powerful second dosing system shows a higher mass flow
    rate for each considered fertilizer; differently from the case of granular fertilizer,
    in this case the fertilizers have different physical characteristics (see Table
    3) and fertilizer 3 has a density and mass flow rate much higher that the other
    two liquid fertilizers. The behavior is substantially linear in all the cases,
    but, considering the different fertilizers, it is possible to observe that it
    is a more regular for the more dense fertilizer 3 with a linearity error lower
    than the other 2 fertilizers; all the tests in Table 6 were carried out considering
    a constant quantity of fertilizer in the supply tank, a completely full tank condition.
    In order to investigate on the importance of this condition, that in operative
    situations may be not always respected, some tests (2 repetitions for each test)
    were carried out with a partially empty tank. The results are reported in Table
    7 for the three liquid fertilizer and the dosage system 1 with partially empty
    supply tank. Comparing the results with the data in Table 6, it is possible to
    conclude that the effect of the filling level of the supply tank is not so significant
    and the mass of deposed fertilizer is analogue with the condition of completely
    full tank; Table 7 Experimental results for liquid fertilizer dosage system 1,
    partially empty supply tank Full size table in Table 8 a comparison between the
    theoretical mass flow rates of the designed dosing systems for the 3 liquid fertilizers
    with the experimental mass flow rate estimated by the tests for both the dosing
    systems is reported; the experimental mass flow rate is lower than the theoretical
    one with a reduction that depends from the dosage system (lower for the dosage
    system 1 with lower mass flow) and from the fertilizer (lower for the higher density
    fertilizer 3). This is justifiable by considering that as the velocity of the
    fluid increases, there is an increase in the energy losses by the system, due
    to dissipations that generally turn into heat. In this way the dissipations cause
    changes in the flow of the liquid, generating a reduction in the processed flow
    rate. This phenomenon is less evident with the fertilizer 3 with higher density
    that shows a bigger efficiency. Table 8 Experimental analytical data comparison
    liquid fertilizer systems 1 and 2 Full size table Finally, from all the aforementioned
    considerations and comments, it is possible to conclude that, with simple linear
    mathematical relations, we can determine directly and with an excellent accuracy,
    note the amount of fertilizer required by the crop, the operating time of the
    system for all the dosage systems designed and realized and for all the fertilizers
    (granular and liquid) tested. 8 Conclusions Relying to the concept of precision
    agriculture, in this work some components have been designed and tested: four
    automatic fertilizer dosage systems, two for granular fertilizers and two for
    liquid fertilizers with different flow rates, that may be inserted in an innovative
    fertilization system powered by solar energy in such a way to optimize, with a
    high level of accuracy, the mass quantity of fertilizer placed in the ground.
    The main aim of the research, besides the preliminary hardware design of an appropriate
    environmental node sensor hardware, has been the design from scratch, the realization
    and the testing of automatic dosage systems that may be driven by a control that
    uses the data of the network of sensors nodes placed in the field. The several
    tests carried out and here presented, first of all, have made it possible to verify
    the correct analytical sizing of the dosing systems; as a result of the tests,
    it was possible to ascertain the proper functioning, in terms of moving the fertilizer
    from the loading area to the unloading area. Furthermore, the tests have allowed
    to determine the repeatability, considering the operating time constant, of the
    flow rate calculated as a function of the fertilizer and of the type of system
    under analysis. The analysis of the data made it possible to determine the linear
    mathematical expression, characteristic for each fertilizer and dosing system,
    which allows a priori to define, according to the actuation time, the quantity
    actually processed and the motor working time necessary to get the necessary quantity
    of fertilizer with high accuracy and very low error. The motor working time can
    be easily set by a simple digital driving board and a suitable control algorithm.
    It has been observed that the granular fertilizers dosing systems have a slightly
    higher linearity and repeatability than the liquid fertilizer dosing systems,
    due mainly to the different chemical-physical behavior that, for liquid fertilizer,
    provoke the generation of air bubbles in the fluid especially at high speed and
    low density. Moreover, after designing the dosing systems, the execution of the
    related experimental tests made it possible to compare the analytical data with
    those obtained experimentally. This comparison showed the fundamental importance
    of the calibration process, which allowed to define the trend of experimental
    data compared to analytical data. In this activity, the analysis was limited to
    only three different fertilizers for each system, however it was observed that
    the difference between the experimental and analytical data remained roughly constant
    with the variation of fertilizers, suggesting a similar trend for the others fertilizers
    commonly used in agriculture. The setup used for the tests is characterized by
    its simplicity and economy and from the possibility of directly measuring the
    amount of fertilizer (liquid or granular) available in the ground, characterizing
    with a linear mathematical model the dosage system. The designed and tested dosing
    systems are now available for their use inside the fertigation solar powered systems;
    future specific developments for refining the research here presented could be
    related to the possibility of testing other fertilizers in such a way to create
    a database useful for avoiding for the user any kind of preliminary calibration
    for getting an accurate dosing. A further specific target for some solid/granular
    fertilizers (such as granular fertilizer 3) could be that of avoiding the problem
    of empty area around the dosing cochlea by designing a system for mixing the fertilizer
    in the hopper during the rotation of the cochlea. Moreover, it should be considered
    that the fertigation system could be applied in areas where environmental or external
    factors could heavily influence the necessities of the plants; at this aim a more
    complex investigation should be carried out including the correlations between
    the different influencing factors. The factors may be divided in specific factors
    related to the dosage system behavior (that have considered from the results of
    the experimental tests in this research), and external factors (environment, pollution,
    specificity of the plants, specificity of the place, etc.) where a complete and
    articulated analysis (i.e. [24]. that analyzes the dynamic factors for mitigating
    air pollution) should be necessary and useful for defining their relative contribution
    to the process. In the discussed case, the effects of the external factors may
    be considered inherent the dosage system control of the proposed complete fertigation
    system, where opportune sensors and control algorithms could take into account,
    in closed loop, the effect of external factors. Several tools have been recently
    introduced in the scientific literature [25,26,27,28] for supporting the control
    algorithm choices. The demonstrated extreme linearity of all the proposed low-cost
    dosage systems is a benefit for easily controlling the external factors and maintain
    a stable and well controlled behavior of the proposed fertigation system. Other
    automatic fertilizers (i.e. the system shown in [29]) have shown, in the field
    tests, a not negligible difference between the prescribed dosage and the applied
    one. The validation of the entire automatic fertigation system constitute the
    next research target including a functional analysis of the factors affecting
    the system performance. References Dornfeld, D. A. (2014). Moving towards green

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Budva, Montenegro SECTION I. Introduction
    In the time of increasing demand for food, precision agriculture provides higher
    yields with a lower input cost and leads to a reduction in environmental pollution
    and labor. Modern day food production and precision agriculture are expected to
    dramatically increase the usage of the latest computer and electronic technologies.
    In accordance to this, decision support systems have been developed in the last
    decades in order to provide expert knowledge needed for farmers in their agricultural
    management [1]. Agriculture has been primary economic activity for the people
    of developing nations. The green-house based agriculture system enhanced by Internet
    of Things - IoT for monitoring and controlling would provide better yield as well
    as quality as per required by the market. The use of Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN),
    actuators, remote database server/cloud computing, remote access through user
    application integrated as part of IoT, will enable the efficient utilization of
    resources available [2]. Agricultural systems are inherently characterized by
    spatial and temporal variability making yield maximization with minimal inputs
    a complex task. Thus the farming technologies followed in all parts of world need
    to be constantly updated to meet these challenges. The concept of precision agriculture
    has been around for some time now. A new approach of collecting real time data
    from the environment could represent an important step towards high quality and
    sustainable agriculture. Precision agriculture is an agricultural system that
    can contribute to the sustainable agriculture concepts [3]. Research in viticulture
    and winemaking sector are increasingly focused on the agronomic and technological
    innovations, aimed to improve quality of grapes and wine, with efficient management
    of water while minimizing negative impact on the environment. The effective management
    of the water regime and controlled water deficits are fundamental factors for
    the production of high quality grapes and wines, along with efficient management
    of viticulture and wine production. In a context of growing competition on international
    markets, it becomes of utmost importance to achieve higher quality standards in
    the vineyard. This has led to a radical renewal of viticulture and a review of
    agricultural techniques, with the aim of maximizing quality and sustainability
    through the reduction and more efficient use of production inputs such as energy,
    fertilizers and chemicals, and minimizing input costs while ensuring the preservation
    of the environment [4]. With the increasing need for mechanization of labor operations
    and with the decreasing availability of manpower, there was a tendency to simplify
    the work on maintaining vineyards by standardizing the application of different
    production inputs - factors of production and agrotechnical measures. This approach,
    which leads to the harmonization of agrotechnical measures, is based on the assumption
    that the vineyard should be viewed as a homogeneous individual by the characteristics
    of the soil and climate, and not as a set of different soil and micro-climate
    conditions. The result of this is the use of factors of production irrespective
    of the real needs of the vine, which leads to a deficient or over-application
    of them, with obvious consequences in terms of profitability and production efficiency,
    as well as environmental aspects. In contrast, there are increasing signs of opposite
    tendencies that result primarily from: a significant increase in interest in “sustainable”
    winegrowing products that are well-suited to the application of locally specific
    agro-technical measures; reduction of costs of production inputs (factors) due
    to very precise programming of their application; differentiation of production,
    bringing to full expression its specificities by improving the inherent quality
    of the product, which is achieved through careful and precise programming of vineyard
    maintenance. A. Precision Viticulture In the last decade, wireless technologies
    have been increasingly applied in precision agriculture. Wireless monitoring systems
    in particular have been used in precision viticulture in order to understand vineyard
    variability, and therefore suggest appropriate management practices for improving
    the quality of the wines. According to International Organisation of Vine and
    Wine, Precision Viticulture (PV) is a cyclic management approach to field operations
    based on information and technology tools that uses multiple sources of vineyard-related
    data to support site-specific decision making with the aim to optimize production
    processes. PV privileges a range of information technologies for understanding
    variability in their production systems and to quantify and map variability within-vineyard
    in order to target management according to the real needs of each part of the
    field (site-specific management). A number of tools, such as soil proximal (ground)
    or weather sensors, remote sensing (satellite, airborne or drone-DAVs remote sensing),
    global navigation satellite system (GNSS), geographical information systems (GIS)
    and robotics can be used. The spatial variability of a particular vineyard can
    be due to any difference in any element or property for each of the natural, biological,
    agronomic factors which influence vine performance and the expression of grape
    and wine characters. These factors may be present naturally or due to human activity
    [5]. Several authors have studied precision viticulture in different [4]–[19].
    They reported about several benefits of precision viticulture: reduction of fertilizer
    costs, reduction of pesticide application costs, minimization of environmental
    pollution, increase of product yield, more accurate information management due
    to more efficient information production, operating records required for sales
    and after sales production periods [20]. Since the production methods and used
    techniques mainly in viticulture sector of Montenegro employ traditional approaches
    there is plenty of room for improvement. This particularly holds for application
    of biosensing technology and state-of-the-art concepts backed up with ICT solutions
    such as wireless sensor networks, low cost sensing devices and remote sensing.
    The introduction of this framework in Montenegro could lead to faster economic
    development, better and more intelligent utilization of the resources, high-quality
    food production and protection of the environment. This research is aimed at developing
    methods to quantify temporal variability observed within vineyards and to use
    data processing tools to assist wine producers and viticulturists to control,
    analyse and make decisions from so-provided information. Combining the technologies
    and methodologies will allow wine growers to improve and optimize production systems
    by taking into account technical and economic aspects of management as well as
    environmental issues at an intra-parcel (sub-block) level [21]. SECTION II. Materials
    and Methods A. Field Data Locality Ćemovsko field where are vineyards situated,
    belong to Podgorica subregion. This subregion is characterized by a Mediterranean
    climate, modified by the influence of lateral high mountains. It covers 2.300
    ha with around 11.5 million grapevines. The intensity of insolation at the site
    of Cemovsko field is very favorable for the growth of vines, with an average duration
    of sunshine around 2506 hours per year, and around 1793.9 hours during the growing
    season. Extremely low and high temperatures which would cause damage to the vines
    and thus hinder its cultivation do not appear. During the winter months the temperature
    rarely reaches −7°C and 39.2°C in summer. Annual precipitation is around 1482
    mm. Disposition of annual rainfall is quite unfavorable. During the growing season
    around 42% or 626.5 mm of rainfall fall, while for the three hottest months (June,
    July, and August) fall around 111 mm, what is 7.4% of total annual rainfall. Dynamic
    movement i.e. winds are most intense from the north direction, with a share of
    23%. Climatic conditions for growing vines in Cemovsko field are favorable, except
    for the annual distribution of rainfall, which is uneven, especially in the summer
    when the requirements of the vines are increased, especially at the stage of development
    of green berries. In the period of berries growth, when the vine has the largest
    need for water, there is a deficit of rainfall. Therefore, successful viticulture
    at Ćemovsko field can not be achieved without the use of irrigation. The soil
    of Ćemovsko field is formed at the conglomerate of fluvioglacial sediments. The
    sediments consist mainly of lime or dolomite stone, gravel and sand. The land
    is characterized by a high content of the skeleton. The content of the skeleton
    over the entire depth of the profile up to the depth of 130 cm is 80% and the
    fraction smaller than 2 mm (small land) is 20%. The highest content of the skeleton
    consists of particles of diameter 0.5–2 cm. It is a high content of skelet of
    2–5 cm in diameter, and fraction of 0.2-0.5 cm is only 8%. B. Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) The advent of precision irrigation methods has played a major role
    in reducing the quantity of water required in agricultural and horticultural crops,
    but there is a need for new methods of automated and accurate irrigation scheduling
    and control. The early adopters found precision agriculture to be unprofitable
    and the instances in which it was implemented were few and far between. Further,
    the high initial investment in the form of electronic equipment for sensing and
    communication meant that only large farms could afford it. The technologies used
    are Remote Sensing (RS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographical Information
    System (GIS) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Wireless sensor networks is a
    network of small sensing devices known as sensor nodes or motes, arranged in a
    distributed manner, which collaborate with each other to gather, process and communicate
    over wireless channel about some physical phenomena. The sensor motes are typically
    low-power consumption, low cost, water''s waste reduced, manpower reduced and
    reliable data communication between sensors nodes. Low-power consumption: the
    main challenge is to design a low-power hardware component. Thus, the overall
    system should take into account the power consumption which should be minimized
    as much possible as it can be at every block of the system design. Moreover, the
    system uses a battery that requires low-power consumption. It provides a service
    life of several weeks. Low cost: since there is a large number of nodes and because
    application is oriented to agriculture, nodes must be as cheap as possible. The
    easy deployment and low maintenance cost make WSNs a cost effective solution for
    monitoring. WSNs are designed to run unattended for years, thus, greatly reducing
    human resources for maintenance and repairing. Moreover, wireless modules do not
    need any cable to work. Water''s waste reduced: to have an effective irrigation
    system it is necessary to obtain as much water to the plants, or into the soil,
    as possible. It may seem easy to do, but in fact, water loss from these systems
    can be up to 50% because of the evaporation cycle. On hot and sunny days, a good
    portion of water may never make it to the ground. Therefore the irrigation system
    should be able to detect when the plants are in need for water to open valves
    for irrigation. Manpower reduced: it reduces effectively manpower requirement.
    Farmer can remotely control his system without going to his farm. The irrigation
    is automatically released by opening and closing the valve without the intervention
    of the farmer. Sensor nodes are small in size and weight and require no wiring
    which means that they are easy to install in most locations and applications.
    Low data rate: for the transmission of sensor data, it is not necessary high-transmission
    rates. A few kilobits per second will be sufficient. This also enables lower-power
    consumption and lower bit error rate while transmitting. The use of this device
    will not only reduce the overall monitoring system cost in terms of labor cost,
    but also provides flexibility in terms of distance or location. Lower bit rate
    means lower transmission errors therefor larger transmission distance [22]. C.
    Node Deployment and Network Architecture In collaboration with DunavNET company,
    LoRa devices for monitoring soil moisture (Figure 1, Figure 2) were installed
    at the 20 different fields in the vineyard, covering 20 grape varieties (Figure
    3). Devices are energy independent, each equipped with solar panel. Soil moisture
    sensors were placed at two depths, 25 and 50 cm, for measuring soil moisture at
    the root zone. Figure 1. Node with solar panel installed in the vineyard Show
    All Figure 2. Sensor node with moisture measurement Show All Figure 3. Installed
    devices in the vineyard Show All Measurements are made every 5 minutes and send
    the average value every 15–30 minutes. All devices are connected to the LoRa network
    established at the Cemovsko field by placing one LoRa gateway in the central part
    of the field. Communication is based on well-known LoRa protocol which operates
    on radio frequency 867–869 MHz. An antenna is 4 DB so that devices in 3 km of
    diameter can send the measurements. For internet connectivity, GSM router is used,
    able to provide internet connection through two different GSM networks. Measurements
    sent from devices to LoRa gateway are transferred to LoRa server, Lora adapter,
    Azure IoT hub and finely to agroNET platform that uses Microsoft Azure as an underlying
    platform. In Figure 4, it is shown the architecture of implemented system. Figure
    4. Architecture of the system Show All After device installation, field water
    capacity is defined for each field and accordingly the minimum amount of available
    water needed for the plants (Figure 5). Figure 5. Defined field water capacity
    and threshold for each field Show All Data visualization is available at agroNET
    platform (Figure 6). Figure 6. Data visualization Show All According to captured
    data and digitized expert modules the irrigation instruction for irrigation is
    created providing information when to irrigate and how much water to use (Figure
    7). Instruction is created according to soil moisture measurements, current vegetation
    period, soil characteristics and weather forecast. Through the mobile and web
    application we can get instructions whether the grapevine needs water and in which
    quantity. Figure 7. Irrigation recipe Show All At each micro locality (according
    to variation in soil and clime) where devices were installed for precision viticulture,
    the value of the field moisture capacity (FMC) and the limit value of soil humidity
    for each device as well as the lento capillary humidity (LCH) were determined,
    which is 65% of the field water capacity. SECTION III. Results and Discussion
    The current irrigation practice is based on experience and visual inspection of
    the vineyard. Based on this, the plants are irrigated every fifth day thus providing
    50 litters of water. However, this doesn''t consider different mechanical soil''
    composition and accordingly specific water need resulting in over or under irrigation.
    In case of under irrigation, the plants are suffering due to water stress. On
    the other side, over irrigation results in soil degradation. By implementing the
    system for irrigation optimization, different water needs as well as different
    water constant are demonstrating through the Čemovsko field. Field water capacity
    comes in the range of 19,4% (Bunar 12, variety Kratosija) and 32,8% (Pista, variety
    Kratosija) while lento capillary water that indicates the minimum soil moisture
    for each field comes in the range of 12,6% and 21,3%. Throughout 2018 it was shown
    that irrigation at most of the fields was done before it was really needed as
    at the time when irrigation was done there were enough available water for the
    plants. At the micro-location Pista (Kratošija variety) the limit value of soil
    moisture is 23.2%, while at the micro-location Dinoš (Petit Verdot variety) limit
    value 17.9% (lower for 5.3%). The obtained results indicate evident differences
    in water demand at these two localities. At the micro-locality Dinoš it is necessary
    to add about 30% less water than it is needed at the micro-locality Pista. Monitoring
    data on the web application we have created an insight into the moisture movement
    of soil and the needs of the vineyard for irrigation. At Bunar 17 part of the
    field, for different grape varieties, soil moisture trend was very similar. During
    July and August, irrigation was done at the 5 days interval but according to measured
    data, it was shown that irrigation was done earlier than it was necessary. Figure
    8. Moisture trend in the soil of some structure, to the different variety Show
    All On certain micro locations we reduced the irrigation for the harvest period
    in order to accumulate high content of sugar in grape. SECTION IV. Conclusion
    In the past 50 years, world agriculture has experienced enormous changes. Industrialized
    countries have created a modernized agricultural system with high productivity
    and advanced technology. Rapid socio-economic changes in some developing countries
    are creating new opportunities for application of precision agriculture [3]. Given
    the fact that the company ‘13. jul Plantaže’ its production of grapes and wine
    mostly based on autochthonous grapevine varieties, primarily on Vranac variety,
    with this practice the needs and requirements of Vranac variety for water and
    nutrients in different phenological stages of its growth and development in Cemovsko
    field will be recognized. The introduction of this technology in viticulture and
    wine production of our company and also in the viticulture and winemaking sector
    in Montenegro, will cause the rapid economic development, more and better use
    of resources, competitive and cost-effective production, better knowledge of agrobiological
    and oenological potential of grapevine, better quality of grapes and wines with
    the protection and preservation of the environment. Bearing in mind the issue
    of climate change is increasingly prominent, for now, it is not yet possible to
    use an automatic irrigation method. However, by combining the received data from
    sensors, climate and soil data, knowledge of the requirements and the physiology
    of the vine, we have the ability to make the decision when it is necessary to
    start irrigation to reap the benefits of precision irrigation. Precision irrigation
    system with robust components such as, sensing agricultural parameters, identification
    of sensing location and data gathering, transferring data from crop field to control
    station for decision making and actuation and control decision based on sensed
    data will find application in future agriculture [3]. To complete the control
    of a whole farm, we will try to implements this nodes and other methods of precision
    agriculture using wireless sensor netrwork in the entire production (vineyards,
    fruit collections, machinery, protection). Authors Figures References Citations

  description: Adequate and real-time monitoring of water stress is critical to enhance
    productivity, crop quality, as well as water use efficiency. This study contributes
    to the new approach of precise and rapid estimation of real-time water stress
    using thermal images taken with an Unmanned aerial vehicle. Different physiological
    parameters stomatal conductance (gs), leaf area, and ground reality parameter
    (Tc) were calculated between 11.30 and 13.30 (Chinese standard time) on sampling
    day. The volumetric water content (θ, m3 m-3) of the soil at different depths
    of (20, 40, and 60 cm) was measured. Data processing steps were implemented in
    MATLAB for thermal images to calculate the canopy temperature T1. Empirical (CWSIe)
    and statistical (CWSIs) methods of CWSI were applied for model calibration. Results
    showed that different spectral indices (TCARI, NDVI, OSAVI TCARI/OSAVI) had a
    high correlation with stomatal conductance (gs) (R2 = 0.590) and transpiration
    rate (tr) (R2 = 0.602) as compared to CWSIe and CWSIs. Volumetric water content
    (θ) and CWSIsi have a high correlation coefficient (0.872). However, the transpiration
    rate shows a week correlation with spectral indices (TCARI, NDVI, OSAVI, and TCARI/OSAVI)
    as compared with CWSI. The plotted high-resolution map shows the distribution
    of water stress in different irrigation treatments and potentially applied in
    precision irrigation management.

  description: The growth process of fruit trees is accompanied by a large number
    of monitoring and management activities, such as pruning, irrigation, fertilization,
    spraying, and harvesting, which are labour intensive and time consuming. In the
    context of precision agriculture, automation and precision orchard management
    not only saves labour resources and increases the income of growers, but also
    has great significance in improving resource utilization. Recent technological
    developments enable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, also commonly referred to
    as Unmanned Aerial Systems, or 'drones') to become an efficient monitoring tool
    for improving orchard management, that can provide growers much more detailed
    and precise information about fruit crops health status, geometric variables,
    physiological variables etc. This paper reviews the use of UAVs in orchard management,
    with a focus on recent UAV applications, synthetically describing the existing
    situation (e.g., general data processing approaches, sensing platform and sensor
    uploaded). The challenges and prospects of UAVs opportunities in orchard management
    are also summarized.

    spraying, and harvesting, which are labour intensive and time consuming. In the
    context of precision agriculture, automation and precision orchard management
    not only saves labour resources and increases the income of growers, but also
    has great significance in improving resource utilization. Recent technological
    developments enable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, also commonly referred to
    as Unmanned Aerial Systems, or ‘drones’) to become an efficient monitoring tool
    for improving orchard management, that can provide growers much more detailed
    and precise information about fruit crops health status, geometric variables,
    physiological variables etc. This paper reviews the use of UAVs in orchard management,
    with a focus on recent UAV applications, synthetically describing the existing
    situation (e.g., general data processing approaches, sensing platform and sensor
    uploaded). The challenges and prospects of UAVs opportunities in orchard management
    are also summarized. How to cite. Zhang, C., Valente, J., Kooistra, L., Guo, L.,

  description: Underutilization of methods and means of remote sensing of the Earth
    significantly limits the capabilities of precision agriculture and irrigation
    novel technologies. The paper presents a survey of actual research areas in this
    field and certain results obtained by Space Research Institute, Agrophysical Research
    Institute, Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, AllRussian Research Institute
    of Plant Protection and other institutions, also published in this special issue
    of Sovremennye problemy distantsionnogo zondirovaniya Zemli iz kosmosa. The survey
    clearly shows that satellite data can improve the quality and scope of information
    support of agriculture today. In recent decades, there has actually been a revolution
    in this area due to the appearance of new highquality Earth observation systems,
    data access policy improvement and development of new information technologies
    for remote sensing data processing, analysis and application. The paper presents
    a possible organizational chart of system research on development and implementation
    of new methods and technologies of Earth sensing data application in precision
    agriculture and irrigation. It is noted that a fundamentally new methodological,
    physicoengineering and experimental framework is required for precision agriculture
    and irrigation systems development. Also the contribution of associated remote
    and insitu researches on obtaining the reference information, development and
    improvement of regulatory framework of precision agriculture technologies and
    their approbation in the field in specific test areas is highlighted. It is noted
    that both basic procedural and technological frameworks for system research on
    Earth remote sensing data application for various agriculture tasks, primarily
    for the development of modern precision agriculture and irrigation technologies,
    exist in Russia at the present moment.

    event processing 1. Introduction Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) is having
    great success in many areas, allowing computers to see, hear and detect parameters
    of the world (Qin et al., 2016). The number of connected devices is increasing,
    and according to CISCO, it is projected about 50 billion objects connected by
    2020 (Evans, 2011). Morgan Stanley; however, forecasts that by the end of 2020,
    around 75 million objects will be connected (Rose et al., 2015). On the other
    hand, Huawei (2015) projects that there will be 100 billion of IoT devices installed,
    connected, and autonomously managed by 2025. IoT is based on a system of interconnecting
    heterogeneous devices to the Internet; these devices have a unique identity, physical
    attributes, virtual personality, and use intelligent communication interfaces
    to transfer data to the network without human interaction (Vermesan and Friess,
    2015). The devices constitute Sensor Networks and Wireless Actuators (WSN or WSAN)
    and at the same time, they are connected through a Gateway to a larger technological
    infrastructure such as a data center or cloud computing which is responsible for
    the storage, processing, analysis, and other data management processes. IoT has
    several fields of application such as Healthcare, Logistics; Manufacturing, Smart
    Home; Smart Cities, Precision Agriculture (PA); among others. In the case of PA,
    it consists of crop integration or farm management that combines information technology
    with rational agricultural industries and tries to provide quantities and types
    of supplies based on the real needs of a crop (Far and Rezaei-Moghaddam, 2017).
    In the context of IoT, raw data obtained from sensors and transmitted to a Cloud
    Computing is abundant, reaching high speeds in real time or near real-time; consequently,
    the task of monitoring and controlling WSN devices becomes complex and almost
    impossible to carry out by humans. It is for this reason that the need for a Complex
    Event Processor (CEP) appeared. There are several CEP tools for IoT. For example
    Google offers its Real Time Stream Processing for IOT tool (Google Cloud Platform,
    2017) that deals with probabilistic events that are stored and processed by machine
    learning techniques to predict patterns. There is also WSO2 (WSO2, 2017), consisting
    of the CEP and BRS components; the CEP component identifies significant events
    and patterns of multiple data sources, analyzes their impact and generates real-time
    alerts; while BRS manages business rules. Companies like Microsoft, IBM, AWS,
    Oracle and others, also offer similar tools. In the scientific community there
    are several proposals such as: An intrusion detection systems (IDS) architecture
    based on the mechanism of event processing in IoT environments for real-time data
    computing (Jun and Chi, 2014). Bruns et al. (2015) show how CEP can be used as
    the key technology for intelligent M2M systems. Another example is a rule engine
    for smart buildings that guarantees real-time response and quick match between
    events and rules (Sun et al., 2015). Zhou et al. (2017) raised the following:
    Knowledge-infused and consistent CEP over real-time and persistent streams; a
    semantic CEP model (x-CEP) is introduced to query across real-time and persistent
    streams applied to case studies from Smart Grid. Akbar et al. (2017) worked an
    architecture which exploits historical data using machine learning for prediction
    in conjunction with CEP for Complex IoT Data Streams. Gökalp et al. (2018) proposed
    a visual programming framework for distributed Internet of Things centric complex
    event processing to users who have limited or no experience in these technologies.
    After reviewing related works and software tools according to the topic discussed,
    although there are several options of RE and CEP for IOT, they are partial solutions
    still which are complex to develop, integrate and deployment; it requires a specialist
    in IoT and PA to take it to the actual applications. In addition, some of these
    tools are expensive and inaccessible to farmers in a developing country such as
    Ecuador. Another difficulty is the demands to process large data-events in IoT,
    the existing options require high-performance hardware or monthly payments for
    cloud service; or simply, they don''t adjust to the needs of Precision Agriculture
    and Internet of Things applications. In the context of PA-IoT, the work proposed
    by Kamilaris et al. (2017), it is a semantic framework for IoT, based on smart
    farming applications, which support reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor
    data streams in real-time and it can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams.
    This work focuses only on rule design and detection of event patterns, but does
    not integrate prescriptive analysis, i.e. it does not make decisions. This work
    proposes a kind of architecture for the automatic management of structured decisions
    generated in Precision Agriculture applications that use telemetry technologies
    and control of systems based on Internet of Things. For example the following:
    irrigation systems in crops, fertigation or plant nutrition; disease or pest control,
    animal monitoring; agricultural robots, machinery, greenhouses, etc. This architecture
    has been called “RECEP” because it integrates two Rules Engine components (RE)
    and Complex Event Processor (CEP); the contributions made are described in greater
    detail below: A. The design of the RECEP architecture in order to facilitate user
    tasks that manage, monitor and control the processes of systems based on IoT as
    a multi-tenant SaaS service model. For example, software as a service for agricultural
    enterprises is organized in one or more plots. The implementation of RECEP intends
    to automate the complexity of raw data processing in WSN and manage the dynamism
    of the structured decisions to be generated. The architecture consists of two
    components: (1) RE that manages event models, decision rules models, configuration
    of control actions, alerts and notifications that are sent to applications or
    users; and (2) CEP is conceived to work as a service in the background performing
    tasks in parallel and in real time; its function is to process incoming events,
    and complete rules with data flows (from WSN, internal databases, external data
    such as web services), evaluate real-time rules and make decisions involving output
    events. B. The proposed architecture has been verified in two ways: (1) Trough
    a use case focused on the monitoring and control of an irrigation system of a
    banana plot located on an experimental farm belonging to the Technical University
    of Machala (UTMACH) in Ecuador. RECEP was designed, built and integrated as a
    subsystem in the IoTMach platform that is an IoT platform created by the AutoMathTIC
    research group of UTMACH. And (2) by running functionality and performance tests
    considering the use of computational resources, carried out with raw data taken
    from the experimental banana farm and also generated by a simulator to evaluate
    large data flows at high speeds. This paper is organized in the following aspects:
    related work, proposed RECEP architecture and its components; use case of the
    architecture in a monitoring and irrigation control system for a banana plot,
    evaluation and presentation of results, discussion and conclusions. 2. Related
    work 2.1. Internet of Things and Precision Agriculture Precision Agriculture (PA)
    combines diverse Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for process
    and data management in an agricultural production system, allowing it to increase
    efficiency and productivity, applying a scientific approach during all phases
    of the production cycle of plants and animals. Data that can be collected or generated
    with ICTs (Bendre et al., 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017) can be obtained from: field
    (physical-chemical soil characteristics, topography, productivity data), climate,
    interpretation of camera or satellite images (space and/or temporal variability
    of the crop), yield maps, maps with input application prescriptions, historical
    data, other internal or external data. The integration and analysis of this data
    can be used to generate automatic decisions (structured decisions that are executed
    in devices, robots or machinery) or to support human decisions (semi-structured
    decisions). PA and IoT have the purpose to optimize resources (energy, water,
    fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) in order to produce more food with less effort,
    costs and environmental impact; all this in order to help farmers achieve higher
    productivity, economic benefits, greater sustainability and environmental protection
    (Ojha et al., 2015, Ray, 2017). PA and IOT technologies have the challenge of
    optimizing agricultural work, automating processes such as: precision soil preparation,
    precision seeding, automatic irrigation, precision crop management, greenhouse
    management, phenotype measurement, integrated pest management, precision harvesting,
    data analysis and evaluation (Greenwood et al., 2014, Juul et al., 2015, Minet
    et al., 2017, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Ojha et al., 2015, Srbinovska et al.,
    2015, Talavera et al., 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). To monitor and control these
    processes, a variety of technologies have been created and applied such as: drones
    for field monitoring, machines and robots for routine operations; sensors and
    remote sensing, high precision positioning systems; Geomapping, automated information
    systems; variable rate technology (VRT), integrated electronic communications;
    cloud computing, mobile and fixed computing devices, data storage; big data, data
    science, etc. (Kaloxylos et al., 2013, Ray, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In all
    IoT domains (Smart Cities, Smart Home, Smart Buildings, Precision Agriculture,
    etc.), the connection of new devices (motes grouping sensors and/or actuators)
    to several WSNs is increasing each time, and through a IoT Gateway (Hernández-Rojas
    et al., 2018c) and the Internet, they are integrated into a cloud computing system
    that captures, stores, and processes data streams from a variety of sources. Depending
    on the number of devices and sensors and the frequency of data reading, the transport
    of raw data can be increased in volume and reach high speed (Zhou et al., 2017),
    generating inconveniences such as unpredictable latency, bottlenecks, incomplete
    or erroneous data, storage and processing difficulties, among other problems (Hao
    et al., 2017); more efficient processing systems are needed to deal with dynamic
    and diverse data, complex events and automation of decisions. Such systems are
    known as Complex Event Processor (CEP). 2.2. Complex Event Processor (CEP) CEP
    is a technology that allows processing, analyze and correlate large amounts of
    heterogeneous data in the form of events to detect patterns with direct implications
    in making decisions relevant to a particular domain (Boubeta, 2014). According
    Wang et al. (2018), CEP interprets and combines flows of primitive events, captured
    in most cases in real time, to identify composite events of higher level, known
    as event patterns or complex events. In addition, a CEP allows the processing
    of data flows from multiple data sources (Akila et al., 2016) and interprets a
    set of rules written in an ad hoc language for defining rules (Cugola and Margara,
    2012). The CEP has a direct communication with a Rules Engine (RE), data server,
    communication protocols, notification server and other services and applications
    internal or external to the cloud (Wang et al., 2011). A CEP is reactive if it
    processes a complex pattern of events and generates automatic decisions, such
    as: sending control actions to devices, triggering alerts and sending notifications
    to applications and end users (Cugola et al., 2014, Wang and Cao, 2014, Zappia
    et al., 2011, Zhou et al., 2017). A CEP is considered proactive, predictive or
    probabilistic if it applies Machine Learning algorithms or data mining techniques
    to predict new events or generate trends (Akbar et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018,
    Wang and Cao, 2014). In Table 1 some important milestones of the CEPs can be observed
    (Dayarathna and Perera, 2018, Luckham, 2007, Wang et al., 2016). Table 1. Evolution

    Analysis (data mining, machine learning and other techniques). Big data stream
    processing from multiple sources and identifying patterns to generate a real-time
    response CEP uses and Benefits. The cases of application of a CEP are focused
    on areas where it is essential to process large amounts of information that flow
    from outside the system; and, it is necessary to respond immediately with new
    complex events according to the pattern that has been triggered. A CEP has been
    applied in the continuous analysis of stocks to detect trends, supervision of
    business processes (Mayer et al., 2015), fraud detection in financial services,
    operational business intelligence, air traffic management or maritime, security
    supervision, as well as in Internet applications of Things, among other cases
    (Wang et al., 2016). Some examples of IoT domains that use a CEP are: Smart City,
    Smart Energy, Smart Manufacturing, Smart transport & logistics, Smart Health,
    Precision Agriculture, etc. CEP Architectures Several CEP architecture proposals
    have been found, these are detailed in Table 2. Table 2. Some examples of CEP
    architectures. Name Description Client-server architecture Processes and extracts
    data for separate detection and reasoning procedures, reducing network consumption

    event streams incorporating χ-CEP event and query models. It consists of three
    parts: the real-time query engine, the semantic archive subsystem, and the query
    planner (Ding et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2017) Proactive CEP A proactive CEP method
    is proposed for large-scale transportation IoT, based on a multilayered adaptive
    dynamic Bayesian model (Wang and Cao, 2014) Architecture: Real-Time Stream Processing

    and handles the processing, storage and analysis of data from hundreds of millions
    of events/hour (Google Cloud Platform, 2017) Context-Aware Stream Processing for
    Distributed IoT applications Approach based on the automatic, unsupervised learning
    method to group the underlying data into different events (Akbar et al., 2016)
    CEP platforms and solutions. There are some open sources and commercial CEP platforms
    to consider, the most popular ones are described in Table 3. Table 3. Some popular
    CEP solutions. Product Description Apache Flink An open-source stream processing
    framework for distributed, high-performing, always-available, and accurate data
    streaming applications (Apache Flink, 2017) WSO2 CEP Identifies events and patterns
    from multiple data sources, analyzes their impacts, and acts on them in real time
    (WSO2, 2018) Stream Analytics (Microsoft Azure) Develop and run massively parallel
    real-time analytics on multiple IoT or non-IoT streams of data using simple SQL
    like language (Microsoft Azure, 2017) Amazon Kinesis Data Streams It collects,
    processes, and analyzes real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights
    and react to new events (Amazon, 2018a) IBM InfoSphere Streams A real-time analytics
    solution with development environment, runtime and analytic toolkits (Sakr, 2013)
    CEP challenges in the context of IoT - Traditional CEP is very much limited to
    the processing of queries on relational data; however, IoT requires the processing
    of data from multiple sources and formats (Zhou et al., 2017). - For Predictive
    Analytics, is necessary to correlate raw data - present and historical events
    (Zhou et al., 2017). - IoT devices and applications generate massive, real-time
    data that must be processed at high speed (Wang and Cao, 2014). - In IoT applications,
    a CEP must capture events with some level of latency due to the integration of
    devices and applications from different networks (WSN, WAN, LAN) (Mayer et al.,
    2015). 2.3. Rules Engine (RE) A rule engine is a component that allows you to
    create or modify business logic in a Business Process Management (BPM) system
    (Sun et al., 2015). RE provides rule models for a CEP to perform its function;
    through a user interface, it manages complex structures of simple and nested rules
    that involve arithmetic-logical operators and relational data or other content
    depending on their application. There are several RE platforms that allow us to
    easily get a rule engine. Table 4 shows some known options. Table 4. Rules engine
    platforms. Product Description Drools (JBoss) Drools is a business rules management
    system (BRMS) solution. Provides a core Business Rules Engine (BRE), a rule management
    and web creation application (Drools Workbench) and an Eclipse IDE plugin for
    core development (RedHat, 2006) WSO2 BRS It is a Business Rules Management System
    (BRMS) that provides the ability to define, implement, monitor and maintain an
    organization''s business decisions and expose them as Web services (WSO2, 2017)
    Rules for AWS IoT Enables devices to interact with AWS services. Rules are analyzed
    and actions are performed based on the flow of MQTT topics. (Amazon, 2018b) 3.
    The proposed architecture for the management of a Rules Engine and Complex Event
    Processor in the context of Internet of Things for Precision Agriculture (RECEP)
    There are several reasons that justify the decision to propose this new architecture
    called RECEP. The purpose of this architecture to respond to the challenge of
    processing large data flows (throughput events/s) that arrive at high speed in
    real time or almost in real time from several WSN. The use case for which the
    architecture was focused is for precision agriculture applications and the Internet
    of things. Another challenge addressed is the use of minimal computational resources
    (CPU and RAM usage) in the CEP and therefore lower costs. In addition, a rules
    engine (RE) with an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface was designed to create
    rule models and establish complex event patterns that generate actuator control
    actions and notifications to users in PA-IOT applications. It is designed for
    users without knowledge of query or programming languages. The RECEP architecture

    full-size image Fig. 1. RECEP Architecture. The RECEP architecture is organized
    by the following components: (1) Gathering Data-Flow (GDF), (2) Rules engine (RE),
    and (3) Complex Event Processor (CEP). Each component is described below: Gathering
    data-flow (GDF). This component corresponds to the source data that can be obtained
    from different sources: WSN, internal databases (agricultural company, plots;
    crops, soil types; irrigation system, configuration of IoT domains; WSN, devices
    or nodes with their respective sensors and actuators), web services or external
    databases that provide data such as meteorological information, production quotas
    or expected yields of a crop, etc. This component is located at the primary level
    (sensor level) of the IoTMach telemetry system, developed by the AutoMathTIC research
    group of the UTMACH. RECEP is also part of that system, located instead at the
    highest level (application level) and hosted on the servers of IoTMach. Therefore,
    RECEP takes advantage of all current benefits in this telemetry system, developed
    by the authors in previous works. One of the featured features that GDF incorporates
    is the Plug-and-play Human-centered Virtual Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (VTEDS)-based
    framework, which makes the GDF highly scalable, allowing unlimited new nodes to
    be added to the system dynamically through plug-and-play mechanisms. This framework
    is based on the IEEE 21451 VTEDS, which enable the interoperability of various
    intelligent sensors with different communication interfaces. A detailed explanation
    of this architecture and principle of operation of the plug-and-play mechanisms
    used are described in (Hernández-Rojas et al., 2018a). In addition, the sensor
    nodes make use of a Lightweight Protocols for Sensors (LP4S) family of sub-protocols
    (LP4S-6, LP4S-X, and LP4-J) that allow sensors to self-describe, auto-calibrate,
    and auto-register. With the use of these protocols, an IoT solution with low latency,
    low power consumption and quality of service (QoS) are guaranteed. More details
    on the LP4S family can be found in (Hernández-Rojas et al., 2018b). Rules engine
    (RE). This component is the graphical interface to interact with the user; it
    allows the management of events, rules, actions, alerts, and notifications. It
    is composed of the following subcomponents: – Event Engine. It is the integrator
    subcomponent in charge of event management. An event consists of: rules, control
    actions for actuators, alerts and notifications to users. The RE sends a message
    to the CEP to update the models of events and rules loaded in memory. – Rules.
    This module is designed to create, edit or delete rule patterns considering the
    data sources, actions and notification associated when the rule is fulfilled.
    A rule is composed of source data (input variables) and mathematical operators
    (arithmetic, logical, relational, etc.). A rule may also contain nested rules.
    Typical input variables are the sensor data, which are often contaminated with
    noise from the signal, the medium or elements of the data acquisition system.
    These noises must be treated at the level of the sensor node, incorporating active
    or passive filters by software or hardware depending on the smart transducer used.
    Techniques of averaging several sampled data and sending this data only when the
    value varies one percent (predefined) difference with the previous measurement
    are commonly used by IoT developers. When the noise is well characterized, a hysteresis
    can be incorporated into the rules, thus avoiding undesired oscillations in the
    output variables (actions). In the next versions of our system, the hysteresis
    management will be added in the rules editor. However, the current graphical interface
    allows us to demonstrate the functionality of our proposal. – Actions. This module
    is designed to create, edit or delete control actions that must be executed on
    analog or digital actuators (electrovalve, motor, hydraulic bomb, etc.). Actions
    are classified as: automatic (running when a rule is fulfilled), repetitive (running
    a number of times every certain time) and planned (running every certain time
    during a period of time). – Notifications. To configure alerts and messages for
    users and/or applications. Messages can be displayed in the RE log and sent via
    email, SMS or other means. – Storage of rules and events. Module that allows you
    to store rules and events in a database with their respective action and notification
    settings. Complex Event Processor (CEP). It is in charge of completing the rules
    created in the RE, fusing them with the data streams collected through GDF; if
    any rule is completed with the source data, it is automatically evaluated and
    if it is fulfilled, the associated events are triggered. The CEP is designed to
    work with a configurable time window consisting of a very small waiting period
    (ms) to re-analyze all rules with the source data, distributing the thread processing
    (parallel processing). The sub-components are described below: Protocol adapter.
    Used as a communication protocol, it is responsible for sending and receiving
    messages (reading data or control actions) between cloud computing, gateway and
    WSN. This module is based on an MQTT messaging broker. In our case, we use the
    Mosquito (Eclipse Mosquitto, 2018) open broker. This module is of vital importance
    in the operation of the entire IoT telemetry system, of which RECEP is part. MQTT
    (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard based on pub/sub messaging
    mechanism (publish/subscribe), designed for remote connections in constraining
    sensor nodes with reduced memory capacity. Among many advantages MQTT allows the
    use of different manufacturers and technologies of gateways and sensor nodes of
    the WSN, for this they must only incorporate in their firmware MQTT clients. An
    intrinsic feature of this protocol is the three levels of quality of service (QoS)
    it includes. These are QoS 0, QoS 1 and QoS 2, which allow delivery to message
    at most once (fire and forget), delivery at least once (acknowledged delivery)
    and delivery exactly once (assured delivery) respectively. The WSN-IoT typically
    consists of low resource devices and power constraint, exposed to failures, shutdowns,
    and disconnections continuously. In these cases, it is recommended to implement
    clients with QoS 1 or QoS 2 with a persistent session, which allows for saving
    all relevant information for the sensor node on the broker. Thus, this feature
    allows achieving a robust and stable system against this type of failure. An excellent
    starting point for the study of MQTT, QoS and persistent session can be found
    in (HiveMQ, 2018). – Data Streaming. Manages the transfer of data readings (real
    time or intermittently) from IoT devices or sensor nodes (Arduino, Raspberry Pi,
    Waspmote, Beaglebond, etc.) and arrive through an IoT Gateway to the Protocol
    Adapter located in the cloud. This sub-component also performs the function of
    a log management system, designed for data transfer at high speeds and large volumes;
    that is, the data is stored temporarily until it is processed. For the storage
    of large volumes of data that arrive at high speed in real time, the use of Apache
    Kafka is proposed. Kafka is a Distributed Messaging System for Log Processing
    (Apache S. F., 2017, Díaz et al., 2016), tested and used by many companies for
    data streams and distributed storage. – Data Collector. It is in charge of capturing
    the source data that generates input events and it is necessary to complete the
    rule patterns created in the RE. Source data can be collected from different sources:
    IoT devices that are part of a WSN, IoT Gateway, internal or external databases;
    they can be in a variety of formats: structured or relational and semi-structured
    (JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, CSV: comma-separated values, etc.); in addition,
    they can arrive in large volumes, at high speeds, in real time or near real time.
    – Event Extraction. It updates the event models in main memory, as long as you
    receive a RE message stating that a change has been made to the rule models. –
    Event matching. This sub-component, when input events have been generated, is
    in charge of fusing the values of the preconfigured source data with the rule
    patterns and verifying whether any rules have been completed; if this happens,
    it automatically invokes Maker Decision to evaluate the rule. Rule processing
    is designed to run on several tasks in parallel (multi-threaded execution) and
    work with a very small configurable time window (ms) waiting, before repeating
    the rule checking process again. – Decision maker (DM). It manages output events
    through automatic control actions. It is in charge of evaluating a rule; if all
    its conditions are fulfilled, it performs a prescriptive analysis generating the
    most appropriate decisions in exit events and transferring the order to the Actions
    Dispatcher. The rules formed with sensor data as input, are always evaluated with
    the information available in the database. In case, that the sensor node associated
    to the input of the rule is failing or simply is in sleep mode, simply the rule
    is not evaluated until said sensor can update said input. – Actions dispatcher.
    It manages control actions such as packets pending shipment and even has a history
    of actions already executed for a period of time. When you receive the DM order,
    it automatically sends the respective control action to an IoT device in the WSN
    to change the status of an actuator (ON, OFF or other value depending on the type
    of actuator). It also dispatches repetitive and planned actions that are not dependent
    on DM. At the same time that control actions are dispatched, the Alerts Dispatcher
    is also activated if the case calls for it. When an action is directed towards
    constraining sensor nodes, these may be damaged or just in sleep mode. In these
    cases, if the node was programmed with a QoS 1 or 2 client with a persistent session,
    the action must be executed regardless of the moment that occurs. Then when the
    node is active again, it will receive the respective order. In the case of QoS
    0 clients, the dispatcher will retry the order three times and then it will be
    eliminated, to prevent the action from occurring outside the time defined for
    the given application domain. – Alerts dispatcher. It manages the activation process
    - sending alerts and notification to users and/or applications by email or other
    means. The interaction between each component and the way they communicate with
    each other is shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (279KB) Download

    component For this case, message interchange format based on subprotocol Lightweight
    Protocol for Sensor - Json (LP4S-J) was used between the IoT Gateway and the CEP
    as shown in Fig. 3. A data flow (raw data) sent by a IoT device and transmitted
    through a gateway to the CEP, is identified by “package_id”, “MAC” is the physical
    address of the device that sends the data flow, “interface” is the pin where a
    sensor (in) or actuator (out) is connected; the interfaces are of various types:
    “ind” = digital input, “ina” = analog input, “outa” = analog output, “outd” = digital
    output and “date” is the date and time of the reading. Download : Download high-res

    Rules management. An example of how the CEP reads a rule is shown in Fig. 7. The
    rule is made of input variables (sensors id/actuators: x1,:x2,:y1,:y2), comparison
    operators (==, >, <), logical operators (and, or, not) for sub-rules, values with
    which they are compared (0, 10, 20, 1), the symbol “->” denotes “then”, the expected
    decision is written down below, that is, A1 is the id of the action that needs
    to be executed if the rule is fulfilled; several control actions can be placed
    in the consequent and a multi-user alert/notification. Download : Download high-res

    more complex rule can integrate data collections where it is possible to apply
    aggregation functions (minimum, maximum, average, etc.). For example, to average
    the values generated by two or more humidity sensors installed at different depth
    levels in the same irrigation area or plant. It is also possible to add new variables
    resulting from a custom mathematical expression that generates a calculated data;
    for example, the percentage applied to a simple input variable. Management of
    control actions, alerts and notifications. If a rule is fulfilled, actuator control
    actions, alert and notification messages for users to be sent by email are configured.
    The CEP component It runs as a background service and is responsible for processing
    events that integrate rules, control actions and alerts/notifications. The events
    are loaded into RAM memory and a configurable runtime time window (tw) is used,
    which by default was set to 100 ms, and it represents the waiting time before
    fusing the rules with the source data again; once the rules are completed, it
    proceeds to evaluate them and then automatically generates the decision of which
    action, alert or notification to execute. 5. Experiments This section describes
    the first case study to which the proposed RECEP architecture has been applied.
    This case was implemented as a subsystem of the IoTMach platform that was created
    for the field of Precision Agriculture, specifically for banana cultivation in
    Ecuador. Although tested on one experimental banana field, it is designed to grow
    and support multiple companies in the Ecuadorian banana sector. 5.1. Experimental
    setup The Experimental Place was carried out at the Universidad Técnica de Machala
    (UTMACH), located in the province of El Oro, south of Ecuador, in the geographical
    coordinates: latitude 3°15′30″ S and longitude: 79°57′37″ O. 5.1.1. Materials
    and tools used for the development and implementation of the subsystems based
    on the RECEP architecture The GDF component, was worked in two scenarios: (1)
    A WSN simulator was developed in the NodeJS language to generate large volumes
    of random sensor data; then, this tool was used to simulate two WSNs, with four
    Waspmote and four Raspberry PI 3 + WIFI devices, also two IoT Gateway devices
    deployed with two Raspberry PI 3 devices (see Fig. 8). (2) A physical WSN was
    implemented in the experimental banana field located in Santa Inés farm managed
    by the public company of UTMACH with the following resources: An IoT Gateway using
    Raspberry PI 3, and sensor nodes: Arduino Mega for the solenoid valve control
    panel and tree Raspberry PI 3 for sensor nodes; one temperature sensor, 6 soil
    moisture sensors, and 8 solenoid valves. Download : Download high-res image (300KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Scenario of use case. The RE component
    was developed in the programming language Python + Framework Django and the Nginx
    web server. The CEP component was developed in the NodeJS language as a background
    service, which analyzes the events and rules, distributing the processing of events
    in tasks or threads in parallel. The MQTT Mosquitto broker was used for the sub-component
    Protocol Adapter, and Apache Kafka was used for the Data Streaming sub-component.
    The PostgreSQL database manager was used for both RE and CEP. The implementation
    of this sub-system was carried out in a virtual machine (with 1.9 GHz single-core
    CPU, 6 GB of RAM and 100 GB of Hard Disk) of the cloud computing server located
    in the Academic Unit of Civil Engineering of UTMACH. 5.2. Functionality demonstration
    using WSN simulator The following scenario was designed to obtain results: Two
    companies were created with their respective WSN, gateway and irrigation zones
    (IoTMach: Zone1 and Zone2) and (Company ABC: Zone A and Zone B); and the following
    aspects were integrated: 2 sensor nodes, 2 temperature sensors (ST1, ST2), 4 humidity
    sensors (SM1 to SM4), two solenoid valves (SV1, SV2), and two hydraulic bombs
    (B1, B2). As shown in Fig. 8 two examples of complex events that group: actions
    and alerts-notifications are shown in Fig. 9; these events were recorded in the
    RE and updated in the CEP through the Event Extraction sub-component. Download

    Examples of events designed for an automation scenario of an irrigation system.
    The CEP collected data flows (Data Collector) through the MQTT Protocol Adapter
    and the Data Streaming system with Apache Kafka. The CEP then completes the rule
    patterns stored in memory with incoming data streams coming from the WSN (Event
    Matching). If a rule is fulfilled, output events are managed via Decision Maker
    and the automatic execution of control actions (Dispatcher actions) that affect
    actuators and the sending of alerts and notifications (Dispatcher Alerts) to users.
    Fig. 9 shows two examples of event models applied in the automation of an irrigation
    system; Event1 and rule R1: if the average humidity of sensors located in Zone1
    is less than or equal to the lower irrigation limit(Oi), open the solenoid valve2,
    activate bomb2 and send a notification to the user admin informing the event,
    date and time; Event2 and rule R2 are also created: if the average humidity of
    sensors located in Zone1 is higher than the upper threshold(Os) or field capacity(cc)
    then turn off bomb2, close solenoid valve2 and notify the user admin of the event
    occurred. The Event Complex 1 configuration in RE is shown in Fig. 10, where a
    rule model is selected, then the rule associates whether it is simple or complex;
    finally, the control action and the alert/notification to be sent by email to
    the users when the rule is fulfilled are specified. In a similar way other events
    are created. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size

    Evaluation of CEP performance Some test cases were designed to verify the performance
    of the RE-CEP subsystem. The metrics that were analyzed are: – RAM Usage: The
    amount of RAM memory that the CEP consumes while it is active. – CPU Usage: The
    percentage of CPU that consumes while the CEP is active. – Throughput (# received
    events/day and #rules evaluated/day): The number of events and rules that it is
    capable of evaluating per day. Each test case is described below: (a) Test case
    1 The irrigation in the experimental banana plot was planned to be carried out
    for two hours daily, with a throughput of 1696 events/day. A total of 8478 events
    were analyzed during the evaluation period of five days. Table 5 shows the sensors
    and actuators used and the number of measurements collected per day in the experimental
    plot. Table 5. Sensors and actuators used in the experimental plot of banana.

    soil moisture sensors 12 60 720 Temperature sensor 1 60 60 Water pressure meter
    1 60 60 Actuators (Electro-valves) 8 1 8 The results obtained according to the
    use of resources and performance metrics are shown in Fig. 12. The horizontal
    reference lines red represent the average consumption of CPU (13.4%) and the used
    average of RAM (50.4 MB), when processing incoming data flows (throughput). If
    the user registers new rule models or updates an existing rule in the Rules engine
    (RE), the CEP immediately detects it and incorporates the change. This process
    of updating the monitoring scheme of both rules and incoming event flow, results
    in a slight consumption of CPU and RAM. In the graphic, the rule models are updated,
    the horizontal reference lines green represent the average CPU consumption (25.8%)
    and average RAM utilization (56.8 MB). (b) Test case 2 Download : Download high-res

    in the CEP applied in the experimental banana crop. The horizontal reference lines
    in red indicate: Avg CPU consumption (13.4%) and Avg RAM used (50.4 MB), when
    processing incoming data flows (throughput). The horizontal reference lines in
    green represent Avg CPU consumption (25.8%) and Avg utilization of RAM (56.8 MB),
    when the rules models are updated in Rule Engine (RE). In this test case, a built-in
    WSN simulator for testing was used to send several throughput (events/s), as can
    be seen in the first column of Table 6. The second column shows the events collected
    in two hours a day, which normally lasts the irrigation in banana cultivation.
    The third column corresponds to the total of events collected during a 15-day
    evaluation period. The sixth column shows the amount of Rules Evaluated/day that
    is obtained according to the CEP Windows size and Rules models. And in the last
    two columns it shows the average CPU and RAM usage in each applied throughput.

    million events/day (an approximate of 4200 events/s), considering the few computational
    resources that the VM has where it was implemented. To improve performance, 2
    cores or 4 cores CPU would suffice. Regarding the use of RAM, there is no significant
    increase compared to the 6 GB allocated to the VM. Download : Download high-res

    initial conclusions were carried out when analyzing the performance of the RECEP
    regarding CPU, RAM and Throughput usage. However, it is interesting to evaluate
    what would be the behavior of the proposed system in real scenarios of precision
    agriculture. From Fig. 15 the following expressions were extracted: (1) (2) Expressions
    (1), (2) were used to obtain the predictions shown in Table 7, where the variable
    throughput was estimated from the real results obtained in the experiments carried
    out at the Santa Inés farm, which constitutes an experimental station of banana
    production with an extension of 3.4 ha, located within the premises of the UTMACH.
    It is important to note that the product obtained from this farm is currently
    exported. Table 7. Predictive throughput (events/day) by hectares, CPU and RAM

    16 shows a performance comparison of the RECEP in different scales of banana production,
    organized according to the number of hectares planted, which in Ecuador on average,
    is a direct proportion with the volume of output obtained. Therefore, small producers
    (which is the large productive mass not only in Ecuador, but in most developing
    countries), companies or associations of small producers with more than 500 ha
    and the equivalent of several companies grouped by provinces and even the total
    production at the country level, were analyzed. In Ecuador, banana production
    is concentrated mainly in three regions, Guayas, El Oro, and Los Ríos, which by
    themselves exceed the production obtained by the rest of the provinces, as can
    be seen in Table 5. The quantity of the hectares by regions used in our analysis
    was taken from the last report issued by the National Institute of Statistics
    and Censuses of Ecuador and can be found in (INEC, 2017). Download : Download

    consumption of CPU and RAM resources by planted hectares. Two interesting findings
    were found, as can be seen in Fig. 16. The first, show that the RAM required by
    our RECEP is low, allowing even the management of events of the entire area planted
    in Ecuador (82 MB), using a modest hardware infrastructure like ours, described
    in the experimental setup section. In contrast, the necessary CPU resources vary
    depending on the throughput. A referential value of 70% of CPU usage was added
    to the figure to represent an acceptable performance limit. There, we can appreciate
    that hardware architecture similar to the one we have used in our experiments
    are sufficient to deal with experimental environments and companies of small and
    large producers. But when it is required to manage several companies, with a more
    significant number of hectares, or management at a regional or national level,
    then an upgrade of the server with more CPUs must be done. 6. Conclusions The
    Internet of Things is a technology that is making incursions in many fields and
    the agricultural field is no exception. IoT applied in Precision Agriculture,
    allows the optimization of resources and the increase of agricultural production.
    However, more and more wireless sensor networks that integrate many IoT devices
    with a variety of sensors and actuators are connecting, producing an increase
    in the transmission of large volumes of data flow and in real time; thus, the
    need to automate event processing, pattern identification and decision making
    is also growing. In this work, we propose the architecture called RECEP for the
    processing of events generated in the context of Precision Agriculture and Internet
    of Things (PA-IoT), is formed by: Rules Engine (RE) and Complex Event Processor
    (CEP). The purpose of RE is to manage event templates (rules, incoming data flows,
    control actions and alert-notifications). While the CEP carries out the task of
    fusing incoming data, at the rate it arrives, with the rules established in the
    RE and performs a prescriptive analysis that consists of detecting event patterns
    and making automatic decisions. RECEP was implemented in a VM of a cloud with
    limited computing resources and integrated into an intelligent irrigation system
    of an experimental banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. In order to determine
    the performance of the RECEP, it was evaluated using a WSN simulator was also
    used to generate sensor data in large volumes. The CEP was evaluated with several
    test cases, where a logarithmic regression model was found (r-squared > 0.9) to
    predict the use of CPU and RAM according to the number of events to be processed.
    The predictive values obtained when evaluating said regression model allow defining
    the hardware infrastructure necessary for the use of RECEP with different banana
    producing companies, categorized according to the number of hectares planted.
    The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of using our RECEP in low-cost
    infrastructures for small and large producers. Acknowledgments This research received

  description: Internet of Things (IoT) has been flourishing the communication and
    networking system in recent years, while experiencing a growing phase in agricultural
    field. Precision agriculture requires sensor integration, automatic control, and
    networking and data processing capabilities. With the implementation of rapidly
    growing IoT, challenges of scalability and data management can be overcome. In
    this research, we have developed an IoT based smart monitoring system for agricultural
    practice including client application- web application and android application;

    Location: Chittagong, Bangladesh SECTION I. Introduction Precision agriculture
    is an information and technology based site specific farming practice with the
    aim of maximizing the crop production along with the efficient usage of resources
    involved in farming process. It provides real time assessment of various crop
    and environment parameters by precising the observed farming land as well as the
    amount of required water, fertilizer and other input needs [1]. This method enables
    our farmers to achieve efficient water consumption by irrigating with proper amount
    in the required time and therefore ensures growth of non-toxic, safe and healthy
    crop [2]. But to fulfill its purpose there needs a continuous, organized and precise
    observation with the help of information technologies like Global Positioning
    System (GPS), sensors, satellites or aerial images, etc. [3]. However, scientific
    approaches should be more convenient, comprehensive, and cost efficient. In recent
    years our current technological discipline has intensely impacted by Internet
    of Things (IoT). It has been taking part in enriching almost all sectors of modern
    life and precision agronomy is a potential area which can be mostly advantaged
    by IoT [4]. Our goal is to use IoT technology to overcome the difficulties of
    adaptation in real field of existing platform and developing a cost effective
    system as well. So, on the basis of IoT and by merging variant useful technologies
    and mechanisms we have designed and implemented a smart farm monitoring and irrigation
    management system for PA. In which, sensing and measuring the variations of some
    meteorological factors (Temperature, humidity) and some soil attributes (soil
    temperature, moisture, pH), which are essential parameters for proper growth monitoring
    of crop and irrigation management are obtained by corresponding sensors. One of
    the unique features of the system is to use IoT protocol based LoRa transceiver
    for wireless and rapid communication, and long distance coverage between the gateway
    and the sensor nodes. A cloud based database with web application for data management
    and monitoring has been added to the system. Addition to the uniqueness of our
    cloud based system; we have also developed an android application, which provides
    the users their corresponding field condition in daily and weekly basis as well
    as irrigation controlling feature. In brief, features of the system are real time
    field condition monitoring, managing and analyzing data using cloud server, user
    understandable presentation using numerical and graphical plots of data on web
    application and android application, controlling the irrigation system as well
    as expandability of the platform. Consequently, by implementing our system, farmers
    can remotely obtain their field status instantly and thereby take the necessary
    decision. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: literature
    review will be discussed in section II and the overall system architecture, in
    section III. Methods and materials will be presented in section IV. Irrigation
    control system will be included in section V. Finally, in section VI and VII,
    result, conclusion and future work will be discussed respectively. SECTION II.
    Literature Review IoT has been emerging in the numerous field of life for the
    purpose of monitoring, data collecting, and machine controlling, security. A survey
    on IoT in smart agriculture has been presented by Mekala MS, Viswanathan P. [5].
    [6] J. Ye, B. Chen, Q. Liu, and Y. Fang have proposed a platform to implement
    IoT for PA using WebGIS. The architecture would require expertise to operate and
    develop the system. Fig. 1. Overall system architecture for smart farming Show
    All [7]T. Ojha, S. Misra, and N. Singh has highlighted the problems and challenges
    in implementing wireless sensor technology in agro-field by surveying the previously
    proposed techniques. [8] I. Mohanraj, K. Ashokumar, and J. Naren have proposed
    work on overcoming limitations of traditional agricultural procedures using IoT
    in agriculture. Nevertheless, in literature, works has been proposed on IoT in
    monitoring [2] [9] without any hardware deployment. On the other hand, WSN technology
    can be implemented in greenhouse monitoring and controlling, and in viticulture
    [10] [11]. A prototype has been developed for monitoring and prediction purpose
    based on WSN [12]. Implementation of WSN in precision farming in Egypt has been
    developed by Sherine M. Abd El-Kader [13]. Likewise, WSN has also been implemented
    in the Southern Spain for precision horticulture [14]. By studying recent works
    and their flaws of data integrity, area coverage, applicability and user amenability,
    we have developed an IoT based system for PA providing the facility of real time
    and automatic control of irrigation system as well. Moreover, existing systems
    uses Bluetooth or Zigbee [12] wireless communication protocol for data transmission
    which which are quite expensive, have less coverage area, fewer devices communicability
    and higher power consumption than LoRa which has been used in our system. SECTION
    III. System Architecture The overall IoT based agro filed monitoring and irrigation
    controlling system architecture is presented in figure 1. The proposed platform
    is designed, so that real time data are automatically obtained on a periodic basis
    or spontaneously, stored and viewed for the purpose of monitoring the field condition.
    Therefore, data acquisition, data transmission, data management and analysis,
    data visualization and controlling-these five functions defines the whole platform.
    Data from the sensor node are transmitted to the cloud server using LoRa IoT protocol
    through the gateway node which is can be located within a distance of 2-22km from
    the field where WiFi is available. Gateway needs to be connected to the Internet
    via. WiFi. However, this platform is provided with cloud based database server
    and provides API(Application Programming Interface) for data access, data import
    from the database for data visualization and the farmers i.e., authentic remote
    users can monitor the real time field condition by accessing to the server database.
    Furthermore, we have designed the monitoring and controlling interface amenable
    for the farmer by developing an android application “CropNet” which uses REST
    API services to import and export data from the database. Therefore, data from
    the database are imported to the mobile application on user''s request and again
    user can send command to control the irrigation system using this app to control
    the system. SECTION IV. Methods and Materials The system incorporates 3types of
    node: sensor node, gateway node, irrigation node; database, web application and
    android application. A. Sensor Node Design The architecture of the sensor node
    is presented in Fig. 2. Since measurement should be taken from different locations
    of the field, the sensor network should be comprised of adequate number of sensor
    nodes. Again each sensor node comprises of 4 basic units including sensors, communication
    unit, data processing unit and power unit. Our designed sensor node contains sensors
    for sensing environmental temperature, humidity, soil moisture and soil temperature.
    Moreover, Arduino Nano, Lora SX1278 IC with antenna as transceiver, and 6V power
    supply unit has been included sensor node. The hardware implementation of sensor
    node is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 2. Sensor node architecture Show All Fig. 3. Sensor
    nodes: NODE-700, NODE-800 (hardware) Show All Fig. 4. Working flow diagram of
    the sensor node Show All Corresponding data from all sensors are collected and
    then formatted into JSON data packet. After communication is confirmed between
    the both transceivers of gateway and sensor node data packet is send to the gateway.
    The data packet can be sent within few seconds and we have configured the sensors
    to send real time data at an interval of 5min. The working flow diagram of the
    IoT sensor node is presented in Fig. 4. B. Gateway Node Gateway node has been
    designed using Node MCU 2.1 and Lora SX1278 with its antenna, router, and 6V power
    supply. It works as a medium of communication between sensor nodes and the cloud
    server. It receives data packet wirelessly using LoRa IoT protocol from the sensor
    node and posts the data packet to the cloud server via. Internet. The working
    flow diagram of the gateway node is presented in Fig. 7, where it is used as receiver,
    data coordinator and data transmitter. Block diagram and hardware architecture
    is shown in Fig. 5, 6 respectively. Since, sensor nodes and gateway node are connected
    through LoRa protocol which has large coverage area; gateway node can be located
    at any distance less than 22 km from the sensor node (LOS) which provides this
    system more flexibility for using in remote areas where Internet facility is not
    available or weak. Moreover, a repeater node containing Arduino microprocessor
    and LoRa transceiver can be used to coverage a larger area between sensor nodes
    and gateway node. We have tested the system locating the gateway node at a distance
    of approximately 1km from the sensor nodes and the data communication was successful.
    Fig. 5. Gateway node architecture Show All Fig. 6. Gateway node (hardware) Show
    All C. Data Transmission A recent development in IoT platform for low power, long
    range, wide area coverage LoRa WAn has been used here for data transmission between
    sensor nodes, gateway and irrigation node. Authors found this technology is best
    suitable for smart agriculture [15]. LoRa is a private and spread-specteum technique
    which allows sending data at extremely low-data-rates to extremely long range
    securely. The low data-rate (down to few bytes per seconds)and LoRa modulation
    lead to very low receiver sensitivity (down to −134dBm), which combined to an
    output power of +14dBm means extremely large link budgets: up to 148 dB., what
    means more than 22km (13.6miles) in LOS links and up to 2km (1.2miles) in LOS
    links in urban environment (going through buildings) [16]. Fig. 7. Flowchart of
    working of the gateway node Show All Fig. 8. Login interface of web application
    Show All Fig. 9. Nodes added to the network Show All D. User Interface Design
    User interfaces: a web application and an android application have been developed
    so that field level users can understand the system''s purpose and use them without
    difficulty. 1): Web Application FeatureCollected data from the sensor nodes are
    consumed by the database and displayed to the clients from a running query from
    database on the web application. Our MySQL server is located at pythonanywhere.com.
    This server allows us installing web2py web framework which has been used to develop
    web application. Since only the authentic users have access to the database using
    login accounts and passwords as shown in Fig. 8, users have to be authorized using
    valid emails. Here, every farmer is a user and has own dashboard where real time
    data from his registered nodes are displayed. Therefore, to get data from particular
    nodes a user need to authorize his nodes to his dashboard. We have tested a list
    of nodes in Fig. 9 by changing node ID to confirm data reception from different
    nodes added to the networks. There are web interfaces to visualise the numerical
    data of individual node(Fig. 11, 12) as well as all data of all nodes together
    (Fig. 10). Fig. 10. Neumerical data from all nodes Show All Fig. 11. Web interface
    for data from node 700 Show All 2): Android Application FeatureFor android application,
    we have successfully developed some basic interfaces and managed to pursue data
    from the database for the user. The main interface contains daily data, weekly
    data and condition analysis, irrigation cotrol sub interfaces (Fig. 13). Data
    are displayed on different interfaces (Fig. 14) so that the user can monitor farming
    condition daily as well as throughout a whole week using the weekly node data
    interface, on which all the data throughout a week are displayed. Again the average
    condition of filed will be provided in the app as in Fig. 13d. The soil pH value
    will be manually measured and users need to send the data to the server using
    the ‘PH Sensor Test’ option in Fig. 13d. We have added this feature, because we
    are working on providing solutions and suggestions for the farmers based on the
    real time data. Fig. 12. Web interface for data from node 800 Show All Fig. 13.
    Android application features Show All Fig. 14. Different interfaces of android
    application showing daily data Show All SECTION V. Smart Irrigation Scheme We
    have proposed an irrigation system which can be controlled by the user using android
    application. A node will perform as data receiver from the user through gateway
    using LoRa. Irrigation node is composed of an irrigation pump or a reservoir with
    solenoid valve, a controller circuit to operate the motor or solenoid valve, arduino
    nano, LoRa SX1278 transceiver with antenna and solar panel with solar charger
    circuit. The block diagram of the irrigation node architecture is presented in
    fig 16. According to the command the node performs automatic or force-stop irrigation.
    Automated irrigation will be performed based on the filed condition in which exceeding
    threshold level will turn on the irrigation and after a pre-determined time automatically
    will be switched off. On the other hand, the force-stop mode enables farmer to
    hold control on stopping irrigation. This mode will be helpful to save crops from
    overwatering problems as well as save energy. SECTION VI. Result and Implementation
    The whole setup was deployed in the kitchen garden of our residence (Fig. 16)
    and has been observed for two days. We have implemented two sensor nodes: NODE-700,
    NODE 800 for testing. Gateway node was placed inside the house which was connected
    Internet using WiFi. Success of the sending data from the sensor nodes and storing
    these data in the database is 99%. There are 5,164 data stored in the database
    which includes all the test level data of the system. We have shown the interfaces
    of web application and android app for numerical data visualization with real
    time data collected from field. The graphical representations of the collected
    data from NODE-700 and NODE-800 of one day are presented in Fig. 17 and 18 respectively.

    an attractive part of research because of its application in numerous fields.
    In the field of agriculture the most necessary help can be provided by this technology.
    The study is about developing a feasible system which can be adopted in every
    filed where monitoring and controlling is required. The performance of the system
    proves it relevancy and technological efficiency to implement in PA. Besides,
    we are developing the irrigation node in the mean while a prediction model for
    disease detection is being developed. The irrigation node will add a new dimension
    to the system since it will complete the cycle by including the control mechanism.
    Moreover, a predictive model for providing suggestion and treatment for different
    problems of crops will be added to the android application. We have also designed
    our goal to include a model for disease detection of crops, which will be developed
    using image processing and machine learning algorithm. Therefore, a complete platform
    will be provided to enhance the agricultural output in upcoming days. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Irrigation, particularly pivot-center, is widely used around the world
    to fill the need of crop watering. This method of irrigation has a low efficiency
    compared to other methods of irrigation such as drip systems and generally they
    use water without consider the real need of plants. In this paper we propose an
    automation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information
    System (GIS) and quasi real-time in the cloud of water requirements to improve
    the efficiency of water use. Indeed, each segment of the pivot-center moves at
    a different speed compared to others; thus, must be individually controlled to
    optimize the yield of irrigation. Moreover, it necessary to integrate factors
    such as stage of crops' development, heterogeneity of soil, runoff, drainage,
    soil components, nutrients and moisture content. In this paper we develop a complete
    system integrating sensors, GIS, Internet of Things and cloud computing. This
    approach allows to automate fine-grained the consumption of water without decreasing
    the yield. In addition to that, the collect of data and the soil moisture measurement
    will allow to adapt coefficient of evapotranspiration to local weather without
    having to resort to lysimetric measures. The proposed architecture allows to store
    and treat real-time, time series data and low-priority data such as 3D images
    used in digital phenotyping field which are treated with batch processing.

    Morocco SECTION I. Introduction The demand of food production and fiber increase
    with de world population. The irrigation management is important particularly
    in context where the fresh water resources are limited. The aim of the irrigation
    is to give to plants the adequate amount of water to ensure their water requirements.
    The use of Water Production Function (WPF) allows to estimate the production in
    terms of dry matter or marketable yield, evapotranspiration ore the amount of
    applied water during irrigation (IW). According to the different production functions
    of IW may also include different components in addition to Crop Water Requirement
    (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to prepare the seeding, leaching requirement
    to decrease the salinity, rise of water table by capillarity and rainfall. The
    estimation of water requirement is a stone corner which you can calculate the
    correct irrigation doses. Indeed, the water available for the crop is an indicator
    of the texture of soil, precipitations, previous irrigations, state of development
    of crop and the amount of water already present in the soil. Center-Pivot of irrigation
    are usually reserved to irrigate large areas from 3.5 to 65 ha because of the
    costs; but, the nutrients, fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide and pesticide can
    be directly applied on the canopy of crop [1]. Center-Pivot irrigation systems
    require up to 40% less water application than traditional and conventional gravity
    (furrow) or surface irrigation methods, where a part of water is lost by percolation
    or runoff. But Center-pivot irrigation stays less effective than the drip systems
    that are the most economical in term of water. The main challenge is related to
    the exact estimation of both the evapotranspiration of the crop and how to bring
    the water (frequency and quantity). Traditional hand-feel soil measurement methods
    do not provide quantitative soil water and real-time data. The use of sensors
    in precision agriculture is becoming widespread, especially in irrigation and
    open the field of irrigation management in order to establish an optimal timing
    and amount of irrigation water for greatest effectiveness. Indeed, an optimal
    irrigation management avoid water deficiency and use too much water that reduces
    the potential for profitability of the crop. The supply of an optimal amount of
    water allows also to maximize the yield response to other management practices,
    optimize yield per unit of water applied, reduce the potential runoff, reduce
    soil erosion and pesticide movement into the surface and ground water [1]. To
    optimize the yield and soil water in the crop, plants should not pass the wilting
    point. This means the minimum soil moisture required by a plant not to wilt. At
    this point, any decrease in soil moisture will result in wilting. When a plant
    wilts, its leaves dry out, droop, and wither. The coupling of the irrigation system
    with a soil moisture monitoring and an accurate evapotranspiration calculation
    has a significant advantage in term of water consumption. Precision agriculture
    (PA) uses the Internet of Things and allows real-time control measure and automation
    of pivot-center irrigation systems. Furthermore, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN)
    is affordable and the wide availability of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol
    such as LoRa, SigFox and Ingenu coupling with cloud IoT platforms pave the way
    of high precision and realtime irrigation management systems. In this paper, we
    combine agronomic and computer science expertise to propose a cloud IoT architecture
    and a network of sensors using LPWA to control, monitor and optimize the crop
    production at quasi real-time. The low-cost sensor network measure on one hand
    the weather data required to calculate potential evapotranspiration of the crop,
    and on other hand the soil moisture at different depths. The proposed architecture
    calculates water requirements of plants and actuate solenoids to open and close
    water individually each sprinkler. SECTION II. Literature Review The main challenges
    in the elaboration of an automated irrigation system for irrigation pivot-center
    are vital; on one hand to choose an adapted evaluation method of water requirements,
    and on other hand to identify a correct cloud IoT platform essential for data
    storage and treatment. The following paragraph focuses on these aspects and on
    reviewing existing works. A. Related Works Classical Water Production Functions
    (WPF) are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield
    reduction due to deficit irrigation which is usually based on linear regression
    and don''t give a representation of nonlinear behaviors of complex ecological
    systems. To fix this issue recent research are investigated. We list the use of
    more robust and nonlinear techniques such as machine learning, Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) and data-mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al in 2010 [2], Dai et al.
    in 2011 [3], Haghverdi et al. in 2014 [4] and Elnesr et al., in 2016 [5]). In
    this study we follow two different controls. The first model consists to control
    the speed of travelling of the central-pivot for a constant flow rate. The second
    uses an electronic control to adapt flow rate in the nozzles. The speed of travelling
    of the central-pivot is maintained constant. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    allows to save 9-19% of irrigation water and to address field-level spatio-temporal
    heterogeneity in terms of soil water holding capacity and depth of soil [6]. According
    to Pan et al in 2013 [7] VRI allows also to enhance water-use efficiency, improve
    productivity, reduce fuel consummation and reduce nutrient leaching. The choice
    of sprinkler package, the pressure of working, meteorological conditions and tower
    dynamics affect the irrigation water distribution pattern [8]. Moreover, variations
    in micro-meteorological and technical conditions can modify the water application
    depth and irrigation uniformity at different lateral positions with flow control
    nozzles or pressure regulators at each head [8]. Wind speed and direction don''t
    significantly modify the uniformity of water applicatIon but impact the absolute
    application depth of zones under VRI management [9]. To adapt flow of irrigation
    soils moisture measure must be done. Traditional soil moisture sensors need to
    be installed early in the growing season and must be removed before the harvesting.
    Dong et al in 2013 [1] has proposed a cyber-physical system based on underground
    sensors to monitor soil moisture but this approach do not monitor soil on only
    one depth [1]. The interest of the coupling of Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and Remote Sensing (RS) with Internet of Things (IoT) has been demonstrated by
    different authors such as Li et al. in 2012 [10] Ye et al. in 2013 [11] Wang et
    al., 2013 [12]. B. Estimations of Water Requirements The estimation of water requirements
    of crop (ETc) can be estimated from a simple soil water balance (SSWB) model.
    A general form of the soil water balance is done by the following equation: ETc=I+P+F+R+ΔS
    (1) View Source Where I is the irrigation dose [mm], P is the precipitation [mm],
    F is the net subsurface flow into the control volume [mm], R is net runoff or
    runon to the control volume surface [mm] and ΔS is the net change in soil water
    stored in the control volume [mm]. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) can
    be calculated by using different methods. A common one requires several weather
    data that are not all the time available. Among these methods, we mention Penman-Monteith
    [13] FAO56 PM) which ranked as the best method for estimating daily and monthly
    ET for all climates. Penman [14] (FAO24), Penman [15] (FAO-ppp-17), Kimberly-Penman
    [16], Hamon [17], Hargreaves [18], Haude [19], Penman [20], Penman-Monteith [21],
    Priestley-Taylor [22], Makkink [23], McCl [24], De Bruin-Keijman [25] (DK), Jensen-Haise
    [16], Blaney-Criddle [26] (BC), Blaney-Criddle [14] (FAO 24 BC), FAO 24 Radiation
    [14], Turc [27], Wendling [28], Valiantzas [29]. Nevertheless, modern technologies
    such as the use of Wireless Infrared Thermometers (IRT) appear to measure surface
    temperature and determine the ETc [30]. A comparison of 16 among the models mentioned
    above has been carried out by Liu et al. in 2017 [31] and have shown that FAO-ppp-17,
    Pen-63 and FAO-24 BC are the better results in semi-arid climate. Therefore, we
    notice that a poor calibration between all the aforementioned researchers lead
    to inconsistent results of existing studies on weighting lysimeter. Indeed, Jensen
    et al. report that FA024BC is better [32]. While Yoder et al. in 2005 [33] and
    Lépez-Urrea et al. in 2006 [34] find that FA056 PM is the better formula. Otherwise
    some authors such as Berengena et al. in 2005 [35], Howell et al. in 1998 [36]
    have proven that the adjustment of the Penman formula coefficients at local scale
    shows significantly performing results. To conclude, we assume that FA056 PM or
    FA024 BC can be tested as a first approach in the evaluation of the evapotranspiration
    and a precise evaluation can be obtained locally by adjusting the parameters of
    the original Penman equation. The local adjustment of coefficient of the Penman
    formula need the use of lysimeters and a long experimentation which is not always
    achievable out of research centres. The Maximal Evapotranspiration (MET) of a
    crop can be calculated at different vegetative stage when amount of water is sufficiently
    available and agronomic condition are optimal. The MET can be calculated by model
    but in real conditions, and the Real Evapotranspiration (RE) is inferior in amount
    calculated by model. By consequence, it''s important to measure accurately real
    evapotranspiration by mean of sensors to provide the necessary quantities of water
    and to avoid percolation losses related to excessive intake linked in particular
    to an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration. C. Choice of Sensors Both
    approaches can be followed. The first one uses commercial sensing solutions which
    natively provide a wide range of features directly and allows researchers to focus
    on the developments of algorithms and meta-processing, etc. The second one uses
    open hardware solutions which are programmable and flexible allowing to developers
    to have the full control of the behaviors of the nodes [37] The first approach
    is particularly interesting to develop proof of concept but makes researchers
    dependent of one provider and the availability of sensors used for development.
    Moreover, the rapid turnover of product of high technology renders this science
    stream especially risked for long term developments. The second way although requiring
    further development is more sustainable and is generally supported by a large
    community of developers. The choice of sensors is crucial because nodes can move
    over time that causes considerable interferences in the communication between
    nodes. Moreover, the influence of temperature, humidity, rainfall, sandstorm and
    high solar radiation greatly affect the links and communication quality among
    the nodes, particularly in harsh environmental conditions. The high temperature
    encountered in semiarid environments affects significantly the received signal
    strength (RSS). The humidity linked to the irrigation system and the heavy rainfall
    intensely affects the propagation of radio waves. The choice of the wireless transceiver
    and the transmission protocol must take into account the number of nodes, the
    distances between them, the height of antenna and the operating frequency based
    on the desired size of payload [37]. D. Cloud IoT Platform The correct choice
    of the IoT Platform to build a solution can affect the overall success of the
    project [37]. Both explorable approaches acquire and manage the underlying hardware
    and software layers or use a commercial offering which provides all needed services
    to propose an integrative solution. A review proposed by Ray PP in 2016 compare
    the 26 most popular IoT cloud platforms based on the following parameters: deployment
    service, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data
    management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization and research.
    According to Ray in 2016 [38], they should have at least 49 IoT cloud platforms
    present in the actual global market. Nowadays, any commercial or open source cloud
    platform allows to deploy, and hosts applications or models elaborated on different
    framework on the same cloud architecture. SECTION III. Calculation of Water Requirements
    The soil characterization has been achieved on basis of samples taken in situ
    by BNEDER (National Technical Studies Office for Rural Development) located at
    Alger (Algeria). 96 samples were taken following a systematic grid of 30 × 30
    m over the area covered by the pivot (one by layer of soil). The parameters evaluated
    were bulk density, texture and the soil water holding capacity. Then, parameters
    measured on each of the 32 sampling points for three layers of soil has been interpolated
    to obtain a high-resolution map. The software ArcMap 10.5.1 was used to interpolate
    data measured in order to generate a grid by layer of 5m × 5m (25m2 area per cell)
    for each kind of measure. Moreover, each layer of soil has also been interpolate
    using 3D spline method to obtain a 3D model of soil layer. This 3D model and the
    spatial interpolation of soil water holding capacity allows to calculate the plant
    available in function of the depth of rooting. As shown on Fig. 1. The first layer
    is a mix of one or more existing layers which have been homogenized from a textural
    point of view and the salt content by successive plowing on a height of 25 to
    30 cm. The water available for plant is also function of roots development which
    offers the possibility to explore a more and more large part of soil. The available
    water is obtained by a weighted mean of the depth of all layers explored by the
    root system at each stage of development. A day by day amount of water irrigation
    can be calculated from (1). Fig. 1 Different stages of crop development Show All
    The FAO Penman-Monteith method (2) is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) and the evapo-transpiration of the crop (ETc), also named MET which takes
    into account the stage of vegetative growth of the crop by weighting the potential
    evapotranspiration by the coefficient Kc [13]. The Kc coefficient allows to modulate
    the PET in function of the crop envisaged and the stage of its stage of development.

    of the crop is calculated with (3). ETc= PET ∗ Kc (3) View Source Where ETc is
    the crop evapotranspiration [mm.day''], PET is the reference evapotranspiration
    [mm.day−1] and Kc is a ponderation coefficient variating between 0.3 to 1.2 depending
    of the crop stage of development [8], see Fig 1. SECTION IV. Material The application
    is tested on a pivot-center irrigation and a crop of soft wheat implanted in Ain
    Salah located in the heart of the Sahara Desert region in the center of Algeria.
    This region is characterized by a hot desert climate where the temperature in
    the summer reach 47 to 50°C. The irrigation pivot-center is composed of 6 spans
    with a total length of 308m. The revolution time of the pivot is 24h, it means
    that every hour an angle of 15° is traveled. As shown in the Fig. 2, the cover
    area is increasing from the center to the outside. The sensors must stay functional
    with important temperature variation from 20 to 65 degrees and remained functional
    also in presence of rate of humidity close to 80%. Fig. 3 The proposed system
    and architecture Show All SECTION V. Proposed System and Archttecture We have
    chosen to follow the open hardware way as part of our developments. The proposed
    system is composed locally of a weather station. Several multi-depth moisture
    sensors distributed on the irrigate area at the middle on each span measure the
    amount of water at different depths and solenoid placed on sprinkler. Data are
    transmitted by LoRa modulation to a gateway which relay data to The Things Network
    using a 4G connection. A cloud architecture collects, treats and stores data received
    from the weather station and soil moisture sensor, and calculates in real-time
    needs in irrigation water. A. Weather Station The weather data are acquired by
    a micro weather station which uses a LoRa transmission system. This low-cost protocol
    has been chosen for its easiness of deployment, its ability to resist interference
    with the spread spectrum technology and the area that can be covered by a single
    gateway. The micro weather station is based on a Weather Sensor (Argent Data Systems)
    which contains an anemometer, a vane direction and a pluviometer. The weather
    station contains a temperature / humidity sensor AM2315 (Aosong) with an error
    of 0.1°C for the temperature and 2% for the relative humidity. The net solar radiation
    is measured by a digital net radiometer SN-500, Apogee Instruments. All sensors
    are connected on a LoPy which collect data and send them on LoRa / 4G gateway
    (see Fig. 3). B. Sensors and Actuators Soil moisture nodes based on LoPy using
    soil moisture underground sensors measure the rate of humidity at different soil
    depths. The humidity is measured at different depth (20, 30 and 50 cm) with Watermark
    Soil Moisture Irrometer sensor model 200SS. The measure of humidity at different
    depth allow to control if amount of water calculate are correct or if they must
    be adjusted. As show on Fig. 2, the 24 sensors are implanted in the middle of
    each ring, the water requirements are controlled 8 times per day (one just before
    the irrigation and one hour just after the irrigation) on each of the four control
    lines of sensors. Solenoid valves are implanted on the sprinkler feed pipes and
    allows them to be operated individually and thus finely control the water supply.
    The fine control of the sprinklers allows to have a same amount of water per unit
    area at each of the 6 zones traveled at the level of each of the different segments
    each hour. C. Cloud Architecture We use our own architecture based on a Cloud
    IoT platform and a share/hosting application platform. This architecture has already
    been tested with cattle behavior [39], digital phenotyping [40] and monitoring
    of bee health [41]. Time-related Data are transmitted to the Cloud IoT platform
    by LPWA network while images, videos and sound are transmitted by Wi-Fi network,
    see Fig. 3. 1) The Cloud IoT Platform The platform is composed of two parts. The
    first one is based on one hand on Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Druid, to treat
    stream and time-related data. The second one uses an Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark
    are associate to store and treat images, sound and video. a) Time Related-Data
    Data are received by Apache Kafka which transfer them to Apache Samza to be processed
    before the ingesting by Druid. Druid is a distributed column -oriented fault-tolerant
    data store presenting real-time analytical capabilities. The data processing allows
    to increase the speed of ingestion 10 times by elimination of bad formed package,
    inconsistent and incomplete data. Redis Caching accelerate the speed of recurrent
    queries. The data are stored in units of few millions of lines named ‘segments’
    composed of 5 to 10 million of times-stamped events compressed by LZ4. Old segments
    are locally stored on HDFS. Both external dependencies are used: PostgreSQL and
    ZooKeeper to respectively store meta data and monitor the four kinds of nodes
    present in the cluster. These four types of nodes coordinate, broke, store in
    real-time or archive data in the distributed data store. b) Sound, Images and
    Video These kinds of data are independently treated and stored by a second structure
    based on Hadoop and Apache Spark. These kinds of data are also locally stored
    on HDFS. This structure offers better performance than an Hadoop, MapReduce, HiPi.
    Camera placed on the pivot center can make 3D-pictures of same plant every day
    in order to model their development and compare the impact of agricultural practices
    and weather conditions on the growth of the crop. The analysis of sound allows
    to detect any dysfunction may occur of critical parts of pivot-center and program
    a preventive maintenance (PM) to avoid the immobilization of the pivot over a
    long period. But both features are not yet implemented. 2) The Application Sharing
    and Hosting Platform Druid powers high performances application with low query
    latencies. To better exploit this performance and don''t be dependent of one SDK,
    we propose a cloud architecture able to host application developed on principal
    framework. This cloud platform authorizes elaboration of the model by researchers
    and also host endpoint applications of third party adapted to different kinds
    of material allowing to monitor and automate the pivot-center irrigation while
    optimizing crop yields. SECTION VI. Results We compare water requirements calculated
    by the cloud architecture with the one calculated by CropWat [42] decision support
    tool. This tool is developed by the Land and Water Development Division for the
    calculation of crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil,
    climate and crop data. The calculation procedure is described in [8], the response
    of different yield is explained in [43] and the coupling between CropWat and climatic
    data of ClimWat is explicated step by step in [44]. Remarkably values calculated
    by CropWat assume that only water can change and other factors such as agricultural
    practices, fertilization, etc. are at optimal level. Table 1 gives results obtained
    with CropWat 8.0 for a wheat with a planting date of 25 November at In Salah,
    Algeria and total development in 180 days. Water requirements are calculated on
    basis of real daily weather data. Table I. Water requirements calculated with
    cropwat The Fig. 4 shows the comparison between measured and calculated with CropWat
    Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP). Both approach gives similar results. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion and Future Works We have outlined an architecture based on soil
    characteristics interpolate by mean of GIS, soil moisture measured, and weather
    data transmitted by LoRaWan to calculate in quasi real-time the water requirements
    of the crop. The LoRaWan is particularly adapted to transmit data in harsh conditions.
    In the end, the comparison of first approach performed with CropWat has allowed
    to calculate maximal evapotranspiration and verify that these are never exceeded.
    Fig. 4 Comparison between CropWat and measured average daily ETP Show All In order
    to validate the water requirements calculated using the CropWat model, we compared
    them with a precise model called AquaCrop [45]. This model considers more parameters
    affecting the vegetative and reproductive growth of crop. The implementation of
    3D Camera in specific areas places on the pivot, will open a new research path
    in the field of digital phenotyping. In addition to this, the continuous analysis
    of sound from microphones implemented in chosen places will quickly detect signs
    of failure and prevent downtime that can be expensive in term of crop profitability.
    As future work, we plan to exploit GPU Tegra Mobile Processors 1 that offers high
    computation power thanks to the exploitation of GPU processors in parallel [46]
    [47]. In addition to the high performance, these cards provide the possibility
    to exploit artificial intelligence algorithms for a better training and prediction
    of collected data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank our colleagues from Biosystems

  description: The development of sensors that provide geospatial information on crop
    and soil conditions has been a primary success for precision agriculture. However,
    further developments are needed to integrate geospatial data into computer algorithms
    that spatially optimize crop production while considering potential environmental
    impacts and resource limitations. The objective of this research was to combine
    several information technologies, including remote sensing, a cropping system
    model, and a geographic information system (GIS), to synthesize and interpret
    geospatial data collected during two irrigation scheduling experiments conducted
    in 2009 and 2011 in a 5-ha cotton field in central Arizona. The Geospatial Simulation
    (GeoSim) plug-in for Quantum GIS was used to manage geospatial data and conduct
    site-specific simulations with the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model. Simulated annealing
    optimization was used to adjust five model parameters to simulate site-specific
    conditions in 320 zones across the field. Using input parameters for GeoSim, a
    multiple criteria objective function was developed to incorporate measured and
    simulated leaf area index (LAI), crop canopy height, seed cotton yield, and evapotranspiration
    (ET) for site-specific optimization of CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton. Parameter identifiability
    and equifinality issues associated with model inversion were investigated. The
    optimized model was used for post hoc analysis of irrigation rates that maximized
    site-specific irrigation water use efficiency. With spatial optimization, the
    model was able to simulate LAI with root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 15 and
    8 % in the 2009 and 2011 experiments, respectively. The RMSEs between measured
    and simulated canopy height, seed cotton yield, and ET were 5 % or less in both
    seasons. Some parameters were more identifiable than others during model inversions.
    Multiple temporal estimates of LAI were effective for constraining the model’s
    specific leaf area parameter (SLAVR, cm2 g−1), but lack of information on root
    growth reduce identifiability of a parameter related to that process (SRGF0).
    Post-hoc simulation analysis of irrigation management options showed that irrigation
    schedules based on remotely sensed vegetation indices increased irrigation water
    use efficiency as compared to traditional scheduling methods, particularly in
    the 2009 growing season. In 2011, the analysis showed that all scheduling methods
    resulted in excess irrigation application, and higher deep seepage rates were
    simulated in that season. Taken together, the results demonstrate that well-designed
    software tools and algorithms for data processing and interpretation can be potentially
    transformative for integrating multiple geospatial data sets to compute optimum
    scenarios for precision irrigation management.

    January 2017 Integration of Geospatial Technology and Simulation Modelling for
    Climate Change Studies Chapter © 2020 Introduction Concerns about water scarcity,
    arising due to aridity, drought, desertification, and water shortage, have driven
    efforts to improve approaches for managing agricultural irrigation water (Pereira
    et al. 2002). Precision irrigation technologies, which aim to apply the appropriate
    amount of water at the appropriate place and time, have emerged as a viable solution
    for optimizing crop production under water resource constraints (Monaghan et al.
    2013). Engineering solutions for precision irrigation management have led to control
    systems on mechanical move irrigation machines capable of applying water on a
    site-specific basis (Camp et al. 1998; Kranz et al. 2012). Further improvements
    have permitted remote monitoring of the irrigation system through the Internet
    and integration of wireless sensor networks that provide real-time information
    on soil moisture and meteorological conditions (Chávez et al. 2010). Dynamic models
    of crop growth and soil water balance have also been incorporated into irrigation
    control systems for development, evaluation, and implementation of precision irrigation
    strategies in real-time (McCarthy et al. 2010). However, management decisions
    that optimize irrigation schedules and improve water use efficiency remain complex
    and are dependent on multiple factors: crop status, soil conditions, meteorology,
    commodity prices, water resource constraints, and others. Continued efforts are
    needed to develop computer algorithms and decision support systems that holistically
    combine information from multiple sources to calculate and implement spatially
    and temporally optimized irrigation strategies (Evans and King 2012). Cropping
    system simulation models can serve as the central computational component of decision
    support systems for precision irrigation. Such models combine information on meteorological
    conditions, soil characteristics, crop cultivars, and management practices to
    simulate hydrology, nutrient dynamics, and crop growth and development processes
    on daily or hourly time steps (e.g., Thorp et al. 2014a). Since simulating crop
    growth responses to root-zone soil moisture shortages is a primary function of
    cropping system models, they have been regularly used in research to evaluate
    irrigation management options (Baumhardt et al. 2009; Hood et al. 1987; Hook 1994)
    and to assess the economics of irrigation management decisions (Cammarano et al.
    2012; Mauget et al. 2013). Nair et al. (2013) used the Cotton2K model to assess
    cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) productivity and profitability when water resource
    constraints permitted irrigating only a subset of the total field area. DeJonge
    et al. (2007) used CERES-Maize to analyze the potential for precision irrigation
    to improve maize (Zea mays L.) yields and revenue in Iowa. Current limitations
    of cropping system models for applications in precision irrigation include (1)
    the typical design characteristic of simulating conditions at one point on the
    landscape and (2) the large parameterization requirements for model implementation
    at multiple spatial locations. To overcome the point-based design limitation of
    cropping system models, a geographic information system (GIS) can offer functionality
    for conducting model simulations spatially. A GIS can facilitate mapping, visualization,
    and geoprocessing of spatial data within unique geospatial units across a field.
    Several modern GIS packages also provide access to their application programming
    interface (API) and support scripting languages, which permit savvy GIS technicians
    to develop custom plug-ins that automate geoprocessing and data management tasks.
    This functionality of GIS software has been used to develop links to cropping
    system models and to conduct spatial simulations for addressing diverse topics
    in precision agriculture. For example, Rao et al. (2000) linked the Erosion Productivity
    Impact Calculator (EPIC) model with a GIS and simulated site-specific nitrogen
    dynamics under conventional and minimum tillage over a 5-year period at a field
    site in Oklahoma. McKinion et al. (2001) integrated the GOSSYM model with a GIS
    to analyze precision irrigation and nitrogen fertilization prescriptions. With
    spatial optimization of water and nitrogen management, GOSSYM simulated a 322
    kg ha−1 increase in cotton yield with a 2.6 cm ha−1 increase in irrigation and
    a 35 kg ha−1 decrease in nitrogen fertilizer. Thorp et al. (2008) developed the
    Apollo decision support software, which conducted simulations for site-specific
    crop model calibration and evaluation (Thorp et al. 2007) and analysis of precision
    nitrogen (Thorp et al. 2006) and irrigation (DeJonge et al. 2007) management options.
    Separate GIS algorithms were developed to prepare the model input files required
    for spatial simulations in Apollo. More recently, Thorp and Bronson (2013) developed
    an open-source GIS tool that could manage spatial simulations for any point-based
    cropping system model. They demonstrated the tool using both the AquaCrop and
    CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton models to simulate site-specific seed cotton (fiber + seed)
    yield in response to irrigation management, nitrogen management, and soil texture
    variability for a 14 ha study area near Lamesa, Texas. Others have linked cropping
    system models with GIS for analyses of crop yield and water use relationships
    at regional scales (Heinemann et al. 2002; Ines et al. 2002; Liu 2009). To assist
    parameterization of cropping system models for spatial simulations or to provide
    data for updating model state variables spatially, remote sensing technologies
    have been used to rapidly quantify spatial variability in crop canopy characteristics.
    For example, Seidl et al. (2004) computed the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) from airborne remote sensing imagery and used the index to update
    the leaf weight state variable in spatial simulations with the CROPGRO-Soybean
    model. The updating procedure improved coefficients of determination (r 2) between
    measured and simulated soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield in some fields,
    but improvements were dependent on the timing of remote sensing reconnaissance.
    Several studies have similarly used ground-based NDVI measurements to estimate
    leaf area index (LAI) and test impacts of updating simulated LAI or related leaf
    growth state variables on simulated evapotranspiration (ET) and crop yield (Hadria
    et al. 2006; Thorp et al. 2010). El Nahry et al. (2011) described efforts to combine
    Landsat remote sensing imagery, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land
    (SEBAL) model for instantaneous ET calculations, the FAO Cropwat model for Penman–Monteith
    daily time-series ET calculations, and maps of yield and soil variability within
    a GIS for analysis of the economic and environmental impacts of precision irrigation
    and nitrogen fertilization. Although costs of applying precision management were
    much greater than traditional practices, their analysis demonstrated economic
    benefits with the former approach due to increased crop yields. Integration of
    remote sensing data and crop growth simulations within a GIS has also occurred
    at regional scales (Ju et al. 2010; Mo et al. 2005). These studies demonstrate
    the utility of combining multiple informational tools for analyzing spatial variability
    in crop yield, ET, and other important cropping system variables. Multiple approaches
    are available for combining data from remote sensing imagers and other sensors
    into the simulations of cropping system models. A common technique uses model
    inversion for adjusting parameters to minimize error between measured and simulated
    data. For example, Calmon et al. (1999) used simulated annealing optimization
    to adjust soil and root growth parameters in CROPGRO-Soybean to minimize error
    between measured and simulated volumetric soil moisture content. Model inversion
    has been regularly used in precision agriculture research to estimate soil hydraulic
    properties and other factors that govern site-specific yield variability (Irmak
    et al. 2001; Paz et al. 1998; Thorp et al. 2007). Charoenhirunyingyos et al. (2011)
    used estimates of LAI and ET from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)
    data to estimate soil hydraulic parameters in the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant
    (SWAP) model, which improved soil moisture simulations to a depth of 28 cm. An
    important feature of their study was the use of multiple criteria objective functions
    to solve the inverse problem for multiple variables. Thorp et al. (2012) linked
    two radiative transfer models with a cropping system model and used optimization
    to adjust leaf area growth parameters to minimize error between measured and simulated
    NDVI or canopy spectral reflectance. As compared to stand-alone simulations, estimates
    of wheat (Triticum durum L.) yield and LAI were improved using remote sensing
    data to optimize the coupled models. Model inversion was also used to estimate
    dual crop coefficients using FAO-56 ET methods and measured soil water potential
    (Zhang et al. 2011) . The overall objective of this research was to combine several
    information technologies, including remote sensing, a cropping system model, and
    GIS, to synthesize and interpret geospatial data collected during two irrigation
    scheduling experiments in a 5-ha cotton field in central Arizona. Specific objectives
    were to (1) use the Geospatial Simulation plug-in for Quantum GIS (Thorp and Bronson
    2013) to manage geospatial data within site-specific harvest zones and conduct
    spatial simulations with a cotton model, (2) develop and evaluate an optimization
    approach that used measured NDVI, crop height, soil moisture, and yield to estimate
    five model parameters and calibrate the model for site-specific conditions, and
    (3) use the calibrated model to evaluate the irrigation scheduling approaches
    tested in the experiment by assessing their ability to maximize site-specific
    irrigation water use efficiency. Materials and methods Field experiments As described
    by Hunsaker et al. (2015), irrigation scheduling experiments were conducted in
    a 5-ha cotton field from May to October in 2009 and 2011 at the University of
    Arizona’s Maricopa Agricultural Center (MAC) near Maricopa, Arizona (33.075°N,
    111.990°W, 361 m above sea level). Soils at the site were a mixture of Casa Grande
    sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, hyperthermic, Typic Natrargids) to the east and
    Trix clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed calcareous, hyperthermic Typic Torrifluvents)
    to the west. The environment at MAC is arid with maximum daily air temperatures
    regularly exceeding 38 °C in July and August. Precipitation amounted to 68 and
    24 mm during the 2009 and 2011 cotton growing seasons, respectively. Sixteen treatment
    plots were established with a north–south orientation, each hydrologically isolated
    with border dikes and containing 12 cotton rows with spacing of 1.0 m and length
    of 168 m (Fig. 1). Upland cotton (cv. ‘Deltapine 1044B2RF’) was planted in raised
    beds on 22 April 2009 [day of year (DOY) 112] and 20 April 2011 (DOY 110). Average
    post-emergence plant densities were 22.0 plants m−2 in 2009 and 15.2 plants m−2
    in 2011. Four replicates of four experimental treatments were randomized in a
    complete block design to test four methodologies for irrigation scheduling. The
    ‘MAC’ treatment imitated irrigation scheduling practices of the MAC farm supervisor
    who managed adjacent cotton fields and used visual assessments of crop stress
    and personal experience to make irrigation management decisions. The ‘FAO’ treatment
    used FAO-56 methods (Allen et al. 1998) with site-specific soil texture data and
    a soil water balance model to schedule irrigations when available root zone soil
    moisture was depleted to 45 % of total available capacity. The ‘VI_A’ treatment
    was identical to FAO, except remotely sensed NDVI was used to estimate site-specific
    crop coefficients for FAO-56 ET calculations. The ‘VI_B’ treatment was identical
    to VI_A, except irrigations were scheduled when available root zone soil moisture
    in 5 % of the treatment area was depleted to 65 % of total available capacity.
    Fig. 1 Field map of irrigation treatments for the 2009 and 2011 cotton field experiments
    in Maricopa, Arizona with locations of random soil samples and access tubes for
    neutron probes. Twenty zones for site-specific cotton harvest were delineated
    within each irrigation treatment (Color figure online) Full size image No mechanical
    move irrigation systems were available on-farm at the time of these studies, which
    limited the potential for true precision irrigation. Water for surface irrigation
    was delivered through gated polypipe, which was hard-plumbed to a concrete-lined
    irrigation ditch on the southern side of the field. Treatment plots were irrigated
    individually, and irrigation volumes applied to each plot were monitored with
    an in-line propeller flow meter. Nine irrigation events occurred for each treatment
    plot in each growing season, but the irrigation rates and dates varied. Since
    surface irrigation leads to variable opportunity time for infiltration which contributes
    to spatially variable infiltration rates (Hunsaker et al. 1999; Jaynes and Hunsaker
    1989), seven water sensor timers, manufactured in-house (Hunsaker et al. 2011),
    were positioned in the furrow adjacent to the neutron access tube locations. The
    sensors recorded the time that water arrived (advance time) and the time that
    water had completely receded below the soil surface (recession time). Information
    on irrigation flow rate, furrow geometry, and advance and recession times were
    used within the WinSRFR simulation software (Bautista et al. 2009) to estimate
    site-specific irrigation infiltration at the location of each neutron access tube.
    Pre-season soil profile nitrate was adequate in both seasons, so no pre-plant
    nitrogen fertilizer was applied in either year. Based on analyses of cotton petiole
    nitrate concentration, 56 kg nitrogen ha−1, as liquid urea-ammonium-nitrate, was
    uniformly applied to all treatments on 1 June 2009 (DOY 152) and 31 May 2011 (DOY
    151). Site-specific ground measurements Access tubes for neutron moisture meters
    were installed at 112 locations in both seasons. Seven tubes were installed 25
    m apart along one cotton row in each treatment plot (Fig. 1). Field-calibrated
    neutron moisture meters (Model 503, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, CPN, Martinez, California)
    were used to measure the soil water contents from 0.1 to 2.9 m in 0.2 m incremental
    depths. During each cotton experiment, soil water content was measured at each
    location approximately 21 times from mid-May to mid-September. Measurements were
    typically made 1 day before irrigating a treatment plot and again 4 or 5 days
    after the irrigation. Soil water content data were used to estimate ET and deep
    seepage between successive measurement events at each location using the soil
    water balance approach described by Hunsaker et al. (2005): $$ {\\text{ET = }}\\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{11} (D_{i,1} - D_{i,n - 1} ) + \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j
    = 1}^{n - 1} \\left( {R_{j} + I_{j} } \\right) - {\\text{DS}} $$ (1) $$ {\\text{DS
    = }}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 12}^{15} \\left( {D_{i,1} - D_{i,n - 1} } \\right)
    $$ (2) where ET is the total evapotranspiration and DS is the total deep seepage
    occurring from day 1 to the end of day n–1, D i,1 and D i,n-1 are respectively
    the water depth measurements at soil depth increment i at the beginning of day
    1 and end of day n–1, and R j and I j are respectively the precipitation and irrigation
    depths received on day j. Equation 1 was used with DS equal to zero if Eq. 2 resulted
    in DS less than zero. Soil depth increments 1 through 11 were used to estimate
    the change in soil water storage and corresponded to actual soil depths of 10–210
    cm. Soil depth increments 12 through 15 were used to estimate deep seepage and
    corresponded to actual soil depths of 230 to 290 cm. During the installation of
    neutron access tubes in 2009, soil samples in 0.3 m increments to a depth of 1.8
    m were collected from the 112 bore holes. Prior to the 2011 experiment, additional
    soil cores were collected at 80 random locations across the field (Fig. 1). To
    quantify soil texture, samples were analyzed for particle size fraction in the
    laboratory using the Bouyoucos hydrometer method (Gee and Bauder 1986). The Rosetta
    pedotransfer functions (Schaap et al. 2001) were used to calculate soil bulk density,
    saturated hydraulic conductivity, and soil water limits, including the saturated
    soil water content (porosity), drained upper limit (field capacity), and lower
    limit (wilting point) based on soil texture data at each depth and location. Cotton
    plant height was regularly measured near the second, fourth, and sixth neutron
    access locations in each treatment plot. In 2009, plant height was measured 6
    times from 3 June (DOY 154) through 7 August (DOY 219). In 2011, height was measured
    14 times from 10 May (DOY 130) through 19 August (DOY 231). Twenty zones were
    delineated in each treatment plot for site-specific cotton yield measurements,
    each four rows by 16 m (Fig. 1). Within each zone, cotton was machine-harvested
    with a two-row picker from 23 to 28 October in 2009 (DOY 296–301) and from 11
    to 14 October in 2011 (DOY 284–287). Two passes were required to harvest cotton
    in each zone. Samples from each pass were bagged and weighed separately in the
    field. Later, subsamples from each bag were weighed and ginned. Fiber turnout
    percentages were used to correct the original bulk cotton weights to fiber and
    seed weights. Based on limited measurements, fiber and seed weights were further
    reduced by 3.5 and 4.9 %, respectively, to account for moisture. Seed cotton yield
    in each harvest zone was computed as the sum of the corrected fiber and seed weights
    from the appropriate neighboring harvest swaths divided by the zone area (58.8
    m2). Airborne remote sensing As described by French et al. (2015), airborne remote
    sensing surveys were conducted over the field site on multiple occasions in 2009
    and 2011. The present study required only NDVI measurements from multispectral
    cameras sensitive in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum; however, a
    thermal infrared camera was also routinely deployed for surface temperature measurements.
    In 2009, a 3-band multispectral camera (MS3100, DuncanTech, Auburn, California)
    was deployed for NDVI measurements. After an electronic failure, the DuncanTech
    camera was replaced for the 2011 season: first with a pair of 8-bit machine vision
    cameras (EO-1312M, Edmund Optics, Barrington, New Jersey) and later with a new
    3-band multispectral camera (MS4100, Geospatial Systems, Inc., Rochester, New
    York). Cameras were mounted on an aluminum plate, attached to the frame of a Hiller
    UH-12 helicopter, and flown approximately 800 m above ground level, which provided
    images with spatial resolution of approximately 0.25 m. Red and NIR image data
    for NDVI calculations were collected using 10 nm bandwidth filters centered at
    670 and 790 nm. The present analysis used images acquired on 3 June (DOY 154)
    and 30 July (DOY 211) in 2009. Images from five collection dates in 2011 were
    used: 26 May (DOY 146), 9 June (DOY 160), 21 July (DOY 202), 4 August (DOY 216),
    and 18 August (DOY 230). On the morning of remote sensing surveys, four 8 m by
    8 m calibration tarps (Group VIII Technologies, Provo, Utah) were positioned near
    the cotton field. Concurrently with airborne image acquisition, ground-based radiometric
    measurements of each calibration tarp were collected with a portable field spectroradiometer
    (GER1500, Spectra Vista Corporation, Poughkeepsie, New York). Additional radiometric
    measurements over a calibrated, 99 % Spectralon panel (Labsphere, Inc., North
    Sutton, New Hampshire) were used to characterize incoming solar irradiance and
    to calculate reflectance factors in the red and NIR wavebands for each calibration
    tarp. Using an empirical line calibration method, remote sensing images were calibrated
    to percent reflectance by matching the ground-based tarp reflectance data with
    the image digital numbers (DNs) from tarp pixels. Images were georeferenced by
    selecting ground control points from an orthophoto provided by the United States
    Geological Survey (USGS). An NDVI image on each acquisition date was calculated
    using the following equation: $$ {\\text{NDVI = }}\\frac{{\\rho_{790} - \\rho_{670}
    }}{{\\rho_{790} + \\rho_{670} }} $$ (3) where ρ 790 and ρ 670 are reflectance
    in the NIR and red wavebands, respectively. Image processing tasks were completed
    using the Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) software. (Version 4.8, Exelis
    Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, Colorado). Geospatial data processing Thorp
    and Bronson (2013) described the Geospatial Simulation plug-in for Quantum GIS
    (www.qgis.org), which was used to manage geospatial data and conduct site-specific
    cropping system model simulations in the present study. To use the tool, a ‘base
    layer’ polygon shapefile was created to delineate the spatial zones for site-specific
    modeling and to contain the geospatial data for each zone. The ploygon shapefile
    delineating the 320 zones for site-specific cotton harvest was used as the base
    layer shapefile for site-specific simulations (Fig. 1). Estimates of each soil
    hydraulic property at each sampling depth were combined with their respective
    geographic coordinates and represented as a point shapefiles. Universal kriging
    interpolation based on 20 nearest neighboring points was used to estimate the
    spatial distribution of each soil hydraulic property at each sampling depth on
    a 0.5 m grid across the field. A geoprocessing script within the Geospatial Simulation
    tool was used to average the soil hydraulic property estimates within each of
    the 320 simulation zones and append the data to the base layer attribute table.
    Initial soil moisture conditions in each simulation zone were specified from the
    nearest neutron moisture meter reading on the first measurement outing in each
    growing season. Likewise, the site-specific irrigation rates and the ET and deep
    seepage estimates at each neutron access location were assigned to the nearest
    simulation zones in each treatment plot. These data, along with the variable irrigation
    dates, were appended to the base layer shapefile for use in site-specific simulations.
    Similar to the kriged maps of soil hydraulic properties, the NDVI measurements
    in each remote sensing image were averaged within the 320 simulation zones and
    appended to the base layer shapefile. Canopy height measurements at the neutron
    access locations were assigned to the nearest simulation zones. These NDVI and
    canopy height measurements were combined to estimate site-specific cotton LAI
    on each remote sensing image acquisition date. Using the approach of Scotford
    and Miller (2004), a compound canopy index (CCI) was calculated and used to estimate
    LAI: $$ {\\text{LAI = }}\\beta * {\\text{CCI = }}\\beta * \\left( {\\frac{\\text{C}}{{{\\text{C}}_{
    \\hbox{max} } }}} \\right) * \\left( {\\frac{\\text{H}}{{{\\text{H}}_{ \\hbox{max}
    } }}} \\right) $$ (4) where β is a regression constant, C and H are respectively
    the instantaneous canopy cover and height measurements, and Cmax and Hmax are
    respectively the maximum cover and height expected during the growing season.
    Co-located data to parameterize this calculation were collected during a subsequent
    cotton study at MAC during the 2013 growing season. Canopy width and height was
    measured at several locations on ten occasions during the period of rapid LAI
    expansion: 18 June (DOY 169) to 29 August (DOY 241). Overhead digital images from
    a height of 2 m were collected to quantify canopy cover, and measurements with
    an LAI meter (LAI-2200, Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) were also collected. Biomass
    from two 0.5-m lengths of row was destructively sampled and dissected to remove
    all leaves. Total leaf area of each sample was measured with an area meter (LAI-3100,
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) and used to calculate a second LAI estimate. Analysis
    of these data led to values of 5.5, 87.9 %, and 110.5 cm for β, Cmax, and Hmax,
    respectively. These parameters were used for site-specific LAI calculations with
    the 2009 and 2011 NDVI and canopy height data. The NDVI data were used as a direct
    estimate of canopy cover. Using data from 2013 to estimate LAI for 2009 and 2011
    was not considered problematic, because the same cotton cultivar was used for
    all field studies. To complete preparation of the base layer shapefile, the seed
    cotton yield measured in each harvest zone was appended to the attribute table.
    Additional attributes were added for model input parameters requiring site-specific
    adjustments and for select model outputs. In summary, site-specific soil properties,
    initial soil water content, irrigation management data, and estimates of ET, deep
    seepage, canopy height, LAI, and seed cotton yield were compiled within the base
    layer shapefile for parameterization, evaluation, optimization, and application
    of the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model on a site-specific basis. CSM-CROPGRO-cotton The
    Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model
    (CSM; ver. 4.5.1.005; Hoogenboom et al. 2012; Jones et al. 2003) utilizes mass
    balance principles to simulate the carbon, nitrogen, and hydrologic processes
    and transformations that occur within a cropping system. Processes are calculated
    within a homogeneous area on a daily time step, and certain subprocesses are computed
    hourly. With CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton, simulations of cotton development proceed through
    a series of stages based on photothermal unit accumulation from planting to harvest,
    including emergence, first leaf, first flower, first seed, first cracked boll
    (physiological maturity), and 90 % open boll. Light interception is simulated
    based on a hedgerow canopy, where the plant canopy envelope is elliptical and
    defined by simulated canopy height and width (Boote and Pickering 1994). Potential
    carbon assimilation is computed from leaf-level biochemistry based on the model
    of Farquhar et al. (1980), and deductions for growth and maintenance respiration
    are calculated explicitly. The model calculates stress effects from deficit soil
    water and soil nitrogen conditions, which further reduce the carbohydrate available
    for plant growth. Assimilated carbon is partitioned to various plant parts, including
    leaves, stems, roots, bolls, and seed cotton. Simulated plant growth responds
    to management practices, cultivar selection, soil properties, and meteorological
    conditions. Management inputs required for model simulations include plant population;
    row spacing; seed depth; planting dates; dates and amounts of irrigation; dates,
    amounts, and type of fertilizer application; and dates, depths, and type of tillage.
    These inputs were specified as recorded during the field experiments. Cultivar
    parameters define day length sensitivity, heat units needed to progress through
    developmental stages, maximum single leaf photosynthetic rate, single leaf size,
    specific leaf area, maximum partitioning to bolls, individual seed size, threshing
    percentage, and oil and protein composition of seeds. Many of these parameters
    were specified based on the results of Thorp et al. (2014b), who performed the
    first evaluation of CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton for the central Arizona environment. Soil
    profiles are defined by soil water limits, root growth factors, saturated hydraulic
    conductivity, bulk density, pH, and initial conditions for water, inorganic nitrogen,
    and organic carbon. Many of these soil profile parameters were specified using
    site-specific data through the Geospatial Simulation tool in Quantum GIS. Required
    meteorological data include daily inputs for minimum and maximum temperature,
    solar irradiance, wind speed, dew point temperature, and precipitation. Meteorological
    data were obtained from an Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET; http://ag.arizona.edu/azmet/)
    station approximately 1.5 km from the field site. Water deficits in the CSM are
    simulated when the potential demand for water lost through plant transpiration
    and soil water evaporation is higher than the amount of water that can be supplied
    by the soil through the root system (Anothai et al. 2013). As in the study by
    Thorp et al. (2014b), potential ET was calculated using a new approach that combined
    the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration
    Equation (Walter et al. 2005) with the approach of DeJonge et al. (2012) for calculation
    of a crop coefficient from simulated LAI. The soil water balance in the CSM uses
    a tipping bucket approach for a one-dimensional soil profile (Ritchie 1998). The
    CSM also includes algorithms for soil and plant nitrogen balance simulations (Godwin
    and Singh 1998). Additional details about CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton can be found in Jones
    et al. (2003) and Thorp et al. (2014a, b). Model inversion Preliminary simulations
    showed that site-specific parameter adjustments were required to improve agreement
    between measured and simulated site-specific data. The simulated annealing optimization
    algorithm within the Geospatial Simulation tool was used for these parameter adjustments.
    Five model parameters were identified for adjustment between a range of values:
    SLAVR, RHGT, SRGF, XFRT, and EORATIO (Table 1). These parameters were selected
    based on prior knowledge of parameter sensitivity (Thorp et al. 2014b) and the
    results of preliminary optimizations that tested a variety of parameter combinations.
    SLAVR is the potential specific leaf area for the cultivar (cm2 g−1). Preliminary
    optimization tests led to different ranges for SLAVR in 2009 and 2011. Thus, the
    upper and lower bounds for SLAVR were specified differently in the 2 years (Table
    1). Higher SLAVR values in 2009 could be related to the atypical planting density
    in that year. RHGT is an ecotype parameter that governs the height per node relative
    to the standard species definition. SRGF are the root growth factors, ranging
    from 0 to 1, defined uniquely at each simulated soil depth increment. XFRT is
    the maximum fraction of daily growth that is partitioned to bolls during the reproductive
    growth phase. EORATIO is a maximum crop coefficient parameter used to calculate
    potential ET (PET) from ETo: Table 1 Lower bounds (LB) and upper bounds (UB) for
    five model parameters adjusted by simulating annealing optimization using data
    from the 2009 and 2011 growing seasons Full size table $$ K_{c} { = 0} . 3 5 {\\text{
    + (EORATIO }}- 0 . 3 5 ) * ( 1 -{\\text{ exp}}(-0 . 7 0 * {\\text{LAI))}} $$ (5)
    $$ {\\text{PET = }}K_{c} * {\\text{ET}}_{o} $$ (6) Equation 5 was adapted from
    DeJonge et al. (2012) using a minimum cotton crop coefficient of 0.35 (Allen et
    al. 1998) and hard-coded in the model’s ET routine. Using an approach similar
    to Paz et al. (1998), SRGF parameters were set to 1.0 for soil layers above 30
    cm and declined linearly to 0.0 below 30 cm. In this case, the parameter to be
    optimized was the soil profile depth at which SRGF became 0.0 (SRGF0), and SRGF
    values in each soil layer were calculated accordingly prior to simulation. The
    SRGF0 parameter was permitted flexibility from 150 to 350 cm (Table 1), although
    the soil profile depth was simulated only to 210 cm. Thus, if SRGF0 was higher
    than 210 cm, the only effect was to increase SRGF parameters in all soil depths
    from 30 to 210 cm. The SRGF parameter for a given soil layer specifies the ability
    that layer to support root growth, but actual root growth and maximum simulated
    rooting depth also depends on photosynthate availability, soil water and nitrogen
    availability, and plant senescence. Specifying SRGF values in deep soil layers
    does not guarantee that root growth will be simulated there. A multiple criteria
    objective function (f OBJ) was developed to solve the inverse problem for each
    harvest zone in each growing season: $$ f_{\\text{OBJ}} { = } \\sqrt {\\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\left( {\\alpha_{i} \\left( {S_{i} - M_{i} } \\right)^{2}
    } \\right)} $$ (7) where n criteria were evaluated, S i and M i were respectively
    the simulated and measured values for the ith criterion, and α i is a factor used
    to rescale data for the ith criterion. For the 2009 season, five criteria were
    included in the objective function, including cumulative ET from 26 May (DOY 146)
    to 23 September (DOY 266), maximum crop height, LAI on 3 June (DOY 154), LAI on
    30 July (DOY 211), and seed cotton yield. In 2011, eight criteria were evaluated,
    including cumulative ET from 11 May (DOY 131) to 19 September (DOY 262), maximum
    crop height, seed cotton yield, and LAI on five dates: 26 May (DOY 146), 9 June
    (DOY 160), 21 July (DOY 202), 4 August (DOY 216), and 18 August (DOY 230). To
    improve the performance of the optimization, the rescaling factor, α, for each
    quantity was calculated as the inverse of the mean measured value and used to
    adjust the data to similar magnitude, typically ranging from 0 to 10. Simulated
    annealing optimization was set to perform a maximum of 1000 evaluations for each
    simulation zone with a convergence criterion of f OBS < 0.05. The utility of the
    above model inversion protocol for applications in precision agriculture depends
    on the intended use for the model. For example, models are often used to study
    the results of agronomic experiments post hoc, as was true for the present study,
    with intent to improve model design, gain insights on model parameterization,
    or develop new techniques for model use. One advantage of this approach is the
    availability of data collected over the entire growing season, including yield.
    Other potential uses include guiding management decisions during the growing season
    or projecting future crop yield given information to date. A common issue in these
    modeling applications is a lack of information to characterize future conditions.
    For example, if the model is to be used to forecast yield, the optimization strategy
    tested above will not work due to lack of knowledge on future yield, which drives
    the adjustment of the XFRT parameter. To consider the case of within-season modeling
    applications, spatial optimizations were rerun while maintaining XFRT at a constant
    value of 0.90 and removing measured and simulated yield data from the objective
    function (Eq. 7). The constant XFRT value of 0.90 was based on model inversion
    results for XFRT with yield data included. Finally, to evaluate the model’s ability
    without spatial optimization, simulations were rerun using the average optimized
    values for EORATIO, RHGT, SLAVR, SRGF, and XFRT, specified equally for all 320
    harvest zones. Successful inversion of simulation models requires the consideration
    of two modeling concepts: parameter identifiability and equifinality (Luo et al.
    2009). Identifiable model parameters are those that can be constrained by a set
    of data according to a given model formulation. Equifinality occurs when the objective
    function (Eq. 7) is unresponsive to parameter adjustments, resulting in multiple
    parameter values that fit the data equally well. To address these concepts for
    the present problem, model inversions with yield data included were conducted
    a second time using identical input data and simulation methodologies. With differences
    driven by the pseudorandom nature of the simulated annealing optimization algorithm,
    comparisons of parameter estimates from two independent model inversions provided
    insights on parameter identifiability and equifinality issues. Model application
    After calibrating the model for site-specific conditions, additional simulations
    were conducted to assess site-specific yield responses to alternative irrigation
    management strategies. Irrigation rates were adjusted from 50 to 130 % of the
    actual irrigation rates applied to each zone (i.e., the 100 % level was the same
    rate as actually applied.). With an incremental adjustment of 1 %, 81 alternative
    irrigation rates were tested. Each adjustment percentage was applied uniformly
    to all irrigation events during the growing season. The dates of irrigation events
    were not modified. Simulated seed cotton yield and total seasonal applied irrigation
    rate were used to calculate the irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE, kg ha−1
    mm−1) for each management alternative: $$ {\\text{IWUE = }}\\frac{\\text{Seed
    cotton yield}}{\\text{Applied irrigation depth}} $$ (8) The simulations were used
    to determine the irrigation rate that maximized IWUE in each zone for both the
    2009 and 2011 growing seasons. The optimum simulated irrigation rate was expressed
    as a percentage of the actual irrigation rate applied in each zone. Results and
    discussion Model evaluation With site-specific optimization using a multiple criteria
    objective function, the model was able to simulate site-specific LAI, maximum
    canopy height, seed cotton yield, and seasonal ET with reasonable accuracy. For
    the 2009 season, the root mean squared error (RMSE) between measured and simulated
    data was 0.60 for LAI (14.7 % of mean observed values), 0.05 m for canopy height
    (3.7 % of mean observed values), 0.22 Mg ha−1 for yield (4.5 % of mean observed
    values), and 0.05 m for ET (5.4 % of mean observed values) (Fig. 2). Even after
    optimization, the model tended to overestimate LAI later in the growing season
    (Fig. 2a). The 2009 season was characterized by a higher than normal planting
    density, 22.0 plants m−2. Since CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton was previously shown to overestimate
    LAI when planting densities were at this level (Thorp et al. 2014b), the model’s
    simulation of resource competition at higher planting densities needs to be fine-tuned.
    Higher planting densities likely increased competition for light resources in
    the canopy, which led to greater stem elongation and higher measured canopy heights
    in 2009 (Fig. 2b) as compared to 2011 (Fig. 3b). With iterative adjustment to
    five parameters, the results show that the model was able to simulate spatial
    variability in multiple variables simultaneously. Fig. 2 Simulated versus measured
    a leaf area index (LAI) on two dates, b maximum cotton canopy height, c seed cotton
    yield, and d cumulative evapotranspiration (ET) during the 2009 growing season
    at Maricopa, Arizona Full size image Fig. 3 Simulated versus measured a leaf area
    index (LAI) on five dates, b maximum cotton canopy height, c seed cotton yield,
    and d cumulative evapotranspiration (ET) during the 2011 growing season at Maricopa,
    Arizona Full size image For the 2011 season, the RMSE between measured and simulated
    data was 0.28 for LAI (8.3 % of mean observed values), 0.05 m for canopy height
    (3.9 % of mean observed values), 0.19 Mg ha−1 for yield (4.6 % of mean observed
    values), and 0.05 m for ET (5.3 % of mean observed values) (Fig. 3). Simulations
    of LAI were improved in 2011 when planting density was more typical, 15.2 plants
    m−2. Also, five observations of LAI were available in this season, which may have
    improved the performance of the LAI optimization as compared to 2009. It is remarkable
    that simulated LAI compares so well with measurements both over space and at multiple
    time points (Fig. 3a). Simulation errors for canopy height, seed cotton yield,
    and ET were similar among the 2009 and 2011 growing seasons. Model inversion evaluation
    Table 2 compares the simulation results when model inversion was tested with yield
    data included and yield data excluded and also when no spatial optimization was
    used. When spatial yield measurements were incorporated into the optimization,
    the model was able to collectively explain variability in measured spatial LAI,
    crop height, yield, and ET data (Figs. 1, 2; Table 2). Generally, RMSEs between
    measured and simulated values were less than 10 %, and the Pearson correlation
    coefficients (r) were greater than 0.70 (Table 2). Exceptions included LAI in
    the early season, likely due to the low magnitude of these values as compared
    to the potential for measurement and modeling error. Also, with yield data included,
    correlation coefficients for measured and simulated ET were lower (0.67 in 2009
    and 0.71 in 2011) than that for many other variables, although RMSE was reasonable.
    This result highlighted several possible issues: (1) difficulty in simulating
    ET accurately even with model optimization, (2) greater ET variability at the
    scale of the 320 harvest zones than was determined at the 112 neutron access locations,
    and (3) uncertainty in site-specific irrigation depth estimates contributing to
    error in ‘measured’ ET estimates (Eq. 1). Optimizations with yield included represent
    the best fit that could be achieved with full season data given potential for
    both measurement and modeling error. Table 2 Root mean squared error (RMSE) and
    Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between measured and simulated data with
    model inversion based on inclusion and exclusion of yield data and with no spatial
    optimization applied Full size table When yield data was excluded from the model
    inversion, the results demonstrated much greater RMSE between measured and simulated
    yield, and correlation coefficients were poor (0.11 in 2009 and 0.09 in 2011;
    Table 2). Generally, simulations of other variables improved due to fewer constraints
    on the optimization. With regard to model use for site-specific yield forecasting,
    these results were unfavorable and highlighted several possible issues: (1) processes
    that contribute to boll formation and growth in response to site-specific conditions
    were not adequately represented in the model, (2) the measured LAI, crop height,
    and ET data available in this study were insufficient to forecast crop yield using
    the model optimization protocol, (3) the model was overfit to measured LAI, crop
    height, and ET data at the expense of accurate yield simulations, and (4) the
    optimization should possibly focus on an alternative set of parameters. The RMSE
    between measured and simulated yield was greater in 2009 (48.8 %) than in 2011
    (26.9 %), indicating that the additional LAI measurements in 2011 may have helped
    constrain the yield simulation in the latter year. Yield is perhaps the most complex
    yet most important trait of many field crops. Challenges to its accurate prediction
    using in-season data remain (Nearing et al. 2012; Thorp et al. 2010). The results
    show that the model inversion approach could be practical as a guide for in-season
    management decisions. By removing yield from the optimization, simulations of
    LAI, crop height, and ET were improved in most cases (Table 2). Thus, a plausible
    scenario may be to use sequential estimates of LAI from remote or proximal sensors
    along with sequential estimates of ET from soil moisture sensors or canopy temperature
    sensors to update the model during the growing season. In this case, the model’s
    utility lies in projecting LAI, biomass growth, or crop water use over a period
    of days or weeks until the next irrigation or fertilization event. The modeling
    objective would be to appropriately balance near-term crop growth with near-term
    resource use given economic or environmental constraints. Yield estimates would
    not be necessary for these decisions, especially considering that yield formation
    processes are not simulated until midway through the season and that management
    for adequate biomass accumulation is the first step to optimize yield. Alternatively,
    novel sensors for counting bolls could be developed to provide data for updating
    model parameters associated with the formation of yield components. A variety
    of approaches are available for such model updates, including parameter estimation
    approaches as described herein and also Bayesian techniques using ensemble Kalman
    filters (Nearing et al. 2012), although many existing crop simulation models are
    not well-designed for the latter approach. Results demonstrated the importance
    of in-season site-specific measurements of LAI, canopy height, and ET to guide
    the model toward more accurate simulations of spatial variability. When the average
    optimized values for EORATIO, RHGT, SLAVR, SRGF, and XFRT were specified equally
    for all 320 harvest zones, performance statistics were generally poorer as compared
    to cases with spatial model optimization (Table 2). The results reflect the ability
    of the model to simulate spatial variability on its own, with soil hydraulic conductivity,
    soil water limits, bulk density, initial soil water content, and irrigation rates
    specified site-specifically as measured during the experiments. Perhaps with the
    exception of yield, RMSEs between measured and simulated values were generally
    comparable, albeit higher, to the cases with spatial optimization, likely due
    to the model’s general ability to simulate field-average conditions without spatial
    optimization. However, correlation coefficients were markedly reduced for many
    variables in both seasons. This lack of correlation between measured and simulated
    values demonstrates the model’s inability to simulate site-specific conditions
    without efforts to tune model parameters using in-season measurements. Interestingly,
    yield simulations with no spatial optimization were better than with spatial optimization
    when yield was excluded. This may highlight model overfitting to other measurements
    as a primary reason for poor yield simulations in the latter case. Given the need
    for techniques to tune CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton to site-specific conditions, this study
    presents an approach for fitting the model to multiple site-specific measurements.
    Parameter estimation With a few exceptions, the parameters values resulting from
    model inversion over 320 spatial zones were normally distributed in 2009 (Fig.
    4) and 2011 (Fig. 5). The SLAVR parameter (potential specific leaf area) ranged
    from 143 to 225 cm2 g−1 with a mean of 186 cm2 g−1 in 2009 (Fig. 4a) and from
    106 to 176 cm2 g−1 with a mean of 139 cm2 g−1 in 2011 (Fig. 5a). Lower estimated
    values in 2011 were the result of lower maximum measured LAI in 2011 (Fig. 3a)
    as compared to 2009 (Fig. 2a), perhaps caused by differences in planting density.
    Optimized SLAVR parameter values were generally highly correlated with simulated
    LAI (r > 0.9; Table 3), indicating that the observed LAI data was mainly responsible
    for driving SLAVR adjustments. In 2011, SLAVR was also moderately correlated with
    simulated crop height (r = 0.61) and simulated seed cotton yield (r = 0.43). Results
    for the RHGT parameter (relative canopy height) were similar in both seasons and
    ranged from 0.58 to 0.86 with a mean of 0.71 (Figs. 4b, 5b). As expected, optimum
    RHGT values were most highly correlated with simulated crop height (r = 0.78 in
    2009 and r = 0.96 in 2011; Table 3), indicating that the observed canopy height
    data drove RHGT adjustments. However, RHGT was also well correlated with simulated
    LAI, likely because canopy height was used to calculate the LAI ‘measurements’
    (Eq. 4). The SRGF0 parameter used to calculate the linear decline of SRGF (soil
    root growth factors) in each soil layer varied from 150 to 350 cm, but the distribution
    was non-normal in both seasons (Figs. 4c, 5c). As demonstrated by the histograms,
    the parameter values were on average lower in 2009 (240 cm) as compared to 2011
    (275 cm). Optimized values were weakly correlated with simulated seed cotton yield
    (r = 0.31) and ET (r = 0.22) in 2009 and with simulated crop height (r = 0.21)
    and seed cotton yield (r = 0.20) in 2011 (Table 3). Mean values for the XFRT parameter
    (fraction of daily growth partitioned to bolls) were 0.93 in 2009 and 0.85 in
    2011 (Figs. 4d, 5d). In 2009, XFRT was weakly correlated with simulated ET (r
    = 0.30), but the correlation with simulated seed cotton yield was poor (r = −0.06;
    Table 3). The tendency of XFRT values to be near the theoretical maximum of 1.0
    (Fig. 4d) likely impacted the 2009 correlations. In 2011, XFRT was more highly
    correlated with simulated seed cotton yield (r = 0.66; Table 3), indicating that
    the observed yield data drove adjustments of XFRT in this growing season. The
    EORATIO parameter (maximum crop coefficient) ranged from 1.01 to 1.41 with a mean
    of 1.17 in 2009 (Fig. 4e) and from 1.00 to 1.50 with a mean of 1.21 in 2011 (Fig.
    5e). The EORATIO values were highly correlated with simulated ET (r = 0.87 in
    2009 and r = 0.91 in 2011; Table 3), indicating as expected that the observed
    ET data drove adjustments of EORATIO. Correlation results demonstrated that the
    optimum parameter values were differentially impacted by the measurements incorporated
    in the multiple criteria objective function (Table 3). Fig. 4 Histograms of CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton

    table Parameter identifiability and equifinality evaluation Comparing the resulting
    SLAVR values from two independent model inversions showed that the SLAVR estimates
    were highly repeatable (Fig. 6a). As compared to other optimized parameters, SLAVR
    values from independent model inversions had lower RMSE and were more highly correlated
    (Table 4). This means SLAVR demonstrated relatively good parameter identifiability
    and did not lead to equifinality of the model’s response surface. With better
    performance statistics in 2011 as compared to 2009, the SLAVR parameter was more
    identifiable in 2011, likely due to more LAI measurements in that year. Comparisons
    of the SRGF0 parameter values demonstrated obvious problems (Fig. 6c). The optimum
    values for this parameter were often dissimilar when comparing two independent
    model inversions, and RMSE and correlation statistics were worst among all the
    parameters (Table 4). The model inversion procedure was less able to identify
    this parameter given the available data, and the objective function was likely
    unresponsive to adjustments of this parameter, especially as compared to the other
    parameters. As a result, the semi-random nature of the simulated annealing algorithm
    led to large discrepancies in the optimal SRGF0 values obtained from independent
    optimizations. One positive outcome was that the correlations of the SRGF0 parameter
    with simulated yield from the second model inversion (Table 4) was very similar
    to that result for the first model inversion (Table 3). Although these correlations
    were weak, they were consistent for two model inversions in both growing seasons.
    Thus, the adjustment of SRGF provided at least minimal guidance for improvements
    in the simulation of spatial yield, as previously demonstrated by Paz et al. (1998).
    Due to great uncertainty about the dynamics of root growth and difficulties in
    constraining SRGF parameters without such knowledge, continued investigation into
    methods for adjustments of the root growth simulation is recommended. For example,
    instead of using a linear decline in SRGF with soil profile depth, alternative
    shape functions could be tested. Fig. 6 Comparison of optimal parameter values
    from two model inversions based on identical input data. Results are shown for
    a potential specific leaf area (SLAVR), b relative canopy height (RHGT), c soil
    profile depth for soil root growth factor (SRGF) calculations, d maximum fraction
    of daily growth partitioned to bolls (XFRT), and e the maximum crop coefficient
    (EORATIO). Data are compared for 320 management zones in both the 2009 and 2011
    growing seasons at Maricopa, Arizona Full size image Table 4 Root mean squared
    error (RMSE) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between optimal parameter
    values from two independent model inversions based on identical input data and
    simulation methodologies Full size table The RMSEs between measured and simulated
    LAI, canopy height, seed cotton yield, and ET from the second model inversion
    (not shown) were all within 0.4 % of that obtained for the first model inversion
    (Figs. 2, 3). Plots of these relationships were also not visually different. Thus,
    although estimates from two model inversions varied substantially for some parameters
    (Fig. 6), the resulting simulation outcome was essentially the same. This highlights
    the equifinality issues in this model inversion problem. Irrigation analysis Simulations
    of the irrigation rate that maximized IWUE in each zone permitted evaluation of
    the four irrigation scheduling approaches used during the field experiment. Averaged
    over zones, the simulated seasonal deep seepage rates with the applied irrigation
    rates in 2009 were 4, 59, 37, and 34 mm for the FAO, MAC, VI_A, and VI_B treatments,
    respectively. Also, the optimum simulated irrigation rates for FAO, MAC, VI_A,
    and VI_B treatments were 111, 92, 98, and 96 %, respectively, of actual irrigation
    rates applied in 2009 (Fig. 7). Thus, the MAC treatment generally received too
    much irrigation, because deep seepage was highest among all treatments and only
    92 % of the actual irrigation rate was needed to optimize simulated IWUE. On the
    other hand, the FAO treatment received too little irrigation, because the simulation
    analysis showed that 111 % of the actual irrigation rate was needed to optimize
    simulated IWUE. The treatments managed using NDVI from remote sensing images were
    only slightly over irrigated in 2009, indicating that the techniques led to improved
    irrigation management as compared to more traditional methods. Under irrigation
    by the FAO method was likely related to the high planting density in 2009, because
    the FAO irrigation scheduling model did not account for planting density effects
    on ET. The remote sensing approaches accounted for this affect using dynamic vegetation
    indices, while FAO did not account for it. Effects of spatially variable infiltration
    are evident, particularly for the FAO treatments (Fig. 7). For three of the four
    FAO treatments, there is evidence that the southern portion of the treatment plot
    received irrigation applications that more closely matched the optimum irrigation
    rate (i.e., values closer to 100 %), while the northern portion of the FAO plots
    typically needed over 110 % of actual irrigation applied to maximize simulated
    IWUE. This spatial pattern is likely due to increased opportunity time for infiltration
    on the southern side of the field, where surface irrigation commenced. The effect
    was stronger for FAO, because this treatment received the lowest irrigation rate.
    Increased opportunity time for infiltration on the south side of the FAO plots
    left the north side in a more severe water deficit condition. Fig. 7 Irrigation
    rates that maximized the simulated irrigation water use efficiency in the 2009
    growing season, expressed as a percentage of actual irrigation rate applied. Simulations
    showed that MAC treatment plots were generally over-irrigated while FAO treatment
    plots were under-irrigated in 2009 (Color figure online) Full size image In 2011,
    simulated cumulative deep seepage rates with the applied irrigation rates were
    higher than the first season: 87, 69, 104, and 80 mm for FAO, MAC, VI_A, and VI_B
    treatments, respectively. Irrigation rates that maximized simulated IWUE for FAO,
    MAC, VI_A, and VI_B treatments were 89, 96, 88, and 94 %, respectively, of actual
    irrigation rates applied (Fig. 8). Thus, all four of the irrigation scheduling
    methods generally resulted in over irrigation. The FAO method did not lead to
    under irrigation in 2011, because the planting density was more typical. Under-irrigated
    zones were more related to surface irrigation effects, particularly in the northeastern
    portion of the field. Independent of treatment, plots in the easternmost treatment
    block were more well-watered in the south central portion of the plot as compared
    to the northern portion of the plot. This could again be due to increased opportunity
    time for infiltration in the southern portion of the field, where surface irrigation
    commenced. However, this effect was typically not demonstrated in the westernmost
    treatment blocks. This could highlight an effect due to soil texture variability.
    Since the western portion of the field was more clayey and the eastern portion
    was more sandy, the eastern treatments could be more sensitive to spatially variable
    infiltration opportunity time, while the clay in the west helped to mitigate the
    issue. Fig. 8 Irrigation rates that maximized the simulated irrigation water use
    efficiency in the 2011 growing season, expressed as a percentage of actual irrigation
    rate applied. Simulations showed that much of the field was over-irrigated in
    2011 (Color figure online) Full size image One issue with this irrigation analysis
    was the assumption that all parameters other than irrigation rates remained fixed
    at the value obtained from the model inversion procedure. In reality, changing
    the irrigation rate in a zone would also change the measured ET from Eq. 1, which
    could in turn change the value obtained for EORATIO during model inversion. Likewise,
    real adjustments to irrigation rates would also likely impact measured LAI, canopy
    height, and seed cotton yield by changing water interactions, which would in turn
    affect values obtained for SLAVR, RHGT, and XFRT with model inversion. Results
    of this study demonstrated that site-specific parameter adjustments were needed
    to simulate spatial variability in crop growth characteristics and ET (Table 2;
    Figs. 4, 5). Results also showed that parameter estimates could vary substantially
    as a result of equifinality (Fig.  6), but led to the same simulation outcome.
    This may lead to questions on whether the estimated site-specific parameters were
    meaningful enough to provide realistic simulated seed cotton yield and IWUE responses
    to irrigation rate adjustments. The conclusion was that meaning can be derived,
    because spatial patterns related to the irrigation scheduling method were present
    (Fig. 7) and spatial patterns potentially explained by the surface irrigation
    dynamics were evident (Figs. 7, 8). Also, several of the treatment plots were
    over irrigated in all 20 harvest zones (Figs. 7, 8) and one was under irrigated
    in all 20 zones (Fig. 7), a result that would be unexpected if random effects
    associated with parameter estimation were an issue. Since surface irrigation was
    used for the field experiment, estimating the irrigation depths applied in each
    zone was perhaps the most challenging aspect of this simulation study. An in-line
    flow meter provided the total volume of water applied to each treatment plot,
    but complex hydraulic processes determined the spatial distribution of infiltration
    within the plot area. Spatial variability in infiltration potentially resulted
    from surface irrigation management factors (Hunsaker et al. 1999) and spatial
    variability in soil type or preferential flow paths (Jaynes and Hunsaker 1989).
    Additionally, an unknown quantity of water moved laterally into the surrounding
    border dikes during surface irrigation, which complicated the calculation of irrigation
    depth from measured irrigation volume and plot area. Analysis of advance and recession
    data and WinSRFR simulation results assisted with spatial irrigation depth specification,
    but considerable uncertainty in these estimates remained and likely contributed
    to simulation uncertainty reported in this study. Preliminary efforts aimed to
    reduce this uncertainty by incorporating the adjustment of irrigation rates into
    the model inversion protocol. However, these efforts failed, because changing
    irrigation rates changed estimates of measured ET (Eq. 1) which made the minimum
    solution of the objective function (Eq. 7) a moving target. Also, adjusting the
    zone-level irrigation rates required that water be redistributed spatially to
    maintain the water balance within a treatment plot, given the total volume of
    water applied. This greatly complicated the model inversion procedure, because
    parameters for 20 zones had to be adjusted collectively. In the end, irrigation
    rates were held fixed using best estimates, and other parameters were adjusted
    as described above. Central pivot and lateral move irrigation systems offer great
    potential to improve the methodologies reported herein, because applied site-specific
    irrigation rates could be better quantified. Also, such systems would permit field
    testing of the precision irrigation recommendations generated from this simulation
    approach. Conclusions An advanced goal for precision agriculture is the integration
    of real-time sensor data with computer algorithms to provide recommendations for
    variable-rate application of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer while considering
    potential environmental impacts, resource limitations, and climate forecasts.
    This requires the development of both hardware and software components and techniques
    to integrate them. Advancing toward this goal, the present study synthesized information
    from multiple sources to adjust the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model to site-specific
    crop and water use conditions. Positive methodological outcomes included (1) further
    testing of the Geospatial Simulation software (Thorp and Bronson 2013) to integrate
    multiple geospatial data sets and conduct simulation analyses for two cotton experiments
    in Arizona, (2) the identification of several sensitive parameters for fitting
    the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model to site-specific data, and (3) the development of
    a methodology to optimize the model using multiple criteria objective functions.
    The approach led to satisfactory comparisons of measured and simulated data for
    both cotton growing seasons, although assessments of parameter identifiability
    and equifinality suggested that parameter estimates were sometimes non-unique.
    Some parameters were more identifiable than others, and identifiability depended
    on the data available for model inversion. Future investigation should identify
    ways to mitigate these effects, for example through modification of the simulation
    algorithm, refinement of the model inversion strategy, or inclusion of additional
    data sets. Efforts to use the simulation methodology for real-time precision irrigation
    management would identify bottlenecks in data collection and processing pipelines
    and improve the reliability of the approach for practical on-farm use. The present
    study aimed to integrate data from multiple sources to characterize different
    aspects of the cropping system, but there remains great opportunity for streamlining
    the platforms and procedures used to collect these data. For example, active reflectance
    sensors mounted on ground-based vehicles are an alternative to passive airborne
    imaging. Also, ultrasonic sensors are being developed for plant height measurements
    (Scotford and Miller 2004), which would eliminate reliance on manual approaches.
    Incorporating reflectance sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and soil moisture sensors
    into a wireless sensor network would provide all the data needed for real-time,
    site-specific analysis of crop responses to irrigation management using the simulation
    methodology presented herein. Unmanned aerial vehicles are another potential platform
    for airborne data, but the need for soil moisture and plant height measurements
    favors data collection approaches on the ground. The Geospatial Simulation software
    was designed to streamline geospatial data processing and integration, but data
    from some sources, images for example, can require additional processing outside
    of the GIS environment. The present study provides guidance on the types of data
    that are necessary, but the best approach to collect these data remains unclear
    and likely depends on the specific application. Once the appropriate data can
    be rapidly collected and integrated with appropriate computer algorithms, the
    benefits of precision crop management can be realized. After calibration to site-specific
    conditions, CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton identified areas of the field that required more
    or less irrigation water to maximize simulated IWUE. For operational capability,
    future research should reduce the computational time for simulations, perhaps
    by simplifying the algorithm to include only the processes necessary for irrigation
    management or by investigating options for parallelization on multi-core processors.
    This study demonstrated the strength of models that combine simulations of both
    crop growth and soil water balance, which facilitated the synthesis of data from
    multiple sources and permitted calculations of IWUE as a statistic for optimizing
    site-specific irrigation management. References Allen, R. G., Pereira, L. S.,

  description: 'LAI of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and soil water content
    of the topsoil (200 mm) and of the subsoil (500 mm) were considered as state variables
    of a dynamic soil-crop system. This system was assumed to progress according to
    a Bayesian probabilistic state space model, in which real values of LAI and soil
    water content were daily introduced in order to correct the model trajectory and
    reach better future evolution. The chosen crop model was mini STICS which can
    reduce the computing and execution times while ensuring the robustness of data
    processing and estimation. To predict simultaneously state variables and model
    parameters in this non-linear environment, three techniques were used: extended
    Kalman filtering (EKF), particle filtering (PF), and variational filtering (VF).
    The significantly improved performance of the VF method when compared to EKF and
    PF is demonstrated. The variational filter has a low computational complexity
    and the convergence speed of states and parameters estimation can be adjusted
    independently. Detailed case studies demonstrated that the root mean square error
    of the three estimated states (LAI and soil water content of two soil layers)
    was smaller and that the convergence of all considered parameters was ensured
    when using VF. Assimilating measurements in a crop model allows accurate prediction
    of LAI and soil water content at a local scale. As these biophysical properties
    are key parameters in the crop-plant system characterization, the system has the
    potential to be used in precision farming to aid farmers and decision makers in
    developing strategies for site-specific management of inputs, such as fertilizers
    and water irrigation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.'

    11 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract LAI of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
    L.) and soil water content of the topsoil (200 mm) and of the subsoil (500 mm)
    were considered as state variables of a dynamic soil-crop system. This system
    was assumed to progress according to a Bayesian probabilistic state space model,
    in which real values of LAI and soil water content were daily introduced in order
    to correct the model trajectory and reach better future evolution. The chosen
    crop model was mini STICS which can reduce the computing and execution times while
    ensuring the robustness of data processing and estimation. To predict simultaneously
    state variables and model parameters in this non-linear environment, three techniques
    were used: extended Kalman filtering (EKF), particle filtering (PF), and variational
    filtering (VF). The significantly improved performance of the VF method when compared
    to EKF and PF is demonstrated. The variational filter has a low computational
    complexity and the convergence speed of states and parameters estimation can be
    adjusted independently. Detailed case studies demonstrated that the root mean
    square error of the three estimated states (LAI and soil water content of two
    soil layers) was smaller and that the convergence of all considered parameters
    was ensured when using VF. Assimilating measurements in a crop model allows accurate
    prediction of LAI and soil water content at a local scale. As these biophysical
    properties are key parameters in the crop-plant system characterization, the system
    has the potential to be used in precision farming to aid farmers and decision
    makers in developing strategies for site-specific management of inputs, such as
    fertilizers and water irrigation. Similar content being viewed by others How to

    Article Open access 21 March 2024 The Soil. Physical, Chemical and Biological
    Properties Chapter © 2016 Introduction Up to now, despite the wide development
    of agricultural technology, decisions regarding field management are still made
    by the farmer (Hautala and Hakojarvi 2011). There is thus a need for decision
    making systems furnishing strategies for effective management of inputs, such
    as fertilizers and irrigation water. Leaf area index (LAI) and soil water content
    are key parameters within this scope (Behera and Panda 2009). LAI is the total
    one-sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area (square meters per
    square meter). It determines the water and gas exchanges, and consequently influences
    the photosynthetic primary production and plant growth. Soil water content is
    the content of water in the soil, held in the spaces between soil particles. It
    greatly influences the processes related to plant growth and agricultural production
    since it affects the capacity of plants to extract water and soil nutrients. The
    prediction of soil water content is important for management practices, such as
    nitrogen redistribution or irrigation. In this paper, the prediction of LAI and
    soil water content relies on the fact that they are considered as state variables
    of a crop model. Indeed, a dynamic crop model analyses the temporal evolution
    of state variables as a function of input variables including soil and crop characteristics,
    management practices (namely, nitrogen supply), and climate variables. Nevertheless,
    accurate prediction of state variables is not straightforward in these models.
    Most of the equations describing the evolution of state variables are non-linear
    approximations of biophysical processes. For example, the evolution of LAI comprises
    three phases, growth, stability, and senescence described by different formalisms
    according to the models (Palosuoa et al. 2011). In STICS for example, these three
    phases are respectively described by logistic, constant and linear equations (Brisson
    et al. 2003). Uncertainties affect the input variables. Common problems encountered
    include miscalibration or poor maintenance of instruments, weather inputs taken
    too far from the experimental site and soil properties defined from published
    data soil series rather than field measurement (Bellochi et al. 2009). The importance
    of accurate soil and weather input data increases as the environment becomes more
    limiting for plant growth and development (Weiss and Wilhem 2006). Measurement
    uncertainties on the outputs have also important implications for model calibration
    and validation. As a consequence of the non-linearity, the state variables do
    not have a Gaussian distribution, even if all the errors are normally distributed.
    For these reasons, it is interesting to modify the model during the crop lifecycle
    to make it a better predictor for a specific situation, such as a given agricultural
    field (Makowski et al. 2004). Clearly, this implies introducing measurements of
    state variables such as the LAI and the soil water content in the model in order
    to estimate its accuracy and achieve better prediction. Regarding measurements,
    several methods have been developed to quantify LAI at the field scale (Jonckheere
    et al. 2004). The reference method, which involves harvesting the vegetation and
    measuring the area of all leaves within a delimitated area, is destructive. Other
    methods that infer LAI from measurements of the transmission of radiation through
    the canopy (Breda 2003) are non-destructive. For example, the Plant Canopy Analyser
    LAI 2000 (Li-COR, Lincoln, USA) is easy-to-apply and is often used to estimate
    the LAI indirectly. Its main drawback is due to the fact that the sensor cannot
    get totally underneath low-level canopies. To solve that problem, Van Wijk and
    Williams (2005) combined field measurements of canopy reflectance (NDVI) and light
    penetration through the canopy (gap-fraction) and obtained accurate non-destructive
    assessment of the variability of LAI in low level vegetation. More recently, methods
    have been proposed to obtain real-time data processing of LAI. Gebbers et al.
    (2011) developed a rapid mapping of the LAI on the basis of ground-based laser
    rangefinders mounted on a vehicle. Sakamoto et al. (2012) applied a camera-based
    observation system using vegetation indices for monitoring of seasonal changes
    in several biophysical parameters of maize such as LAI. Leemans et al. (2012)
    explored the potential of a stereo vision device to measure the LAI at different
    growth stages of wheat. In these three cases, the accuracy of the estimation was
    comparable to that obtained by commercial sensors. From these research studies,
    it appears that ground-based non-invasive sensors will become affordable in the
    near future to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of LAI with an acceptable
    accuracy and a reduced work load. A review of the available methods available
    for estimating soil water content is given by Dobriyal et al. (2012). The reference
    method is destructive and involves oven drying a soil sample of known volume at
    105 °C for 24 h. The water content is calculated by subtracting the oven dry weight
    from the initial field soil weight (Lunt et al. 2005). Besides methods based on
    radioactivity, measurement of the capacitance between soil-implanted electrodes,
    time domain reflectometry (TDR) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods are
    widely used. More recently, large arrays of sensors (using wireless sensors networks
    to transmit the data) developed for the field measurement of soil water content
    have been shown to be able to characterize automatically the spatio-temporal variability
    of soil water content (Stacheder et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2011; Sudha et al.
    2011). Low-cost and low-power sensors are distributed in the field and are included
    in platforms that efficiently integrate the measurement of soil water content
    (measurement of the capacitance between soil-implanted electrodes) and the data
    transmission to the end-user (even over long distances, typically several kilometers).
    With regard to the algorithms, the introduction of measurements of state variables
    such as the LAI and the soil water content into the model in order to correct
    ‘its trajectory’ and achieve better prediction may be considered as an optimal
    filtering problem. This consists of recursively updating the posterior distribution
    of the unobserved state given the sequence of observed data and the state evolution
    model. The filtering problem has been addressed with several methods, such as
    the Kalman filter (KF) which provides an optimal Bayesian solution but is limited
    by the non-universal Gaussian modeling assumptions. An application of this technique
    to a linear dynamic crop model predicting a single state variable, the winter
    wheat biomass, was presented by Makowski et al. (2004). The authors showed how
    the model predictions can be sequentially updated by using several measurements,
    and studied the sensitivity of the results to the variance of the model errors.
    The ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF) (Xiao et al. 2009), extended Kalman filtering
    (EKF) (Calvet 2000), and the unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) (Van Der Merwe and
    Wan 2001) have been proposed to improve the KF flexibility. Xiao et al. (2009)
    developed a real-time inversion technique to estimate LAI from time series reflectance
    data using a coupled dynamic and radiative transfer model. Other state estimation
    techniques use a Bayesian framework to estimate the state and/or parameter vector.
    This approach relies on computing the probability distribution of the unobserved
    state given a sequence of the observed data in addition to a state evolution model.
    Consider an observed data set y which is generated from a model defined by a set
    of unknown state variables and/or parameters z. The information about the data
    are completely expressed via the parametric probabilistic observation model \\(
    P(\\left. y \\right|z) \\). The randomness of a process can be solved by constructing
    a distribution \\( P(\\left. z \\right|y) \\), called the posterior distribution,
    which quantifies the information about the system after obtaining the measurements.
    According to Bayes theorem, the posterior can be expressed as $$ P\\left( {z\\left|
    y \\right.} \\right) = \\frac{{P\\left( {y\\left| z \\right.} \\right)P(z)}}{P(y)},
    $$ (1) where \\( P\\left( {\\left. y \\right|z} \\right) \\) is the conditional
    distribution of the data given the vector z, which is called the likelihood function,
    \\( P(z) \\) is the prior distribution which quantifies the information about
    z before obtaining the measurements, and \\( P(y) \\) is the distribution of the
    data. Unfortunately, for most non-linear systems and non-Gaussian noise observations,
    closed-form analytic expressions of the posterior distribution of the state vector
    are intractable (Kotecha and Djuric 2003). To overcome this drawback, a non-parametric
    Monte Carlo sampling-based method called particle filtering (PF) was proposed
    by Doucet and Tadic (2003). The latter method presents several advantages since:
    (i) it can account for the constraint of a small number of data samples, (ii)
    the online update of the filtering distribution and its compression are simultaneously
    performed, and (iii) it yields an optimal choice of the sampling distribution
    over the state variable by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence (MacKay
    2003). Recently, a variational filtering (VF) has been proposed for solving the
    non-linear parameter estimation problem (Mansouri et al. 2009) but, until now,
    the method has been applied only for tracking/localization in wireless sensor
    network problems. The variational filter can be applied to large parameter spaces,
    has better convergence properties and is easier to implement than the particle
    filter. Both of them can provide improved accuracy over the extended Kalman filter.
    Nevertheless, some practical challenges can affect the accuracy of estimated states
    and/or parameters, namely the presence of measurement noise in the data, the restricted
    availability of the measured data samples and the larger number of model parameters.
    The objectives of the paper are to compare three filtering methods to estimate
    the temporal evolution of LAI and soil water content of two soil layers (topsoil,
    200 mm and subsoil, 500 mm) during the whole plant lifecycle: the EKF, the PF
    and the VF. In this investigation, the state vector to be estimated at any time
    instant is assumed to follow a Gaussian model, where the expectation and the covariance
    matrix are constants. The comparison relies on the computation of the root mean
    square error (RMSE) and the number of parameters that can be accurately predicted.
    The basic crop model used in this study is mini STICS (Tremblay and Wallach 2004;
    Makowski et al. 2004) which has several advantages since it can reduce the computing
    and execution times and has the nice property of being a good dynamic model, ensuring
    the robustness of data processing and estimation. Materials and methods Problem
    statement A crop model can be described by a discrete set of equations: $$ \\begin{aligned}
    x_{k} & = f\\left( {x_{k - 1} ,u_{k - 1} ,\\theta_{k - 1} ,w_{k - 1} } \\right)
    \\\\ y_{k} & = h\\left( {x_{k} ,u_{k} ,\\theta_{k} ,v_{k} } \\right), \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (2) where k is an index corresponding to the time, \\( x_{k} \\) is the vector
    of state variables, \\( u_{t} \\) is the vector of input variables, \\( \\theta_{t}
    \\) is a parameter vector, \\( y_{k} \\) is the vector of the measured variables,
    \\( w_{t} \\) and \\( v_{t} \\) are respectively model and measurement noise vectors,
    g and l are non-linear differentiable functions, the first one determines the
    new state variables as a function of the preceding situation, while the second
    expresses the dependence of the measurements. It is assumed that the error terms
    \\( w_{t} \\) and \\( v_{t} \\) have normal distributions with zero expectation,
    and that they are mutually independent. Estimating the state vector \\( x_{k},
    \\) as well as the parameter vector θ k , it is assumed that the parameter vector
    is described by the following model: $$ \\theta_{k} = \\theta_{k - 1} + \\gamma_{k
    - 1} , $$ (3) where \\( \\gamma_{k - 1} \\) is white noise. In other words, the
    parameter vector model (3) corresponds to a stationary process, with an identity
    transition matrix, driven by white noise. A new state vector is defined that augments
    the two vectors together as follows: $$ z_{k} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    {x_{k} } \\\\ {\\theta_{k} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right] = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    {f\\left( {x_{k - 1} ,u_{k - 1} ,w_{k - 1} } \\right)} \\\\ {\\theta_{k - 1} +
    \\gamma_{k - 1} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right], $$ (4) where z k is assumed to
    follow a Gaussian model where at any time k the expectation µ k and the covariance
    matrix λ k are both constants. Also, defining the augmented vector, $$ \\varepsilon_{k
    - 1} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {w_{k - 1} } \\\\ {\\gamma_{k - 1} } \\\\
    \\end{array} } \\right] $$ (5) the model (2) can be written as: $$ \\begin{aligned}
    z_{k} & = \\Im \\left( {z_{k - 1} ,u_{k - 1} ,\\varepsilon_{k - 1} } \\right)
    \\\\ y_{k} & = \\Re \\left( {z_{k} ,u_{k} ,\\nu_{k} } \\right), \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (6) where \\( \\Im \\) and \\( \\Re \\) are differentiable non-linear functions.
    General state evolution model (GSEM) In this paper, a general state evolution
    model GSEM (Mansouri et al. 2009) is employed instead of the kinematic parameter
    model (Kotecha and Djuric 2003) usually used in tracking problems. In fact, the
    GSEM model is more practical for non-linear and non-gaussian situations where
    no a priori information on the state value is available. The state variable \\(
    z_{k} \\) at instant k is assumed to follow a Gaussian model, where the expectation
    µ k and the precision matrix λ k are both random. Gaussian distribution for the
    expectation and Wishart distribution for the precision matrix form a practical
    choice for the filtering implementation. The hidden state \\( z_{k} \\) is extended
    to an augmented state \\( \\alpha_{k} = \\left( {z_{k} ,\\mu_{k} ,\\lambda_{k}
    } \\right) \\), yielding a hierarchical model as follows, $$ \\begin{aligned}
    \\mu_{k} \\sim & N\\left( {\\mu_{k} \\left| {\\mu_{k - 1} ,\\overline{\\lambda
    }} \\right.} \\right) \\\\ \\lambda_{k} \\sim & W\\left( {\\lambda_{k} \\left|
    {\\overline{S}} \\right.} \\right) \\\\ z_{k} \\sim & N\\left( {\\mu_{k} \\left|
    {\\lambda_{k} } \\right.} \\right), \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (7) where the fixed
    hyper-parameters \\( \\overline{\\lambda } ,\\,\\overline{S} \\) and \\( \\overline{n}
    \\) are respectively the random walk precision matrix, the degrees of freedom
    and the precision of the Wishart distribution. Note that assuming random mean
    and covariance for the state \\( z_{k} \\) leads to a prior probability distribution
    covering a wide range of tail behaviors allowing discrete jumps in the state variable.
    In fact, the marginal state distribution is obtained by integrating over the mean
    and precision matrix: $$ p(z_{k} |z_{k - 1} ) = \\int {p(z_{k} |\\mu_{k} ,\\lambda_{k}
    )} p(\\mu_{k} ,\\lambda_{k} |x_{k - 1} )d\\mu_{k} \\lambda_{k} , $$ (8) where
    the integration with respect to the precision matrix leads to the known class
    of scale mixture distributions introduced by Barndorff-Nielsen (Kotecha and Djuric
    2003). Low values of the degrees of freedom \\( \\overline{n} \\) reflect the
    heavy tails of the marginal distribution \\( p(z_{k} |z_{k - 1} ). \\) Variational
    Bayesian filter The variational approach consists in approximating \\( p(\\alpha_{k}
    |z_{1:k} ) \\) by a separable distribution \\( q(\\alpha_{k} ) = q(x_{k} )q(\\mu_{k}
    )q(\\lambda_{k} ) \\) that minimizes the Kullback–Leibler divergence (DKL) between
    the true filtering distribution and the approximate distribution, $$ D_{KL} \\left(
    {q\\left\\| p \\right.} \\right) = \\int {q\\left( {\\alpha_{k} } \\right)\\log
    \\frac{{q\\left( {\\alpha_{k} } \\right)}}{{p\\left( {\\alpha_{k} \\left| {\\alpha_{1:k}
    } \\right.} \\right)}}d\\alpha_{k} } $$ (9) The minimization is subject to constraint
    \\( \\int {q\\left( {\\alpha_{k} } \\right)d\\alpha_{k} = 1} \\). The Lagrange
    multiplier method used in Vermaak et al. (2003) shows that the updated separable
    approximating distribution \\( q(\\alpha_{k} ) \\) has the following form: $$
    \\begin{aligned} q(z_{k} ) \\propto & p(y_{k} |z_{k} )N\\left( {z_{k} |\\left\\langle
    {\\mu_{k} } \\right\\rangle ,\\left\\langle {\\lambda_{k} } \\right\\rangle }
    \\right) \\\\ q(\\mu_{k} ) \\propto & N(\\mu_{k} |\\mu_{k}^{*} ,\\lambda_{k}^{*}
    ) \\\\ q(\\lambda_{k} ) \\propto & W_{n} (\\lambda_{k} |S_{k}^{*} ) \\\\ q(\\mu_{k}
    |\\mu_{k - 1} ) \\propto & N\\left( {\\left\\langle {\\mu_{k}^{p} } \\right\\rangle
    ,\\left\\langle {\\lambda_{k}^{p} } \\right\\rangle } \\right), \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (10) where \\( \\left\\langle . \\right\\rangle_{q} \\) denotes the expectation
    operator relative to the distribution q. The parameters are iteratively updated
    according to the following scheme: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\mu_{k}^{*} = & \\lambda_{k}^{*
    - 1} \\left( {\\left\\langle {\\lambda_{k} } \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {z_{k}
    } \\right\\rangle + \\mu_{k}^{p} \\lambda_{k}^{p} } \\right) \\\\ \\lambda_{k}^{*}
    & = \\left\\langle {\\lambda_{k} } \\right\\rangle + \\lambda_{k}^{p} \\\\ n^{*}
    & = \\overline{n} + 1 \\\\ S_{k}^{*} & = \\left( {\\left\\langle {z_{k} z_{k}^{T}
    } \\right\\rangle - \\left\\langle {z_{k} } \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {\\mu_{k}
    } \\right\\rangle^{T} + \\left\\langle {\\mu_{k} } \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle
    {z_{k} } \\right\\rangle^{T} + \\left\\langle {\\mu_{k} \\mu_{k}^{T} } \\right\\rangle
    + \\overline{S}^{ - 1} } \\right)^{ - 1} \\\\ \\mu_{k}^{p} & = \\mu_{k - 1}^{*}
    \\\\ \\lambda_{k}^{p} & = \\left( {\\lambda_{k - 1}^{* - 1} + \\overline{\\lambda
    }^{ - 1} } \\right) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (11) In fact, taking into account the
    separable approximate distribution at time \\( k - 1 \\), the predictive distribution
    is written, $$ \\begin{gathered} p(\\alpha_{k - 1} |z_{1:k - 1} ) \\propto \\int
    {p(\\alpha_{k} |\\alpha_{k - 1} )} q(\\alpha_{k - 1} )d\\alpha_{k - 1} \\hfill
    \\\\ \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\; \\propto p(z_{k} ,\\lambda_{k} |\\mu_{k}
    )q_{p} (\\mu_{k} ) \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (12) The exponential form solution,
    which minimizes the KL divergence between the predictive distribution \\( p(\\alpha_{k}
    |z_{1:k - 1} ) \\) and the separable approximate distribution \\( q_{k|k - 1}
    (\\alpha ) \\), yields Gaussian distributions for the state and its mean and Wishart
    distribution for the precision matrix: $$ \\begin{aligned} q_{k|k - 1} (z_{k}
    ) \\propto & N\\left( {\\left\\langle {\\mu_{k} } \\right\\rangle_{{q_{k|k - 1}
    }} ,\\left\\langle {\\lambda_{k} } \\right\\rangle_{{q_{k|k - 1} }} } \\right)
    \\\\ q_{k|k - 1} (\\mu_{k} ) \\propto & N\\left( {\\mu_{{_{k|k - 1} }}^{*} ,\\lambda_{{_{k|k
    - 1} }}^{*} } \\right) \\\\ q_{k|k - 1} (\\lambda_{k} ) \\propto & N_{n} \\left(
    {V_{{_{k|k - 1} }}^{*} ,n_{{_{k|k - 1} }}^{*} } \\right) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$
    (13) where the parameters are updated according to the same iterative scheme as
    and the expectations are exactly computed as follows: $$ \\begin{aligned} & \\mu_{k}^{p}
    = \\mu_{k - 1}^{*} \\\\ & \\lambda_{k}^{p} = \\left( {\\lambda_{k - 1}^{* - 1}
    + \\overline{\\lambda }^{ - 1} } \\right) \\\\ & \\mu_{k|k - 1}^{*} = \\lambda_{k|k
    - 1}^{* - 1} \\left( {\\left\\langle {\\lambda_{k} } \\right\\rangle_{k|k - 1}
    \\left\\langle {z_{k} } \\right\\rangle_{k|k - 1} + \\mu_{k}^{p} \\lambda_{k}^{p}
    } \\right) \\\\ & \\lambda_{k|k - 1}^{*} = \\left\\langle {\\lambda_{k} } \\right\\rangle_{k|k
    - 1} + \\lambda_{k}^{p} \\\\ & n_{k|k - 1}^{*} = \\overline{n} + 1 \\\\ & S_{k}^{*}
    = \\left( {\\left\\langle {z_{k} z_{k}^{T} } \\right\\rangle_{{q_{k|k - 1} }}
    - \\left\\langle {z_{k} } \\right\\rangle_{{q_{k|k - 1} }} \\left\\langle {\\mu_{k}
    } \\right\\rangle_{{q_{k|k - 1} }}^{T} + \\left\\langle {\\mu_{k} } \\right\\rangle_{{q_{k|k
    - 1} }} \\left\\langle {z_{k} } \\right\\rangle_{{q_{k|k - 1} }}^{T} + \\left\\langle
    {\\mu_{k} \\mu_{k}^{T} } \\right\\rangle_{{q_{k|k - 1} }} + \\overline{S}^{ -
    1} } \\right)^{ - 1} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (14) Compared to the PF method, the
    computational cost and the memory requirements are dramatically reduced by the
    variational approximation in the prediction phase. In fact, the expectations involved
    in the computation of the predictive distribution have closed forms, avoiding
    the use of Monte Carlo integration. Case study and crop model presentation The
    data used in this paper derive from an experiment designed to study wheat growth
    response (Triticum aestivum L., cultivar Julius) under different nitrogen fertilization
    levels during the crop season 2008–2009. The experimental blocks were prepared
    on two soil types (loamy and sandy loam), corresponding to the agro-environmental
    conditions of the Hesbaye region in Belgium. The measurements were the results
    of four replications by date, nitrogen level and soil type. Each replication was
    performed on a small block (2 m × 6 m) within the original experiment as a complete
    randomised block distribution, spread over the field within each soil type, to
    ensure measurement independence. A wireless micro-sensor network (eKo pro series
    system, Crossbow Technology, USA) was used to continuously characterize the soil
    at two depths (200 and 500 mm) and the atmosphere within the vegetation. Six eKo
    nodes supporting sensors were implemented throughout the experimental blocks,
    on the two soil types. The following biophysical variables were measured: water
    content (EC-5, Decagon, USA), soil moisture potential and soil temperature (eS1101,
    Watermark, USA), ambient relative humidity and air temperature (SHT7x, Sensirion,
    Switzerland), global radiation (6450, Davis, USA). A weather station (ES2000,
    MEMSIC, USA) was also implemented in the experimental field in order to measure
    wind speed, wind direction and pluviometry. LAI, biomass, and soil nitrogen content
    were regularly measured manually. The model for which the methods were tested
    is Mini STICS model (Makowski et al. 2004). Its structure can be derived from
    the basic conservation laws, namely material and energy balances. It contains
    dynamic equations that indicate how each state variable evolves from 1 day to
    the next as a function of the current values of the state variables, of the input
    variables and of the parameter values. Encoding these equations over time allows
    one to eliminate the intermediate values of the state variables and relate the
    state variables at any time to the explanatory variables on each day up to that
    time. However, the model involves several parameters that are usually not known,
    which include the radiation use efficiency expressing the biomass produced per
    unit of intercepted radiation, the maximal value of the ratio of intercepted to
    incident radiation and the coefficient of extinction of radiation. The model parameters
    determined by Makowski et al. (2004) are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Model parameters

    soil water content is given by: $$ \\begin{aligned} LAI(t) & = f_{1} \\left( {LAI(t
    - 1) + \\theta } \\right) \\\\ HUR1(t) & = f_{2} \\left( {HUR1(t - 1) + \\theta
    } \\right) \\\\ HUR2(t) & = f_{3} \\left( {HUR2(t - 1) + \\theta } \\right), \\\\
    \\end{aligned} $$ (15) where t is the time, f 1–3 are the corresponding model
    functions, and θ is the vector of parameters driving the simulations (Table 1).
    LAI is the leaf area index and HUR1 (resp. HUR2) is the volumetric water content
    of layer 1 (resp. layer 2). Discretizing the model (15) using a sampling interval
    of \\( \\Updelta t \\) (1 day), one obtains: $$ \\begin{aligned} LAI_{k} & = \\left[
    {g_{1} (\\theta )} \\right]\\Updelta t + LAI_{k - 1} + w_{k - 1}^{1} \\\\ HUR1_{k}
    & = \\left[ {g_{2} (\\theta )} \\right]\\Updelta t + HUR1_{k - 1} + w_{k - 1}^{2}
    \\\\ HUR2_{k} & = \\left[ {g_{3} (\\theta )} \\right]\\Updelta t + HUR2_{k - 1}
    + w_{k - 1}^{3} , \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (16) where \\( w_{j \\in (1, \\ldots
    ,3)}^{j} \\) is a process Gaussian noise with zero mean and known variance \\(
    \\sigma_{{\\gamma^{j} }}^{2} \\). Up to now, model (16) assumes that the parameter
    θ is constant. These parameters are ADENS, DLAIMAX, and PSISTURG. ADENS is a parameter
    of compensation between stem number and plant density. In the case of wheat, it
    is the tillering ability. DLAIMAX is the maximum rate of the setting up of LAI
    and PSISTURG is the absolute value of the potential of the beginning of decrease
    in the cellular extension. For estimating some (or all) of these parameters, the
    equations describing their evolution are also needed: $$ \\begin{aligned} ADENS_{k}
    & = ADENS_{k - 1} + \\gamma_{k - 1}^{1} \\\\ DLAIMAX_{k} & = DLAIMAX_{k - 1} +
    \\gamma_{k - 1}^{2} \\\\ PSISTURG_{k} & = PSISTURG_{k - 1} + \\gamma_{k - 1}^{3}
    , \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (17) where \\( \\gamma_{j \\in (1, \\ldots ,3)}^{j} \\)
    is a process Gaussian noise with zero mean and known variance \\( \\sigma_{{\\gamma^{j}
    }}^{2} \\). Combining (16) and (17), one obtains: $$ \\begin{aligned} f_{1} :LAI_{k}
    & = \\left[ {g_{1} \\left( {\\theta_{k - 1} } \\right)} \\right]\\Updelta t +
    LAI_{k - 1} + w_{k - 1}^{1} \\\\ f_{2} :HUR1_{k} & = \\left[ {g_{2} \\left( {\\theta_{k
    - 1} } \\right)} \\right]\\Updelta t + HUR1_{k - 1} + w_{k - 1}^{2} \\\\ f_{3}
    :HUR2_{k} & = \\left[ {g_{3} \\left( {\\theta_{k - 1} } \\right)} \\right]\\Updelta
    t + HUR2_{k - 1} + w_{k - 1}^{3} \\\\ f_{4} :ADENS_{k} & = ADENS_{k - 1} + \\gamma_{k
    - 1}^{1} \\\\ f_{5} :DLAIMAX_{k} & = DLAIMAX_{k - 1} + \\gamma_{k - 1}^{2} \\\\
    f_{6} :PSISTURG_{k} & = PSISTURG_{k - 1} + \\gamma_{k - 1}^{3} , \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (18) where \\( f_{k \\in (1, \\ldots ,6)} \\) are some non-linear functions
    and where \\( w = \\left( {w_{1} ,w_{2} ,w_{3} } \\right)^{T} \\) and \\( \\gamma
    = \\left( {\\gamma_{1} ,\\gamma_{2} ,\\gamma_{3} } \\right)^{T} \\) are respectively
    the measurement and process noise vector, which quantify randomness at both levels.
    In other words, the augmented state: \\( z_{k} = \\left( {x_{k} ,\\theta_{k} }
    \\right)^{T} \\) is formed which is the vector to be estimated. It can be given
    by a 6 by 1 matrix: $$ \\begin{aligned} x_{k} (1,:) \\to & LAI_{k} \\\\ x_{k}
    (2,:) \\to & HUR1_{k} \\\\ x_{k} (3,:) \\to & HUR2_{k} \\\\ x_{k} (4,:) \\to &
    ADENS_{k} \\\\ x_{k} (5,:) \\to & DLAIMAX_{k} \\\\ x_{k} (6,:) \\to & PSISTURG_{k}
    \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (19) The abilities of EKF, PF and VF to solve this non-linear
    state estimation problem are tested through different cases summarized below.
    In all cases, it is assumed that three states (LAI, HUR1 and HUR2) are measured.
    This assumption is realistic since HUR1 and HUR2 are continuously measured by
    soil water content micro-sensors. Up to now, LAI is obtained by reference measurements
    but automatic methods are in progress (Gebbers et al. 2011; Leemans et al. 2012;
    Sakamoto et al. 2012). i) Case 1: the three states (LAI, HUR1 and HUR2) along
    with the parameter ADENS are estimated. ii) Case 2: the three states (LAI, HUR1
    and HUR2) along with the parameter ADENS and DLAIMAX are estimated. iii) Case
    3: the three states (LAI, HUR1 and HUR2) along with the parameter ADENS, DLAIMAX
    and PSISTURG are estimated. Sampling data generation To obtain original dynamic
    data, the model was first used to simulate the temporal responses \\( {\\text{LAI}}_{k}
    \\), \\( HUR\\,1_{k} \\), \\( HUR\\,2_{k} \\) on the basis of the recorded climatic
    variables. The sampling time used for discretization was 1 day. Moreover, to characterize
    the ability of the different approaches to estimate both the states and the parameters
    at same time, “true” parameter values were chosen (Table 1). The advantage of
    working by simulation rather than on real data is that the true parameter values
    are known. It is thus possible to calculate the quality of the estimated parameters
    and the predictive quality of the adjusted model for each method. The drawback
    is that the generality of the results is hard to know. The results may depend
    on the details of the model, on the way the data are generated and on the specific
    data that are used. The simulated values, assumed to be noise free, are shown
    in Fig. 1. The evolution of LAI during the wheat’s lifecycle presents the three
    expected phases, growth, stability and senescence. Daily variations of shallow
    ground water show fluctuations that were damped in the subsoil layer. Fig. 1 Simulated
    LSM data used in estimation: state variables (LAI leaf area index, HUR1 volumetric
    water content of the layer 1, HUR2 volumetric water content of the layer 2) Full
    size image These simulated states were then contaminated with zero mean Gaussian
    errors, i.e., the measurement noise \\( v_{k - 1} \\sim N\\left( {0,\\sigma_{v}^{2}
    } \\right) \\) where \\( \\sigma_{v}^{2} = 0.1. \\) Simulations results analysis
    In this section, in the first study, the performance of EKF, PF and VF in estimating
    the three states, the leaf-area index LAI, the volumetric water content of the
    layer 1 HUR1 and the volumetric water content of the layer 2 HUR2 are compared.
    It can be observed from Figs. 2, 3 and 4, as well as Table 2, that the VF shows
    improved estimation performance over EKF and PF. The EKF estimation was not as
    accurate as the ones corresponding to PF and VF due to the essential limitation
    of the EKF in non-linear environments. Also, the estimation improvement of VF
    over PF is due to the fact that the VF yields an optimal choice of the sampling
    distribution over the estimated state by minimizing the KL divergence. Fig. 2

    Full size table In the second study, the effect of the number of estimated parameters
    on the estimation performances of EKF, PF and VF and in estimating the states
    and parameters of the LSM process model was examined. The estimation of the state
    variables and parameter(s) for these three cases were performed using the three
    state estimation techniques, EKF, PF and VF. The estimation results for the model
    parameters using these techniques are shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7, respectively.
    For example, Fig. 5 shows the estimation of the parameters using EKF: Fig. 5a
    show the estimates of ADENS, Fig. 5b, c estimates ADENS and DLAIMAX, and Fig.
    5d–f present the estimation of all three parameters ADENS, DLAIMAX, and PSISTURG.
    Also, Tables 3, 4 and 5 compare the performance of the three estimation techniques
    for the three cases. For example, for case 1, Table 3 compares the estimation
    root mean square errors for the three state variables LAI, HUR1 and HUR2 (with
    respect to the noise-free data) and the mean of the estimated parameter DLAIMAX
    at steady state (i.e., after convergence of parameter(s)) for different cases
    using the three estimation techniques. Fig. 5 Estimation of the LSM model parameters

    states and mean of estimated parameters: case 1 Full size table Table 4 Root mean
    square errors (RMSE) of estimated states and mean of estimated parameters: case
    2 Full size table Table 5 Root mean square errors (RMSE) of estimated states and
    mean of estimated parameters: case 3 Full size table It can be seen from the results
    presented in Tables 3, 4 and 5 that in all cases, the PF outperformed the EKF
    (i.e., provides smaller RMSE for the state variables), and that the VF showed
    a significant improvement over all other techniques. These results confirm the
    results obtained in the first comparative study, where only the state variables
    were estimated. The advantages of the VF over the PF (and the PF over the EKF)
    can also be seen through their abilities to estimate the model parameters. For
    example, EKF could perfectly estimate one parameter in case 1 (see Fig. 5a), but
    it took longer to estimate a second parameter in case 2 (see Fig. 5b, c), and
    it could not converge for the third parameter in case 3 (see Fig. 5d–f), where
    it is used to estimate all three parameters. The PF, on the other hand, could
    estimate all parameters in all cases 1–3, even though it took longer to converge
    in case 3, where all three parameters were estimated (see Fig. 6). The VF, however,
    could estimate all parameters in all three cases, and converged faster than all
    other techniques (see Fig. 7). These advantages of the VF are due to the fact
    that it provides an optimum choice of the sampling distribution used to approximate
    the posterior density function, which also accounts for the observed data and
    the effectiveness of using a general state evolution model. The results also show
    that the number of estimated parameters affect the estimation accuracy of the
    estimated state variables. In other words, for all estimation techniques, the
    estimation RMSE of LAI, HUR1 and HUR2 increases from the first comparative study
    (where only the state variables are estimated) to case 1 (where only one parameter,
    DLAIMAX, is estimated) to case 3 (where all three parameters, ADENS, DLAIMAX,
    and PSISTURG, are estimated). For example, the RMSEs obtained using EKF for LAI
    in the first comparative study and cases 1–3 of the second comparative study were
    0.0612, 0.0614, 0.0617, and 0.0659 respectively, which increased as the number
    of estimated parameters increased (refer to Tables 3, 4 and 5). This observation
    is valid for the other state variables HUR1 and HUR2 and for all other estimation
    techniques, PF and VF. The effectiveness of daily introduction of measurements
    of LAI and soil water content into a crop model has thus been demonstrated. Amongst
    the chosen filtering techniques, the VF method appeared to be the more efficient.
    For example, in the estimation of soil water content, the maximum value of the
    RMSE was 2.1 % at 200 mm depth (where the daily fluctuations may be high) while
    it was 1.7 % at 500 mm depth (where the daily fluctuations are damped). Besides
    the accurate prediction of the three state variables LAI, HUR1 and HUR2, the VF
    method allows estimation of the model’s parameters. Hence, the method has the
    potential to determine model outputs such as yield, protein content, soil nitrogen
    content,… From a practical point of view, the set up of the method implies the
    need to distribute sensors able to measure spatial and temporal changes of state
    variables. As mentioned in the introduction, low-cost and low-power wireless sensor
    networks for soil water content monitoring are already available. On the other
    hand, several methods have been proposed to obtain real-time data processing of
    LAI. Even if further development is yet needed, these methods will probably become
    efficient in the near future. Consequently, the monitoring of these variables
    of interest near the crops and scattered over the field and their introduction
    in real-time in crop models opens new perspectives for precision agriculture.
    Indeed, thanks to these techniques, it will be possible to improve the accuracy
    of crop models, which are powerful tools for decision making systems and specifically
    for the management of inputs such as irrigation water and fertilizer supply. Conclusions
    On the basis of synthetic data, this study shows the value of using a Bayesian
    framework to predict state variables such as LAI and soil water content of two
    soil layers. This approach relies on computing the probability distribution of
    the unobserved states given a sequence of the observed data by using a dynamic
    crop model. However, as crop models are non-linear and the observations are affected
    by non-Gaussian noise, the model parameterization is not obvious and the quality
    of the estimation is sometimes hazardous. In this paper, to solve that problem,
    three techniques, EKF, PF, and VF were compared to predict simultaneously three
    state variables (LAI and soil water content of two soil layers, 200 and 500 mm)
    and the associated parameters in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop. Variational
    filter has a low computation complexity and the convergence speed of states and
    parameters estimation can be adjusted independently. On the basis of case studies,
    the significantly improved performance of the VF method when compared to EKF and
    PF was shown. Indeed, the RMSE of the state variables was smaller and the convergence
    of all estimated parameters was ensured. Introducing regularly measured state
    variables in a crop model working in a Bayesian framework and solving the global
    problem by VF is thus promising for estimating state variables such as LAI and
    soil water content. The proposed method has the potential to accurately predict
    crop yield, this latter being computed as a combination of state variables. Finally,
    this study highlights the value of having on-line low-cost and reliable sensors
    able to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of the main state variables
    involved in soil-crop systems, so that these latter would become more adapted
    to site-specific yield analysis and management recommendation. References Behera,

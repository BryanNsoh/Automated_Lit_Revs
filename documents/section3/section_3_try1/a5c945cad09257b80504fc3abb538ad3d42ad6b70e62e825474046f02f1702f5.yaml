    use of water at the farm level in traditional irrigation application methods is
    a present-day concern across the world that can be resolved by enhancing application
    efficiency through the adoption of advanced irrigation techniques. Sprinkler irrigation
    is a method that has high application efficiency, which can be further increased
    when coupled with automation toward precision irrigation. The objectives of this
    review are to summarize the main aspects of sprinkler and precision irrigation
    and their development, scope, and future prospects specifically in Asian countries.
    In this paper, a modified methodology, inspired by PRISMA guidelines, was used
    to explore the available literature to summarize the existing knowledge in the
    field. Regarding the technological aspects of the analyzed works, it became evident
    that sprinkler systems are an efficient method to not only irrigate crops (with
    39% water saving) but also for the application of fertilizers with higher efficiency
    (>35%) and water productivity (>14.1%) compared with gravity irrigation systems.
    Moreover, this paper highlights the prominent features of precision irrigation
    for maximizing agricultural productivity. The use of sprinkler irrigation with
    precision applications using automation with a sensor-based mechanism for field
    data collection, data transformation, data analysis, and operation of IoT-based
    automatic solenoid valves can save 20–30% more irrigation water and increase crop
    yield by 20–27%. An analytical understanding and knowledge of the field were used
    to draw conclusions that are thought-provoking for scientists, researchers, and
    other stakeholders. Keywords: application efficiency; sprinkler types; sprinkler

    Revolution has pushed many countries with agriculture-based economies to introduce
    reforms, resulting in rapid agricultural growth. The world’s agricultural growth
    can be assessed from the fact that only in China has total grain production reached
    117% with a 2% annual increase [1]. The agriculture-based gross domestic product
    (GDP) is growing at a rate of 9.4% [2] worldwide. There are still opportunities
    to double agricultural productivity by adopting mechanized practices that enhance
    crop yields as well as crop intensity [3]. The prime input for agricultural production
    is water, which is even more important in irrigated agriculture and plays a vital
    role in food security. Irrigated agriculture represents one-fifth of agricultural
    land and about half of the production is being cultivated directly from irrigated
    agriculture, screening its potential for crop production with more diversification
    and intensification [4]. According to a study [5], 80% of cereal crops and 90%
    of vegetable crops are being grown under irrigated agriculture; therefore, this
    sector is being expanded in many countries through the introduction of essential
    and mechanized irrigation practices. This development of irrigated areas can be
    assessed from the growth of irrigated land in China (Figure 1) due to it being
    one of the world’s leading agricultural economies [1]. Figure 1. Development of
    irrigated areas in China (1950–2020) [6,7]. Growth in irrigated land demands more
    irrigation water and triggers the issue of water security. Being a major consumer,
    the world’s agriculture sector uses more than 70% of available freshwater [8].
    The per capita water availability is decreasing all over the world and it has
    been projected that by 2050, 45 countries will be water scared (<500 m3/capita/annum)
    and 87 will be at the margin (<1700 m3/capita/annum) out of 180 countries [9],
    indicating increasing pressure on available water resources for the production
    of food to feed growing populations [10]. The provision of surface water resources
    to highly irrigated areas and the effective management of available resources
    are the only methods to sustain development in the agriculture sector to ensure
    the world’s food security with environmental sustainability [5]. This problem
    can be mitigated from two sides. One side is the enhancement of water availability
    by building storage infrastructures and the other side is the efficient use of
    water at the farm level [11,12,13]. In this respect, several projects in the 1990s
    were launched throughout the world to introduce water-efficient techniques for
    improving application efficiencies of traditional irrigation practices [14]. Under
    traditional irrigation systems, water is applied at constant intervals without
    considering the crop water requirements and the application efficiencies of these
    methods are also low as varying amounts of water are applied throughout the field.
    This uneven irrigation could over-irrigate a portion of the land while the other
    portion may experience water stress due to less irrigation [15,16,17]. Sprinkler
    irrigation is a type of high-efficiency irrigation system that has been used at
    the farm level since the late 1970s. This technology has proven its capability
    to save significant amounts of irrigation water with greater uniformity compared
    with other surface irrigation methods (basin, border, beds, furrow, etc.) [18,19]
    in addition to improvement in yield and fertilizer management with less leaching
    effects [20]. The proven facts regarding the benefits of sprinkler irrigation
    have encouraged farmer communities to use this method as an alternate system to
    overcome the problem of low application efficiency at the farm level. This technology
    has become very popular in Western countries, mainly in the USA and Europe with
    areas of 3 Mha and 2.5 Mha, respectively, under sprinkler irrigation until the
    1970s [21]. Many countries like Australia, Israel, China, etc., have developed
    and adopted different types of sprinkler irrigation systems and these are very
    popular in these countries. The adoption rate of sprinkler irrigation has been
    reported as 4.78% [22]. In China, the government is promoting the sprinkler irrigation
    system by launching demonstration projects at farmer fields, providing funds to
    research institutions to carry out research work, and launching subsidies for
    industries to manufacture sprinkler components at the indigenous level. The effectiveness
    of these exertions is demonstrated by the fact (Figure 1) that sprinkler irrigation
    is being adopted by farmers at a high rate and is replacing other irrigation practices
    at their farms. The water and fertilizer efficiency of sprinkler irrigation could
    be further enhanced by introducing advanced interventions like precision irrigation
    practices within the regular operation of manually operated sprinkler irrigation
    systems. The precision irrigation system is a combination of an irrigation system
    coupled with a control system, communication system, and information system for
    water applications in a precise and automatic way to achieve the highest possible
    crop water productivity [23,24]. It has been reported that by adopting sprinkler
    irrigation with precision application tools, maximum economic benefits can be
    driven [25,26]. To understand the effectiveness and applicability of precision
    irrigation for absolute water management at the farm level, previous research
    needs to be reviewed in a meaningful way to identify the research trends and hot
    spot directions for future research work within the subject field. The present
    review paper is an effort to examine the available literature related to sprinkler
    irrigation and precision irrigation using quantitative analysis in a systematic
    way. A careful identification of key influential factors affecting the development
    of sprinkler irrigation toward precision application methods was carried out to
    draw conclusions and thereby provide a state-of-the-art understanding of the topic
    to readers. The purpose of this work is to describe the insights of the research
    topic, understand the ambiguities and research gaps within the scope, and draw
    consistencies between prior research work and future research directions for researchers.
    2. Review Strategy and Exploration of Literature The spatial and temporal growth
    of research databases on a massive scale created a momentum toward summarizing
    research findings in an organized manner, leading to the development of new, systematic
    approaches to literature review since the start of the 21st century [27,28,29].
    A huge number of scholarly literatures on the use of sprinklers and precision
    irrigation in the disciplines of agriculture and engineering is available; therefore,
    systematically productive approaches were taken into account to assess the advanced
    knowledge on said subjects. To start the review process, the domain of this paper
    was divided into two major portions called sub-domains. These included (1) “sprinkler
    irrigation” and (2) “precision irrigation”. Other topics related to “irrigation
    water management” were taken in the study as a miscellaneous domain. The development
    in the research volume regarding these domains and published review papers can
    be seen in Figure 2, presents the volume of literature available only in one database
    (PubMed). This gradual growth in particular research work demands the summarization
    of research outcomes of different researchers to set future research directions
    in the subject field. Figure 2. The production of research publications related
    to specific topics from January 2005 to May 2023. The methodology adopted in the
    present study is inspired by the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [30]. A new strategy was
    designed by intergrading the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the review approaches
    used by other researchers [31,32,33]. The literature related to each sub-domain
    was searched according to four approaches, illustrated in Figure 3. These approaches
    involved searching research papers based on manuscript titles, the keywords, the
    institution affiliation, and the citations of published articles. To achieve a
    speedy review, all searches were conducted using online scholar databases including
    Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, Science Direct, Springer, MDPI, Taylor & Francis,
    and journal websites. In these huge scholarly libraries, numerous research articles
    are available related to sprinkler irrigation and precision irrigation; therefore,
    a sturdy criterion was developed and adopted for the selection of the most influential
    research findings to eliminate unsuitable search results. Figure 3. Illustration
    of the mechanism through which information on the sub-domains of this paper was
    summarized and extracted. 2.1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria A comprehensive criteria
    to include or exclude literature for review proceedings was adopted. The inclusion
    criteria included (1) research published in prestigious journals, (2) research
    published in English and Chinese language, (3) research findings based on actual
    field studies, (4) publications having proper citations and available on the internet,
    (5) publications having relevant data for onward calculations of different quantitative
    parameters, (6) priority was given to journal publications, and (7) the date of
    publication was after 2005. Similarly, the exclusion criteria included (1) review
    articles, (2) research publications with duplicate or similar results, (3) publications
    containing possible errors in the data, and (4) a publication date older than
    2005. The process of obtaining the final search results is illustrated in Figure
    4. Figure 4. Illustration of the process regarding the improvement in the review
    summary using inclusion/exclusion criteria. 2.2. Summary of the Review Process
    The information was reviewed from renowned research databases and journal websites.
    The reviewed publications were dated from 2005 to the present but, of course,
    preference was given to recent publications. Figure 5 presents a summary of the
    review process. In Figure 5a, the year-wise number of reviewed papers is presented.
    It can clearly be seen that the majority of papers were selected between 2012
    and the present with a peak in 2022. In Figure 5b, the illustration of major review
    domains is shown. Most of the papers were reviewed related to sprinkler irrigation
    followed by precision irrigation. The papers related to all other topics are shown
    as other papers in Figure 5. In Figure 5c, the application of inclusion/exclusion
    criteria is given by illustrating the percentage of included papers, which was
    85% of the total reviewed papers. The remaining 15% of papers were not included
    in this study because their results were found to be repeated with similar input
    conditions. Figure 5. Summary of (a) no. of review papers, (b) subject-wise reviews,
    and (c) included and excluded papers. 3. Sprinkler Irrigation Sprinkler irrigation
    is a type of pressurized irrigation that irrigates crops by spraying water in
    the form of small droplets like natural rainfall. It has numerous advantages over
    surface irrigation or even over other pressurized irrigation technologies like
    drip irrigation as it can not only apply water to a crop but also flush its leaves
    and regulate canopy temperature to improve the efficiency of the photosynthesis
    process. Many research studies have been conducted on sprinkler irrigation that
    proved its viability and adoptability for economically higher crop production
    [34,35,36,37]. These systems have some limitations and disadvantages over other
    pressurized irrigation systems. These disadvantages include higher capital and
    operational costs, damage to soft fruit plants, low application efficiency in
    windy areas, and unsuitability for fields with fine textured soil [38]. Under
    humid conditions, moisture-related diseases may emerge within the crop canopy
    due to the presence of excessive moisture after the application of overhead sprinklers
    [39]. Romero et al. [40] reported the outbreak of fungal-related diseases within
    crop plants grown under humid and warm conditions. Belo et al. [41] reported management
    techniques including irrigation time and frequencies to reduce the risks of spreading
    bacterial-related diseases due to heavy moisture and dirt being splashed into
    the plant canopy of onion plants. But on the other hand, foliar water application
    by using an overhead sprinkler is beneficial for plants and good for protecting
    plants against frost when the temperature is at or below zero °C [42]. Despite
    these minimal limitations, sprinkler irrigation has marvelous advantages with
    high water application efficiency in the field [43]. The field application efficiency
    of different irrigation systems in comparison with different sprinkler types is
    illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6. Application efficiencies of different types
    of sprinkler systems. 3.1. Types of Sprinkler Systems In the early usage of sprinkler
    systems, single-point sprinklers were used with moveable positions, and the water
    was supplied to sprinklers through iron pipes [7]. The iron pipes were susceptible
    to erosion and heavy when moving sprinklers from one place to another. Iron pipes
    were replaced with aluminum pipes in the first phase and then with plastic/PVC
    pipes along with plentiful progress in the design of irrigation systems in the
    late 1990s [44]. By increasing the understanding of sprinkler systems, moveable
    machines were developed with sprinkler nozzles that can be transported throughout
    the field to irrigate entire areas with the same sprinkler setup. This kind of
    sprinkler system has high application efficiencies and more irrigation coverage
    with less labor requirements. This form of sprinkler system has many types and
    is adopted as per field conditions due to specific limitations associated with
    each type. The features and distribution uniformities (DUs) of different sprinkler
    systems were obtained from the literature [43,45] and are shown in Table 1. Generally,
    Equation (1) is used to calculate the DU of a sprinkler irrigation system. The
    DU range of each sprinkler type is provided in Table 1. The DU depends on the
    crop type, field condition, and environmental exposure of a sprinkler system.
    The maximum DU value belongs to lab experiments and the minimum value belongs
    to field conditions. 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝐷𝑈)= 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ

    types of sprinkler systems [43]. The center pivot system has many advantages over
    other types; therefore, this type of system has been installed in more than 13%
    of the area under sprinkler irrigation in China [46]. Researchers are working
    on a center pivot system to increase its efficiencies via a nozzle configuration
    corresponding to the particular movement speed [47,48]. Ma et al. studied the
    uniformity and the application efficacies of a two-span center pivot system and
    reported a 66.1–68.4% uniformity coefficient [49]. Several other researchers worked
    on other types of moveable sprinklers and conducted performance tests to determine
    their suitability and to improve the characteristics of existing systems [50,51,52,53].
    Hand-mover gravity sprinklers are mostly used in hilly areas where sufficient
    gravitational head is available to operate sprinklers without irrigation pumps
    [54]. 3.2. Sprinkler Nozzle Sprinkler nozzles are key components in the whole
    sprinkler system and their uniform operation determines the efficiency of the
    system. The study of sprinkler nozzles was limited before the 1970s; however,
    the topics gradually received attention due to the increasing demand for sprinkler
    systems. In the late 1970s, work on designing impact sprinklers was started by
    an industrial group, and a series of sprinkler nozzles were designed with varying
    diameters (20 mm to 80 mm inner diameter). The Chinese government put a special
    effort into the development of new sprinkler nozzles by reverse engineering imported
    sophisticated nozzles and promoting research and development in the same area
    [50,55]. Currently, researchers and enterprises have been working on the development
    of new products and refining the hydraulic performance of existing sprinklers
    with structural improvements. Low-pressure sprinklers are an example of the improvement
    in the design of existing sprinklers. The research and development (R&D) work
    by researchers on sprinkler characteristics is presented in Table 2. 3.3. Low-Pressure
    Sprinklers The increase in energy demand and its high cost are forcing researchers
    to introduce new developments in the existing irrigation technologies so that
    these systems could still be used as a viable source in the new era. Normal sprinkler
    irrigation is operated at a high pressure of around (≥300 KPa), causing more energy
    consumption [56]. The low-pressure sprinkler is a new addition to the existing
    technology, enabling users to operate sprinklers at <200 KPa and subsequently
    lowering operating costs with different management strategies [56,57,58]. The
    key principle of designing a low-pressure sprinkler is to change the internal
    nozzle structure to reduce the operating pressure without compromising the dispersion
    uniformity of water droplets. Table 2. Research work on sprinkler nozzles by researchers.
    Li et al. designed a low-pressure rotary sprinkler with different dimensions of
    scatters and evaluated its performance; the authors reported satisfactory results
    regarding all selected performance parameters [47]. Other researchers improved
    the jet dispersion in low-pressure sprinklers by introducing a pair of aerated
    pipes inside the sprinkler nozzle [70]. The optimal groove numbers were identified
    during a series of experiments using D3000 range sprinklers after changing their
    plate structure [71]. Wang et al. [72] derived empirical equations for low-pressure
    sprinklers for operation under varying operating conditions and design parameters
    [73]. Ouazaa et al. derived a calculation model for cunnings of water distribution
    using low-pressure sprinklers [74]. Besides the changes in sprinkler design, researchers
    improved the field performance of sprinkler irrigation systems by optimizing the
    pipeline structure to reduce energy loss in order to promote the use of low-pressure
    sprinklers [75]. Tsaboula et al. studied the effects of different wind speeds
    on water spray through low-pressure sprinklers [76]. 3.4. Sprinkler Irrigation
    Use for Crop Production The use of sprinkler irrigation is not only for water
    saving but also to improve crop yield and reduce crop production costs by limiting
    crop inputs. Sprinkler irrigation has many advantages over other pressurized irrigation
    methods (drip irrigation) including rain characteristics and delivery of higher
    amounts of water during irrigation in time units. Sprinkler irrigation systems
    can be effective in large areas with less costly installation costs. The regular
    operation, maintenance, and operational troubleshooting of sprinkler irrigation
    systems are easier than drip irrigation. The benefits of sprinkler systems over
    other irrigation systems have been reported by many researchers [77,78,79,80,81,82].
    Sprinkler irrigation can be applied to a variety of crops, soils, and field conditions
    compared with other systems. These are efficient for keeping crops well flourished
    and maximizing yield; therefore, about 6% of irrigated area in China has been
    covered with sprinkler irrigation [7]. Some prolific findings regarding better
    crop production under sprinkler irrigation are given in Table 3. Table 3. The
    benefits of the use of sprinkler irrigation for crop production. To obtain better
    crop response under a sprinkler system, the fertilizer must be applied with water
    for the highest crop productivity. The overall fertilizer use efficiency has been
    reported at only 30% [89], which can be improved by its application using sprinkler
    irrigation systems. The injection of fertilizer via sprinkler irrigation is only
    possible with the use of injection devices. Different injection devices and application
    methods have been reported according to specific operating or field conditions
    [41,90,91,92]. Irrigation water and fertilizer could be further saved using variable
    rate technology (VRT), which means specific water application on a particular
    portion of the field [93]. The first VRT system was introduced in Asia in 2014
    [94] followed by continuous research work on modifications of VRT systems. One
    researcher attuned the variable spray of the sprinkler nozzle by changing the
    operating pressure, flow rate, and internal structure [95], while another researcher
    invented the variable spray mechanism of CPS using infrared thermography [96].
    A GPS-based operating system was developed by a group of scientists, which can
    apply fertilizer at variable rates by changing the duty cycle and pivoting the
    operating speed [54]. In present times, VRT machines are capable of applying water
    and fertilizers as per the soil conditions and plant needs [97]. 3.5. Sprinkler
    Design for Better Microclimate and Associated Field Losses Sprinkler systems revolutionized
    farm irrigation methods with marvelous advantages. The efficiency of these systems
    is associated with the design of pumping systems, delivery pipes, and sprinkler
    devices according to the crops, weather, and field conditions [98]. The optimum
    design and selection of sprinkler components can be helpful in installing a system
    with economical cost and better performance for crop growing. Several techniques
    for designing sprinkler systems are available including graphical, analytical,
    and simulation techniques [99]. Bing et al. introduced the genetic algorithm (GA)
    technique for the design of an efficient irrigation system based on simulation
    research work [100]. Other researchers reported the use of binary coding genetic
    algorithms (BCGAs) for optimum water applications to different crops [101]; general
    genetic algorithms (GGAs) for irrigation scheduling, rotation, and its distribution
    [102]; and the use of single parent genetic algorithms (SPGAs) for space–time
    canal discharge distribution for irrigation rotation [103]. Liu et al. incorporated
    the weighting method (digital) using the MATLAB (R2013b) toolbox to analyze the
    distribution pattern of droplet size and identified the variation trends in distribution
    frequency under changing pressure at varying radial distances from sprinkler nozzles
    [104]. Based on the single-sprinkler installation approach, a line source sprinkler
    system with optimized design parameters was established using the analytical approach
    at Ferdowsi University [105]. These developed techniques are for the design of
    sprinkler systems for successful field operation with the ability to save significant
    amounts of irrigation water and create favorable conditions for crops by modifying
    field microclimate. Controlling field microclimate is an advantage that is associated
    with sprinkler irrigation for controlling the factors of high temperature and
    low humidity [106]. Hot wind drifts can cause an average of 5–10% yield loss that
    could be up to 20–30% under severe climate conditions. Similar results have also
    been reported by other researchers regarding abnormal crop growth and the reduction
    in final biomass [107,108]. Liu et al. conducted long-term scenario studies on
    sprinkler systems for winter wheat and reported a reduction in ambient crop temperature,
    low vapor pressure, and less transpiration [109]. The advantage of sprinkler applications
    also included improvement in photosynthesis and low respiration rates [110,111].
    Moreover, the positive impact of water spray on the temperature of the soil’s
    upper layer and the canopy temperature has been proven in other research works
    [112]. Cai et al. conducted a study on optimizing CPS to regulate field microclimate
    and reported improvement in the peak splits of temperature difference and photosynthesis
    rate [113]. Besides these optimistic impacts, there are some undesirable losses
    associated with sprinkler irrigation in terms of wind drift and evaporation. A
    small portion of the discharging water from sprinkler nozzles in the form of thin
    drops does not reach the crop canopy and evaporates in the air during its transfer,
    which is called wind drift or evaporation losses in sprinklers [114,115,116].
    The researchers’ findings provide evidence that the scale of wind drift depends
    on wind speed and weather conditions [117,118] and it varies from 3.6 to 7.2%
    [119]. Colombo et al. reported 3.38% losses of wind drift under the regular operation
    of CPS [120]. The variation in wind drift was examined by Playan et al. in a number
    of experiments (52 in 2004 and 39 in 2005) and reported the range of the magnitude
    of losses as 4.3–14.7 in 2004 and 0.3–8.3% in 2005 [121]. The wind drift losses
    in cold cum semi-arid climates were reported as 3.3–13.7% [122] and the same for
    Mediterranean regions as 5.8–36.4% [123]. Yazar revealed the average wind drift
    losses for various operating conditions and types of systems as 1.7–30.7% [124].
    These losses should be controlled otherwise these can cause water and energy loss
    as well as a reduction in crop yield and poor quality [125], which eventually
    increases production costs and decreases net income. Mole reported that 30–50%
    of total wind drift losses are due to direct evaporation from the air and the
    remaining part is due to the wind drifting [126]. The wind drift losses could
    be minimized by optimizing the operating pressure, speed of the vehicle, and sprinkler
    type. It was reported that the 1-Wob sprinkler has better efficiency and causes
    less drift losses [127]. Sandeghai et al. developed a multiple linear regression
    model to predict wind drift losses for various weather conditions under varying
    operating conditions [116]. Using the model, the worker can set the operating
    conditions as per the weather situation so that the wind drift losses can be minimized.
    By using the guidelines developed by different researchers [128,129,130], drift
    losses can be controlled to improve the application efficiency of sprinkler systems.
    4. Precision Irrigation Using Sprinklers Sprinkler irrigation systems can apply
    water and fertilizer precisely but manually operated sprinkler systems involve
    labor for their operation; moreover, it is difficult to apply irrigation as per
    the real-time crop water requirement, whereas precision irrigation is the latest
    water-saving technique for maximizing yield and providing water at a desired location
    based on actual crop water demand [15,131,132,133,134,135,136,137]. The potential
    of water saving with precision irrigation through sprinkler systems has been reported
    as 30% compared with conventional sprinkler systems [138]. The concept of precision
    irrigation is based on the temporal and spatial variation in the application rate
    of irrigation systems based on real-time crop water requirements [25,26]. The
    entire field or application area is tackled as small parts or zones having the
    same water requirement at a particular time. Then, irrigation is applied in every
    zone in the desired quantity using a smart application mechanism attached to an
    irrigation system. Precision irrigation keeps every part of the field at optimum
    moisture level for proper plant growth in a uniform way [139], which improves
    its productivity, yield quality, and water use efficiency [140]. Researchers studied
    water application via sprinklers using the principles of precision irrigation
    and reported marvelous results regarding efficient water applications [2,132,141,142,143,144,145,146].
    Precision irrigation involves (1) variable applications of irrigation water in
    space and time, regulated by the real-time monitoring of irrigation-related parameters
    in the field using sensors or other tools, (2) analyzing the data to develop irrigation
    schedules, and (3) feedback and operating mechanisms to control the irrigation
    machine using GPS to fulfill actual crop water requirements in every section of
    the field separately. To implement a precision irrigation system, advanced sensing,
    analyzing (simulating), and control technologies are adopted to achieve its best
    performance. This understanding of precision irrigation is also expressed as variable
    rate irrigation. Typical precision irrigation has been drawn by getting inspiration
    from the literature [147] and is shown in Figure 7. A precision system includes
    a mechanism for field data collection, data transformation to the control center/device,
    data analysis, and calibrated operation of IoT-based automatic solenoid valves
    to operate the irrigation system. Under precision applications, irrigation is
    applied frequently for short durations just to maintain the field water balance
    of a cropping system at every part of the field. Prior to the application of precision
    irrigation, the actual water requirement is calculated, and the operating time
    or intensities are designed for the onward operation of sprinkler vehicles. These
    calculations are referred to as irrigation scheduling. Figure 7. Overview of typical
    precision irrigation mechanism: (a) sensors for data collection from the field;
    (b) data transformation mechanism and transmitters; (c) data receiver and data
    analyzer for data calibration and to generate a command for the irrigation system;
    (d) remotely operated solenoid valves to operate the irrigation system as per
    commands generated by the data analyzer; and (e) the sprinkler irrigation system.
    4.1. Field Parameters Used for Irrigation Scheduling for Precision Irrigation
    The monitoring of field conditions is crucial for implementing precision irrigation
    for food production with minimum water usage. Monitoring of field conditions refers
    to the data collection regarding irrigation-related parameters that are capable
    of stating the real-time water balance of the crop system so that the desired
    water can be applied. Some basic parameters that are related to irrigation scheduling
    are categorized [17,148] into three classes or groups. Any of these parameters
    or the sum of some parameters could be adopted to determine irrigation scheduling
    under precision irrigation. The first group is associated with soil parameters
    including soil moisture, soil salinity, soil water absorption capacity, soil pH,
    etc. The second group is associated with plant parameters including leaf area
    index (LAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), stomatal conductance,
    evapotranspiration, leaf turgor pressure, crop water stress index, etc. Plant-related
    parameters for irrigation scheduling are relatively difficult to monitor but these
    parameters exhibit the most realistic picture of plant water balance and present
    the plant growth expected to be affected by droughts and nutrient deficiencies
    [149]. The third group contained climatic parameters including ambient temperature,
    humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, etc.
    These climatic parameters are put in the world-renowned “Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration
    model” for calculating actual evapotranspiration using crop coefficients for the
    development of irrigation schedules [150]. A summary of the literature review
    regarding the use of different parameters for precision irrigation has been taken
    from the literature [32] and illustrated in Figure 8 after modifications and improvements.
    The parameters are shown as per previously defined groups (crop parameters, soil
    parameters, and climatic parameters). Figure 8. Illustration of the literature
    showing the domains of monitoring parameters for precision irrigation. A: [151];

    Z: [173]; Aa: [174]; and Bb: [141]. 4.2. Data Collection Regarding Irrigation
    Scheduling for Precision Irrigation Precision irrigation requires the accurate
    measurement of field data related to the above-described parameters to implement
    its full scope in order to obtain maximum advantages. There are several ways to
    collect field data including the following: Manual monitoring using smart tools;
    Use of sensors (sensors for soil, plant, and climate parameters); Use of satellite
    data; Use of UAV for data collection. 4.2.1. Manual Monitoring Using Smart Tools
    The accuracy of monitoring field parameters is crucial to implementing precision
    irrigation in a true sense. The continuous and uninterrupted monitoring of irrigation-related
    parameters at different points at desired intervals can be conducted manually
    using smart sensing tools or devices. The biases in data collection by humans
    have been reported but the data regarding some specific plant or soil-related
    parameters could still be collected manually by following standard protocols [175].
    This method of data collection is convenient and easy to follow but it is very
    low in efficiency. 4.2.2. Use of Sensors Plant growth is highly dependent on the
    moisture level in the rhizosphere and frequent monitoring of moisture levels needs
    to be carried out for accurate irrigation scheduling. Accurate data collection
    regarding soil moisture on high temporal grounds is the only option for irrigation
    scheduling in a precise way [169,172,176]. Different kinds of sensors are available
    in the market and are being used for such purposes. One type is capacitance-based
    sensors, which are relatively low cost and can measure the moisture level with
    adequate reliability after efficacious calibration of the sensor with measured
    field data [177]. A more sophisticated device to monitor soil moisture is TDR
    (time domain reflectometry), which contains two electrodes. These electrodes are
    inserted in the soil column up to the desired depth and, afterward, an electric
    signal is generated from one electrode to another to assess the soil moisture
    by estimating travel time and soil conductance characteristics. The accuracy of
    TDR is high, but it is expensive to install in large numbers in open fields for
    monitoring soil moisture at different field spots. Bitella introduced the methodology
    to measure soil moisture at different depths at the same time using low-cost dielectric
    probes [131] while other researchers used IoT-based field monitoring devices for
    moisture measurements [162]. Huuskonen and Oksanen used drone cameras for remote
    measurement of soil moisture in upper soil layers [160]. Besides soil parameters,
    the use of climate parameters for irrigation scheduling has the highest ranking
    due to their extensive use among all contenders [143,149,162,166,178,179,180].
    Permanent weather stations or weather monitoring devices can be installed in the
    field to collect real-time climate data. The sensors to monitor plant or soil-related
    parameters can be installed on the moveable platform of an irrigation system like
    CPS for real-time monitoring during the irrigation cycle [181]. In addition to
    the moisture, soil and plant nutrients could also be monitored using soil nutrient
    detectors connected parallel to moisture sensors [182]. Joly developed a silicon
    chip for site-specific monitoring of soil nutrients [183]. 4.2.3. Application
    of Remote Sensing for Data Collection Satellite remote sensing is an excellent
    and reliable option to collect data on soil and plant-related parameters for irrigation
    under various environmental conditions throughout the world. The satellites can
    read ground data using different spectral bands and are capable of differentiating
    water-stressed crop areas and analyzing crop water needs at high spatial and temporal
    frequencies [184]. Many commercial satellites like MODIS, Landsat, SPOT, etc.,
    offer crop and soil moisture status at high temporal frequency [185]. Several
    researchers used open-source satellite data related to crop evapotranspiration,
    soil moisture, plant water stress, NDVI, etc., for the implementation of precision
    irrigation using sprinkler irrigation systems [186,187]. Reyes [188] used a satellite-based
    vegetation index to estimate actual crop water requirements for the design of
    irrigation scheduling for precise water applications in the field. Ramirez [189]
    used a GIS-based toolbox to explore satellite data for the assessment of soil
    moisture to determine crop water requirements. The 10–20% more water saving achieved
    by using integrated precision cum pressurized irrigation systems has been reported
    by many researchers who used satellite data for irrigation scheduling of various
    crops grown under varying field conditions [190,191]. 4.2.4. Use of UAV for Data
    Collection UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or “drones” are aircraft with no human
    pilots. The size of a UAV varies from small to large, depending upon the function
    that it can perform. UAVs are quick, affordable, and reliable alternatives to
    satellite data if the application area is small (local scale). Depending on the
    sensors carried by a UAV, various crop- and soil-based parameters for irrigation
    scheduling could be collected and monitored in real time at high spatial frequency.
    Various researchers used UAVs for the determination of crop water requirements
    [192], soil moisture [193], and plant water stress [194] for the implementation
    of precision irrigation, and satisfactory results were reported. 4.3. Techniques
    for Data Analysis and Management of Sprinkler Systems for Precision Irrigation
    The collected data were analyzed using several sophisticated techniques including
    modeling tools and multidimensional simulating software (DSSAT(v4.6), MATLAB(R2011b),
    APSIM (7.1), R(2.4.1.2) etc.) to predict spatially and temporally varied crop
    water requirements for developing irrigation maps for onward applications of precision
    irrigation. Mechanized techniques are essential in precision irrigation to manage
    sprinkler systems for efficient water applications using developed irrigation
    maps with less energy input and higher crop yield. The mechanized techniques belong
    to two big categories called open loop technique (OLT) and closed loop technique
    (CLT). In OLT, irrigation is controlled by a pre-set program designed for a particular
    field using input data regarding irrigation parameters [195]. The OLT is easier
    to follow and cheaper in cost; therefore, farmers prefer to adopt these techniques
    for implementing precision irrigation [196]. Farmers can set operating conditions
    (pre-timers, speed, and application rate) for any sprinkler system, which can
    be monitored during the entire operation of the irrigation machine. Many researchers
    reported the use of OLT by farmers for precision irrigation in their fields [197,198,199].
    The CLT is relatively difficult to implement but is more accurately related to
    the true spirit of precision irrigation using sprinkler irrigation systems with
    20–30% more efficiency [200,201,202]. Progressive farmers use such techniques
    at their farms. Many studies have been conducted on the applications, adoptability,
    and benefits of CLT techniques, and significantly positive responses to these
    techniques for crop production were reported [203,204]. The controlling mechanism
    of CLT includes a feedback input mechanism that continuously feeds the field conditions—retrieved
    from the sensors—to the input controller; then, the operation of irrigation machines
    is conducted in accordance with this information. The information may relate to
    climate, soil, or crop parameters [205,206]. Initially, a bigger irrigation program
    of variable nature is formulated that is implemented accordingly after retrieving
    information from the sensors at small time intervals [207,208]. However, continuous
    dynamics in field conditions make the control of irrigation extremely cumbersome
    under CLT. Also, due to the installation of sensors on irrigation machines and
    in soil profiles, the capital cost exceeds even unaffordable limits. Also, the
    use of sensors could mislead operators if they are not calibrated properly, which
    results in immense implementation struggles for farmers. The simplest illustration
    of precision irrigation using a center pivot sprinkler system under both controlling
    mechanisms (OLT and CLT) is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Block diagram of (a)
    open loop technique (OLT) and (b) closed loop technique (CLT) under precision
    irrigation. 4.4. Use of Controlling Devices for Precision Applications of Sprinkler
    Irrigation To perform water application using a sprinkler system according to
    real-time irrigation scheduling, mechanized systems are used to continuously control
    the operation of the irrigation system to adopt the true spirit of precision irrigation.
    The operation of the irrigation system is controlled to maintain the desired irrigation
    level by controlling the application rate or irrigation time [175]. To achieve
    this, electronic devices called “controllers” have been developed and are available
    in markets. The selection of controllers is made keeping in view their function,
    reliability, availability, price, etc. One type of controller is the PID (proportional-integrated
    derivative) controller. These controllers are widely used due to their simple
    structure, ease of troubleshooting, and minimum errors but these cannot handle
    external disturbance and can thus create errors [209]. The second type of controller
    is an AI (intelligent control for precision irrigation) controller. These controllers
    use the application of artificial intelligence, which makes these devices capable
    of providing solutions in a smarter way [210]. These devices with briskly developed
    algorithms can emulate the process of human decision making; therefore, these
    devices have been implemented specifically in sprinkler irrigation machines for
    precise water applications [211,212] in different forms like fuzzy logic, etc.
    [213]. On the other hand, these kinds of controllers have complex structures,
    are higher in price, and are difficult to troubleshoot. The third type of controller
    is the MPC (model predictive-based irrigation) controller, which is widely used
    in agriculture and other industries [214,215,216,217,218]. By installing MPC controllers
    instead of classical controllers on sprinkler irrigation machines, many benefits
    including good efficiency, excellent performance, and optimality can be achieved
    toward the true spirit of precision [219]. Future research on the development
    of smart MPC controllers can improve the efficiency of precision irrigation using
    sprinkler systems in a convenient way with 20–30% more efficiency. 4.5. Use of
    Precision Irrigation for Crop Production Precision irrigation has proved its impact
    in the field of irrigated agronomy. Many researchers worked on the qualitative
    and quantitative behavior of crops against precision irrigation. Abioye [159]
    used an MPC controller in sprinkler irrigation for precision applications and
    reported 30% water saving. The IoT-based precision irrigation system was used
    for water saving in tomato production and reported 10% water saving with 71% better
    uniformity and 27.5% higher yield [220]. Chen [221] recommended the fuzzy neural
    network with a genetic algorithm (GA) to accomplish precision irrigation for 15–25
    better yield and 25% water saving. The same technique was used by Guha [222] to
    calculate precise amounts of water with reference to greenhouse effects for a
    significant impact on crop productivity. Perea [223] used a combination of ANN
    and genetic algorithm (GA) for the prediction of evapotranspiration and crop response
    under water applications and reported 3–11% better results in terms of system
    efficiency for crop productivity. Ahmad [224] compared several studies on precision
    irrigation coupled with sprinkler irrigation and concluded that these technologies
    have a very positive influence on crop production and in the field of irrigated
    agronomy. 5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives This study consulted the major
    advances in sprinkler systems toward precision applications to save irrigation
    water and provide an increase in net crop production, maximum irrigation uniformity,
    and better fertilizer management with minimum leaching losses. A number of research
    articles from the literature were reviewed as per the designed methodology followed
    by the application of comprehensive inclusion/exclusion criteria to exclude unnecessary
    literature from the search results. Regarding the technological aspects of the
    analyzed works, it became evident that sprinkler systems are an efficient source
    to not only irrigate crops but also for fertilizer applications in the field with
    >35% efficiency and >14.1 productivity. This study also revealed the fact that
    the design of sprinkler irrigation needs to be optimized to avoid associated wind
    drift losses that are up to 14% of the total application efficiency. Moreover,
    this study covered prominent features of precision irrigation coupled with sprinkler
    irrigation technology. The data regarding precision irrigation revealed a dramatic
    improvement in productivity when automation and sensor-based monitoring were coupled
    with a control communication and information system to operate the sprinkler system
    to enhance the yield by 27.5% and save 30% more irrigation water. It is obvious
    that the cumulative literature and consolidation of results in one place will
    provide opportunities for students and researchers to develop new ideas for further
    interventions in the field of precision irrigation and improvements in the design
    of existing sprinkler systems. Future research should be continued on the smart
    design and evaluation of sprinkler nozzles with environmental impact assessments
    and simplified application mechanisms for precision irrigation systems. Research
    work on these lines will further support the adoption of modern irrigation techniques
    in large cultivable areas. Author Contributions Investigation, original drafting,

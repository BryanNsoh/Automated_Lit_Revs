  description: Climatic factors affect various stages of plant growth, thereby affecting
    agricultural productivity and production stability. The growth and development
    of various tissues and organs during the complete growth period of plants are
    affected by changes in climate and environment. The genotype is the internal cause
    for the expression of the phenotype, while the environment is the external conditions
    for the appearance of various morphological characteristics. With the rapid progress
    of high-throughput plant phenotype measurement technology, combined with genomics,
    bioinformatics, and big data computing, plant phenotyping will greatly promote
    the process of functional genomics research and crop molecular breeding and efficient
    cultivation. Phenotypes can effectively track the links between genotypes, environmental
    factors, and phenotypes. Without detailed phenotype data, it is difficult to fully
    understand the complex effects of genomic and environmental factors on plant phenotypes.
    Therefore, difficulties in plant scientific research are gradually shifting from
    genetic analysis to phenotypic analysis. Plant phenotyping began at the end of
    the 20th century, and its core was to obtain high-quality, reproducible trait
    data, and then quantify the interactions of genotype and environment and their
    impact on key traits related to yield, quality, and stress resistance. As more
    and more plant and trait parameters must be measured quickly and accurately, many
    of the world's top scientific research institutions have shifted their research
    focus to solving practical problems such as experimental design, quantitative
    analysis, and interpretation of conclusions. Characterizing key traits through
    phenotypic analysis can provide big data-based decision support for breeding,
    cultivation, and agricultural practices. Plant genomes have undergone rapid development
    in recent years, but the lack of sufficient phenotypic data has limited human
    ability to parse quantitative trait genetics. This can be addressed by developing
    a plant phenotypic information collection platform and performing image analysis.
    High-throughput, automated, high resolution plant phenotypic information collection
    platforms and analytical technologies are critical to the acceleration of plant
    improvement and breeding, increasing yield, and resistance to pests and diseases.
    These systems are used to analyze genomic information and quantitatively study
    complex traits related to growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress.
    It is an important pathway for integration, which can fulfill the gaps between
    genomic information and plant phenotypic plasticity. With the growth in the demands
    of scientific research and the development of imaging sensor technology, it has
    become possible to collect high-throughput, high-efficiency, high-precision, low-error,
    and low cost automatic phenotypic information. The data monitored by imaging sensors
    is objective and can monitor and analyze plants in real time. Therefore, automatic
    phenotype information collection technology has begun to be widely used in plant
    phenotype information collection platforms. With the development of modern and
    intelligent agricultural equipment, scholars hope to discover functionally diverse
    species and compare performance and plant response to the environment in a large
    number of plants. To generate a correlation between phenotypic traits, genes,
    environment, and expression, high-throughput plant phenotype information collection
    has been invented. High-throughput refers to the ability to measure more samples
    and/or more data points than manual phenotyping, not only with a high number of
    samples per unit time, but also with the synchronization and efficiency of data
    processing and parameter acquisition. The hardware platform scans the source data
    to match. High-throughput phenotyping relies on rapid transportation, automated
    sensing, data acquisition, data analysis methods and technical equipment, and
    is carried out by various sensors, such as CCD camera, near-infrared instrument,
    infrared instrument, thermal imager, spectral imager, fluorescence imager, etc.,
    to monitor indoor and field plants, so as to obtain more phenotypic parameters
    in a short time. Due to the huge potential of plant phenotype information collection
    technology in the agricultural field, scientific research institutions and enterprises
    in various countries are actively developing and constructing high-throughput
    plant phenotype information collection platforms. Phenotypic data collection and
    analysis methods are the core part of plant phenotyping research, including indoor
    and outdoor parts. Modern indoor high-throughput plant phenotype detection platforms
    generally detect plants closely related to plant genetics and variation through
    automated transmission equipment and integrated sensors (such as visible light,
    near-infrared, far-infrared, fluorescence, multispectral, laser, hyperspectral,
    etc.). The acquisition of a plant dynamic growth and developmental phenotype dataset.
    Its advantages are high resolution, high controllability and high-throughput,
    which can provide high-quality multidimensional images and experimental data for
    subsequent plant phenotyping. Whether it is aboveground or underground, indoor
    phenotype monitoring usually takes the individual plant as the unit and describes
    the population characteristics by collecting the characteristics of the individual
    plant. Depending on the image sensor accuracy, the extracted phenotypic data can
    often be accurate down to the tissue cell level. Thus, the scale division of indoor
    phenotypic traits can range from populations to histiocytes. Field-oriented plant
    phenotyping platforms provide accurate and continuous collection of single leaves
    or plant organs, single plants, small plots, and entire farms from proximal to
    long distances, mainly including vehicle-mounted, self-propelled, gantry, and
    suspension as well as several types such as drones, aerial remote sensing and
    spectral satellite imaging. The field high-throughput platform mainly includes
    two types of field machinery and UAVs equipped with multi-sensors, which can achieve
    rapid and non-destructive acquisition of plant population phenotype information
    under field conditions. The combination of agricultural machinery and equipment
    with a multi-sensor platform can effectively reduce the variation in measurement
    results but is limited by the distribution of crops and soil conditions after
    irrigation. Therefore, it is difficult to quickly realize cross-regional applications,
    the operation efficiency is low, and it cannot be used over a large range. However,
    the rapid analysis of field crop phenotype information based on an UAV-equipped
    multi-sensor platform has high technical efficiency and low cost and is suitable
    for complex farmland environments. It has a wide range of applications in the
    analysis of crop height, chlorophyll content, LAI, disease susceptibility, drought
    stress sensitivity, nitrogen content and yield, making it an important means to
    obtain crop phenotype information. Plant roots are an important part of plants
    and have very important functions such as water and nutrient absorption and transport,
    organic matter storage, plant anchoring, and interaction with soil. Since roots
    grow underground, the core of collecting root phenotypes is how to visualize roots
    growing under natural conditions. Therefore, the collection and analysis of root
    phenotypic traits has become the focus and challenge of biological and phenotypic
    research. At present, the research progress of cultivation and improvement based
    on root traits is very slow, and the screening of root traits is still a very
    time-consuming task. Researchers must continue to develop systematic and large-scale
    high-throughput root phenotyping platforms suitable for different cultivation
    goals, so as to accelerate the screening of root traits and the understanding
    of root function, and to gain an in-depth understanding of how root traits are
    related to whole plant stress resistance strategies correlate to increase crop
    productivity and ultimately successfully identify key root traits for crop improvement.
    In recent years, with the continuous development of remote sensing and related
    sensor technologies, a variety of non-destructive plant detection technologies
    have emerged, providing effective means for crop phenotype monitoring, disease
    and insect pest monitoring, and crop identification. RGB cameras are a relatively
    common sensor device in crop phenotyping technology. In the experiment, a digital
    camera with visible light imaging on a UAV can be used to improve the efficiency
    of data collection and achieve rapid acquisition of high-definition images. It
    can be used to monitor crop emergence during agricultural production, rate, flowering
    dynamics, canopy coverage, and lodging. Thermal imaging sensors use an infrared
    detector and an optical imaging lens to receive infrared radiation energy in a
    photosensitive element infrared detector. Infrared imaging technology is used
    to measure plant canopy temperature to infer plant water use efficiency and photosynthesis
    efficiency. It is also used to measure the response of crops to osmotic stress
    such as salinity or drought. It can also measure the impact of other abiotic stresses
    on organisms and detect the presence of pests in the grain. Because the crop canopy
    temperature changes with time, conventional handheld infrared temperature measurement
    equipment is limited by its low measurement efficiency, and it is difficult to
    be widely used in large-scale breeding areas. However, UAVs are equipped with
    thermal imagers for breeding areas, where canopy temperature provides a new efficient
    and reliable method. At present, thermal infrared technology is increasingly used
    in the field of precision agriculture. To ensure stable agricultural production,
    increased production and food security, optimized agricultural production structure,
    and a reduction in the use of pesticides and fertilizers, it is necessary to accurately
    monitor and warn the occurrence of diseases during agricultural production. Experts
    at home and abroad have carried out a series of thermal infrared imaging technology
    to detect crop disease research. The importance of data interpretation in phenotyping
    research cannot be overstated. With the continuous development of phenotyping
    platforms and related technologies at home and abroad, the current plant high-throughput
    phenotyping platform can obtain massive digital images, point cloud data, spectral
    imaging and thermal imaging data, and undergo geometric correction, radiometric
    correction, and data modeling. And a series of processing processes, and finally
    realize the use of remote sensing means to analyze plant phenotype information.
    High-throughput phenotyping is expected to become the latest tool for sustainable
    production under global climate change. However, at present, there are few plant
    species as the research objects of plant phenotype information, and there is a
    lack of analysis and identification of plant phenotype information in complex
    natural environments. The breadth and depth of plant phenotype analysis research
    must be continuously expanded to establish a unified plant phenotype monitoring
    system and specifications, form a network resource sharing library, and strengthen
    mutual cooperation among developers of various phenotype platforms. Using modern
    mathematical analysis methods, the rapidity and effectiveness of the algorithm
    can be achieved in image processing and recognition software design to improve
    the analysis ability of the analysis module of the plant phenotype monitoring
    system. It is necessary to use multi-domain knowledge to carry out comprehensive
    control and establish background expert decision-making support systems to automatically
    monitor and analyze target plants in real time.

  description: Soil moisture sensors can improve water management efficiency by measuring
    soil volumetric water content (θv) in real time. Soil-specific calibration equations
    used to calculate θv can increase sensor accuracy. A laboratory study was conducted
    to evaluate the performance of several commercial sensors and to establish soil-specific
    calibration equations for different soil types. We tested five Florida sandy soils
    used for citrus production (Pineda, Riviera, Astatula, Candler, and Immokalee)
    divided into two depths (0.0-0.3 and 0.3-0.6 m). Readings were taken using twelve
    commercial sensors (CS650, CS616, CS655 (Campbell Scientific), GS3, 10HS, 5TE,
    GS1 (Meter), TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI, TDR315, TDR315S, TDR135L (Acclima), and Hydra Probe
    (Stevens) connected to a datalogger (CR1000X; Campbell Scientific). Known amounts
    of water were added incrementally to obtain a broad range of θv. Small 450 cm3
    samples were taken to determine the gravimetric water content and calculate the
    θv used to obtain the soil-specific calibration equations. Results indicated that
    factory-supplied calibration equations performed well for some sensors in sandy
    soils, especially 5TE, TDR315L, and GS1 (R2 = 0.92) but not for others (10HS,
    GS3, and Hydra Probe). Soil-specific calibrations from this study resulted in
    accuracy expressed as root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.018 to 0.030
    m3 m-3 for 5TE, CS616, CS650, CS655, GS1, Hydra Probe, TDR310S, TDR315, TDR315L,
    and TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI, while lower accuracies were found for 10HS (0.129 m3 m-3)
    and GS3 (0.054 m3 m-3). This study provided soil-specific calibration equations
    to increase the accuracy of commercial soil moisture sensors to facilitate irrigation
    scheduling and water management in Florida sandy soils used for citrus production.

    TDR315, TDR315L, and TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI, while lower accuracies were found for 10HS
    (0.129 m3 m−3) and GS3 (0.054 m3 m−3). This study provided soil-specific calibration
    equations to increase the accuracy of commercial soil moisture sensors to facilitate
    irrigation scheduling and water management in Florida sandy soils used for citrus
    production. Keywords: bulk density; irrigation management; water loss reduction;
    volumetric water content 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is becoming increasingly
    important due to the rise in human population and food demand [1]. Different irrigation
    technologies can be deployed to improve the planning and management of water resources
    for agricultural production. The most used irrigation methods are surface, subsurface,
    sprinkler, and microirrigation. The use of each method depends on the crop, environmental
    conditions, and installation and maintenance costs. Surface irrigation entails
    water flowing by gravity over soil and includes furrow, basin, and border irrigation
    methods. Subsurface irrigation applies water below the soil surface to raise the
    water table into or near the plant root zone. Sprinkler irrigation applies water
    to the soil by spraying water through the air on to the soil surface. Finally,
    microirrigation applies water at low rates and pressures to small areas targeting
    the root zone through to use of drip emitters, bubblers, or microsprays [2]. Regardless
    of the irrigation system, the amount of water applied should always be precisely
    determined to reduce the potential of water losses through runoff and percolation
    and maximize crop yield. Despite the use of weather-based watering methods, most
    of the current irrigation scheduling follows rigid calendars using irrigation
    timers instead of accounting for the actual crop water requirements. Real-time,
    less expensive technologies are needed to increase the large-scale use of water
    scheduling tools. Recently, the use of soil-sensing methods has been increasing
    due to the profusion of sensors available in the market [3]. Soil moisture sensors
    (SMS) are a recent innovation with potential to estimate soil volumetric water
    content (θv) and electrical conductivity in real time [4,5,6]. Those sensors provide
    an accurate estimate of moisture content by measuring the dielectric constant
    of the soil or relative permittivity (ε) in response to water content, determined
    by the time in which an electromagnetic pulse travels in the soil [7,8]. The propagation
    of a wave through the soil varies according to its water content [9], which allows
    correlating the dielectric constant to the soil water content. The dielectric
    constant ranges from ∼1 in the air to 80 in the water [10,11]. Conversion or calibration
    equations provided by the manufacturers transform raw sensor measurements into
    the θv [12]. SMS allow real-time and continuous determination of soil moisture
    at different depths with minimum alteration of the natural soil conditions [13].
    However, the results of these methods are affected by site characteristics such
    as soil type and moisture, soil homogeneity, and the presence of stones and roots
    [14,15]. All sensor manufacturers have generic equations for mineral and organic
    soils. However, the performance of a given sensor can be increased by 2–3% when
    a soil-specific calibration is performed [4]. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate
    the performance of SMS in determining soil moisture based on site-specific calibration
    equations for agricultural fields with large spatial variability [16]. The use
    of SMS for irrigation scheduling is recent in citrus production in spite of the
    crop’s relevance to the country’s economy. The United States’ citrus production
    in the 2017–2018 season totaled 6.13 million tons. Florida is the second largest
    citrus producer in the country, accounting for 36% of the production area [17].
    Water is a limiting factor for Florida citrus growers due to the low water-holding
    capacity of sandy soils and the uneven distribution of rainfall during the year
    [18]. Even though generic equations are provided, manufacturers indicate that
    sensors are more accurate when soil-specific calibration equations are used [19].
    The information of θv for different Florida sandy soils used in citrus production
    is still scarce. Maximizing crop productivity in these areas requires irrigation
    systems to be designed to ensure uniform water application. Soil water content
    affects the amount of water and nutrients available to plants and soil aeration
    status [20]. Furthermore, determining how much and when to irrigate is a key element
    for irrigation management. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of data collected
    from commercial capacitance sensors and to establish calibration equations for
    different sandy soils used for citrus production in Florida. 2. Materials and
    Methods 2.1. Sensor Description Twelve commercial capacitance sensors from different
    manufacturers were evaluated under laboratory conditions (Figure 1 and Table 1).
    The sensors were connected to a datalogger (CR1000X; Campbell Scientific, Logan,
    UT) to provide power and collect data. The communication between the datalogger
    and the computer was obtained through a proprietary software (LoggerNet 4.5; Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT). Figure 1. Soil moisture sensors from different manufacturers
    used in this study. (Table 1 shows the manufacturer information.) Table 1. Information
    on the capacitance sensors tested in this study. Sensors use the physical, chemical
    and mechanical properties of the soil to take electrical, electromagnetic, optical,
    radiometric, mechanical, acoustic, pneumatic, or electrochemical measurements
    [21]. In the present study, electrical and electromagnetic measurements were assessed
    based on Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR), Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR),
    Transmission Line Oscillation (TLO), and Time Domain Transmissometry (TDT). TDR
    is an accurate and widely used method to estimate soil θv based on soil dielectric
    properties. According to Topp et al. [22], there is a close relationship between
    soil θv and the dielectric constant. The principle behind the TDR method is the
    determination of the velocity of propagation and return (or reflection) of an
    electromagnetic wave in a medium [13]. The presence of water in the soil decreases
    the speed at which the electromagnetic wave travels [23], which allows the measurement
    of soil water content. FDR is based on the resonance features of RLC (resistor,
    inductor, and capacitor) circuits in which a capacitor is formed by two electrodes
    and the in-between and surrounding soil [24]. The principle is based on the electrical
    capacitance of a capacitor that uses the soil as a dielectric pole that depends
    on the soil water content. When connecting the capacitor together with an oscillator
    to form an electrical circuit, changes in soil moisture can be detected by changes
    in the circuit operating frequency. In FDR the oscillator frequency is swept under
    control within a certain frequency range to find the resonant frequency (at which
    the amplitude is greatest), which is a measure of water content in the soil [25].
    TLO is used by some moisture sensors, which have two parallel rods that conform
    to an open transmission line. The two-way travel time of the electromagnetic waves
    induced by the oscillator in the rods varies according to the moisture content
    in the soil and translates into a change in the dielectric constant [26]. TDT
    is a technique analogous to TDR that measures the transmission of an electrical
    pulse along a closed circuit. The principle of this technique is based on the
    measurement of the time it takes from the application of the pulse at one end
    of the probe to the other end of another probe [27]. The main difference between
    TDR and TDT is that the latter measures the time of transmission and not reflection,
    as TDR does. 2.2. Study Sites The study was conducted from February to June 2018
    at the UF/IFAS IRREC in Fort Pierce, FL, using soils collected from multiple sites
    across the State of Florida (Figure 2). We tested five sandy soils [28] representing
    the most common soils for citrus production in Florida: (1) Pineda: Loamy, siliceous,
    active, hyperthermic Arenic Glossaqualfs (96.0% sand, 2.5% clay, and 1.5% silt);
    (2) Riviera: Loamy, siliceous, active, hyperthermic Arenic Glossaqualfs (96.5%
    sand, 2.0% clay, and 1.5% silt); (3) Candler: Hyperthermic, uncoated Lamellic
    Quartzipsamments (97.5% sand, 1.25% clay, and 1.25% silt); (4) Astatula: Hyperthermic,
    uncoated Typic Quartzipsamments (98.5% sand, 0.75% clay, and 0.75% silt); and
    (5) Immokalee: Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Arenic Alaquods (98.5% sand, 1.0%
    clay, and 0.5% silt). The particle size distribution reported was obtained from
    trials using the same soil type [29]. Figure 2. Location of the five sandy soils:
    Fort Pierce, FL - Pineda soil (1); Vero Beach, FL—Riviera soil (2); Fort Meade,
    FL—Candler soil (3); Lake Placid, FL - Astatula soil (4); and Immokalee, FL—Immokalee
    soil (5). Soils were sampled at two different depths (top and bottom layers at
    0.0–0.3 and 0.3–0.6 m, respectively). The content of organic matter and the water-holding
    capacity in these soils generally ranges from 0.5% to 2% and 25 to 83 mm m−1,
    respectively [28]. Pineda and Riviera soils are similar and characterized by poor
    drainage as they formed on unconsolidated marine sandy and loamy materials influenced
    by underlying alkaline material [28,29]. These nearly leveled soils are on low
    hammocks; in poorly defined drainage ways; and in broad, low, flat, and depressional
    areas. The water table is within a depth of 0.254 m of the surface for 1 to 6
    months and at a depth of 0.254 to 1.016 m for more than 6 months in most years.
    The slope ranges from 0% to 2% [38,39]. Many areas that correspond to Pineda and
    Riviera soils have been drained and are currently used for citrus production.
    In their original state, these soils are used for pasture, and natural vegetation
    consists of species of pine (Pinus sp.), cypress (Cupressus sempervirens), myrtle
    (Myrtus communis) and palm (Areca sp.). Candler and Astatula soils share certain
    similarities since both are excessively drained soils formed in sandy marine or
    eolian deposits. These soils are on broad undulating upland ridges and knolls
    on flatwoods. Slopes range from 0% to 8%. These soils are hyperthermic, uncoated
    Typic Quartzipsamments. Typical pedon of Candler sand has 0–5% slopes, whereas
    the typical pedon of Astatula sand is 0–8% [40,41]. These soils are used mainly
    for citrus and pastures. Immokalee soils are characterized by nearly level, poorly
    drained soils on the flatwoods. These soils formed in sandy marine sediments.
    The slopes of these soils are less than 2%. These soils are sandy, siliceous,
    hyperthermic Arenic Haplaquods [42]. In natural conditions, these soils are used
    for wildlife conservation and forestry but with appropriate management, can be
    used for citrus, vegetables and grasses production. 2.3. Soil Sampling and Physical
    Characterization Samples were collected from each soil type in two depths: top
    (0.0–0.3 m) and bottom layer (0.3–0.6 m). These depths were selected based on
    the fact that irrigation systems have a capacity to reach a moisture dispersion
    of 60% of the total citrus rooting area (approximately 0.9 m) [18]. Furthermore,
    the highest concentration of roots is located within this depth and there is a
    greater dynamic of water absorption. Sampling began by removing debris from the
    surface with a hoe to eliminate all nondecomposed organic material. Subsequently,
    the soil was manually collected and deposited in 378 L plastic barrels. The soil
    samples were completely dried in a forced circulation oven at 75 °C for 10 days.
    Samples were divided to obtain three replicates. Each replication was placed into
    19 L polyethylene buckets for data collection. Analysis of the soil physical properties
    was performed at the beginning of the study. The specific gravity of solid particles
    and the bulk density were determined according to the procedure described by the
    American Society for Testing and Materials [43] (Table 2). The determination of
    bulk density was done in order to further transform the data obtained from the
    gravimetric method into θv. Table 2. Physical properties of soils tested. 2.4.
    Experimental Setup Before starting to take sensor measurements, we calculated
    the amount of water to be added incrementally to obtain a broad range of θv values
    (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%) until reaching the saturation point at the buckets
    using volumetric (θv) and gravimetric water content (θg), according to the Equations
    (1) and (2) proposed by Schmugge et al. [44]. Thus, a gradual increase of 5% moisture
    in the soil to amounts of 0.16 m3 m−3 was established. The mixing of the given
    water volume was achieved by pouring the three replicates of each soil sample
    into a larger container, thoroughly mixing them, and then depositing them back
    into the 19-L polyethylene buckets. This was repeated five times for each soil
    sample, taking a reading with each sensor. The moisture percentages were used
    to obtain the relationship between soil moisture and sensor measurements. Each
    sensor was inserted vertically (i.e., the sensor head in air and rods fully submersed)
    into the soils in the center of all buckets with minimal disturbance to the surrounding
    soil while inserting the rods. 𝜃 𝑣 = ( 𝜃 𝑔 ) ( ρ soil ) (ρ water ) (1) 𝜃 𝑔 = m
    soil m dry soil  × 100% (2) where 𝜃𝑣 is the volumetric water content, 𝜃𝑔 is the
    gravimetric water content, m is the mass, and ρ is the density. Substituting Equation
    (2) into Equation (1), we calculated the water volume (Wv) as: m water = 𝜃 𝑣 100%
    × ( ρ water )× m soil ρ dry soil (3) 𝑊𝑣= m water ρ water (4) The θg was obtained
    from each soil using the method described by Topp and Ferre [45]. Briefly, soil
    samples were collected, weighed, dried in a forced circulation oven, and weighed
    again, which enabled expressing water content on a mass basis. Additionally, 450
    cm3 aluminum cylinders were weighed with soil samples. Subsequently, cylinders
    were oven-dried at 75 °C for 48 h, and final weight was recorded. Equations (5)
    and (6) established by Schmugge et al. [44] were used for θg and θv, respectively.
    Reference θv (θref, m3 m−3) was calculated by multiplying θg by soil bulk density
    [46]. 𝜃 𝑔 = ( m wet soil )− (m dry soil  ) m dry soil (5) 𝜃 𝑣  = ( 𝜃 g ) ( ρ soil
    ) (6) 2.5. Data Analysis Accuracy and precision were used as proxies to assess
    sensor performance. Accuracy is the ability of a sensor to estimate the actual
    water content, while precision is an indication of the uniformity or repeatability
    of obtaining the same result [16]. A good sensor should have high accuracy and
    high precision. For sensor accuracy, we used the root mean square error (RMSE)
    and the coefficient of determination (R2) to verify the quality of fit. Briefly,
    RMSE is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors), and the R2
    is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable
    from the independent variables. For sensor precision, we used the coefficient
    of variation (CV) to evaluate the repeatability to obtain the same results from
    the sensor in comparison to the gravimetric method. The CV is expressed as the
    standard deviation by the mean value. The RMSE, R2, and CV for each sensor were
    computed across the three replications by soil series, soil depths, and amount
    of water added per sample. To evaluate the performance of the selected sensors,
    θv readings were compared to θref values. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient
    (r) was calculated between the θv obtained by the sensors with the standard equations
    (Table 1) and that observed by gravimetry (θref). Finally, a regression analysis
    was performed to obtain the calibration for the 12 capacitance sensors using the
    data collected for each soil type and soil depth. The equations were estimated
    using the curve-fitting tool [47]. The statistical analyses were performed using
    SAS v. 9.4 [48]. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Sensor Accuracy The θv values
    measured by the sensors were compared to the results obtained from gravimetric
    determination in the laboratory. The comparison among different sensors is presented
    in Table 3. In general, sensors measured θv accurately, and several sensors presented
    an R2 > 0.90 (TDR315S, TDR315L, GS1, 5-ET, TDR315, TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI, and CS655).
    However, some sensors (10HS, GS3, and Hydra Probe) were not effective in determining
    θv, resulting in low R2 and high CV (Table 3). Table 3. Comparative analysis of
    θv by sensors and the gravimetric method, where: RMSE = Root mean square error,
    R2 = coefficient of determination, and CV = coefficient of variation for each
    sensor evaluated. The RMSE, R2, and CV for each sensor were computed across the
    three replications by soil series, soil depths, and amount of water added per
    sample (n = 540). In our study, the sensors that presented the lowest RMSE are
    based on the TDR measurement method (Table 3). In addition, all sensors from Acclima
    had an R2 ≥ 0.90. Out of these, only the TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI sensor uses a different
    measurement method, which is TDT. Varble and Chávez [49] indicate the performance
    of TDT and TDR sensors is similar in soils with different textures since these
    methods operate on similar electromagnetic frequencies. The RMSE is a sensible
    indicator of sensor accuracy [50]. A small RMSE value indicates higher accuracy.
    Categories for interpreting RMSE values are described by Fares et al. [16]. These
    categories include good (RMSE ≤ 0.01 m3 m−3), fair (0.01 ≤ RMSE ≤ 0.05 m3 m−3),
    poor (0.05 ≤ RMSE ≤ 0.10 m3 m−3), and very poor (RMSE ≥ 0.10 m3 m−3). The sensors
    evaluated in this study had RMSE values ranging from 0.023 to 0.049 m3 m−3 (Table
    3). The data obtained are similar to those of Singh et al. [51], where the sensors
    resulted in RMSE values between 0.02 m3 m−3 and 0.04 m3 m−3. The authors observed
    that sensors CS655 and TDR315 were the most accurate, with RMSE < 0.02 m3 m−3
    in a low clay content soil. This value is lower than what we found for these sensors
    (CS650 = 0.035 m3 m−3 and TDR315 = 0.028 m3 m−3) in sandy Florida soils. Since
    TDR310S, TDR315L, and TDR315 are recently released models, limited research is
    available to evaluate sensor performance. However, the accuracy established by
    the manufacturer is ± 0.02 m3 m−3 for the θv determination [36], which approximates
    the data obtained in the present study that indicate an RMSE of 0.023 m3 m−3 for
    TDR310S, 0.026 m3 m−3 for the TDR315L, and 0.028 m3 m−3 for the TDR315L sensor
    (Table 3). The GS1 sensor also had low RMSE (0.026 m3 m−3) (Table 3). This value
    was smaller than the RMSE value of 0.048 reported by Datta et al. [6] for the
    GS1 in a fine sandy loam soil. These authors reported that TDR315, CS655, and
    GS1 sensors performed better in a soil with lower salinity and lower clay content.
    Adeyemi et al. [52] reported an RMSE of 0.03 m3 m−3 for both GS1 and TDR315 sensors.
    Those results were obtained by evaluating sensor performance in a sandy soil with
    similar characteristics to the ones evaluated in the present study. Our results
    indicated that the TDR315, CS655, and 5TE sensors performed well in sandy soils
    with the generic equation presenting a lower mean square error (Table 3). Varble
    and Chávez [49] tested the 5TE sensor and concluded that the sensor’s generic
    equation is not accurate in sandy loam soils. More recently, a study regarding
    the 5TE, TDR315, and CS655 sensors showed RMSEs of 0.039, 0.050, and 0.078 m3
    m−3, respectively in loam soils, overestimating the θv present in the samples
    [53]. Sensors CS650, CS616, Hydra Probe, 10HS, and GS3 had higher CVs, with R2
    values ranging from 0.72 to 0.86 (Table 3). Vaz et al. [4] evaluated the Hydra
    Probe, 10HS, and CS616 sensors in a soil composed of 92.7% sand, which is similar
    to the soils evaluated in the present study. The RMSE obtained by these authors
    was 0.058 m3 m−3 for CS616, 0.018 m3 m−3 for Hydra Probe, and 0.077 m3 m−3 for
    10HS. In the present study, we obtained a higher RMSE (0.037 m3 m−3) for Hydra
    Probe. Nevertheless, the CS616 and 10HS sensors presented lower values than those
    presented by Vaz et al. [4], which indicates that the generic equation is better
    for the soils evaluated in this study due to the soil texture. Similarly, in research
    conducted by Singh et al. [53], the CS616 and Hydra Probe sensors provided higher
    results with respect to RMSE determined. The CS616 sensor was also evaluated by
    Varble and Chávez [49], resulting in an overestimation of the volumetric water
    content in 0.03 m3 m−3 for a sandy loam soil. Furthermore, the results indicated
    that greater accuracy was obtained for sensor CS616 in sandy clay loam soils at
    lower θv and not at high θv. The GS3 sensor presented an RMSE of 0.049 m3 m−3,
    which differs from the manufacturer’s accuracy of ± 0.03 m3 m−3 in mineral soils
    [32]. This value falls into the fair accuracy category as defined by Fares et
    al. [16]. These results suggest that GS3 sensor is highly sensitive to soil property
    variability (e.g., soil bulk density, total porosity, particle size distribution,
    pore size, electrical conductivity, etc.) with a significant impact on sensor
    performance. Similar results with a high RMSE (0.038 m3 m−3) were determined by
    Straten et al. [54] in sandy soils with an organic fraction of 2%. Son et al.
    [55] tested the GS3 sensor and found an overestimation of θv with an RMSE of 0.028
    m3 m−3, indicating that the manufacturer’s generic equation is more appropriate
    for silt loam soils than sandy soils. A positive correlation was observed between
    θv (measured by sensors) and θref values (determined by gravimetry) (Figure 3,
    Figure 4 and Figure 5). That means the sensor measurements are correlated with
    the gravimetric determinations. When comparing the regression graph with the 1:1
    reference line, values on the upper half indicate θv overestimation, while values
    in the lower half indicate θv underestimation. Sensors 10HS, GS1, and GS3 had
    the lowest correlation coefficient (r = 0.8990, r = 0.9212, and r = 0.8394, respectively;
    Figure 3a–c), and outlier data points may have been caused by the generation of
    nonuniform readings from these sensors. This was more evident for sensors 10HS
    and GS3, which showed poor accuracy, low R2, and high CV (Table 3). However, the
    other sensors showed a high positive correlation between θv and θref (r > 0.90).

    and the dashed line is the 1:1 reference. Each point represents a single data

    and determined by gravimetry (θref) for the Acclima sensors TDR315 (a), TDR310S

    correlation, and the dashed line is the 1:1 reference. Each point represents a
    single data value taken from each of the three replications by soil series, soil
    depths, amount of water added, and evaluated sensors (n = 540). The sensors 10HS,
    GS1, GS3 (Figure 3a–c), CS650 (Figure 4b), TDR310S, TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI, and TDR315L
    (Figure 5b–d) overestimated θv as most of the points were above the 1:1 reference
    line. Many researchers have also reported overestimation of θv by the CS655 sensor
    [56,57,58]. Similar results from Datta et al. [6] showed that all sensors (TDR315,
    CS655, and GS1) overestimated θv in a low clay content soil located in central
    Oklahoma. Adeyemi et al. [52] found that TDR315 and GS1 underestimated θv in sandy
    loam soil. Singh et al. [51] reported that sensors TDR315 and CS655 resulted in
    θv similar to reference θ in a sandy soil (RMSE < 0.02 m3 m−3), but the discrepancy
    was larger for the clayey soils. An increase in clay content tended to cause TDR315
    to underestimate θv and CS655 to overestimate θv [51]. The CS616 and Hydra Probe
    sensors underestimated θv in sandy soils (Figure 4c,d). In contrast, Evett et
    al. [59] found that CS616 overestimated θv and Hydra Probe overestimated εa compared
    to TDR (slope = 1.437, R2 = 0.966, RMSE = 1.08) more than Acclima, which was highly
    corrected with TDR-derived εa (slope = 1.108, R2 = 0.996, RMSE = 0.256). In our
    study, the sensors 5TE, CS655, and TDR315 were very precise in determining θv
    (R2 ≥ 0.9604; Figure 3d, Figure 4a and Figure 5a). 3.2. Soil-Specific Calibration
    Equations We generated calibration equations for several sandy soils representing
    the most common types used for citrus production in Florida (Figure 6; Figure
    7). The sensor readings were taken over increasing θv values, successfully establishing
    soil-specific calibration equations for all the sensors, in all the soils sampled,
    and at the two depths tested. Sensors with output in voltage, period, and dielectric
    permittivity followed similar trends for all soil types and soil depths. The slopes
    on all soils differed for each sensor, evidencing that soil-specific calibration
    equations are required to improve sensor accuracy based on the soil used. That
    outcome is expected since several SMS have been evaluated, and most of the studies
    concluded that the sensor accuracy can be considerably increased by using soil-
    or site-specific equations determined in the laboratory and field instead of using

    TDR315L (h), GS3 (i), CS650 (j), TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI (k), and TDR310S (l). Each data
    point is the average of the three samples of the soils taken from each of the
    three replications by soil series (n = 9). In this study, the equations were established
    according to the different factors, including sensor, soil type, and soil depth.
    The linear, quadratic, or higher-order independent terms of each equation were
    determined through regression analysis, having the electric permittivity, voltage,
    or period as the independent variable and the θv determined by gravimetry as the
    dependent variable. The sensors’ readings were taken at incrementally θv, obtaining
    a range of values that allowed the determination of a soil-specific equation for
    each soil and depth. As a result, the soil-specific calibration equation in both
    depths presented an R2 ranging from 0.83 to 0.99 for Pineda soil (Table 4), from
    0.81 to 0.99 for Riviera soil (Table 5), from 0.81 to 0.99 for Candler soil (Table
    6), from 0.46 to 0.99 for Astatula soil (Table 7), and from 0.79 to 0.99 for Immokalee
    soil (Table 8). Table 4. Soil-specific calibration equations for commercial soil

    equations for commercial soil moisture sensors in the Immokalee soil series. Based
    on the determination of the soil-specific calibration equations, new values of
    RMSE were calculated. Except in the cases of 10HS (0.129 m3 m−3) and GS3 (0.054
    m3 m−3), all sensors had a lower RMSE value than that presented by the manufacturer’s
    standard equation (5TE = 0.018; CS616 = 0.025; CS650 = 0.024; CS655 = 0.020; GS1
    = 0.030; Hydra Probe = 0.024; TDR310S = 0.019; TDR315 = 0.022; TDR315L = 0.019;
    and TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI = 0.022 m3 m−3). The factors that influenced the increase
    in the RMSE for the 10HS and GS3 sensors are still unknown. However, it is important
    to note that these sensors presented the highest CV in comparison to the other
    sensors tested (Table 3). Hignett and Evett [63] indicated that for efficient
    irrigation management based on the determination of soil water content, the RMSE
    of the water content estimation should be between 0.01 and 0.02 m3 m−3. Thus,
    according to the RMSE presented in Table 3, none of the sensors evaluated would
    have the accuracy required for the determination of water content using the manufacturer’s
    generic equation. Therefore, to reduce the coefficients of variation as much as
    possible and to find the lowest RMSE, soil-specific calibration equations should
    be used to improve sensor accuracy. Our results indicate that the use of a soil-specific
    equation had a notable impact on improving the accuracy of θv determination in
    sandy Florida soils. Vaz et al. [4] also compared the performance of the manufacturer’s
    generic calibration equations for different sensors (CS616, Hydra Probe, 5TE,
    and 10HS) with soil-specific equations developed in seven texturally varying soils.
    Those authors also demonstrated that soil-specific calibrations improve measurement
    accuracy to values ranging from 0.02 to 0.03 m3 m−3. That improvement is imperative
    for sandy soils like the ones used for citrus production in Florida since the
    water-holding capacity is reduced by the large pores present in sandy soils with
    more than 96–97% sand. Fares et al. [16] also concluded the soil-specific calibration
    equations can mitigate the effects of varying soil properties and improve sensor
    accuracy for water content measurements. Results from field tests in sandy clay
    loam and loamy sand soils indicated that a linear calibration for the TDT, CS616,
    and 5TE sensors can reduce the errors of the factory calibration of θv to less
    than 0.02 ± 0.035 m3 m−3 [49]. Previous studies also have noted that RMSE in θv
    was smaller when using site-specific calibrations in comparison to generic calibrations
    [5,64,65]. Singh et al. [53] reported that soil-specific calibrations led to substantial
    improvement in θv accuracy beyond factory calibration. RMSE of CS616 exceeded
    0.10 m3 m−3 at both depths when using generic calibration and dropped below 0.02
    m3 m−3 for depth-specific and combined data when using soil-specific calibration.
    The authors noticed that the RMSE of the evaluated sensors (5TE, EC5, Hydra Probe2,
    CS616, CS655, and TDR 315) installed at depths of 0.15 and 0.76 m were below 0.015
    m3 m−3 using soil-specific regression calibration sand and below 0.020 m3 m−3
    as determined by combining all regression calibrations. 4. Conclusions The sensors
    that performed best in estimating θv using the manufacturer’s generic equation
    for the evaluated soils were TDR310S, TDR315L, GS1, and 5TE. These sensors presented
    the greatest adjustments to the model and lowest RMSE. Conversely, the low CV
    for GS3, 10HS, and Hydra Prove sensors indicated the low accuracy of the standard
    equation for the θv determination in sandy soils. The estimated calibration equations
    can replace the manufacturer’s generic equations as they provide more accurate
    data on the soil’s real-time moisture content according to the sensor, soil type,
    and depth chosen. Unsatisfactory results were found for soil-specific calibrations
    performed on two of the sensors tested (10HS and GS3). A significant improvement
    was obtained in estimating θv with respect to the generic equation for the other
    sensors. This improvement allows researchers and end users to obtain real soil
    moisture content data in the soils tested, permitting, for example, more efficient
    irrigation control and water savings by optimizing the water use. For the evaluated
    Florida sandy soils, the calibration equations can be applied with an accuracy
    ranging from 0.018 to 0.030 m3 m−3. Sensors 5TE, TDR310S, and TDR315L had a better
    overall performance in soil moisture estimation. These equations can be used under
    field conditions. However, we still recommend evaluating the sensors by considering
    the specific environmental conditions of each site, since they influence sensor
    performance. Finally, further research should be carried out to test other commercial
    sensors, in other soil types, and with different organic matter contents. Author
